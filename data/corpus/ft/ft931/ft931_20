Variable-rate investments

SAVERS ARE becoming accustomed to facing an annus horribilis every year.
Base rates had fallen from a peak of 15 per cent in 1990 to 6 per cent at
the end of January this year.
Those who are dependent on banks and building society savings for their
income have therefore seen their income drop by as much as 60 per cent since
interest rates were at their peak.
For example, Halifax's 90-day Xtra account paid 14.65 per cent gross
(adjusted for composite rate tax)in March 1990 on Pounds 25,000. The gross
rate in February on the same amount, before reductions in reaction to that
month's base rate fall, was 5.5 per cent.
Although inflation has been falling during this period, price rises have
continued and savers have therefore seen a significant drop in their
disposable income.
There is little, unfortunately, that savers can do about falling base rates,
but they can try to protect themselves against unnecessary losses.
The first thing to do is make sure that the account they are in has not been
made obsolete. One of the more objectionable practices of banks and building
societies is to launch a new investment account, while reducing rates
significantly on the account it has replaced. Customers are not individually
informed and do not realise the fate of their account.
Complaints about this practice to the Building Societies' Ombudsmen
increased sixfold during 1991-92, accounting for over 13 per cent of total
complaints.
Many were in connection with the launch of Nationwide Anglia's Bright
Horizons investment range in late 1990. While noting 'widespread
dissatisfaction' with this practice, the ombudsmen said that the onus was on
investors to be 'vigilant' about their savings, while building societies
should make information about new accounts accessible.
Since the ombudsmen have not made it incumbent upon building societies to
inform customers individually once their account has become obsolete, they
will have to do the work themselves. Phoning or going into a branch at
regular intervals, as well as checking press notices, is the only way of
keeping informed. The elderly should ask relatives to keep an eye out for
them.
Rates offered on other accounts as well as by competitors should also be
checked. Increasing competition in the savings market has challenged
ordinary assumptions. For example, there was a time when 90-day accounts
offered the highest rates, but a recent analysis of 90-day and
instant-access accounts in the FT showed that, in most cases, the 90-day
rate was beaten by a postal account. Access to funds in a postal account is
between one to two weeks - much shorter than the three-month notice period
required by 90-day accounts.
It is hard to see any reason not to have a Tessa (Tax-exempt special savings
account). These pay tax-free interest if held for five years, but all that
happens if money is withdrawn during that period is that tax is paid. Given
that Tessa rates are often higher than those of conventional building
society accounts, this makes them highly attractive.
Offshore accounts are another option. Although UK residents must declare
their income for tax purposes, wherever it is held, instant-access offshore
building society rates tend to be a little higher than the rates paid
onshore. Moreover, it is possible to delay paying tax.
Unless the saver is registered as a non-taxpayer, basic-rate tax is deducted
at source when the interest is credited on building society accounts held
onshore. But offshore accounts pay interest gross which then has to be
declared and, in the process, payment of the tax will be delayed.
For example, if interest is credited at the beginning of the tax year
1993-94, it does not have to be declared until at least one year later, with
final payment of the tax delayed by another few months.
With rates as low as they are today, savers should be particularly wary of
being lured by 'too good to be true' high-interest promises. Higher rates do
not always mean higher risk, but they often do.
If the worst should happen and a bank or building society collapses,
compensation is available for savers but it is very limited. The Deposit
Protection Scheme for banks will cover 75 per cent of the first Pounds
20,000, in other words, a maximum of Pounds 15,000. The protection scheme
for building societies will guarantee to repay 90 per cent of the first
Pounds 20,000.
Investors should also be wary of accounts that offer above-average rates to
attract investors, only to drop them sharply a few months later. Inertia
means that many people fail to spot the change and switch.

it on - Trusts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IF ALICE gives Bob money to invest for Claire in such a way that Bob,
thereafter, owns that money, not for himself, but for Claire the legal
relationship between Alice, Bob and Claire is that of a trust. Alice is the
settlor, Bob the trustee and Claire the beneficiary.
A change of ownership from Alice to Bob is essential to create a trust. This
is what makes a trust different from any other legal arrangement, and also
the reason why, unless specified to the contrary, the settlor has no further
rights over or entitlement to the trust assets after the trust has been
created.
This does not mean that the trustees can do with the trust assets what they
choose. If a trustee in any way benefits from the trust assets, unless
specified by the settlor at the time of creating the trust, or deals
recklessly with the trust assets, he can be sued by the beneficiary.
The settlor's instructions to his or her trustees are usually contained in a
Trust Deed, which should be carefully drafted by a lawyer, so as to reflect
the settlor's wishes accurately.
The unique legal relationship of a trust is of great importance in commerce.
Trusts are widely used, for example, in pension schemes, share employment
schemes, investment transactions and joint ventures.
Trusts have also traditionally been used to provide for the weak and needy,
and for those beneficiaries such as widows, charities, infant children and
future generations, so that capital is protected and preserved in the safe
hands of the trustees (one of whom could also be the settlor).
Not surprisingly, the unique legal relationship of the trust means that it
must be taxed differently, from either an individual or a company. Trustees
cannot be taxed on trust income and trust capital as if it were their own
personal income or capital to enjoy; neither can the funds simply be added
to the beneficiary's income or personal capital, because a beneficiary has
no control over these funds and in many cases does not receive any money
until much later, if at all.
Trusts are taxed according to the type of trust and the relationship between
the settlor and the beneficiary. They are categorised, depending on what the
trustees do with the income of the trust fund. If the trustees must pay all
the income of the trust to a particular beneficiary - the 'life tenant' -
the trust is an 'Interest in Possession' trust. All other trusts are
'Discretionary' trusts, because the trustees either have discretion as to
which beneficiary should receive the income or how much the beneficiary
should get, leaving the trustees free to accumulate what remains of the
income with the existing capital of the trust fund.
One important sub-class of the Discretionary trust is the 'Accumulation and
Maintenance' trust for children under the age of 25. Provided the conditions
set out in inheritance tax legislation are met, the penal inheritance tax
provisions imposed on Discretionary trusts can then be avoided.
Because trusts are taxed in a different, often more advantageous way, from
either individuals or companies, they are often used as part of a family tax
mitigation scheme. The table sets out the tax effects of the various
settlements.
The most tax-effective trust is one set up by a 'Non-UK domiciled' settlor
for a UK resident beneficiary with trustees resident in a tax haven. This
trust can effectively avoid UK income tax, capital gains tax and inheritance
tax if carefully structured and managed.
If a trust is to be used as part of a tax mitigation exercise, it must be
remembered that a trust cannot always be changed at a later date, if the tax
regime changes or the settlor decides that he or she needs the money
personally. A trust should therefore be treated with respect and should not
be entered into lightly.

FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (20): Choose the place, then the
route - School fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT EDUCATION has a reputation for being elitist. High fees, which
are increasing ahead of the rate of inflation, could make this even worse.
Meanwhile, falling interest rates have forced parents to take a slightly
higher level of risk if they want to plan ahead.
But forward-planning can still bring independent education within the range
of many families who feel that will give their children an advantage.
School fees can become an even bigger financial commitment than a house
purchase, which justifies making a special, ear-marked plan. But financial
considerations should not be allowed to dictate the choice of school - one
of the most important decisions a family ever makes. If you want to send
your child to a big city single-sex day school - and FT surveys continually
suggest that these provide the best value for money - you will have less of
a problem meeting fees than you would with a famous boarding school.
Once you have chosen a school, or produced a short list, contact bursars to
find out what the current fees are and for an estimate of what they could be
in future. Remember that you are aiming for a fixed commitment at a set
time, and that securing more than the fees would be There is no point in
saving more than you need.
While you will probably need a disciplined plan to reach the target, it does
not follow either that financial providers should impose extra discipline on
you through punitive and inflexible charges, or that all your money should
be put into one investment. Pre-packaged 'school fees plans' do not
necessarily offer decent value for money.
Your tax position is also of crucial importance in deciding which schemes
make most sense - for example, if one partner is a non-taxpayer, they should
use up their income tax allowance in a deposit account before trying
anything more technical.
Once these principles are in place, there are three routes to paying school
fees, which will depend on your capital resources, and on the length of time
before your child starts at school:
From capital. Those able to pay fees with a lump sum have a broad range of
opportunities.
The classic solution is the educational trust. Funds in an educational trust
can be invested tax-free, provided they are used to pay school fees - no
specific school or pupil need be named. Life offices offer these trusts,
accepting a fixed lump sum and then guaranteeing a certain level of fees
through a series of annuities commencing at a certain point. But this can be
expensive, as the guarantees are costly to fund - particularly now that gilt
yields have come down.
Thus advisers suggest they should only be used for part of fees, and should
be restricted to 40 per cent taxpayers who have used up both their personal
income tax allowances and their annual CGT allowance.
Products ahead of them in the queue include personal equity plans, Tessas
(tax-exempt special savings accounts) and zero-dividend shares of investment
trusts, which offer a fixed return taxed as capital gains (useful for those
who do not pay capital gains tax).
Those certain of the school their child will attend might ask about
'composition schemes' where you pay a lump sum in advance, at a level which
usually saves you money compared with paying fees as they arise. Such
schemes are not transferable, which is the big disadvantage.
From income. This is the way most people have to do it, and the traditional
recommended method is the with-profits endowment. But the 'sum assured' will
never be enough to pay school fees on its own.
Other vehicles include Pep savings schemes, which are more flexible and
tax-efficient, and a range of cash-based schemes, such as Tessas and
National Savings. Of the latter, Children's Bonus Bonds have been designed
specifically for saving on behalf of children.
You could also buy a friendly society bond on behalf of your child - this is
inflexible, but savings of Pounds 18 per month can be kept in a totally
tax-free environment for the child, provided you keep paying in the money
for 10 years.
Equity-based products make more sense if there is still a long time to go
before the child starts school. Cash-backed investments should take a larger
share of the portfolio if the first day at school is nearer.
From a Loan. This is only to be recommended if the start of the child's
independent education is imminent, and there is no other way of paying for
it.
Probably the best loan scheme available is offered by Isis (the Independent
Schools' Information Service) in conjunction with advisers Claremont Savile
and the Halifax building society. This allows you to draw down the loan as
and when you need it to pay fees, so you do not need to take all the debt up
front as with a mortgage. Halifax has made no stipulations about how you
repay the loan, so you can save towards it using any investment vehicle you
like.

FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (19): You'll need to top up NI
benefits - Retirement Planning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS FACE a bewildering array of different pension products, and before
entering the maze it is worth going back to basics to familiarise yourself
with the three main sources: occupational schemes, private individual plans
and the state.
Most people end up with a combination of at least two, and usually all
three, elements, so it is important that you and your pensions adviser take
each into consideration before planning ahead.
The state scheme provides the 'old age' flat-rate pension and an
earnings-related pension, both of which are based on an individual's
National Insurance contribution record. NI is paid at 9 per cent by most
employees. For the 1993-94 tax year, the lower and upper thresholds are
Pounds 56 and Pounds 420 a week.
The old-age pension is a maximum of Pounds 56.10 a week for the 1993-94 tax
year, while the earnings-related pension (Serps) will be a maximum of
between 20 and 25 per cent of middle-band earnings, depending on your NI
record and when you retire. Middle-band earnings are those earnings that
fall between the lower and upper NI thresholds. Employees who are not in a
'contracted out' company scheme or personal pension plan will automatically
be in Serps.
Clearly, even with a full NI record, the combination of state pensions is
not going to keep you in clover. For this reason most people make extra
provision, either through a company pension or through personal pensions and
other similar plans.
Company schemes and private individual plans approved by the Inland Revenue
are extremely tax-efficient. Contributions are paid free of basic and
higher-rate tax, the pension fund builds up tax-free, and a significant
chunk of the accumulated fund can be taken as tax-free cash at retirement.
The pension itself is taxed as income.
A good company pension scheme will also provide widow's and dependants'
pensions, death-in-service benefits of up to four times the member's salary,
long-term disability pensions and, increasingly, membership of the group
private medical scheme.
Occupational schemes in the UK cover about 50 per cent of employees,
representing over 11m people. Massive funds, in total estimated at Pounds
300bn, support these arrangements which are set up predominantly on a
final-salary basis, although a growing number of schemes are moving to
money-purchase.
Under a final-salary, or 'defined benefit' scheme, the pension is linked to
the value of the employee's salary at retirement. Employees usually
contribute 5 to 6 per cent of salary, while most employers at least match
this rate and often pay considerably more for older members.
Typically, the pension builds up at the rate of 1/60th of final salary for
each year of service, up to a Revenue maximum of 40/60ths, or two-thirds of
final salary after 40 years' service. Where tax-free cash is taken, the
pension is reduced. (Public sector schemes tend to build up on an '80ths'
basis, but add the tax-free cash on top of the pension, which makes them
roughly equivalent to the '60ths' schemes.)
Certain high earners will find their contributions and final pension
restricted by the 'earnings cap'. The cap, which represents the maximum
salary that can be taken into consideration for pension purposes, was
introduced in the 1989 Budget, and is worth Pounds 77,400 for the 1993-94
tax year. It applies to members of final-salary schemes set up after the
1989 Budget and members who joined any final-salary schemes after June 1,
1989. However, there are less tax-efficient 'unapproved' Revenue schemes
available, which help build up pensions for earnings above the cap.
Few employees achieve a full two-thirds pension at retirement, particularly
if they have changed jobs several times. Fortunately, it is possible to top
up a company pension by paying into an additional voluntary contribution
(AVC) scheme, usually run by a life office on behalf of the employer. AVCs
are individual money-purchase plans that can be used to provide extra
pension either through the purchase of an annuity or, in some cases, by
boosting the company pension itself. Free-standing AVCs (FSAVCs) are also
available, mainly from the life offices. The maximum total contribution to
the company scheme and (FS)AVC combined is 15 per cent of earnings.
Group money-purchase, or 'defined contribution' schemes do not link the
pension to the final salary. Instead, contributions are invested to provide
a fund at retirement, which is used to purchase an annuity to provide an
income for life. The value of the fund - and hence the annuity - is not
guaranteed but will depend on the provider's investment performance, policy
charges and the prevailing annuity rates at the time of purchase.
There are two basic options under this type of group scheme - contracted-out
money-purchase schemes (comps) and, by far the most popular with employers,
group personal pensions. Comps are also available on a contracted-in basis,
where the pension provided by the scheme sits on top of the Serps pension
rather than replacing it.
There are a few differences between comps and group personal pensions, but
the pros and cons of each tend to be outweighed by more important factors,
such as the employer's rate of contribution (sometimes nil, but generally
about 3 per cent) and the investment performance of the chosen fund.
Most group schemes - whether final-salary or money-purchase - are contracted
out of Serps and receive a rebate of NI contributions. In return,
final-salary schemes promise to provide a guaranteed minimum pension (gmp)
to replace the Serps benefit foregone. Very few money-purchase schemes offer
this guarantee.
The self-employed and employees who do not have access to a suitable group
scheme can take out a personal pension. These were introduced in 1987 and
replaced the old-style self-employed retirement annuity. Although it is
still possible to contribute to an existing retirement annuity, new
contracts are not available.
'Appropriate' personal pensions allow employees to contract out of Serps and
claim the NI rebate. This is calculated as a percentage of middle-band
earnings. Almost 5m employees have taken out personal pensions and will be
eligible for the rebate, which is worth up to Pounds 1,500 for the 1992-93
tax year for those earning over Pounds 21,000. The rebate is sent direct to
your chosen provider, who invests it in the fund of your choice.
However, a rebate-only plan will not provide a decent pension on its own, so
you should also try to pay an extra contribution to top up the rebate plan.
Like all money-purchase arrangements, on retirement the accumulated fund is
used to provide an element of tax-free cash, and the remainder is used to
purchase an annuity.
Personal pensions are available from a range of financial institutions, but
the market is dominated by the life offices. A handful of unit trust groups
and friendly societies also run their own scheme, but most banks and
building societies act as tied agents and offer the pension products of a
life office.
Finally, it is important to appreciate that investments in a pension scheme
or AVC are locked away until retirement, and even with personal pensions you
cannot take the benefits until at least age 50. For this reason, in some
circumstances pensions advisers also recommend the use of other
tax-efficient savings vehicles such as personal equity plans (Peps) and
tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas) which tie up your money for
much shorter periods.

FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (18): How to give advisers the
litmus test - Questions you should ask
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN EDWARDS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL ADVISERS come in many different guises. They can be an alternative
name for insurance company or unit trust salesmen; employees of banks or
building societies; or pukka financial consultants.
So the first question when dealing with financial advisers should be aimed
at checking that they are authorised to give investment advice, and on what
subjects.
That sorts out the wheat from the chaff. If you receive an honest answer,
you should at least know whether you are talking to an independent financial
adviser, company representative or a 'tied' agent.
The company representatives and tied agent should explain that they are only
able to offer the range of products sold by one particular company.
But salesmen are salesmen. Therefore you might need to ask a few
supplementary questions to get a really clear picture. Ask to see a
letterhead and/or business card. Asking for the name of the adviser's boss
or contact at the company gives you someone to complain to if something goes
wrong, and a possible checkpoint if you feel you are being misled.
Once you have established what type of adviser you are dealing with, the
next stage is to assess their status and competence. With company
representatives and tied agents, this is mainly a check on the company they
are representing. Has it got a good name and a reputation to protect, or
have you never heard of it?
It is a bit more difficult with independent advisers. You can ask how long
they have been in business, how many people are employed, and what
qualifications or experience the adviser has. Also, what they are authorised
to advise upon; and whether they are specialists in any particular areas.
In both cases you can then check with the central register of all the
authorised firms of investment advisers, maintained by the Securities and
Investments Board (SIB). The register lists their names, addresses and a
description of the sort of business they are allowed to undertake.
It also states whether or not the firm is permitted to handle clients' money
 -another important question.
If their names are not on the central register, prepare to move away smartly
with your hand on your wallet.
Competence and honesty, are more difficult to assess. However, you might
prepare a few trick questions where you know the answers, and see whether
the adviser looks blank, bluffs or gives correct replies. The simplest
questions are often the most revealing.
For example, two questions that might reveal whether the adviser is only
interested in commission-earning products are: What's the difference between
an investment trust and a unit trust? What are the current rates being paid
on National Savings products?
Another safeguard is to ask advisers to put their recommendations down in
writing, so that you can judge them in the cold light of day.
Possibly the most crucial question is how the adviser is remunerated -
salary, bonuses, commission or fees. Unfortunately, with company
representatives you are unlikely to get a straight answer. They are not
obliged to tell you how and what they are paid. Tied agents are also not
bound to reveal their commission and charging arrangements.
Independent financial advisers, however, must give you details of how much
they will earn from providing you with a particular product, provided you
ask specifically.
Most independent advisers still rely on commission for the bulk of their
earnings, and this can obviously influence their judgment.
However, equally relevant is how the individual consultant is remunerated.
Some independent advisers pay their consultants salaries only to prevent
their being swayed by the need to earn commission. Others pay a mixture of
salary and commission to their consultants or themselves.
Alternatively, there are a growing number of fee-based advisers who charge
'up front' for their services, although most of them do not rely exclusively
on fees.
The few simple questions listed with this article should at least prevent
your being led up the garden path. Whether the advice proves to be any good
is another matter.
Key questions to ask a financial adviser:
Are you authorised to give investment advice, and if so by whom?
Are you fully independent, or are you employed or tied to a particular
company and only able to recommend its products?
Are you authorised to handle clients' money?
What types of business are you authorised to give advice on, and are you
permitted to operate discretionary accounts?
Are you prepared to put your advice in writing?
How are you remunerated? Salary only; salary plus bonuses and/or commission;
commission only; fees only, or a mixture of fees and commission.

CONSUMERS normally acquire investments on a haphazard basis: a word from a
friend here; a newspaper article there; the persuasion of a salesman
somewhere else.
But how does one work out a sensible portfolio of investments and policies
which actually meet your needs? There is no magic formula that applies to
everyone, which is why advisers and salesmen have to take you through a
fact-find when they first meet you.
John Cole, of financial advisers Berry, Birch &amp; Noble, says that investors
should sit down with a blank piece of paper and write down all their sources
of income and their normal expenditure, and see what money is surplus and
thus available for investment.
Then they should think about their ultimate objective, whether it is
providing for school fees, retirement or a daughter's wedding. Most people
have an inflated idea of what their pension will actually be worth; just
finding out what your pension benefits are is a useful exercise in itself.
Make sure you have the basics in place. If you have dependants, do you have
life insurance? You may find this is provided by your work; if not, then
term assurance is the cheapest way of providing what you need. There is no
investment element to term assurance; it is just like house or car
insurance. If you do not make a claim, you do not get any premiums back.
Savers should also decide what level of risk they are happy with. Mr Cole
says it is vital that the investor understands the product he or she is
buying and is comfortable with it.
Once you have a clear idea of your current financial position, your
financial goals, and your attitude to risk, then you can start to think
about your portfolio.
Mr Cole says any portfolio should have three elements: liquidity, a backbone
of guarantee and security, and equity-related growth products.
Broadly speaking, the younger you are, or the longer term your goals, the
greater the proportion of your portfolio that should be in shares. This is
because, over the long term, equities have provided the best returns.
But shares can, of course, be risky in the short term. So anyone saving for
the next holiday, or an elderly person who needs income, should limit the
equity proportion.
The best way for the small investor to get into shares is via a unit or
investment trust. These buy a widespread portfolio of stocks, and thus
reduce the risk of one company going wrong. If held in a personal equity
plan, all income and gains are tax-free. Again, the advantages of a Pep show
through in the long term; in the short term, the charges can easily destroy
the tax benefits, especially for a basic-rate taxpayer.
Buying an indexed fund which grows in line with the FT-SE 100 or the
All-Share wipes out the risk of picking a poor-performing fund manager. The
charges are lower, too.
For the cautious, guaranteed equity products provide a way to get some of
the benefits of share investment without risking your original capital.
Turning to the 'secure' portion of the portfolio, investors could consider
the following:
National Savings. Decent returns if held for five years, often with tax
advantages.
Gilts. Bonds issued by the UK government, which offer a fixed income and a
fixed repayment value on a fixed date.
Index-linked gilts. Repayment value and income grow in line with inflation.
Very tax-efficient, because most of the return comes in the form of capital
gain.
Guaranteed income bonds. These pay a fixed income (after basic rate tax is
deducted) and return your capital after a set period of years.
Zero dividend preference shares. Issued by investment trusts, these pay no
income but will be repaid at considerably more than their face value.
Profits are subject to capital gains (not income) tax, which few people pay.
With-profits policies. These are issued by insurance companies and should
normally only be considered if you can wait at least 10 years for your
return. They give poor value if surrendered early.
Finally, on the liquidity element of the portfolio. There can be more
imaginative choices than just the building society. Money market funds offer
competitive rates, and two (Fidelity and M &amp; G) give chequebooks to those
with over Pounds 5,000. A Tessa gives tax-free interest if held for five
years; all that happens if you withdraw money early is that you pay the tax
you would have paid in the first place.
It makes sense to get financial advice, although make sure that you know on
what terms you are paying for it. Most FT readers should consider paying a
fee, so that the adviser is paid by you, rather than by the product
provider. But whether fees or commissions, go to an independent adviser in
preference to a tied agent who just works for one company.

FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (16): The gateway to a haven is
still ajar - Offshore investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TAX HAVENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
or offshore financial centres, as they prefer to be called - played a
starring role in every financial scandal of the 1980s.
They offer a climate of secrecy and non-accountability in which white-collar
crime festers and thrives. But that is a slightly unbalanced perspective on
the offshore financial services business.
Shrewd UK investors have used tax havens legitimately for decades as a means
of avoiding tax and protecting their assets. They still do, although the UK
is gradually closing the door.
Successive Budgets have severely limited investors' options. The biggest
blow was the 1984 Finance Act, which outlawed the practice of deferring tax
indefinitely on dividends from offshore 'roll-up' funds, ending the
billion-pound bonanza enjoyed by Rothschild's Old Court and similar Channel
Islands funds.
The 1991 Finance Act imposed taxes on capital profits made from offshore
trusts set up after April 5, 1991, a long-expected restraint on the nouveaux
riches who hoped to squirrel away their wealth in the manner of the
aristocracy.
A more ominous measure, if implemented, is contained in the 'Domicile Bill'.
This would render taxable the offshore holdings of thousands of rich
foreigners resident in the UK. But Ruritanian princesses need not hold their
breath. The Bill, which would deem them 'UK domiciled' - thus subjecting
their worldwide assets to UK tax - is unlikely to come into force.
Notwithstanding these drawbacks, offshore opportunities proliferate. A
simple expedient, for the super-rich, is to invest in an offshore fund or
deposit account. These pay dividends and interest gross, on which tax is not
payable until you have filed your tax return. Wealthy investors may thus
receive 'interest on their interest' until they file.
Another windfall derives from the enduring notion of 'distributor status'.
Such status is conferred annually by the Inland Revenue upon offshore funds
which pay out dividends equal to 85 per cent of net income. Income from
funds with distributor status is taxed as if it were capital.
While UK investors in offshore distributor funds must pay tax on dividends,
any disposal is treated as capital gain. Thus they receive the first Pounds
5,800 free of capital gains tax (this tax bonus was significantly greater
when income tax rates were above CGT rates).
The famous 'roll-up' fund is still a ubiquitous feature of the UK's
traditional tax havens (Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man). Jeffrey
Burton, managing director of Guernsey International Fund Management and
chairman of Guernsey Fund Managers Association, says that roll-up funds
still provide 'a significant deferral of tax'.
One example is the UK investor planning to retire abroad, who places his
assets in a roll-up fund, and then sells the holding, free of tax, after he
has left the country. It is a simple way of cocking a snook at the Inland
Revenue while making full use of the UK's public utilities.
Alternatively, roll-up funds appeal to those who anticipate their income
being relegated from the higher to the lower tax band. Such people would
invest in a roll-up fund while in the higher tax band and dispose of their
holdings under the lower, avoiding higher-rate tax exposure altogether.
Currency funds are perhaps the most popular offshore vehicle, because they
pay close to money-market rates of interest. Like derivative funds, they are
available chiefly offshore. Mr Burton explains: 'The regulations covering
unit trusts have not really made it possible to introduce them in the UK.'
Offshore financial advisers say that most wealthy people in the UK use one
or more of these methods of investing.
'We would certainly hope so,' said one fund manager in Jersey. 'Assuming
that Barings, Hambros and Schroders manage a similar investment performance
offshore as they do onshore, there is a strong argument that you should
invest offshore to receive dividends gross,' he said.
A director of a Guernsey company said, however, that 'we don't market
products purely on tax advantage, we don't think investors should invest
purely on tax criteria - but it is an argument which applies'.
But do the risks outweigh the attractions? No, according to Channel Islands
practitioners. Both Jersey and Guernsey have introduced investor protection
legislation in recent years, which compensates investors up to Pounds 50,000
and Pounds 60,000 respectively on losses derived from fraud or negligence.
Both islands classify funds into two groups: those recognised by the
Securities &amp; Investments Board, and marketable in the UK, and those
available elsewhere.
Neither island has a depositor protection scheme, unlike the Isle of Man,
whose scheme is as generous as that applying in the UK. But the Channel
Islands take much comfort from the fact that they have never had a
significant banking failure. Indeed, both refused BCCI a banking licence,
and Jersey last year received an AAA credit rating from Standard &amp; Poor's.
Secrecy laws are as strict as Switzerland's, and money-laundering rules are
identical to those recently introduced in the UK.
'Investors have to be introduced by a reputable professional,' says Mr
Burton. 'We would always look to the source of the referral.'

FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (15): Safe but not what they used to
be - National Savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL SAVINGS and controversy are not likely partners, but after a year
in which National Savings regularly made the headlines, it appears to be
preparing to retreat to its less newsworthy corner.
The controversy was a product of the government's determination to raise
funds. In order to increase its contribution to government funding, NS
launched a new product - the First Option Bond - last summer. The bond,
which was aimed at basic-rate taxpayers, paid a fixed rate of 7.75 per cent
net on amounts under Pounds 20,000 for one year. Building societies
complained that they could not match the rate and alleged unfair
competition.
The offending bond has since been withdrawn, and NS has also finally lowered
the rate of interest paid on its other products.
Like other fixed-rate and deposit-based investments, this means that
National Savings products are no longer as attractive as they used to be.
But they cost nothing to buy and, short of revolution, are completely safe.
Fixed-rate products
With the exception of Capital Bonds, these are free of capital gains and
income tax, and are therefore of most benefit to higher-rate taxpayers. The
drawback is that they do not pay income and that they have to be held for
exactly five years to get the rate of interest promised. If they are
encashed any earlier, returns will be diminished.
Those who forget to encash matured certificates will be put on to what is
known as the general extension rate, currently paying 3.75 per cent tax
free.
Savings Certificates
The bedrock of the range, the 40th issue NS certificates, pay 5.75 per cent
compound per annum if held for five years. The index-linked certificates
guarantee to pay 3.25 per cent above the rate of inflation, again if they
are held for five years.
An individual can hold a minimum of Pounds 100 of either certificate, and
the most that can be held is Pounds 5,000 of each. An additional Pounds
10,000 of matured certificates can be reinvested in either or both
certificates.
If the holder of NS certificates dies, their heir can inherit the
certificates without prejudicing their own holding.
Yearly Plan
This is a scheme designed to help those who want to buy a savings
certificate through regular payments. Monthly payments of between Pounds
20-Pounds 400 are made by standing order for one year to buy a four-year
Yearly Plan certificate. The maximum that can be put in over a year is
therefore Pounds 4,800. If you can afford a lump sum of Pounds 4,800, you
would be better off buying the certificates directly.
At the end of the five-year term, the investor will receive 5.75 per cent
compound, once again free of income and capital gains tax. Because payments
are made piecemeal during the first year, the interest earned during the
year is staggered. The Yearly Plan can be held alongside the savings
certificates.
Children's Bonus Bond
Launched about 18 months ago, the bond is a way of investing money for
children, perhaps as a gift for their 21st birthday when the bond matures.
Rates of interest are fixed for five year terms. The present Issue E offers
a fixed 7.85 per cent compound if held for the five-year term. After five
years, another fixed-rate offer is made, and the bond will attract the new
rate automatically unless it is encashed.
This can be done at the fifth year anniversary, or when the holder is 21
years old. The bond will attract no interest if it is encashed in the first
year and only 5 per cent in subsequent years. The maximum that can be put in
the bond is Pounds 1,000.
Capital Bonds
Unlike the other guaranteed products, these are taxable, and tax has to be
paid before the bonds mature. But since interest is paid gross, the bonds
are primarily attractive to non-taxpayers. Series G pays 7.75 per cent gross
when held for five years, equivalent to 5.8 per cent for a basic rate
taxpayer. Higher-rate taxpayers will be better off buying the NS
certificates.
The minimum investment is Pounds 100 with a maximum holding of Pounds
100,000. Unlike the other products, the bond is automatically repaid on the
fifth anniversary, so there is no risk of the holder being put on to the
general extension rate.
Variable-rate products
Income Bonds: Particularly popular with non-taxpayers, because interest is
automatically paid gross, the bonds pay regular monthly income. The current
rate is 7 per cent gross equivalent to 5.25 per cent for a basic-rate
taxpayer.
Holdings are in multiples of Pounds 1,000, with the minimum holding at
Pounds 2,000 and the maximum at Pounds 50,000. For couples who wish to hold
the bond jointly, the maximum is Pounds 100,000. Interest is earned on a
daily basis, and is paid as monthly interest on the 5th day of every month,
once the saver has held the bond for six weeks. The first payment includes
the interest due since the bond was taken out. Monthly income can be paid
directly into a bank or building society.
Investment Account: This is a one-month-notice account, currently paying
6.25 per cent gross, which compares favourably with instant-access building
society accounts, particularly on lower amounts. The minimum for each
deposit is Pounds 20 and the maximum that can be held in the account is
Pounds 25,000. Interest is paid gross, but the account is taxable.
Ordinary Account: The replacement for the Post Office Savings Account, this
is advertised as an instant access account, but notice may need to be given
if you wish to draw amounts over Pounds 100. The minimum deposit is Pounds
10 with a total maximum at Pounds 10,000. The account pays two rates of
interest, depending on how long you leave the money untouched. The standard
rate is 2.5 per cent gross, but if a minimum of Pounds 500 is left for a
whole calendar year, it will earn the higher rate of 3.75 per cent gross.
Premium bonds: Premium bonds pay monthly tax-free prizes, from Pounds
250,000 to Pounds 50. The minimum purchase is Pounds 100, to a maximum of
Pounds 10,000. The return on the fund is 5 per cent per annum.

FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (14): A unitised home for ready cash
 -Money market funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONEY MARKET funds are fast emerging as a potential alternative to building
societies as a home for savers' cash holdings.
A money market fund pools together the deposits of savers and invests them
in the short-term debt of banks and other institutions. The depositor has
units in the fund, which rise in value as interest is accumulated. Since a
money market fund does not need a vast branch network, it should have lower
costs than most building societies. Thus it should always be able to offer a
competitive return close to the level of base rates.
One or two building societies will nearly always be offering accounts which
beat money market rates at any time. But all too often, such returns are
'special offers' which apply only in the short term; rates fall again once
sufficient deposits have been attracted.
Safety.
Can a money market fund reduce your capital? There are two obvious forms of
risk. The first is that the institution offering the fund could go bust.
Here the investor has rather better protection than the building society
depositor.
Most money market funds - the ones classed as unit trusts - are covered by
the Investors Compensation Scheme. The investor therefore has 100 per cent
cover on his first Pounds 30,000 deposit and 90 per cent of the next Pounds
20,000 - a maximum protection of Pounds 48,000.
Contrast that with the building society depositor, whose maximum
compensation is limited to 80 per cent of his first Pounds 20,000 deposit -
a maximum therefore of Pounds 16,000.
The second level of risk with a money market fund is the possibility that
the fund will invest in a bank or other institution which goes bust. Here,
funds can offer two forms of comfort. First, they only invest in banks with
good credit ratings - and would therefore steer clear of the likes of BCCI.
Second, the fund will have many holdings - so even a disaster at one bank
will have little impact.
Perhaps the best reassurance for British investors is that money market
funds are widespread in the US, where bank failures are commonplace, and yet
problems for fund holders are virtually unknown.
Flexibility
How can investors get their money out of a fund? Most operate on a postal
basis; investors must redeem units in the fund and this will take a week or
so.
However, two funds offer easier access. Fidelity gives a chequebook to those
who invest Pounds 5,000 in its fund. Cheques can then be used to pay for
substantial items such as holidays, though payments must be for a minimum of
Pounds 250.
M&amp;G's recently launched Treasury fund (which invests in Treasury bills) also
offers a chequing facility, but this only allows the investor to transfer
money into a bank or building society account.
Tax
Interest accumulates within the fund net of basic-rate tax. Non-taxpayers
will have to reclaim the tax from the Inland Revenue; higher-rate taxpayers
will face an additional charge.
Most money market funds credit the interest in the form of an increasing
unit price. Assume that you had bought 1,000 units at 100p in a fund which
yielded 5 per cent net. After a year, the unit price should have grown to
105p, making your 1,000 units worth Pounds 1,050. Fidelity operates a
slightly different system. The unit price stays the same, at 100p; interest
is used to buy more units. So if you had 1,000 units at 100p, and the fund
yielded 5 per cent net, then, after one year, you would have 1,050 units at
100p.
Charges
The manager's charges obviously have an important effect on investor
returns. Most money market unit trusts have no initial charge and a small
annual fee (Fidelity's is 0.5 per cent, M&amp;G's is 0.6 per cent). Returns
quoted in the press are net of this charge, so what you see is what you get.
Performance
According to Finstat, the best money market fund over the three years to
January 1, was Smith &amp; Williamson Cash with a return of 30.2 per cent. The
average for the sector over that period was 27.8 per cent. Over 1992, the
best performer was Lazard Money Market, with a return of 7 per cent.

FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (13): The secured route may be
insecure - Loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DO YOU really need a loan? This is probably the first question to ask
yourself before deciding where to turn for one.
Only the desperate will be attracted to small advertisements promising a
sympathetic ear but which can charge exorbitant rates. Which?, the
Consumers' Association magazine, found that one company charged as much as
Pounds 1,000 to arrange a Pounds 5,000 loan, while interest rates on some
loans arranged by brokers were double those at high street banks. If you
want a loan in order to pay off existing borrowings, it is better to go to a
debt counsellor than a loan shark.
But if you are confident that you can repay the loan, there are broadly two
main ways of borrowing. For larger amounts which will be paid back over a
relatively long period, you will probably need a secured loan. Smaller loans
can be arranged by your bank or credit card company. It is worth checking
the cost of various types of loan from a number of institutions before
making a final decision.
Secured loans. The cheapest way to borrow is through a loan secured on your
property. But you should consider carefully whether repayments can be kept
up, because you risk losing your home if you do not. There are three main
options for those with equity in their property:
Further advance. You can borrow more money from your lender against a
specified limit of the equity left in your home. If the money is for home
improvements, you will usually be charged the standard variable rate. The
rate of interest can, however, be higher.
Second mortgage. This is an additional loan, taken out from a second lender
on a home on which there is already a mortgage. If your home had to be sold
to meet your debts, the second lender would be behind the first for payment.
Second lenders are therefore likely to charge a higher rate of interest than
your mortgage rate.
Remortgage. This is more expensive than the other two options, because you
are taking out a new mortgage to replace the old. It therefore involves the
full costs of arranging a mortgage, including valuation and legal fees. In
some cases, tax relief could be lost, so you should check first.
Those borrowing more than 70 per cent of their property's value will incur
heavy mortgage indemnity premiums. By raising the loan-to-value ratio, the
risk of sliding into negative equity is also increased, should house prices
fall further. It is chastening to note that in two-thirds of repossession
cases, a second mortgage was involved. Secured loans are also available from
banks.
Unsecured loans
If you want to borrow smaller sums of money, the main choice is between a
bank loan or borrowing off your credit card.
Overdraft. This is generally an expensive way to borrow, even if it is
authorised. It is a good idea to arrange an overdraft facility when you are
in credit in case you need it when cash-flow problems cause you to be
periodically overdrawn.
Personal loan. A set amount is borrowed at a fixed, though usually
negotiable, rate of interest for an agreed period of time. The period of the
loan is unlikely to be longer than five years. If you are borrowing at a
time of relatively high interest rates, the fixed interest rate may prove
irritating if rates subsequently fall.
Credit cards. These are cheap - and free if your card does not carry an
annual fee - as long as you pay off your bill when it is due. But they are
one of the more expensive ways of longer-term borrowing. If you have a Gold
Card, you may have an overdraft facility on it. The overdraft rate is likely
to be less than that that on a bank loan.
Other options include:
Employers. Some employers may be prepared to give a loan for certain items,
such as a transport season ticket or car, on reasonable terms.
Insurance company. If you have an investment-type insurance policy, for
example, an endowment, which is not already tied to anything else (such as
paying off your mortgage), you may be able to borrow against the value of
the policy from the insurance company.
The loan is a percentage of the surrender value, so unless you have held the
policy for a while, it may not be worth very much. However, this is a
relatively cheap and long-term way of borrowing.
Unauthorised overdrafts and store cards are two of the most expensive ways
to borrow.
As a general rule, it is foolish to borrow in order to invest money. There
is little point in receiving interest on savings only to pay out a greater
rate of interest to finance a loan. Similarly, if you have savings, it is
far better to use these than to borrow, but some cash savings should be left
for an emergency.

FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (12): Regulation is helpful but
complex - Knowing where to complain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KNOWING WHO to complain to in the financial services industry is a skill in
itself. The area is riddled with borders which sometimes overlap and
sometimes do not meet at all. Given the plethora of self-regulatory bodies
and ombudsmen, knowing where to begin can seem daunting.
Where to go depends on the nature of your complaint. If you believe you were
given bad financial advice or that you were sold the wrong investment
product, your complaint would be against the person or company that sold you
the product.
But if you are concerned that your investment is being mismanaged, your
complaint would be against the company managing the investment, rather than
the person who sold it to you.
The procedure for complaints is always to approach the individual first, and
then the company. If your complaint is not dealt with satisfactorily, you
should then contact the relevant regulatory body. The final stage is to take
the matter to the ombudsman, if there is one.
Photocopies of supporting documents and the correspondence to date should
also be sent.
Knowing which regulator to contact can be cause for confusion, because some
products fall between various regulatory stools. Home income plans, for
example, can be the responsibility of the Building Society Ombudsman, or
Lautro (the self-regulatory organisation for the life industry), or Fimbra
(the SRO for independent financial advisers).
There is a proposal that Fimbra and Lautro should be merged into a Personal
Investment Authority, which should simplify the process if it actually
happens.
The body with ultimate responsibility for financial services and investments
is the Securities and Investments Board. It will deal with complaints, but
only after they have been through the regulatory authorities.
Some companies may be members of one or more bodies. If you are unsure of
the correct regulatory body, SIB has a central register listing the details
of authorised firms and the conditions under which they can operate. The
number is 071-929-3652.
The self-regulatory bodies and Ombudsmen only have jurisdiction over their
members, so it is important to make sure that you do business with an
accredited individual or company.
Financial Advisers. If your complaint relates to the advice given you by an
independent financial adviser and you have already complained to the
adviser, write to Fimbra at Hertsmere House, Hertsmere Road, London E14 4AB.
Fimbra can withdraw a member's authorisation, and if you find this is the
state to which your IFA has been reduced and that you have grounds for
seeking compensation, you should write to the Investors Compensation Scheme,
Gavrelle House, 2-14 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8RA. SIB has responsibility
for the ICS, and is at the same address.
The procedure is different for agents who are 'tied' - that is, selling the
products of a single insurance company, or who are part of the direct
salesforce of a company.
After approaching the individual and then the company, you should write to
the relevant regulatory body. This is likely to be either Lautro or Imro
(Investment Management Regulatory Organisation). Lautro is at Centre Point,
103 New Oxford Street, London WC1A 1QH; while the address for Imro is
Broadwalk House, 5 Appold Street, London EC2A 2LL.
Banks and building societies. After contacting the branch manager and head
office of the bank or building society, the next step is to write to either
the Banking Ombudsman, Citadel House, 5-11 Fetter Lane, London EC4A 1BR; or
the Building Societies Ombudsman, 35-37 Grosvenor Gardens, London SW1X 7AW.
The ombudsmen deal with complaints about savings and mortgages.
Insurance-related products sold by a bank's 'adviser' will be handled
elsewhere.
Insurance-related products. You need to find out which is the responsible
regulator for the company, but it is most likely to be Lautro or Imro.
If you are unhappy with the outcome of your correspondence with Imro, the
Investment Referee, at 6 Frederick Place, London EC2R 8BT, can act as a
conciliator between the complainant and the Imro member.
If neither Lautro nor the Investment Referee is able to help, you should try
the Insurance Ombudsman at City Gate One, 135 Park Street, London SE1 9EA.
Pensions. After exhausting the complaints procedure of the company in
question, queries and complaints about occupational pensions should be
addressed to the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service (Opas). Complaints
about private pensions are most likely to be handled by Lautro.
If your case needs to go further, you should contact the Pensions Ombudsman,
who shares the same address with Opas: 11 Belgrave Road, London SW1V 1RB.
Unit and Investment trusts. Unit trusts fall under the self-regulation of
Lautro. The Unit Trust Ombudsman scheme has been dissolved and is now
handled by the Insurance Ombudsman.
The fund management activities of most investment trusts should fall under
the authority of Imro.
Stockbrokers. The Complaints Bureau of the SFA (Securities and Futures
Authority) handles complaints against stockbrokers. The address is Cotton
Centre, Cottons Lane, London SE1 2QB.
The professions are regulated by the Recognised Professional bodies (RPBs).
The main ones are:
Chartered Accountants. There arethree chartered accountancy institutes. The
addresses for complaints are:
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, Gloucester House,
399 Silbury Boulevard, Central Milton Keynes, MK9 2HL; Institute of
Chartered Accountants in Scotland, 27 Queen Street, Edinburgh EH2 1LA; and
Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, 87-89 Pembroke Road, Dublin
4.
Lawyers. Complainants in England should contact the Complaints Office, Law
Society, Portland House, Stag Place, London SW1E 5BL. The corresponding
address for the Law Society of Scotland is 26 Drumsheugh Gardens, Edinburgh
EH3 7YR.
Actuaries. Institute of Actuaries, Staple Inn Hall, High Holborn, London
WC1V 7QJ is responsible for regulation.
Insurance Brokers. Insurance Brokers Registration Council, 15 St Helens
Place, London EC3A 6DS.

FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (11): Recovery is delayed by a sick
economy - Japan's Stock Market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TOKYO stock market has suffered a heavy fall since reaching its peak
just before the close of 1989. Since then, it has dropped by about 57 per
cent, compared with a rise of about 12 per cent for the UK stock market and
an 18 per cent rise in US equities.
Since the start of 1990, the Nikkei average has underperformed the Dow Jones
and the FT-SE 100 by more than 60 per cent. But despite this
underperformance, analysts and fund managers do not believe that Tokyo's
long-awaited recovery has begun.
Poor earnings growth, a slowing economy, falling property prices and an
increase in bad loans outweigh the potential benefits of a further cut in
interest rates this year and last year's official measures to support the
stock market.
The state of the Japanese economy is the main reason for investors to be
cautious. In mid-January, Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, vice-minister at the
ministry of international trade and industry and one of the country's top
economic policymakers, warned that the economy would only begin to recover
in the autumn at the earliest.
Mr Rod Birkett, fund manager of Flemings Japanese Investment Trust, believes
that the Japanese economy may not show signs of a sustained recovery until
possibly 1994. Furthermore, the stock market will have difficulty in
pre-empting a recovery in the economy, because of the loss of confidence
among investors.
However, he believes that 1993 might still provide a good opportunity to buy
Japanese equities, especially for investors prepared to take a longer-term
view of the market. He would hope to be fully invested later on this year -
the cash position of his Pounds 180m trust is just under 5 per cent at
present.
Mr Robert Hook, a senior fund manager of Japanese equities at Prolific Asset
Management, is wary of the market at present, because it is being
artificially supported by public money, as a result of the government's
package to help the stock market. He also finds it difficult to find value
in a market which he believes does not yet reflect the fundamentals of the
economy.
The views of fund managers are broadly in line with the forecasts of
brokers. SG Warburg, in its 1993 outlook, says that the potential rewards in
overweighting the Japanese market at current levels seem rather meagre,
while the risks remain high. Furthermore the stock market's valuations (for
example, it is trading on a prospective price/earnings ratio of more than
50, compared with around 16 for the US, about 13 for the UK and just under 9
for Hong Kong) do not appear inviting to the broker, unless there is a more
rapid pick-up in profits than it thinks likely.
Warburg agrees that the declared buying interest of public funds is playing
a blocking role, but this cannot provide a new impetus for equities on its
own. Therefore the broker forecasts a decline in the market indices of 20-25
per cent over the first four to six months of 1993, and looks for the market
to bottom in the second quarter.
James Capel is more positive about Japan than other brokers. In its 1993
outlook, it believes that, after a dismal 1992, the market may already have
seen the bottom. The broker expects further gains in 1993, with a target of
about 20,000 on the Nikkei for the year-end, and about 1,540 on the Topix
index. The indices currently stand at 16,500 and 1,270 respectively.
Capel agrees that the market's supply-and-demand problems are not yet behind
it, and expects continued selling by tokkin, or specified money trusts, this
year, although not as heavy as in the first quarter of 1992.
Nevertheless, Capel believes the gradual recovery of the Japanese economy,
combined with a more tangible improvement in the US, will make 1993 a good
year for the electrical sector. Warburg also sees some pockets of optimism
in the Tokyo market. For example, it believes that the ratings of
non-financial shares, such as capital goods producers and consumer product
manufacturers, are not too demanding.
Prolific's Mr Hook believes the restructuring of the Japanese economy, as
manufacturing companies turn away from a policy of making wafer-thin profit
margins on high-volume sales towards one of greater profitability and
competitiveness, will provide a longer-term investment theme for investors.
Fleming's Mr Birkett says an improvement in Japanese companies' return on
equity over the 1990s will feed through into better profits, which will in
turn reduce the p/e ratios of individual stocks. At the beginning of this
year, return on equity in Japan was a low 4.5 per cent, compared with 15 per
cent in the US.

FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (10): Losses spur the pace of
innovation - Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOCIAL, ECONOMIC and technological pressures are transforming the UK's
insurance industry and leading to significant changes in the price, range
and quality of home, motor and other consumer products and the way in which
they are bought.
Since the mid-1980s, the industry has been subject to an onslaught of
competitive pressures.
The final abandonment of the insurance companies' cartel in 1985 - the
so-called tariff system - ushered in a period of intense competition among
large composite insurance groups - Royal Insurance, Sun Alliance, Guardian
Royal Exchange, Commercial Union, General Accident, Eagle Star and Norwich
Union.
UK companies were particularly anxious to retain and increase market share
as a result of the opening of the European insurance market and the entry
into the UK of giant European companies such as Allianz and L'Union des
Assurances de Paris.
The resulting price competition drove premium rates downwards, especially in
higher margin commercial insurance (the policies bought by businesses rather
than individuals), leaving the industry ill-prepared for a surge of claims
from storms and subsidence in 1990 and 1991.
The recession led to an increase in claims for theft and arson. Worse still,
the collapse of the property market and the downward spiral in house prices
led to wholly unexpected claims on mortgage indemnity policies - a class of
insurance policy sold to banks and building societies to protect mortgage
loans, traditionally regarded as virtually risk-free by insurers.
These factors contributed to a cyclical downturn in the industry, which left
almost every insurer nursing heavy losses in 1990 and 1991, when pre-tax
losses for the UK industry amounted to more than Pounds 2bn. For some
companies, such as Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance, these losses were the
first ever sustained.
The fall in the equity and property markets - especially during 1991,
because of the Gulf War - made matters even worse, as it reduced the size of
the insurance companies' own assets. Solvency is a concept used by
regulators and insurance brokers (who are essentially professional insurance
buyers) to measure the financial health of insurance companies. It compares
a company's capital base with its insurance liabilities (in the technical
jargon, net assets as a percentage of non-life premium income).
Because insurance companies paid for losses from their own reserves, and
because the value of their investments in shares and buildings fell, the
solvency of most insurers has fallen.
One company, Municipal Mutual Insurance, the ninth largest in the country,
has been forced to withdraw from the market. The industry as a whole is keen
to raise fresh capital by issuing more shares.
On top of these economic pressures, a wave of technological innovation has
made it easier for new companies to enter the market, and forced insurance
companies to re-examine their traditional ways of doing business. Because so
many of their day-to-day operations concern the routine processing of
information, the introduction to the market of cheaper and more powerful
computers has had a particularly important effect.
Computers have allowed insurance companies to make their 'backroom'
operations (filing, claims processing etc) more efficient. In addition, they
give underwriters access to more information more quickly about the risks
they insure and the claims that have resulted. This should allow insurers to
price risks more accurately.
The greatest amount of innovation has occurred so far in the motor insurance
market. Using advanced computer software and telephone systems, companies
such as Direct Line, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland, have
developed direct sales techniques which bypass the insurance broker, the
industry's traditional middleman. Direct Line and its imitators advertise
their products through carefully planned television and advertising
campaigns, and employ relatively low-grade clerical staff to underwrite
insurance and sell policies over the telephone.
Brokers have reacted to this threat by developing their own networks and
streamlining their links with companies to increase their efficiency. Chains
such as AA Insurance Services and Swinton offer telephone sales services,
supplementing their extensive networks of high street branches and offering
instant price quotes.
For the consumer, this combination of economic pressures and technological
innovation has produced a mixed picture. On the one hand, the cost of
insurance has increased sharply in the past two years as insurers have
sought to recover from recent heavy losses. On the other, insurers have
become much more selective in their pricing, more and more relating premium
levels to smaller and smaller classes of risk.
For example, until 1991, the price of household insurance tended to be
around Pounds 2 per Pounds 1,000 of rebuilding cost, with relatively few
variations between companies. But in the past 18 months, each of the
companies has introduced a range of rating bands, with the price of
insurance varying from Pounds 1.80 to Pounds 4 per Pounds 1,000, depending
on a property's exposure to subsidence or storm risk.
Further changes are on the cards as Direct Line and similar sales companies
enter the market. Building societies and banks sell over 50 per cent of
insurance policies in the UK, receiving in return sizeable commissions of
over 30 per cent in some cases. By reducing these costs of distribution,
both brokers and direct writers can offer cheaper products.
Increasingly, insurers are competing in terms of the service they offer as
well as price. For example, by using telephone networks and computer
systems, companies have introduced so-called 'help lines', offering
consumers assistance when a claim occurs. In addition, some companies now
offer access to legal advice as part of insurance policies.

FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (8): Keep awake to read the small
print - Guarantees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORD 'guarantee' seems to give many investors the ability to sleep
soundly at nights. Over the past year, there have been guaranteed products
in the fields of fixed interest, property and equities.
But investors should never forget one thing; the guarantee is only as good
as the institution offering it. A prime example was Birmingham Capital
Trust, a small banking institution, which guaranteed to pay no less than 12
per cent per annum over five years on its tax-exempt special savings account
(Tessa).
At the end of 1992, however, the bank wrote to Tessa holders, telling them
that 'due to a major erosion of the capital base of the company' the account
would be shut down. Investors were recommended to switch to the Dudley
Building Society, which was then offering a much lower (and variable) return
of 8.5 per cent.
So when offered a guarantee (especially one that lasts a long time),
investors should carefully consider whether the company will be strong
enough to honour it.
A second point is to make sure what exactly is being guaranteed. The
Scottish Widows Monthly Bond, offered at the end of last year, was a case in
point. The advertisement offered up to 9.2 per cent per annum net for five
years - and said: 'We can only guarantee these rates on the first Pounds 15m
invested.'
But the 'guarantee' on this product applied only to the income, not the
capital. The advertisement did contain the standard warning: 'The value of
stock market investment may fall as well as rise, and investors may not get
back the full amount originally invested.'
In fact, the Scottish Widows product consisted of a combination of an
annuity and a personal equity plan. For investors to receive all their
capital back, the Pep would have to grow at 13 per cent per annum. That is a
steep growth target. If the Pep failed to grow at all (by no means
impossible, as many investors will have found in the past), the capital loss
would be 40 per cent.
Investors could have gleaned these facts by careful study of the product
literature, but many may not have done so. The lesson is: do not rely on the
word 'guarantee' in an advertisement. Read the small print.
Some guaranteed products are relatively straightforward:
Guaranteed income bonds (see also B for Bonds) are issued by insurance
companies, pay a fixed income over a number of years, and repay your lump
sum at the end of the period. This income is paid net of tax, and cannot be
reclaimed by basic rate taxpayers. The backing for the guarantee comes from
the Policyholders Protection Act, which will pay 90 per cent of the value of
the fund if the company goes bust.
Guaranteed growth bonds are essentially the same product, except that the
income is rolled up within the bond and paid out at the end.
Once one strays into the field of guaranteed equity products, things become
much more complicated. Most last for a five-year period, at the end of which
they will offer your money back or a return roughly equivalent to the rise
in the FT-SE 100 Index, whichever is the greater.
But the market is evolving all the time, with some products now offering an
income facility, others giving the chance to lock in gains as they occur,
and some allowing the investors to make early withdrawals.
These products may well appeal to those cautious investors plunging into the
equity markets for the first time. But they should remember two key points:
You do not get something for nothing. The funds have to pay for the
guarantee. Commonly, investors have to give up the yield on the market,
which at 4-5 per cent is a significant return to lose.
Most of these products are insurance bonds and have basic-rate tax deducted.
Higher-rate taxpayers will face an extra charge and, unless they regularly
pay capital gains tax, they should be better off with a low-charging indexed
fund.
In the case of the Business Expansion Scheme, companies have been stopped
from describing themselves as guaranteed. But in practical terms, a
guarantee is what is on offer from these schemes. These involved a BES
company buying property from an institution which agrees to buy back the
properties at a marginally higher price in five years' time. Because the
investor gets tax relief on his initial investment (turning a Pounds 10,000
investment from a top-rate payer into Pounds 6,000), returns can be very
attractive.
Much depends, of course, on the creditworthiness of the institution
concerned; if it is small and weak, it may not be able to buy back when
required. That is why the regulators attacked the word 'guarantee'. But some
schemes have third-party backing by major banks, and this 'guarantee' is
what attracts investors.
The BES is set to disappear at the end of this year, and one can expect the
market to be flooded with schemes. Financial services marketing men have as
much use for a clearance sale as any other salesman.

FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (9): Cheaper loans absorb less of
your income - Housing market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE FACE of it, there are good grounds for optimism in the housing
market. Base rates fell from a high of 15 per cent in 1990 to 6 per cent at
the end of January. Mortgage rates correspondingly dropped from 15.4 per
cent to 7.99 per cent over the same period.
With mortgage payments so comprehensively reduced, housing affordability has
increased. A statistical analysis undertaken by the FT shows that, with
mortgage rates of 7.99 per cent, servicing the loan on an average-priced
house now takes 17.8 per cent of average gross income, compared with 45.1
per cent in 1990 when base rates were 15 per cent. This affordability ratio
is almost down to 1972 levels of 17.35 per cent.
The calculation divides average monthly earnings by the amount needed to
finance an 80 per cent mortgage for the average-priced house at prevailing
interest rates. Prevailing tax reliefs are taken into account.
As affordability increases, the hope is that first-time buyers will return
to the market, pushing up demand and prices.
But the problems afflicting the market are many, and the single remedy of
falling interest rates appears to be inadequate.
Confidence. Building societies and estate agents are the first to admit that
this is what the market now needs. Mortgage rates have fallen as low as they
are likely to go. Only half a percentage point of the one point base-rate
cut on January 26 is being passed on to mortgage holders. Building societies
are now thinking of their savers rather than their borrowers and, if there
is another base-rate cut, they are unlikely to pass on more than a fraction
of it.
In any case, mortgage rates are historically low. You would need to go back
to October 1971 to find mortgage rates of 8 per cent, and even further back
 -to April 1968 - for rates of 7.63 per cent.
The question is no longer affordability but confidence. With unemployment
continuing to rise and green shoots of recovery stunted, people still feel
economically insecure and prefer to reduce their debts rather than to spend
money.
Prices. Another reason why first-time buyers are holding back is nervousness
about the level of house prices. Whenever the floor appears to have been
reached, another Halifax house price index shows prices dropping yet
further.
Expectations last year that prices would finally stabilise were dashed when
the Halifax index showed that house prices had fallen by just under 8 per
cent in the year to December 1992.
The problem of negative equity - where the value of the house has fallen
below the size of the loan - may be a problem confined almost completely to
the south-east, where price falls have also been greatest. But the Joseph
Rowntree Foundation, the social research group, estimates that the problem
affects one in five homes bought in the last five years to November 1992.
Potential buyers still have to be convinced that they are not buying a
falling asset before they enter the market.
Supply. Lack of demand and high levels of repossessions, caused by the
inability of some homeowners to meet their mortgage payments, have combined
to increase the availability of housing stock. Repossessions have a further
depressing effect on the market by dragging down prices, too.
According to the Council of Mortgage Lenders, repossessions fell from their
1991 peak of 75,540 to 68,540 at the end of last year. The main reason for
the 9 per cent drop was increased willingness on the part of lenders to
accept lower payments until the borrower could afford to pay more.
Partly as a result of this, more than 350,000 households were six months
behind in their mortgage payments by the end of December - the highest
figure ever and an increase of 28 per cent on the 1991 total of 275,350.
Although Mark Boleat, director-general of the CML, is optimistic that
repossessions will continue to fall, others are not so sure. John
Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, expects
repossessions to increase next year, and high levels of repossessions to
continue for the next three years. This oversupply of property is likely to
continue to act as a drag on house prices.
The Pounds 750m announced in the Autumn Statement by the government for
housing corporations to buy up 20,000 empty homes should ease some of the
oversupply, although this figure is thought to represent only 10 per cent of
the total number of empty properties on the market.
These negative factors are likely to inhibit a quick recovery of house
prices, despite low mortgage rates.
Halifax, the largest mortgage lender, says it expects prices to stabilise
this spring, with its estate agents reporting a significant increase in
demand by prospective buyers to view houses. But it does not expect to see
any price increases until the second half of the year, leading to a more
sustained recovery in 1994.
Mr Wriglesworth has become more optimistic about the prospects for recovery.
He has abandoned his forecast of a drop of 5 per cent in house prices by the
end of this year, and now expects no price change.
While homeowners may not regard these projections with much joy, they do
indicate that the property market may finally be at its floor. This means
that those who have held back from buying could afford to be less cautious,
though they do not need to hurry because the indications are that they have
plenty of time before prices start to rise.
This is also likely to be the time to take out a fixed-rate mortgage. The
problem is that the lowest rates come from the shortest-term fixes - fixing
for a long term may involve paying more than your current variable rate.
That might be a hard pill to swallow.
It is important, however, to watch out for stiff early-redemption penalties,
the cost of tied-in insurance-related products and high application fees.
These bear particularly hard on short-term fixes.

NO FINANCIAL advice comes free. One way or another, you will have to pay for
it.
This may grate, but advisers need to earn a living. The problem is how they
should do this.
There are two basic methods of remuneration: fees, where you pay the adviser
according to time and effort spent; and commissions, where the product
provider pays the adviser a proportion of the money spent on the product.
Theoretically, as far as the consumer is concerned, there is no contest. An
adviser paid by fee is your agent, with no incentive to offer any particular
product or any particular company. Thus, he or she can offer genuinely
'independent' advice.
A commission-charging adviser, on the other hand, is being paid by the
product provider, and has a natural bias to be its agent, and not yours.
Such advisers may not suggest non-commission products such as National
Savings or investment trusts to their clients.
What makes this worse is that commissions vary from product to product and
from company to company. Until 1989 they were capped by the Maximum
Commissions Agreement, but this was abolished, in a move which the industry
bitterly opposed, and commissions have risen since.
Also, when buying from direct sales forces, or from tied agents of insurance
companies, such as most building societies, the system of incentives for
sales staff can be camouflaged in the figures. You have the right to ask an
independent adviser how much commission he is receiving, but this does not,
unfortunately, apply to those who can only sell the products of one company.
In practice, however, the commission-charging system has survived intact
because many consumers will not write out a cheque to an intermediary. They
are certainly unlikely to write out cheques for amounts equivalent to the
sums the insurance companies are paying advisers in commission.
Fee-charging advisers have a market among better-off people who are used to
paying fees for lawyers and accountants, but their chances of expanding must
await a change in attitude by the British public.
How much commission do you pay on the standard investment products?
Endowment Policies: According to a survey conducted last year by Lautro, the
life assurance regulator, the average commission on a 25-year
mortgage-linked endowment with Pounds 50 monthly premiums in 1991 was Pounds
570 to a tied agent (a category which includes most building societies) and
Pounds 498 to an independent adviser. Total premiums in the first year would
be Pounds 600. Total range was, for tied agents, from Pounds 435.60 to
Pounds 641.52, and for independents from Pounds 419.76 to Pounds 578.16.
This tempts advisers both to sell an endowment, when a repayment mortgage on
its own will usually not yield any commission at all, and to recommend one
high commission company rather than another. The law does not allow an
adviser to recommend one company rather than another solely because it pays
a higher commission, but it is hard to believe that life offices would offer
more commission unless it had an effect.
Personal Pensions: Commissions again reach high levels. Lautro's survey
found that the commission on the average 25-year individual personal pension
is 62 per cent of the first year's premium. For 10-year pensions it would
take a bite of 29 per cent. Again, commissions are higher if you go to a
tied agent, such as most building society - 69 per cent of first year's
premiums were taken from 25-year pensions, and 34 per cent from 10-year
plans. Facilities for rebating commission, or reinvesting it in the
contract, tend to be more advanced than they are for endowments.
Single-premium Bonds: The Lautro survey revealed that, out of Pounds 1,000,
Pounds 52 would probably go to an appointed agent and Pounds 52 to an
independent adviser.
Unit Trusts: Three percentage points of the front-end charge are meant as
commission for the adviser. Lautro found that the average commission out of
an investment of Pounds 1000 was Pounds 32 for tied agents and Pounds 31 for
independents. The same norm applies to unit trust Peps. This is a steady
industry standard, although Lazards and Murray Johnstone have cut their
front-end charge by removing the commissions. Note the hefty incentive this
provides to offer single premium bonds, life assurance element and all,
rather than unit trusts, and endowments, rather than Peps, for mortgage
repayment.
Investment Trusts: Normally you would only pay a brokers fee for making the
transaction. However, several investment trust managers have taken to
offering 3 per cent commission to independent advisers. This has helped them
in the race against unit trusts in recent years.
Gilts: You can buy them through the National Savings Stock Register at the
post office, and no commission as such is payable. The administration charge
is Pounds 1 for the first Pounds 250 you buy, and 50p for each subsequent
Pounds 125 on top of this.
National Savings: No commission is payable. You can buy them from a post
office, for no charge.
Tessas: No commission is payable - they are normally bought direct from a
building society, whose expenses have been taken into account in the rate of
interest on offer.
Arm yourself with this information when going to an adviser. But there are
also can be dangers in the 'fee-charging' system. If someone charges you a
fee, make sure you know the exact basis on which fees will be charged in
advance. If they advise you to buy a commission-charging product, make sure
that commission is accounted for  - there is certainly no merit in paying
both fees and commission.
Also, commission is only one of the factors behind your choice of
investment. It may be worth paying high commissions for performance, but you
should have strong evidence of good performance before paying over-the-odds;
other things being equal, low charges should boost the performance of your
investment in the long run.

FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (6): Inheritance tax may be
avoidable - Estate Planning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE LAW allows people to leave a considerable estate
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pounds 150,000 - before any tax at all is payable, and many might feel this
is sufficiently generous. The best measures to mitigate the inheritance tax
burden for your heirs tend to involve placing a lot of trust in them, which
some parents might not be prepared to do.
Two or three years ago there was a spate of IHT 'plans', as the tax seemed
likely to catch more people. Now, as house prices - the main constituent of
most estates - fall while the threshold for paying the tax increases, many
are slipping back out of the IHT net. The longer lives secured by modern
medicine are also taking their toll on the value of estates left at death,
particularly when a few years are spent in expensive residential care. There
may be more point in ensuring that you have enough money to pay for this
care during your lifetime, than in limiting the IHT payable on whatever
estate is left.
However, those who want to take action against IHT can take heart from the
fact that it is a very easy tax to avoid.
The basic allowances are as follows:
You can leave as much as you like to your spouse - all bequests to a
marriage partner are outside the IHT net, and all other allowances are in
addition to this.
The threshold before IHT is payable on an estate is Pounds 150,000. No tax
will be payable if Pounds 150,000 is left to an heir and the rest of the
estate is left to a spouse.
Over and above these, 'potentially exempt transfers' can be made. These are
gifts made to heirs (or anyone else) during the donor's lifetime. If the
donor survives for seven years, no IHT will be payable on these. If death
intervenes within seven years, then there could be an IHT liability - this
tapers off, depending on how long the donor survives.
On top of these provisions, there are annual exemptions:
A gift of up to Pounds 3,000 can be given each year to an individual,
completely free of IHT liability. This can only be carried forward by one
tax year, so those who have not made such a gift for IHT purposes before can
give a maximum of Pounds 6,000 in the first tax year.
A limitless number of 'small gifts' of up to Pounds 250 per tax year can
also be given away. If you had 20 people to whom you wanted to make gifts,
you could therefore give Pounds 5,000 completely free of IHT.
Once all these exemptions have been accounted for, heirs will have to pay 40
per cent of any excess in tax. From an estate of Pounds 1m where no action
had been taken, therefore, Pounds 340,000 would be payable in tax (40 per
cent of Pounds 850,000).
If you do not want your heirs to be burdened with this there are two broad
ways to proceed - either by using life assurance policies, or through
trusts.
The route of least resistance is to insure your life for the amount of IHT
which you expect your heirs to have to pay. If you take out a whole-of-life
policy, written in trust, your heirs are at least guaranteed not to have to
be out of pocket. However, life insurance for the elderly is not cheap, so
this could make quite a dent in the value of the estate.
A variation on this is to give your money away as a potentially exempt
transfer, and then take out a seven-year term insurance policy. If you die
within the seven-year time limit, therefore, your heirs' tax liability will
be covered. However, the life insurers will pay nothing if you survive more
than seven years.
Still another possibility is to buy a whole-of-life policy, along with an
annuity. All money paid into an annuity is automatically outside your
estate, as it officially belongs to the life company, and the annuity income
payments can then be used to pay the premiums for the whole-of-life policy.
Taking this route could, however, be over-generous to a salesman paid by
commission only.
A more complicated route to estate-planning, which involves paying less in
life insurance commission, involves setting up a trust. Inheritance
tax-planning trusts are typically 'gift and loan', where some money is given
to the trust but a larger proportion is only loaned. Profits made by the
trust on the money loaned to it should be immune from IHT, although the
precise limits are controversial.

FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (5): If you Pep them, watch the
charges - Dividends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY PEOPLE make the mistake of thinking that owning shares is all about
capital gains. In fact, dividends are vitally important.
Broadly speaking, share prices do no more than keep up with inflation over
the long term. In real (after inflation) terms, BZW figures show that share
prices were no higher at the end of 1992 than they were at the end of 1968.
The real return to investors thus comes in the form of dividend income.
BZW's calculations show that the real return to investors from shares since
1919 has been a gross 7.3 per cent per annum. If you assume that dividends
will grow in line (over the long term) with GDP, then a rough and ready
calculation is to say this real return from equities consists of the average
dividend yield of 5 per cent, plus dividend growth of 2 per cent.
The compounding effect of such growth rates can be remarkable. The BZW
figures show that someone with a gross dividend income of Pounds 1,000 in
1978 would have seen it grow to Pounds 4,687 by 1992.
But the 1980s were a remarkable period. The UK was emerging from a decade
when corporate profits were depressed, dividend growth was restricted and
inflation was high. Dividends actually fell by 25 per cent in real terms
between 1970 and 1978.
So the 1980s may have represented a 'catch-up' period. As so often happens,
the 1990s has seen yet another change in mood. According to BZW, dividends
actually fell in nominal terms in 1992 - for the first time since 1973.
The long economic boom of the 1980s made companies confident about their
ability to pay out dividends. The 'cover' ratio - the extent to which
current profits are sufficient to pay dividends - has dropped below 2, well
below the historical average. Many were caught out by the depth of the
current recession and have been forced to cut dividends, or not pay them at
all; a move which normally causes unpopularity among investors.
This suggests that any recovery in profits in the 1990s will be used to
rebuild dividend cover rather than to increase payouts substantially.
Nevertheless, now that UK interest rates have fallen to such low levels,
investors are starting to see dividend yields as a source of immediate
income.
At the start of February, the dividend yield on the FT-A All-Share Index was
4.3 per cent, compared with base rates of 6 per cent.
If held within a personal equity plan, dividends are tax-free. So the net
income return from a Pep for a top-rate taxpayer could easily beat the
return from a building society account as well. Add in the possibility of
capital growth as well and it is easy to see why Peps could prove popular.
Much depends on the Pep charges, however. If the annual charge is 1 per cent
plus VAT (1.175 per cent), then a Pep will have to yield 4.7 per cent for
the tax savings of a basic-rate payer to outweigh the charge. For a top-rate
taxpayer, the break-even yield is around 2.94 per cent.
The market is becoming ever more competitive, however, and managers are
showing willingness to be flexible in their charging structures. By creating
hybrid products, with part of the portfolio invested in bonds and the bulk
in equities, managers can offer Peps with attractive yields and reasonable
levels of security.
Cazenove launched a Pep in early February, for example, which invested in
utility stocks (such as water and electricity) and in bonds. With a yield of
7 per cent (after allowing for the annual management charge of 0.5 per
cent), the initial charge of 0.2 per cent plus Pounds 35 makes little dent
on the tax attractions to those who can invest the full Pounds 6,000 Pep
allowance.
But investors need to be cautious of too high a dividend yield. This
normally signals a high risk investment, and what investors gain in income,
they can lose in capital. Furthermore, the fact that an individual share is
on an above-average yield often signals that the market expects the dividend
not to grow, or to be cut, in the near future.
Sometimes capital loss can be built into the structure of the investment, as
with some of the income shares of split-capital trusts. In some cases, these
income shares will have no value at all when the trust is wound up; and so
the shares closely resemble an annuity. In other cases, the repayment value
of the income shares is dependent on the trust receiving high investment
returns, making the shares highly speculative.
So when choosing a Pep to take advantage of dividend returns, investors
should look very carefully at both charges and the nature of the underlying
investments. The good news is that there are attractive packages around, and
that history has shown that dividends are a reliable source of income
growth.

FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (4): Shortcuts to a portfolio of
equities - Collective Investments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT is a full-time occupation
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
you cannot expect to beat the market unless you put in the hours. Those who
do not have the time to look after their investments will need to join with
others in a collective fund.
The UK's fund managers offer two vehicles for collective investment: unit
trusts and investment trusts. You can buy these as part of tax-efficient
packages (through personal equity plans and pensions), and products such as
single-premium bonds and with-profits endowments provide collective
investments for those who do not mind using part of their savings to provide
life assurance. But for those interested in pure investment, the choice is
between unit and investment trusts.
Differences between the two are often overstated, so here are the points
they have in common:
Both allow small investors to buy a portion of a large portfolio of
securities. This is professionally managed, for a fee which reflects a small
percentage of the portfolio each year. Thus they both allow diversification
 -a spread of investments to limit the risk of capital loss which comes with
investing in individual equities.
Each trust has a defined investment objective - for example, growth or
income - and a sector in which it can invest. Trusts can restrict themselves
to geographical areas, or to particular kinds of company, or to particular
classes of asset. This makes it easy to use them as building blocks for a
diversified portfolio.
Comprehensive statistics, regularly published in the FT and elsewhere, allow
investors to compare funds, and to monitor which fund managers have
delivered the best performance.
Those are the points in common. In other ways they differ:
Unit Trusts. A unit trust is a mutually held fund, which is split for
pricing and valuation purposes into units. The price of units varies with
the performance of the fund - if the portfolio of shares it holds goes up in
value, then so will the unit price, by the same proportion. The price of the
units multiplied by the total number of units will always be equal (once the
various charges are taken into account) to the asset value of the portfolio
which it represents.
The number of units is determined by the relative amount of buying and
selling. If more units are bought than are sold (or 'redeemed') on one day,
then the number of units in the fund will expand. Administration of buying
and selling, plus the valuation, is carried out by the unit trust company
(or its agent).
Unit trusts pay out a distribution each year, which is taxed as income,
although this can be accumulated within your investment. Capital gains tax
may be payable when you sell.
Charging includes a 'front-end' charge, of typically 5 per cent, which is
deducted from the value of the investment at the outset. This is part of the
'bid-offer spread', which is the difference between the price at which you
buy units (the offer price), and the price at which you sell (the bid
price). This also takes account of the costs of buying and selling
individual shares. There is also an annual charge which varies between 0.5
and 1.5 per cent.
There are many more unit trusts than investment trusts, including trusts
devoted exclusively to cash, gilts, convertibles, and international bonds -
these are not exclusively equity vehicles.
Investment Trusts. Unlike unit trusts, investment trusts are quoted
companies, which happen to have the sole aim of investing in other
companies. You invest by buying shares in the company through a stockbroker
(or direct from the trust, via a savings scheme). Note that this allows
complex capital structures which can have useful applications (see Z for
zeros). While unit trust prices are determined by the management company,
the price of an investment trust is determined by the market.
The size of the fund cannot fluctuate in accordance with flows of money from
investors - instead, it only moves in response to the performance of the
investments it holds. This makes investment trusts 'closed-ended', while
unit trusts are 'open-ended'.
In general, the market will value an investment trust's share price, so that
it moves in line with the performance of its underlying assets. But if
demand is heavy, the share price will rise disproportionately, while it will
fall if there are few buyers. Most investment trusts trade at a discount to
their net asset value - in other words, the share price is such that you can
buy the assets of the trust for less than they are worth. This is an
attractive proposition.
However, it does add an extra level of risk and opportunity. You are at the
mercy of the performance of the fund managers, as you are with unit trusts,
but you must also contend with market sentiment about the trust. If the
discount narrows, you will gain. If it widens, you will lose.
Pricing provides an argument in favour of investment trusts. All you need
pay is a standard bid-offer spread, commission to a broker and stamp duty.
An annual charge is taken from the fund by the fund manager. As the trust
itself bears less administrative costs, the result will normally be lower
fees than on a unit trust.
Unit and investment trusts lessen risk. Do they deliver good performance?
The total return on the FT-A investment trust index was 105.5 per cent in
the five years to the beginning of 1993, according to Datastream. Over the
same period, total return on the All-Share was 99.32 per cent. This
out-performance can largely be attributed to a narrowing of discounts which
may not be repeated.
Meanwhile, the average UK Equity General unit trust, over the same period,
has grown only a paltry 52.81 per cent with income reinvested, according to
Micropal (note that the investment trust figure will not include all the
charges payable, whereas the unit trust figure does).

FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (3): A good bet if inflation remains
low - Bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BONDS ARE suddenly attracting the attention of British investors. The reason
is simple: bond returns are now higher than those available on cash in
building societies. In the jargon of finance, this is called a positive
yield curve.
A bond is just a tradable IOU with the issuer agreeing to pay interest and
to repay the capital on maturity. In Europe and in the US, it is very common
for private investors to own them.
But in Britain, high inflation has in the past destroyed the value of bond
holdings. Investors are hoping that the current conditions of low inflation
and high real (after inflation) yields will make bond buying more profitable
this time.
The key thing to understand about bonds is the yield. The running yield is
the relationship between the interest rate and the market price, calculated
by dividing the former by the latter. A bond which has an interest rate of
10 per cent and a price of 80 has a running yield of 12.5 per cent. If the
price rises to 125, then the running yield falls to 8 per cent. So as prices
rise, yields fall and vice versa.
What complicates the calculations is that bonds will eventually be repaid at
face value (normally expressed at 100). So someone who buys a bond at 80 can
look forward to a capital gain of 20 if he holds the bonds till maturity.
The combination of capital gain or loss to maturity plus interest is called
the gross yield to redemption. The redemption yields for government bonds
(gilts) are shown every day in the FT.
Bonds priced above face value have higher running yields than redemption
yields; those priced below face value have higher redemption yields than
running yields. As an example: on January 22, the Treasury 2000 issue, with
an interest rate of 13 per cent, was priced at 126 1/2 . At that price, the
running yield was 10.28 per cent and the redemption yield was 8.18 per cent.
When investors buy bonds, they have a measure of certainty. They know the
income they will receive each year, and the yield to redemption. But what
they do not know is how the price will move between purchase and maturity.
Nor do they know what inflation will do to the value of their capital while
they hold the bond.
The bond market is not a homogeneous mass, but divides into a number of
categories:
Conventional gilts. These bonds, issued by the UK government, have a fixed
return and, short of revolution, the investor is absolutely certain of
repayment. All capital gains are tax-free but income is taxable. The
cheapest way of buying gilts is via the Post Office, through not all issues
are available and you may not get the best price; you need to use a
stockbroker if you want to buy more than Pounds 10,000.
Index-linked gilts. Also issued by the government, but their repayment value
and interest payments rise in line with inflation. As a consequence, much of
the return comes in the form of (tax-free) capital gain.
UK Corporate bonds. Comparatively rare. They will offer a higher yield than
gilts, because they carry a higher risk; there is a chance, if the company
gets into trouble, that the bonds will not be repaid in full, or at all.
Overseas government bonds. The credit risk varies widely, depending on the
country. But as well as price fluctuations due to interest-rate changes, the
investor also faces an exchange-rate risk; if the foreign currency
depreciates against the pound, the value of the bond will fall in sterling
terms. Broadly speaking, if another government's bonds are yielding more
than gilts, that is because the credit risk is significantly higher, or the
foreign exchange markets expect the country's currency to decline. Costs of
dealing in such bonds can be high, so they are best bought via a fund.
Overseas corporate bonds. Have all the characteristics of overseas
government bonds, with extra credit risk thrown in.
Guaranteed income bonds. Not tradable like the bonds in all the above
categories, but they do offer a fixed return over a fixed period. They are
issued by insurance companies and interest is paid net of tax (and cannot be
reclaimed); security is provided by the Policyholders' Protection Act, which
guarantees 90 per cent of the investment, should the insurance company get
into difficulty.
Permanent insurance-bearing shares. Not strictly speaking, bonds at all, but
have some of the same characteristics; that is, they pay a fixed rate of
interest and are tradeable. They are issued by building societies. Two very
important points, however: they will never be repaid, and so have no
redemption value; and if the building society goes bust, they come a long
way down in the list of creditors to be repaid. As usual, therefore, the
higher returns they offer do involve higher risk.
Bond funds.
For those who do not want the headache of buying bonds directly, bond funds
offer an alternative. Most are unit trusts, and by investing in a portfolio
of bonds, aim to provide the investor with income and/or capital growth.
Investors need to be aware that the higher the yield on offer, the greater
the risk of capital loss.
One disadvantage of a gilt fund is that profits are subject to capital gains
tax - not the case if the investor had bought government securities
directly. But a further point is that the investor must pay management fees.
These have fallen over the past year or so, with some managers making no
initial charge, but others still charge 5 per cent. Annual charges tend to
be around 1 per cent.
The task for the investor is to decide whether the manager's expertise more
than makes up for the fees. The top performing domestic bond funds over the
five years to January 1 were: Abbey Capital Reserve, Whittingdale Short
Dated Gilt and Kleinwort Benson Gilt Yield; the average return for the
sector over the five year period was 38.3 per cent (offer-to-bid with net
income reinvested).

FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (2): Tough times increase the
charges risk - Accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS HAVE had a tough year, during which they have been lambasted over high
charges and poor service. The introduction of charges by Robert Fleming/Save
&amp; Prosper on its current account for those in credit is seen as the
beginning of the end of free banking.
One of the measures taken by banks and building societies to weather the
recession has been a widening of their margins. This has affected borrowers
more than savers (see L for loans).
The main effect of the recession on savers has been a greater need to be
vigilant about their accounts so that they do not find themselves paying
unnecessary charges.
Competitiveness in the banking sector has increased the number of services,
such as telephone and postal banking as well as the range of different
accounts, for example, high interest cheque accounts. Customers can enjoy a
greater choice but they must also do more work to select the right kind of
bank and type of account for their needs.
To do this, anyone with a bank account should put himself into one of two
categories: the customer who does not expect to need an overdraft and the
one who foresees going into the red intermittently.
If you are in credit.
Interest-bearing current accounts. The level of overdraft rates is not a
concern. Instead, you can choose between the interest-bearing current
accounts of banks and building societies. These should provide features such
as a Pounds 100 cheque guarantee/debit card, credit cards and good service.
Almost all banks and building societies give tiered rates of interest, but
some give significantly better returns on higher deposits.
The difference can be startling. For example, earlier this month net
percentage rates on current accounts with Pounds 10,000 were Abbey National
Current (0.38); Bank of Scotland BankSave Plus (2.48); Britannia React 365
(3.19); Co-op Pathfinder (4.38); First Direct (1.13); Lloyds Gold (2.25);
Midland Meridian (2.40); Woolwich Current (2.93); Robert Fleming/Save &amp;
Prosper (3.38).
It is important to check the terms and conditions of the accounts. For
example, the Co-op Pathfinder account offers standing orders and direct
debit, but has no chequebook facility. There are monthly charges on the
Lloyds Gold and Midland Meridian accounts, if the balance falls below Pounds
1,000.
First Direct and Robert Fleming/Save &amp; Prosper do not have branches but are
telephone banking operations.
High-interest cheque accounts. These aim to pay higher rates of interest on
large deposits than interest-bearing current accounts, but they usually
require a large minimum balance.
There may also be a minimum withdrawal size and many, such as Caledonian
Bank's Hica, do not offer a cheque guarantee card or direct debit. Instead,
Caledonian's Hica pays a flat rate of interest which is unusual, because
most Hicas pay lower rates on smaller deposits.
These accounts are designed to complement rather than replace current
accounts, but some customers may find it more convenient to operate a
current account alongside a savings account (see V for Variable rate
investments).
Other types of account include those provided by Midland's Orchard and Royal
Bank of Scotland's Balanced Banking, which allow customers an automatic
transfer of funds between a choice of accounts.
If you are overdrawn. If you are likely to be overdrawn either consistently
or at periodic intervals, charges are the most important consideration.
Banks and building societies have been ruthless about widening their margins
and, in their attempt to retain savers in the face of lower base rates, they
are happier to pass the cost on to borrowers.
Accounts which pay high rates of interest to those in credit are the ones
most likely to have draconian charges for those who go into the red.
Overdraft charges are in two parts. The first is the annual rate of
interest, which will be substantially higher on an unauthorised overdraft
than on one which has been arranged. For example, National Westminster's
authorised overdraft rate on its current account is 19.2 per cent per annum
and 32.9 per cent for an unauthorised overdraft. The Co-op is unusual in
making no difference in rates between an authorised and unauthorised
overdraft.
However, customers will be less aware of the second set of charges. These
may be additional fees for exceeding an arranged overdraft, as well as
charges for sending out a warning letter or bouncing a cheque. Transaction
charges may also be made.
Some banks, such as Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland, allow the customer to
be overdrawn by Pounds 100 before imposing overdraft fees.
In its last survey of current accounts, Which?, the Consumer Association's
monthly, found that the banks which came out best in terms of overall
satisfaction to the customer were Abbey National, Co-op, First Direct, Royal
Bank of Scotland and Yorkshire Bank. Those that were above average were Bank
of Scotland, Girobank, Halifax and Nationwide. The ones voted worst were
Lloyds, Midland and NatWest.
Moneyfacts (0692 500765) and Blay's Moneymaster (0753 880482) are monthly
publications which include details of bank and building society interest
rates on accounts, credit cards, Tessas and mortgages.

FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (1): Jargon and apathy are the
enemies of planners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ALL PROFESSIONS are conspiracies against the laity, said Shaw
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and finance is no exception.
There is so much jargon in the field that many people give up in despair.
The result, too often, is that they make the either the wrong financial
decisions or no decisions at all.
But ignorance and apathy can prove disastrous. There are, of course, more
important subjects in life than split-capital investment trusts. But just as
the financial markets can overturn the plans of politicians, so lack of
financial forethought can upset your plans for a happy retirement, or for
paying for children's education.
This A-Z, a sequel to the one we published a year ago, is designed to give
readers a working guide to their personal finances - so that they can deal
more confidently with the professionals in their sector.
Articles cover both important products in the field - from bonds to
zero-coupon shares - and some of the key issues, such as whether to pay fees
or commissions, and the questions you should ask when you meet an adviser or
salesman.
The guide appears at a time when the rapid falls in interest rates have
relieved some of the pressure on borrowers, but have made it more difficult
for savers to earn acceptable returns without taking unacceptable risks.
Meanwhile, the ties between banking and life insurance are growing ever
stronger. Consumers can expect to be offered a lot of products during the
1990s, so they need to be able to tell the dross from the worthwhile.
They may or may not be able to rely on the regulators to look after their
interests; the sector is currently in turmoil as the authorities try to
cobble together a new body, the Personal Investment Authority, to cover the
retail field.
These issues make it all the more important for consumers to be
well-informed, and we believe that the A-Z of Personal Finance supplement
will prove to be of value.
We cannot cover absolutely every personal finance subject, but most are
touched upon. Those readers who want income might look at the articles on
bonds, dividends, money market funds and variable-rate investments. Those
aiming for tax-efficiency might turn to our pieces on estate planning,
National Savings, offshore investment, year-end tax planning and zeros.
You don't have to earn Pounds 150,000, or wear stripy shirts and coloured
braces, to understand finance; but you do have to take an active interest.

FT  26 FEB 93 / ICI to split and shed 9,000 jobs worldwide: Investment in
petrochemicals halted Pounds 384m pre-tax loss reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the UK's manufacturing flagship since the
1920s, yesterday signalled an end to its ambitions as one of the world's
biggest chemical groups when it announced it would split in two and shed
9,000 jobs worldwide.
Britain's biggest manufacturer also announced its first loss for a decade
following a massive Pounds 949m provision for its historic change in
direction.
The company's narrower ambitions were underlined by the revelation it would
cease to invest in the loss-making petrochemicals and chlor-alkali
industries which between them account for turnover of about Pounds 2bn.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, announcing the largest restructuring in UK
industrial history, said ICI would split in June, creating a separately
quoted company called Zeneca.
The new group, with a turnover of about Pounds 4bn, would comprise ICI's
drugs, agrochemicals and seeds, and specialities businesses. ICI
shareholders will receive one Zeneca share for each ICI share. The group's
shares rose 70 1/2 p to Pounds 11.52 1/2 .
Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief operating officer and new ICI's designated chief
executive, said the company was in the middle of the longest recession since
the 1930s. 'We are restructuring ICI so it can face the future,' he said.
'The world is becoming ever more demanding. There will be slower growth over
the next five years because of shortage of capital. We must prepare for a
harsh- er competitive environment.'
About half the 9,000 job losses will be in the UK, representing about 10 per
cent of ICI's 44,000-strong workforce. About 7,000 jobs will be lost from
new ICI and about 2,000 from Zeneca. The head-count of the combined groups
will fall to about 105,000.
ICI reported a Pounds 384m pre-tax loss for the year to December 31,
following an exceptional charge of Pounds 949m, including Pounds 516m for
rationalisation. Sir Denys said the outcome was not satisfactory, but was in
line with the experience of ICI's peer group.
Sir Denys said there might be an improvement in trading conditions during
the second half of the year. Both ICI and Zeneca would improve on last
year's results during 1993. New ICI's operating profits fell from Pounds
324m in 1991 to Pounds 148m last year, on turnover of Pounds 8.88bn while
Zeneca's trading profits dropped from Pounds 682m to Pounds 587m.
Last year's net cash outflow was Pounds 454m, in spite of the group's target
to be cashflow neutral. Mr Hampel said the outflow was unacceptable.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, downgraded ICI's debt from
double A minus to A plus. It said it reflected the fact that new ICI would
be more vulnerable to economic cycles and less profitable. ICI maintained
the dividend at 55p, although it was paid from reserves. ICI and Zeneca will
each pay a dividend of 27.5p for 1993.
Petrochemicals and chlor-alkali production did not make sense in the long
term, explained Mr Hampel. He said the businesses would not be sold, but
could be integrated into joint ventures.
ICI's chlor-alkali business at Runcorn, Cheshire, employs about 7,000
people. The petrochemicals complex at Wilton on Teesside has about 10,000
staff.
The split must be confirmed by an extraordinary general meeting in May.
Zeneca will raise about Pounds 1.3bn through a rights issue, underwritten by
SG Warburg and BZW. The proceeds will be used to reduce ICI's Pounds 2.3bn
debts. The new ICI will have debts of Pounds 600m and Zeneca Pounds 400m.
Mr Hampel said: 'ICI in its new form will be a performance-driven, no-frills
cost-conscious entity. Non-performing activities will have to be dealt with
more quickly than in the past. We must be more ruthless.'

FT  26 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ICI statement confirming a rights issue and a demerger also dominated
trading in the derivatives sector, writes Joel Kibazo.
In stock index futures, the March contract continued trading in a tight
range of about 20 points for most of the session. It started the day at
2,828 and moved lower, as the market reflected on the chemical giant's
rights issue and restructuring plans. It fell to the day's low of 2,809 at
around 11.15am.
Thereafter, sporadic buying helped March recover some of the earlier falls,
before a squeeze in the late afternoon caused a jump in the contract, with
demand boosted by renewed firmness of sterling. It touched the day's high of
2,837 at 3.30pm but came off the top to close at 2,831, up 13 on its
previous close. Turnover at 7,537 lots was poor.
In traded options, total volume was also poor reaching a meagre 24,838 lots.
Turnover in the FT-SE 100 option was a dull 3,668 lots and that in the Euro
FT-SE 1,452.
BTR was the most actively dealt stock option with 3,741 lots traded. It was
followed by ICI at 2,915, and then by Abbey National at 1,564. British
Aerospace and Sainsbury were also busy.
Liffe announced yesterday that Smith New Court had received approval to
become a market maker, thereby increasing the number on the exchange from 7
to 8. It starts trading next month.

FT  26 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: More confident mood helps shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON stock market was broadly satisfied with the ICI statement
confirming plans for its demerger, and relieved to hear that the planned
Pounds 1.3bn rights issue call from Zeneca, the proposed new corporate
holder of the pharmaceutical and bio-technology interests, will not arrive
until June. Encouraged by a recovery of around 6.6 per cent in ICI shares,
the equity market turned firmer, although investors were still restrained by
the prospect of further rights issues and profits statements from leading
companies.
Outside ICI, which made up almost 2 per cent of market activity yesterday,
there were few salient features. Trading results from Shell and from British
Gas contained no surprises for the stock market and neither share moved far
from overnight levels. The heavy job losses foreshadowed by both ICI and
British Gas did nothing to lift the shadow cast by the recession in the UK
economy, but merely tended to confirm the view that economic recovery is
still some way ahead.
Equity trading was influenced from the market opening by the looming
statement from the ICI boardroom. Shares in the blue chip chemical group had
been bought heavily by US investors after London closed on the previous
evening, and this development had left UK marketmakers dangerously short of
stock; ICI, and the market, rose sharply in the first half hour of official
trading, help along by activity in ICI traded options.
The early gain of 12 points on the Footsie scale was soon reversed to a fall
of 7.6, however, as traders grappled with the heavy flow of corporate
statements. The market then recovered steadily, encouraged as the time for
Wall Street's opening drew near, by traders' awareness that renewed US
demand for ICI shares was in the offing.
At the close, the FT-SE Index was just below the day's best at 2,828.7, a
net gain of 11.7 points, with ICI effectively responsible for about 3.19 of
them. Traders expressed some disappointment with the Footsie's apparent
reluctance to move away from the lower end of a trading range which seems to
have narrowed to 2,810 - 2,850 this week.
Second line stocks drifted off as market attention focused on the day's list
of announcements from the blue chip list. At 3,029.5, the FT-SE Mid 250
Index shed 0.4. In terms of market volume, non-Footsie stocks made up about
61 per cent of the day's total of 620.5m shares traded through the Seaq
system. On Wednesday, a Seaq total of 592.7m shares returned retail worth of
Pounds 1.18bn, maintaining the satisfactory levels of retail business which
have now prevailed for the past five months.
There were signs that investors were willing to turn away from the defensive
sectors which have returned to fashion as rights issue fears have unsettled
confidence for the near-term outlook for equities. Utility stocks gave back
some of their recent gains.
However, financial stocks looked steadier as the market absorbed this week's
disclosure of higher debt provisions at National Westminster. Store issues,
weakened recently by realisation that further interest rate cuts may have to
await the Budget speech from the UK chancellor of the exchequer, moved
higher. Selected buying of store shares from the US, a somewhat rare
occurrence, was reported.

FT  26 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Property hopes
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There were further positive comments on the commercial property market, with
Smith New Court detecting a slow revival in its latest report. Like NatWest
Securities, which came to similar conclusions earlier this week, Smith
suggests that net asset values are at present taking second place to cash
flow in analysts' judgment of property stocks.
The broker recommends Slough Estates, off a penny at 186p, MEPC, steady at
370p, and along with NatWest, British Land, 6 forward at 232p. In second
liners, both brokers prefer Allied London Properties, steady at 55p, and
Frogmore Estates, also unchanged at 345p.
Barclays Bank shares were given a mid-morning mauling, sliding to 414p at
one point after a flurry of selling triggered by rumours that the bank had
been summoned to the Bank of England because of concerns over its loan book.
A denial of the story brought a swift rally in the shares which ended the
session only 4 easier at 420p. Turnover was an unremarkable 7m. Along with
the rest if the sector, Barclays shares have come under pressure since
NatWest published disappointing bad debt figures on Tuesday. Barclays'
preliminary numbers are expected on March 4.
Credit Lyonnais (CLL) added to the pressure on Barclays reaffirming its
belief that the bank should retain core capital and therefore cut the
dividend. CLL told its clients to either sell or switch from NatWest and
Barclays and to buy Lloyds, Abbey National, Royal Bank of Scotland and TSB.
Abbey, due to report preliminary figures on March 2, added 3 at 388p, helped
by aggressive buying of the stock options.
SG Warburg jumped 8 to 628p, after 635p, reflecting the fees accruing from
its role in the ICI/Zeneca rights issue.
British Gas shares made early progress, touching 292p, but later eased to
close unchanged at 289p as the market assessed the sharp decline in the
group's preliminary results. Analysts said the profit shortfall reflected
the unexpectedly large restructuring charge and there was general
satisfaction with the dividend increase.
But specialists were alarmed at the chairman's statement on dividend policy.
One said: 'A company that is haemorrhaging cash, with profits below
expectations and a dividend under threat from the Monopolies Commission mean
that investment in it is a real act of faith.'
Royal Insurance closed unchanged at 285p after the preliminary figures which
were accompanied by a Pounds 100m bond issue. This was seen as lifting the
threat of a rights issue in the short term. Analysts pointed to the
underlying improvement in the insurance business, with current year
estimates being lifted to around the Pounds 100-Pounds 110m mark.
General Accident suffered again from worries that a big rights issue, in the
region of Pounds 400m to Pounds 500m could appear with the preliminary
results expected on March 2. Prudential jumped 8 to 317p after good figures
from its US subsidiary Jackson National.
Shell's preliminary numbers were given a relatively good reception by the
market and the shares edged up to close at 583p. Turnover, still boosted by
talk of switching out of Royal Dutch, reached 7.1m shares. One analyst said
the dividend was at the top end of expectations but cautioned about the
continuing losses in the chemicals business. BP held at 275 1/2 p despite
broker recommendations to switch out of the shares and into Shell.
Bargain hunters helped cause a rally in several of the photo copier related
stocks which fell heavily on Wednesday on fears that the OFT may launch an
investigation into their activities. Gestetner put on 5 to 136p, while
Southern Business Group also gained 5 to 84p.
The market continued to appreciate the restructuring plans at British
Aerospace. The shares closed 2 up at 267p, following the payment of a 3p
interim dividend. The final dividend payment of 4p which was announced on
Wednesday is due on Monday. The company is holding another session on its
trading outlook for analysts today.
Rolls-Royce was also busy with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said to be positive on
the stock. The shares added 4 to 132p in trade of 5.1m. Talk that Abu Dhabi
was about to place an order for 8 Super Lynx helicopters with Westland
Group, boosted the shares. They gained 4 to 150p, with turnover reaching
4.4m.
Volume in conglomerate Tomkins rose to 7.1m as the shares eased 5 to 261p,
with most of the day's selling having been conducted through a leading US
house.
Worries about the poor state of the German automotive industry left GKN
shares 4 lighter at 462p.
Inchcape added 4 to 598p after announcing that its Inchcape rBerhad
subsidiary was to sell its timber business to local Singapore investors for
around Pounds 24m.
There was more tired talk of rights issues around Allied Lyons, although
dealers said more hurtful was a rumour of a downgrade by agency broker James
Capel. The shares dropped 5 to 585p. A line of over 1m shares hung over Bass
for most of the session and weakened the shares, off 3 at 574p.

FT  26 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hartstone tumbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leather and hosiery group Hartstone fell by 27 to 223p, leaving the stock
one of the biggest casualties in the London market, as rumours that the
company broker had cut forecasts were confirmed.
Ms Julia Blake, textile analyst with BZW, reduced her 1993 estimate by
Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 32.5m on the basis of a severe downturn in the
European hosiery market. 'There is serious overcapacity in the area and,
although the company is still generating profits there, margins have been
squeezed,' she said.
The stock has been very volatile recently with the downgrade message
competing with bid talk. Mr David Gratton, the company finance director said
yesterday: 'Unfortunately this is not the first time we have suffered from
rumours - I am not aware that we are about to be taken over.'

FT  26 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: ICI wins brokers' approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ANNOUNCEMENT by ICI of a Pounds 1.3bn rights issue to fund the demerger
of its pharmaceuticals and chemicals divisions was followed, perhaps
surprisingly, by a 6.5 per cent jump in the share price. This represented
the sharpest rise in the FT-SE 100 index list and one of the biggest in the
London market. The last time the shares saw a similar price hike and trading
volume was in July 1992, when ICI first announced its intention to create
Zeneca as a separate pharmaceuticals arm.
The initial announcement of a pre-tax loss of Pounds 384m and the need to
cut 9,000 jobs was not encouraging and the shares moved up by less than 10p,
in spite of short covering by London brokers. However, at a packed meeting
with analysts the company announced that barring unforeseen circumstances it
would hold its traditional 55p dividend after the split.
Analysts returned to examine the yield on the stock and decided that a fair
share price was about 1,200p. Mr Jeremy Chantry of Kleinwort Benson is
looking for a combined share price 'north of 1200' and Mr Charles Lambert of
Smith New Court, who has taken a bearish view of the group's prospects, also
took a less gloomy attitude. Some analysts felt that, with the dividend
guaranteed, the shares are now virtually as secure as gilts and at a better
return.
The shares raced ahead to close 70 1/2 up at 1152 1/2 - but still lower than
they were immediately after the original Zeneca announcement  - on turnover
of 13m. By the time the UK market had closed a further 2m shares had been
traded on Wall Street and the share price there had reached the equivalent
of 1,162p. A further 3m shares changed hands in the form of traded options.

Wall Street
BLUE CHIP stocks clung to their recent gains in the afternoon, with the help
of programme-driven buying, while the the Nasdaq market held its ground
through the day in spite of a sell-off in biotechnology bellwether company
Amgen, reports Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 8.65 higher 3,365.15, after falling
more than 10 points in morning trading. The more broadly based
Standard&amp;Poor's 500 was up 1.69 at 442.56, while the Amex composite gained
2.02 at 405.43, and the Nasdaq composite added 4.61 to 667.07.
Trading volume on the NYSE was more than 254m shares. Rises outnumbered
declines by 1,063 to 804.
The mixed tone of the market reflected continuing investor uneasiness about
the Clinton administration's economic policy.
Drug company stocks, which recovered lost ground at mid-week, once more
turned lower yesterday. Merck was off Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 38 3/8 ,
Bristol-Myers Squibb lost Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 57 1/8 , and Pfizer eased
Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 57 but Glaxo Holdings ADRs rose Dollars 1/8 to
Dollars 18 3/4 .
Among active NYSE stocks, Philip Morris dropped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 66,
Chrysler firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 38 7/8 , Eastman Kodak rose Dollars
2 5/8 to Dollars 53 and AT&amp;T was Dollars  1/4 higher at Dollars 56 3/8 .
Office Depot climbed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 30 1/8 after Merrill Lynch
increased its near-term rating on the stock from 'neutral' to above average.
In Nasdaq trading, Amgen tumbled Dollars 9 1/4 to Dollars 37 in very heavy
trading after the biotechnology company warned investors to expect
disappointing first quarter earnings on the back of slower-than-expec ted
sales of its important Neupogen cancer drug.
Other biotechnology issues also moved lower including Chiron, off Dollars
1/2 at Dollars 48 3/4 and Synergen, down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 14 3/4 .
Cytogen fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 14 after Merrill Lynch downgraded its
rating on the stock from 'buy' to 'near-term above average'.
Nasdaq trading, however, was dominated by improving technology stocks. Intel
added Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 118, Microsoft firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars
84 3/8 and Lotus Development rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 26 1/4 .
Dell Computer regained some ground yesterday. The stock rose Dollars 2 1/2
to Dollars 32 5/8 .
Canada
TORONTO stocks ended a four-day winning streak with a mixed performance in
extremely active trading.
Based on preliminary figures, the 300 composite index fell 5.81 points, or
0.17 per cent, to 3,459.94, but advances outnumbered declines 353 to 273.
Volume fell to 54.60m shares from 57.79m shares but the Wednesday total was
boosted by a block of 9m Petro-Canada shares. Trading value was CDollars
492m compared with CDollars 549.6m.

FT  26 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Royal Dutch results depress
chemicals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEBRUARY inflation numbers from three of western Germany's four largest
states exceeded forecasts from most economists but neither this, nor a flat
beginning for the Dow on Wall Street did more than moderate a good rise for
the Eurotrack 100 constituents, writes Our Markets Staff.
AMSTERDAM was weaker in chemicals following results from Royal Dutch which
featured a disappointing performance in that division. While Royal Dutch
showed a slight 20 cent gain on the day to Fl 154.20, DSM slipped Fl 1.70 to
Fl 71.80 and Akzo Fl 2.10 to Fl 147.80. The CBS Tendency index was unchanged
on the day at 99.8.
Mr Marcel Bokhove, analyst with ABN-Amro in Amsterdam, commented that fourth
quarter earnings for Royal Dutch came in better than expected, although
mainly due to high currency exchange gains and less extraordinary losses.
However, the chemical division's loss of Pounds 182m against Pounds 85m in
the same 1991 period further illustrated the depressed state of the sector.
Unilever remained solid following its results earlier this week, closing at
another record high, up Fl 2.50 at Fl 205.10, while Heineken put on Fl 4.20
or 2.4 per cent at Fl 181.20, partly on expectations of good figures next
week.
VNU also rose to an intraday high of Fl 108 before closing 80 cents up at Fl
107.30 as rumours continued that it was to sell the majority stake in its
printing division.
FRANKFURT recovered after two days of losses, the DAX index closing 14.67
higher at 1,658.91. Financials maintained their relative strength, led by a
DM10 gain to DM693 for Deutsche Bank, and one of DM24 to DM2,235 for
Allianz.
Turnover fell from DM7.4bn to DM5.4bn. Carmakers recovered some of their
recent losses, with Volkswagen exceptionally strong as it put on DM5.40 to
DM276.70. Chemicals were mixed with Bayer recovering from pressure
associated with its pharmaceuticals interests, rising DM3.20 to DM270.70.
But Hoechst eased 60 pfg to DM258.70 following an explosion at one of its
chemical plants in a Frankfurt suburb this week.
MILAN was again alive with rumours and Fiat rose a further 8 per cent after
a newspaper report that Renault was to buy a 40 per cent stake in the
Italian group's core car and truck business.
The Comit index rose 4.05 to 506.80, also lifted by indications that the
privatisation programme might soon move ahead after news that Iri had set
criteria for the sale of Sme, the food group, which would protect the rights
of minority shareholders.
Fiat shares fixed L262 higher at L5,780 and continued up to L5,980 after
hours, in spite of denials of the report from Renault and Fiat.
Mr Matteo Amoretti, of Albertini in Milan, said it was the detailed nature
of the newspaper report - which indicated that an announcement would come
between March 10-13 and even suggested a price - that had sparked the
renewed buying. However, he doubted whether a sale to a foreign,
state-controlled company could go ahead without the approval of the Italian
government, and questioned the logic of such a disposal after Fiat's
government-backed investment in production capacity in southern Italy and
the former eastern Europe.
PARIS shed most of Wednesday's gains with the CAC-40 index down 8.75 at
1,944.64 in turnover of some FFr2.9bn.
Casino declined FFr6 or some 4 per cent to FFr152 following 1992 results
after Wednesday's close which disappointed the market.
Axa gained FFr16 to FFr1,159 after announcing a 16 per cent rise in 1992
turnover.
MADRID featured another sharp rise in Nissan Motor Iberica, heavily involved
in commercial and off-road four-wheel drive vehicles, closing Pta42, or 15
per cent higher at Pta324 after a Nomura buy recommendation which said that
new model introductions will allow NMI to double its current revenues by
1994. The general index rose just 0.10 to 228.00.
STOCKHOLM was stronger following recent weakness as the Affarsvarlden
general index gained 11.4 to 989.2 in turnover down to SKr973m from SKr1bn.
SKF, which said that it would pay no dividend on its 1992 results, the first
time in 70 years, was unchanged in the B shares at SKr76.50.
Astra recovered some of this week's losses although the announcement that
the finance director was to resign did remove part of the gains and the B's
finished SKr11 higher at SKr661.
COPENHAGEN saw a late rush to sell the March index future, and the KFX index
fell 0.94 to 82.08. Den Danske Bank fluctuated after announcing a DKr1.74bn
net loss, closing DKr7.50 lower at DKr290.50.
TEL AVIV recovered from a fall of more than 4 per cent on Tuesday with a
gain in the index of 5.26 to 194.18.

FT  26 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Norway is encouraged by cuts in
interest rates - But export markets hold the key
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Monday the Bank of Norway cut its key overnight lending rate from 9.50 to
9.25 per cent, the third cut this month and the benchmark rate's lowest
level since it was introduced in 1986.
The All-Share index rose 5.17 to 406.92 on the day, just below a 1993 high
of 407.38 achieved earlier this month. But it has been unable to retain its
strength, although yesterday gained 1.25 to 401.74 on a stronger dollar.
Lower interest rates are expected to be the driving force behind an advance
in share prices later this year, but the potential upswing will be
restricted by sluggish export markets in Europe and limited US economic
recovery.
Most analysts believe that further cuts in German interest rates will pave
the way for even lower rates in Norway, and lead to further strength in the
dollar, both beneficial for the country's export-based shares.
However, Mr Tage Haug, an analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities, cautions
that lower interest rates will not necessarily lead to Norway outperforming
Europe, since Belgium, France and Spain are more interest-rate sensitive
markets; he thinks that further reductions in German interest rates could
inspire a five per cent increase in prices.
Few analysts believe that Oslo will take off before real growth in
international export markets can be achieved, and this is not widely
expected to happen before 1994. While US recovery and a firmer dollar are
positive news for Norway, recession in Europe and Japan make it too early to
overweight a market in which most companies are raw materials producers.
'Lower interest rates provide a good, underlying basis for growth', says Ms
Mary Berg, an analyst at James Capel, 'but international demand needs to
pick up before a major upswing in Norway can be expected. Norwegian
companies have been working very hard to reduce costs and restructure, but
their Nordic competitors have benefited from higher gains from currency
devaluations than that of the krone.'
But equity investors need to be convinced that the market will not
deteriorate as it did in 1992. Last year the All-share index hit a high of
464.24 on January 17; then, due to a spate of bad news in the autumn and
turbulence in the foreign exchange markets, it plunged to a year's low of
300.04 on August 25.
Investors may be encouraged by currency factors. Norway was forced to float
the krone on December 10 and the currency has fallen by just three to four
per cent against the Ecu since then; but the Oslo market's industry index -
grouping export-based companies together with oil shares - reached a high of
728.74 on January 10 after a 1992 low of 532.43 last August 25, and has held
most of that ground since then.
Mr Klas Andersson, an analyst with Goldman Sachs, says that the effective
devaluation has been smaller than previously envisaged, and will lead to
smaller devaluation gains in terms of earnings.
In fact, what the currency float did allow was significantly lower interest
rates, and with short-term rates down to their lowest level in years,
investor focus this month has shifted to long-bonds.
The yield on the government's S-448 bond fell to 8.7 per cent from 9.3 per
cent at the end of January, the lowest level in nearly 15 years. Goldman
Sachs believes bond yields may come down to 8-8.5 per cent this year.
Some analysts believe that the rally in the bond market will filter though
to equities later this year. Several of Norway's blue-chip companies,
including Norsk Hydro, Elkem and Bergesen, have warned shareholders not to
expect substantial improvement this year and the question is whether
domestic, and foreign investors will have the confidence to look at 1994.

FT  26 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Japan remains quiet
ahead of G7 meeting
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING remained quiet ahead of this weekend's G7 finance ministers' meeting
in London, and share prices closed higher after fluctuating on technical
trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed up 108.45 at 16,907.39 having risen to the day's
high of 16,926.06 in the morning as arbitrageurs bought the index on the
overnight rise in Nikkei futures in Chicago. However, prices fell to the
day's low of 16,779.47 before receiving support from public fund buying.
Volume was 250m shares against 220m as gainers led losers by 474 to 451,
with 196 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose
2.92 to 1,278.20 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.16 to
1,025.71.
Although investors remain uncertain about corporate earnings and prospects
of economic recovery, buying by public funds has provided a support around
the 17,000 level.
With the currency market stable, exporters regained some ground: Sony rose
Y40 to Y3,920 and NEC Y9 to Y624.
Showa Shell Sekiyu, the day's most active issue, closed up Y25 at Y825 after
fluctuating in heavy trading.
The issue has plunged 45 per cent since last weekend's announcement of
Showa's Y125bn foreign exchange loss. Other oil stocks, which were
previously weak on Showa's fall, also rose.
Cable companies firmed on expectations that the government will increase
spending on telecommunications as part of an expected economic package.
Sumitomo Electric gained Y25 to Y905 and Fujikura advanced Y10 to Y528.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 5.81 to 18,057.89 in volume of 106.4m shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets produced some strong performances.
SINGAPORE rose into record territory for the third straight day, boosted by
late index buying. The Straits Times index rose 3.32 to 1,680.96 after
losses in morning and early afternoon trade.
Trade in speculative Malaysian shares fuelled market activity with the
over-the-counter Metroplex the most active, falling 7 cents to SDollars 1.01
with 23.06m traded.
TAIWAN closed at its highest level since last July, boosted by a late wave
of buying of financial shares.
The weighted index rose 107.38 or 2.7 per cent to 4,156.88, with the
financial sector up 5.3 per cent in active turnover of TDollars 40.5bn.
Banks, which led the market rally earlier in the month but fell prey to
profit-taking in recent days, closed limit-up on expectations of big stock
dividends next fiscal year.
AUSTRALIA staged a late advance on opposition suggestions of lower interest
rates after the March 13 elections, the All Ordinaries index ending 2.1
higher at 1,606.9 in turnover of ADollars 280.37m.
Brambles Industries shed 40 cents to ADollars 15.80 on marginally lower
interim net profits, and Lend Lease eased 12 cents to ADollars 14.96 in
spite of a slight rise in net profit and a higher dividend.
HONG KONG moved ahead but investors remained wary, waiting to see if
publication of the governor's reform package would be delayed to allow talks
with China on the issues. The Hang Seng Index advanced 26.19 to 6,203.88 as
turnover dipped to HKDollars 2.73bn.
KUALA LUMPUR saw late profit-taking and the composite index closed 4.61
higher at 638.83 due to gains in two major component stocks, in volume of a
record 464.0m shares. Malayan United Industries rose 50 cents or 18 per cent
to MDollars 3.22 on rumours that Hong Leong's Quek Leng Chan was buying up
the shares from the open market.
BOMBAY was unmoved by the disturbances in New Delhi, concentrating instead
on expectations that Saturday's national budget would prove favourable to
business. The BSE 30-share index rose 26 to 2,803 in light trading.
SEOUL ignored the inauguration of President Kim Young-sam and broadly-based
selling pulled the market down. The composite index fell 17.20 to 655.61.
BANGKOK lost ground amid rumours about more share manipulation cases and
heavy sales of Bangkok Bank as it announced a capital increase. The SET
index dropped 4.59 to 954.53.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark loses a little shine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK yesterday lost some of the strength it had built up against
European currencies in recent days, but there were some signs of gathering
tension within the exchange rate mechanism, writes James Blitz.
The peseta, which came under strong selling pressure against the D-Mark at
the start of the week, was looking comfortable by yesterday's close. Once
again, the Bank of Spain intervened in the market to support its currency,
holding it to a close of Pta71.93 against the D-Mark from a previous
Pta71.94.
The D-Mark lost some shine against the dollar, partly helped by expectations
of a high figure for fourth quarter GDP in the US today. The dollar closed
at DM1.6345 up from a previous DM1.6195.
Even sterling and the lira managed to shake off the gloom of recent days.
The lira closed at L964.9 against the D-Mark from a previous L985.0, helped
by a victory for Mr Amato, the Italian prime minister, in a crucial
confidence vote in the Italian parliament. Sterling also closed up a pfennig
at DM2.3375.
The immediate outlook for most currencies depends on whether Germany cuts
interest rates again. The French authorities appeared to be under a little
more pressure yesterday, with the 3-month French franc interest rate rising
to 12 1/16 per cent as the currency came close to dipping below FFr3.40.
The franc also closed slightly weaker on its divergence indicator in the
European Monetary System, to -41 per cent.
Several UK economists take the view that the prospect of lower German
inflation and the deepening recession will allow the Bundesbank to cut
interest rates very soon.
Ms Jane Edwards, international economist at Lehman Brothers in London,
believes the Bundesbank will ease aggressively from the spring. She told a
conference in London yesterday that German call money will fall below 6 per
cent by the end of this year, moving to 4 per cent in the course of 1994.
This is a far more radical view than the market is taking.
Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London, also
believes that a 50 basis point cut in official German rates is possible next
Thursday.
However, remarks yesterday by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank
Vice-President, raised speculation that policy may be on hold for longer.
'If the Bundesbank were to turn away from its stability-oriented policy,
serious consequences for the exchange rate and the level of prices could not
be ruled out,' he said.
A poorer-than-expected set of inflation figures in some German states may
also have made a cut less likely next week. 'It is the same old story,' said
Mr Jeremy Hawkins of Bank of America in London. 'At best, we are still
looking at 6 or 7 per cent interest rates in Germany by the end of the
year.'

FT  26 FEB 93 / Money Markets: Sterling futures recover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT-DATED sterling futures bounced sharply yesterday after the pound
staged a mild recovery against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges, writes
James Blitz.
Throughout the week, the March contract has been steadily bid down to
yesterday's low of 93.91 as dealers continue to assume that the pound's
weakness eliminates any chance of a cut in UK base rates.
The March contract recovered yesterday to close at 94.01, partly reflecting
sterling's rise above the the historic lows that were reached in foreign
exchange trading on Wednesday.
One London-based dealer said that it would be hard to push the contract
below 93.75, because dealers buying the contract below this level would be
assuming some tightening of monetary policy by the middle of next month.
However, another dealer suggested that the contract could easily move 50
basis points either way in the next few weeks. 'The pound is so weak that
you cannot exclude the possibility that base rates will rise in the next few
weeks,' he said.
Dealing in the cash market was relatively quiet and 3-month money again
closed at around 6 1/8 per cent. However, a very large shortage is expected
today and, according to one dealer, 'it could be pretty nasty.'
With the end of the month approaching, liquidity conditions in money markets
are always tight.
However, one dealer said that a large number of bills are due to be drawn by
corporates and institutions today, and the discount houses will have plenty
to offer the Bank of England. However, if the shortage is very large, the
Bank may be under pressure to offer a shorter-dated repurchase to ease
conditions.
European interest rate markets were quiet. German call money rose sharply to
over 9 per cent yesterday after the Bundesbank drew a large amount of
liquidity in its weekly money market operations on Wednesday.
However, the Bundesbank's move was only technical, designed to ease the
transfer to easier reserve requirements after this weekend.
The March Euromark contract closed 5 basis points higher at 91.88. The
steady drip-drip of the March French franc contract continued: it closed at
88.13, down 5 basis points on the day.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gatt expects beef export fall
to continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD BEEF exports fell by 2 to 3 per cent in 1992 and a similar decline is
likely in 1993, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade says in a report
published today.
In its annual review of international meat markets, Gatt highlights a
continuing slump in European Community beef exports, which now account for
about a quarter of the world total. The EC itself is predicting a drop of 22
per cent in beef exports this year after a 12 per cent fall in 1992. Despite
lower production, EC beef stocks ended 1992 at record levels of about 1m
tonnes.
Australia has regained the top spot among the world's beef exporters from
the EC, which is followed by the US in third place, New Zealand and Brazil.
Argentina's shipments plunged nearly 30 per cent last year because of rising
production costs and the strong currency.
'Major changes in world market shares are likely in 1993,' the report says,
predicting fresh gains by the US and Brazil at the expense of the EC and New
Zealand.
World beef and veal production is estimated to have declined by about 1 per
cent in 1992, largely because of lower output in the EC, central Europe and
the Commonwealth of Independent States. Gatt expects a further 1 to 2 per
cent slide in 1993, mostly the result of falling EC production.
The Gatt report says prospects for the international beef market are clouded
by the uncertain economic outlook and changing diets. In many countries
consumers have switched to cheaper poultry meat, which now represents a
quarter of world meat production.
In the US, per capita consumption of poultry meat, at 43 kg the highest in
the world, roughly equalled that of beef for the first time last year. In
the EC, beef consumption stagnated or fell in all countries except for Spain
and Portugal.
Import demand is set to rise substantially in Japan and other East Asian
countries, especially South Korea, but elsewhere will remain sluggish, Gatt
says.
EC exports in particular are being hit by falling demand from the
Commonwealth of Independent States.
Gatt expects beef prices to weaken further in the US but to remain firm in
East Asia and to strengthen in Europe as a result of lower EC production and
a possible rise in beef demand in central Europe and the CIS.
Gatt's Arrangement on Bovine Meat, designed to expand and liberalise world
meat trade, has 27 members (the EC counting as one) which account for about
90 per cent of world beef exports and about 60 per cent of consumption and
production.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aboriginal claim may threaten
mine project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MIM HOLDINGS, the Australian resources group, is considering a potential
claim by an aboriginal group for ownership of the site of its McArthur River
lead/zinc/silver project in the Northern Territory.
MIM has received a letter from the Northern Land Council, an aboriginal
advisory group, seeking consultations about the project on behalf of
aborigines in the territory and in northern Queensland. This follows
suggestions by the council that a legal claim for ownership of the land
might be filed unless MIM agreed to provide jobs and compensation to
aborigines claiming connection with the area.
MIM and a group of Japanese joint venturers received permission to develop
the mine last year after complying with the environmental and planning
regulations of the federal and territorial governments.
However, the status of some mining rights has been thrown into doubt by a
High Court decision last year that overthrew the legal doctrine that
Australia was terra nullius, or unoccupied, when European settlement began
in 1788. The decision created a form of 'native title' applying to
government-owned land where aboriginal groups can prove uninterrupted
occupation or a continuous close relationship.
A legal claim for ownership of McArthur River could delay development of the
mine, which is 70 per cent owned by MIM. Nippon Mining and Metals owns 15
per cent, and Mitsui, Mitsubishi Materials and Marubeni 5 per cent each.
The land council's action angered the territory's government, which claimed
that aboriginal and environmental opposition to mining has reduced
investment proposals.
Mr Shane Stone, mines and energy minister, said the threat of a land claim
against McArthur River was 'beyond the pale'. He said the project was 'too
important to become another Coronation Hill' - a gold project in the
Northern Territory that was blocked in 1991 after the federal government
accepted aboriginal claims that the site was sacred.
The territory government did not make clear how it planned to overcome the
provisions of federal race discrimination legislation.
The federal Labor government and the conservative opposition have said that
land claims should be resolved by negotiation.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold jewellery demand riding
high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WIDESPREAD RECESSION has failed to dent world demand for gold jewellery,
according to the World Gold Council, the promotional organisation supported
by producers. The industry soaked up a record 2,400 tonnes last year, 14 per
cent up on 1991.
The council estimates that total identified worldwide demand for gold in
jewellery, investments and industrial uses rose by 9 per cent to 3,057
tonnes - 'a striking increase in a year where 600 tonnes of official gold
was sold by Belgium and Dutch central banks'.
The driving forces behind the increase in jewellery demand have been the
Middle and Far Eastern markets. Demand in the Far East rose by 33 per cent
to 654 tonnes. Chinese demand for pure gold jewellery, known as Chuk Kam,
rose by 47 per cent to 250 tonnes. However, Far Eastern demand for bar and
coins was 41 per cent down at 51 tonnes.
In the developed world, trade purchases of jewellery eased by 1 per cent,
with Japan showing a fall of 17 per cent to 104.5 tonnes and the US
registering a rise of 5 per cent to 230.6 tonnes.
Mr Roger Murphy, of the council's economics service, emphasised that the
council's figures were based on identified demand, adding that there was
probably substantial un-identified demand. He expects to see 'a continued
movement of gold from West to East and with it a steady rise in demand
through 1993'.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC sets minimum fish import
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission last night set minimum import prices on white fish,
but warned that tougher measures would be taken if this did not stem the
flood of cheap imports coming into the EC and driving down prices.
The minimum prices will apply to cod, haddock, whiting and monkfish until
the end of June, and are based on the reference prices normally used to
monitor the EC fish market.
They are unlikely, therefore, to restore fully the 15 to 30 per cent drop in
white fish prices caused by this year's import surge, because prices were
drifting downwards anyway because of the industry's own structural problems
and a fall in consumption because of recession.
The move follows a vigorous campaign by Breton fishermen, who on Tuesday
partly destroyed the Paris fish market at Rungis. It has as its main target
Russian imports, as well as fish from Iceland, Norway and Poland.
'This decision should allow us to correct the disturbances caused by imports
from third countries at extraordinarily low prices,' said Mr Ioannis
Paleokrassas, the EC's environment and fisheries commissioner.
But commission officials warned that if the situation was not stabilised
quickly, the community could resort to an embargo on imports.
French fishing interests had also called for action to correct the
distortions caused by recent devaluations of sterling and the Spanish
peseta. Commission officials pointed out, however, that that form of
exchange rate compensation was no longer practicable in the EC's border-free
internal market.
'We have a single market but we do not have a single currency,' one official
said.
The commission's decision followed a vote at the EC management committee for
fisheries, made up of senior civil servants from the member states. A slight
dissident note was sounded by the UK, which abstained after failing to limit
the minimum import regime to three months, instead of the six months called
for by Brussels and the four months finally agreed.
Belgium may challenge the EC banana import regime through an appeal to the
European Court of Justice, Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene's office said,
Reuter reports from Brussels. In a statement issued after a cabinet meeting,
the government said it was considering measures to counter the regime.

gas row solution
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN AND Ukrainian leaders gather for 11th hour talks in Moscow today to
find a deal on debts and energy after Russia extended a deadline, which
expired yesterday, for cutting off natural gas supplies to Ukraine.
Mr Rem Vyakhirev, acting head of Gasprom, the state-owned gas monopoly said
that the deliveries could be cut off as early as Sunday unless Ukraine paid
world prices for 1bn cubic metres of gas it had received this year. The
postponement of the threat is designed to allow for talks beginning today
between Ukrainian prime minister, Mr Leonid Kuchma, and Mr Viktor
Chernomyrdin, the former head of Gasprom and now prime minister of Russia.
Although various figures have been provided - ranging from the world price
of Dollars 85 per 1,000 cu m to Rbs26,000 (less than Dollars 50 at present
exchange rates, including export taxes depending on which Russian official
is talking) - it is not quite clear what world prices Russia wants to charge
Ukraine.
Nor is it clear what Ukraine means when it counters that it will increase
transit fees on Russian gas exports to western Europe, 85 per cent of which
cross Ukraine. While Ukraine has quoted a transit fee of Dollars 2.2 per
1,000 cu m, Russia says this is far higher than the world average. In an
attempt to put western pressure to bear on Ukraine in turn, one Russian
official said this week that Russia plans from March 1 to charge western
customers for gas as delivered from the Russian-Ukrainian border. This would
leave it up to western customers to bully Ukraine into setting an acceptable
transit price for their gas supplies.
Interfax news agency said yesterday that Gasprom had received permission to
sell 20 per cent of its shares to the public but that foreign investors
could account for no more than 9 per cent of the company's capital. Its
articles of association as a joint-stock company are due to be registered
soon by the Justice Ministry.
Mr Viktor Kress, the governor of Russia's Siberian Tomsk region, has made a
plea for foreign investors to help rejuvenate some 800 oil wells which would
increase the western Siberian region's oil output by 2m tonnes a year to
14m. But a decision on whether to hold a tender for new oil-fields in the
region has yet to be agreed between the region and the authorities in
Moscow.
Meanwhile, attempts partly to privatise the region's Tomskneft production
company have ground to a halt, the region's privatisation chief, Mr
Alexander Petrov, said earlier this week. He said the state-owned
enterprise's managers, who want more of the company for themselves and their
workers, had gone to Moscow to lobby the federal government for better
terms.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russians meeting Espy today to
discuss grain debt defaults
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A HIGH-level delegation of Russian officials will meet US secretary of
agriculture Mike Espy today to discuss Russia's mounting grain debt defaults
and seek a solution to the credit crisis that has stalled US grain exports
to the former Soviet Union since November.
However, US grain trade groups do not expect the visit to produce a quick
solution to the credit impass.
Mr Aleskey Shokhin, first deputy prime minister of Russia, and a party to
Russia's Paris Club debt negotiations, will lead the delegation. Mr Leonid
Cheshinsky, president of the Russian domestic grain agency Roskhleboprodukt,
and Mr Oleg Klimov, president of the semi-private Exportkhleb grain-buying
agency, will accompany Mr Shokhin, as will deputy finance minister Mr Andrei
Vavilov.
The delegation will stay in Washington until next Wednesday, visiting
congress and members of the Clinton administration. The visit precedes a
meeting between Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, and Russian
foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev in Geneva on Thursday.
Mr Espy met grain trade representatives on Wednesday to discuss possible
financing alternatives in advance of the Russian visit. Mr Nelson Denlinger,
executive vice president of US Wheat Associates, said Mr Espy tried to
dispel the notion that he had arrived at a solution to the Russian credit
problem. 'I don't think there are any simple solutions on the table,' Mr
Denlinger said.
For one thing, Mr Espy has said any plan would have to be co-ordinated
through an 11 agency committee that includes the Treasury and the State
Department.
In the meeting, the North American Export Grain Association proposed that
the US form a fund to buy out Russia's bad loans and then place the country
on a longer-term loan programme. The plan, while allowing Russia to resume
grain purchases, would be expensive. It would also contrast sharply with US
Department of Agriculture staff proposals that Russia be given direct food
aid while allowing the credit arrears to mount.
'My reading of the (NAEGA) plan is, given current sentiment to cut
programmes and reduce the deficit, that it would not fly (in Washington),'
Mr Denlinger said.
CIS countries are Dollars 367.7m in arrears on US-backed grain loans. Bank
claims against the defaults have begun to rise. To date, five banks, all of
them foreign, have made claims totalling Dollars 6.7m, and the USDA has paid
out Dollars 5.6m against those claims.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: International Wheat Council
says ex-Soviet republics seeking to expand use of barter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia and other former Soviet republics in difficulty with grain payments
are seeking to expand the use of barter, according to the International
Wheat Council, writes David Blackwell. Sales have already been fixed under
the US Export Enhancement Program (EEP) - mostly in exchange for cotton from
Uzbekistan.
Australia, Canada, Finland and Turkey are thought to have held talks on
barter deals, the IWC says in its latest grain market report. The
Australians are believed to have been offered 40,000 tonnes of aluminium in
exchange for wheat.
However, with the exception of the US, the parties concerned 'are reluctant
to reveal details of any possible arrangements' as they involve price
exposure on both sides of a transaction. Traders need to cover themselves
for commodities that they are unfamiliar with.
The fact that most commodities are in plentiful supply on the international
market at relatively low prices further complicates any attempts to expand
barter trade, the IWC suggests.

Mr Charles Josselin, the French maritime affairs minister, will today hold a
meeting with the French fishing association in Rennes to discuss the
European Commission's proposals for a minimum fish pricing system, writes
Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
The news of the meeting followed renewed demonstrations from fishermen in
the Brittany and Vendee. The fishermen who have, for the past fortnight,
been protesting against the recent rise in cheap fish imports into France
culminating in the ransacking on Tuesday of the Rungis fish market near
Paris.
A group of 400 Breton fishermen yesterday staged a demonstration in Brussels
outside the building where European Community fishing officials were
discussing the minimum pricing plan. The fishermen sheltered from a light
snowfall in nearby cafes during the meeting.
There were rowdy demonstrations throughout the day at Sables d'Olonne, the
Vendee port. Local fishermen sealed off the commercial docks with a boat
blockade during the morning and protested outside local authority buildings
in the afternoon.
Another group of Vendee fishermen sealed off the Loire estuary by
Saint-Nazaire bridge and built blockades of burning tyres to block off road
access to the bridge. Meanwhile the trawlermen, who had on Wednesday
blockaded a military testing area in Les Landes, ended their protest
yesterday afternoon.

NICKEL fell sharply on the London Metal Exchange yesterday as support levels
gave way, triggering sell stops and liquidation. Three-month metal fell
through the Dollars 6,200-a-tonne level - an area where support has held
solid in recent days - and slid rapidly down. The decline occurred against a
background of steep losses in other metals, notably COPPER and ZINC. Also,
there were no fundamental reasons for nickel to be immune from the general
weakness now affecting base metals, dealers said. Three-month copper
confirmed the break below the important Dollars 2,200 level, with modest
Chinese buying around Dollars 2,180 brushed aside. New York arabica COFFEE
prices were down sharply at midsession after the market's technical bounce
to Tuesday's tumble ran out of steam. Analysts said futures garnered early
firmness from a port strike at Brazil's Santos. But such support proved
fleeting because of persistent perceptions of high supply and lessened
demand for coffee.

FT  26 FEB 93 / The Property Market: Investment Property Databank's figures
indicates hint of market improvement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS a hint of improvement in the market in January, according to the
Investment Property Databank's latest monthly figures.
January saw the lowest monthly fall in capital values recorded since last
July - by just over half a point - the result of a further outward shift in
yields and the continued decline in rental values.
Total return for January stood at 0.2 per cent, an increase from the zero
return recorded in December.
But the year-on-year results continued to fall. Rents fell by more than 10
per cent in the year to January, while capital growth and total return fell
to -8.5 per cent and -0.2 per cent, respectively.
Offices and industrials showed a relative improvement in their monthly
returns of four and five basis points respectively, while those for the
retail sector remained static, at 0.3 per cent.
The industrial sector showed the strongest monthly return, beating retails
for the first time since January 1992.
A slight deterioration in capital values, to -0.4 per cent, meant that total
return for the retail sector remained at 0.3 per cent for the month.
Office values improved by about half a point in January, representing their
highest monthly return since early 1990.

FT  26 FEB 93 / The Property Market: The Iranian connection - Vanessa
Houlder on a duo making its mark in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rotch Properties, the investment vehicle of the Iranian Tchenguiz family, is
one of the lesser-known property buyers to have emerged in the past three
years of UK recession.
Rotch, and its 50 per cent-owned sister company Wyn-Ro Properties, has
bought more than Pounds 100m of property in the past 18 months, taking its
portfolio to about Pounds 400m. It says it will sign another Pounds 40m of
deals in the next few weeks. 'We think this is the best buying opportunity
for 20 years,' says Adrian Goldsmith, a Rotch executive.
Rotch, which is ultimately owned by a family-owned company incorporated in
Panama, is run by two Tchenguiz brothers: Vincent and Robert, both in their
30s. Vincent, who used to work at Prudential Bache and Shearson Lehman
Brothers, describes himself as a financier; Robert is the deal-maker.
They started Rotch in 1982 with the help of a bank guarantee from their
father Victor Tchenguiz, a wealthy property owner who fled Iran after the
Shah's downfall in 1979. Their first purchase was a Pounds 50,000 flat in
Marble Arch, London. They concentrated on residential development until 1985
when they bought an option on an old biscuit warehouse in Hammersmith, west
London. Together with Scottish Amicable, they built a 215,000 sq ft office
development, known as Windsor Plaza.
From 1988, they switched their emphasis to investment. Their biggest deal
was the acquisition of Sea Containers House, a 420,000 sq ft building on
London's south bank. This building and several others were later absorbed by
Wyn-Ro, a company Rotch set up with Allied Lyons Pension Fund in 1989.
For a low-profile company, Rotch has demonstrated a taste for some
high-profile deals.
Their most conspicuous and (for the moment) the least successful deal was
the acquisition in mid-1991 of South Quay Plaza 3, a 210,000 sq ft building
on the waterfront in London's Docklands. Wyn-Ro paid the receivers Pounds
37m, but secured a three-year rental guarantee from the banks.
Rotch dismayed the Docklands market by offering South Quay Plaza 3 to
tenants at the (then) knock-down price of Pounds 10 a sq ft. The
acquisition, which is still unlet, is described as 'a mistake' by Vincent
Tchenguiz. His brother, however, defends it as 'the best building in the
Docklands outside Canary Wharf. We are still keen on the Docklands,' he
says.
Another prominent and probably more successful deal was the acquisition of
Lunar and Apollo House, a government-occupied building in Croydon for Pounds
46m, equivalent to a yield of 11 per cent. MEPC's decision to sell the
building (on the grounds it had no growth potential) provoked criticism from
Mr Harry Hyams, a large MEPC shareholder who thought the building had being
sold for a bargain.
Rotch has also bought a string of smaller buildings in the past 18 months,
in places as diverse as Dover, St Pancras, Brighton, Harrow, Plymouth,
Liverpool, Birmingham and Barry, south Wales.
The aim of these acquisitions was to buy high-yielding property let to
blue-chip tenants, the rental income of which would cover the debt. Tax
factors also played a big part in these deals. Rotch believes that the tax
benefits associated with the depreciation of plant and machinery are often
undervalued.
The twin constraints on Rotch's acquisition programme are the difficulty of
finding the right buildings and obtaining finance. 'If the product and
source of funds were there we would do another Pounds 100m of deals,' says
Vincent Tchenguiz.
The company's principle banker is Sanwa; GE Capital and Norwich Union have
also been prominent sources of long-term funds. Rotch would like to attract
more institutional funding.
'We are looking to refinance our borrowings through institutions rather than
banks,' says Vincent Tchenguiz. He would also like to raise some equity from
the institutions and plans to seek a stock market listing in a couple of
years.
Rotch borrows up to 100 per cent of the cost of its acquisitions, but it is
unconcerned about the high level of debt it is amassing. 'We are not worried
about our gearing. You could be 200 per cent geared provided you have cash
flow to support your debt,' says Robert Tchenguiz.
But Rotch's high gearing has resulted in the shrinkage of its net asset
value during the steep downturn in the property market over the past few
years. The combined net asset value of Rotch and Wyn-Ro was Pounds 143m in
the year to May 1991. The Tchenguiz brothers say it has now fallen to Pounds
42m.
This valuation of its portfolio underestimates the true value of the
buildings' income streams in the view of Vincent Tchenguiz, who is a
critical of UK valuation techniques. He believes that once the current phase
of forced sales is over, property yields could fall by between 30-40 per
cent.
Property has lurched from a period of being over-valued to a period of being
under-valued, he says. 'Every period of exaggeration is followed by another
period of exaggeration.'

FT  26 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: Currency debt re-rating threat hits
Italian futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN government bond futures fell steeply yesterday afternoon on news
that Moody's Investor Services, the US credit rating agency, had placed
Italy's long-term foreign currency debt rating of Aa3 under review for a
possible downgrade.
Moody's last reduced Italy's foreign currency debt rating to Aa3 from Aa1 in
August.
Earlier in the day, the Italian government bond market had been supported by
news that the government of Prime Minister Giuliano Amato had survived its
second vote of confidence in the space of three weeks.
Late in the day, the Liffe March BTP future traded at 95.51 on volume of
19,343 contracts, down from a high of 96.50 in the early afternoon, and
below the previous day's close of 95.86.
Moody's said it had taken this action because of two concerns, firstly
because of the lack of progress in reducing the country's public sector
deficit, and secondly, because efforts to improve the fiscal balance have
been impeded by the deepening political crisis.
Moody's also lowered the domestic currency rating of Enel, the electricity
authority, to Aa3 from Aa1 and also placed the rating under review for
further downgrades. Enel debt is guaranteed by the Italian government. A
total of Dollars 62.5bn worth of debt is affected.
Meanwhile, the Bank of Italy said it planned to change the auction system
for government securities. Mr Bruno Bianchi, head of the central bank's
monetary and financial division, said the revised system would be
computer-based in order to shorten the time of the auction. The new system
could go into effect next year.
Currently, banks participating in the securities auctions must send a telex
to the central banks to make their bids.
UK GOVERNMENT bonds rose steadily to close at the day's highs, supported by
a slight recovery in the pound from its record lows. The long end rose
between  1/4 and  1/2 point. The gain at the shorter end was limited to
1/32 point.
The Liffe March long gilt future rose to the day's high of 103 9/16 late in
the day, up from the previous close of 103 1/16 , in volume of 25,902
contracts.
Trading was quiet and dealers said the market appeared to be stuck in a
range of about one point on either side of current levels. They added that
the market remained at risk on the downside, due to the continued
vulnerability of sterling.
US TREASURY prices gave up their mid-day gains to turn broadly lower
yesterday afternoon.
The decline followed news that Daiwa Securities America, the US arm of the
Japanese securities firm, has been banned from placing customer bids at
treasury auctions for three months. The news prompted speculation that other
Japanese brokerage firms might liquidate their US security holdings. Daiwa
can still bid on its own account.
Yields on the treasury's bellwether 30-year bond inched back towards the 7
per cent level after moving lower in at mid-day. The long bond rose about
1/2 point at mid-session, but in late trading it was quoted  5/32 lower at
102 7/8 yielding 6.892 per cent. On Monday, the long bond broke through the
7 per cent barrier for the first time in 15 years.
At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged to yield
3.960 per cent.
The Federal Reserve entered the open market to add liquidity to the banking
system by arranging four-day system repurchase agreements. Fed Funds were
trading at 3 per cent, the Fed's perceived target for the rate, when the
intervention occurred.
The market shrugged off news that unemployment claims rose 4,000 in the week
ended February 13 to 325,000. Expectations had centred on a rise of 8,000 to
10,000 for initial weekly claims.
GERMAN government bonds were little changed in the cash market late in the
afternoon but the long Bund futures were slightly firmer. The Liffe March
bund future rose to the day's high of 94.67 in moderate volume of 45,008
contracts, up from the previous day's close of 94.52.
Dealers said that yesterday's inflation data from the western German state
of Baden-Wurttemberg had dampened hopes of a credit policy change by the
Bundesbank at its fortnightly meeting next Thursday.
Consumer prices in Baden-Wurttemberg, the third of western Germany's four
largest states to release inflation figures for the month, climbed 0.5 per
cent in the month to mid-February and rose 4.1 per cent.
The latest figures represent a mild slowdown from January's consumer price
index monthly rate of 1.2 per cent and the annual rate of 4.2 per cent. But
the figures continue to show an inflation rate above the 4 per cent which
the Bundesbank regards as too high.

FT  26 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Canadian issues rally from Mulroney
resignation fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Canadian dollar market yesterday remained a focus for international
borrowers, as government bond prices bounced back from news of prime
minister Brian Mulroney's resignation the day before.
The Republic of Austria raised CDollars 300m through a 10-year issue, while
Rabobank issued CDollars 125m of bonds over five years.
Both deals reflect the good opportunities offered by the Canadian dollar
swap market, allowing borrowers to switch to a floating-rate liability at an
advantageous level.
Austria's issue was thought to have equated to an all-in cost of around 25
basis points below Libor.
Strong demand in Canada for fixed-rate mortgages explains the continuing
opportunity for international borrowers to find attractive levels in the
swap market.
Canadian government bond prices advanced after the set-back on Wednesday,
with the yield spread between the Canadian and US bond markets tightening
from 142 basis points to 135 basis points.
Austria's issue was said by banks involved in the transaction to have been
aggressively priced, although some reported that the bonds had sold well
regardless.
The Rabobank issue was modelled closely on a CDollars 125m five-year issue
brought earlier in the week for the City of Vienna.
That was offered at a yield 47 basis points above government bonds, while
Rabobank's bonds were launched with a yield spread of 45 basis points.
Meanwhile, Royal Insurance became the latest UK insurer to come to the
sterling bond market, raising Pounds 100m through a subordinated 10-year
issue.
It follows Confederation Life, which raised Pounds 100m through a similar
10-year transaction last month.
Royal said the issue, which follows a Pounds 76m convertible at the end of
last year, was intended to extend the maturity of its debt, a third of which
now had a life of 10 years or more. The 175 basis point spread over gilts
compared with a 150 basis point spread from Confederation Life.
Royal said it had no need to borrow for a longer period, though observers
pointed out that a long-dated issue would have added considerably to the
company's borrowing costs.
Bass, the UK brewer, raised Dollars 300m through an issue in the US domestic
market. The 6 5/8 per cent notes, expected to be rated A-1 by Moody's and
A-plus by Standard &amp; Poor's, yield 63 basis points over comparable US
Treasuries.

FT  26 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Mortgage lender places its
faith in securities - Yesterday's pounds 105m issue by the troubled National
Home Loans achieves a number of important goals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Home Loans' Pounds 105m issue of securities backed by
non-performing mortgages yesterday achieves a number of important goals for
the troubled mortgage lender, which had to be rescued by its banks last
year.
As well as removing a further chunk of mortgages from its balance sheet, NHL
will use the proceeds to repay more expensive bank and bond debt. The deal
will leave NHL with a mortgage book of just Pounds 325m, after securitising
a total of more than Pounds 2bn of its mortgages.
The mortgage-backed issue, launched yesterday by Goldman Sachs, consists of
two senior tranches and a large subordinated tranche, providing
collateralisation, which is kept by NHL. The senior tranches pay interest of
85 basis points over the London interbank offered rate - for an estimated
one-year average life - and 110 basis points above Libor for a two-year
average life.
Although this margin looks high compared with spreads on ordinary
mortgage-backed securities with a similar average life, which are currently
trading at 35 to 40 basis points over Libor in the secondary market, the
cost savings for NHL are substantial.
When the company was forced to reschedule its debt last year, its financing
costs rose dramatically. NHL is currently paying interest of 200 basis
points over Libor on its Pounds 400m of bank debt. Prior to the
restructuring of its debt last year, the company was paying only 30 basis
points over Libor.
NHL is also paying 200 basis points over dollar Libor on its dollar bonds,
which were also rescheduled. Earlier this month, NHL shelved plans to
reschedule its D-Mark bonds.
Since last year, the company has generated cash to repay Pounds 140m. Its
main source of cash is now the vehicles created to issue previous
mortgage-backed offerings; any surplus revenue not needed to pay interest on
those deals is channelled back into the mortgage originator. Under the terms
of its debt restructuring last June, all banks and bondholders received
equal payments of the Pounds 140m paid in debt paid down, reducing the total
level of debt to Pounds 560.
The latest financing serves another function; the maturity of the securities
matches the life of the mortgages.
The severity of National Home Loans' problems in the last few years were
exacerbated by the company's failure to match the maturity of its assets and
liabilities, by funding long-dated mortgages in the money-markets.
NHL was in the process of renegotiating its syndicated bank facilities when
money-market funding dried up suddenly, as investors withdrew funds in the
wake of the BCCI collapse. This resulted in the steep increase in cost of
funding, which it is now attempting to reverse.
Last year, NHL recording pre-tax losses of 146m, but Mr Jonathan Perry, the
group's executive chairman, predicted a 'significantly reduced loss' in 1993
and a future return to profitability.
Although the company has managed to repay some of its debt, NHL is not
generating any new business, and with only a small mortgage book left, is
little more than a shell company.
So far, Barclays and the TSB are the only UK banks to have securitised any
mortgages, but UK banks and building societies are currently studying the
market. There is a strong incentive for banks to remove non-performing
mortgages from their balance sheets, since they require twice as much
capital.

FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Renison falls to ADollars 10m in
first half

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RENISON Goldfields, the Australian mineral sands, tin, gold and copper mine
which is 40 per cent owned by Hanson of the UK, yesterday posted a fall in
net profits to ADollars 10.35m (USDollars 7.21m) for the first half to
December, from ADollars 23.54m a year earlier, Reuter reports from Sydney.
The group also said it would have difficulty matching the profits in the
second half.
Sales advanced to ADollars 328.9m from ADollars 299m; earnings per share
fell to 5.2 cents from 11.9 cents; and the interim dividend is being halved
to 2.5 cents. Mr Campbell Anderson, managing director, said: 'The company
does not anticipate any significant market recovery in the second half.'
He said that, to contain operating costs, plant rationalisation in mineral
sands might require a limited write-down of existing plant and equipment.
He said the first-half result was disappointing and reflected mainly
depressed conditions in most of Renison's principal commodity markets.
Mr Anderson said US dollar gold prices were below those of a year ago, and
the price improvement experienced in copper and tin early in the half year
proved to be short-lived.

BRAMBLES Industries, the diversified Australian transport group, yesterday
blamed economic conditions in Europe and the US for a 0.7 per cent fall in
net profit to ADollars 88m (USDollars 59.8m) for the first half to
end-December. Sales fell 10 per cent to ADollars 1.3bn.
Mr Gary Pemberton, chief executive, said the result 'fell short of
expectations', mainly because of reduced demand for waste processing in the
US and a lower UK contribution.
Mr Pemberton said prospects for the second half were difficult to predict,
but 'any reasonable reading of overseas economic conditions would demand
caution'.
He said Brambles' full-year result would be 'particularly sensitive' to the
state of the US economy, where the newly established Chep USA pallet
business recently won a big contract with Campbell Soup, the US food group.
Brambles said the contribution from Australian operations slipped slightly
from last year, but added that the economy had showed some signs of recovery
before pre-election jitters set in after the New Year. Some Australian
businesses contributed improved trading profits, but the economy continued
to provide a difficult trading environment for most of the company's
industrial service activities.
In Europe, the group's new contracting, records management and forklifts
businesses contributed to a slight improvement in trading profits, although
crane and construction-related operations were 'disappointing.'
Mr Pemberton said UK trading conditions were tough. The effects of high
interest rates and rising unemployment were most severe on the Cleanaway and
GKN-Chep joint ventures.
The group said the interim dividend would be maintained at 30 cents, fully
franked.

THE Japanese business environment will remain severe for most of this year.
Asahi Glass, the country's leading glassmaker, warned yesterday when it
reported a 33.5 per cent fall in ordinary income for the year to the end of
December.
Asahi Glass' sales fell by 1 per cent to Y1,011bn (Dollars 8bn), operating
income fell by 46.9 per cent to Y25bn, ordinary income was cut to Y40bn, and
net income declined by 44.6 per cent to Y20.4bn.
The company's consolidated sales rose by 5 per cent to Y1,316bn, but its
operating income fell by 32 per cent to Y42bn and net income declined by
Y35.6 per cent to Y24bn.
Asahi Glass said it was pressing ahead with a three-pronged restructuring
programme, to cut costs, improve co-ordination between its Japanese and
overseas subsidiaries and put more emphasis on more sophisticated, higher
value-added products.
The glassmaker has been badly hit by a fall in demand from the Japanese car
and electronics industries and the stagnant construction sector.

FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Top two at Showa Shell to quit
over losses

THE president and chairman of Showa Shell Sekiyu, the Japanese oil refiner
and distributor 50 per cent owned by Royal Dutch/Shell, are resigning to
take responsibility for Y125bn (Dollars 1.07bn) of so far unrealised foreign
exchange futures losses which the company revealed last weekend
Mr Takeshi Henmi, president, and Mr Kiyoshi Takahashi, chairman, will step
down after steps have been taken to ensure that the foreign exchange losses
will be covered, the company announced yesterday.
Mr Henmi will also be resigning his post as vice-chairman of the Petroleum
Association of Japan.
The Shell group has already said it will send Mr Neil Gaskell, head of
investments, to the board of the Japanese company. Currently, Shell has one
representative on Showa Shell's board.
Shell, which made a provision of Pounds 131m (Dollars 183m) to cover the
currency losses in the fourth quarter, announced yesterday it would make a
further provision of Pounds 65m in the first quarter.
Mr John Jennings, Shell group managing director, said the currency
speculation was a 'gross contravention of the company's internal procedures
and practices.'
He said the company was reviewing whether to tighten up its rules that
govern the activities of associate companies. Shell is also looking at
further disciplinary measures at Showa Shell. One executive in the treasury
division has also resigned and another has been moved to another part of the
company, while the manager in charge of treasury operations has been
dismissed. Executives and auditors will also surrender their bonuses.
Showa Shell Sekiyu expects to incur losses of Y125bn on dollar futures
trading conducted by a small group in the company's finance department.
The group speculated in 1989 that the dollar would rise and continued to
roll over futures contracts over four years, in breach of company rules.
The company said yesterday it planned to cover the losses by selling assets,
mainly stocks, and by making a charge against profits. For 1993, it expects
to cover Y70bn of losses through asset sales of Y50bn and an extraordinary
charge of Y20bn.
Showa Shell has already moved to limit the losses by capping the exchange
rate at which it will buy dollar futures, it said.
Over a period of about four years, the group in the treasury department took
contracts to buy the dollar at a future date at an average rate of Y145.
During that time, however, the dollar fell to about Y125 on average, and
Showa Shell's losses snowballed.
Depending on moves in the currency market the losses could be as high as
Y160bn.
The futures trading continued unknown to top management as the group
postponed settlement of their contracts so that, while the losses
multiplied, nothing appeared in the company's accounts. Japanese accounting
rules do not require the disclosure of losses unless they are actually
realised.
Yesterday, the company also announced a 12 per cent drop in profits for the
year to December 31. Pre-tax profits fell to Y38.03bn from Y43.39bn the year
before. Sales slipped 3 per cent to Y1,565bn from Y1,617bn. The Showa Shell
figures did not include a provision for the foreign exchange futures losses.
Showa Shell said that the main reason behind the fall in profits was the
slide in oil prices in Japan coupled with a rise in costs, mainly relating
to transport.
Although oil prices fell, the volume of sales increased and this added
significantly to domestic costs, the company said.

CONTINENTAL Insurance, the Japanese arm of US casualty insurer Continental
Corporation, yesterday announced it would withdraw from the Japanese market
in September.
The move is part of Continental's restructuring of its overseas network
after facing losses from hurricane damage and the costs of reinstating
catastrophe reinsurance.
It may trigger similar decisions among US casualty insurers facing huge
claims for damages caused by hurricanes Andrew and Iniki. Japan's
tightly-regulated insurance market has also been a barrier for foreign
insurers, which find it difficult to crack traditional relationships between
Japanese business and their insurance companies.
Continental has about 30,000 contract holders in Japan, and its premium
income totalled Y1.2bn (Dollars 10m) during the year to March last year,
ranking eighth among 33 foreign insurance companies in Japan.
The Tokyo arm of Assicurazioni Generali, a leading Italian casualty
insurance company which started its Japanese operations in 1991, will take
over Continental's operations and contracts. Continental's 50 employees are
also expected to be transferred to Assicurazioni.

FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Big turnround in shipbuilding
boosts Daewoo

<TEXT>
DAEWOO, South Korea's fourth-largest conglomerate, yesterday reported a
10-fold increase in net profits for 1992, mainly due to improvements in its
securities and shipbuilding operations.
Net earnings for Daewoo, which consists of 22 subsidiaries, rose to
Won298.2bn (Dollars 370m) from Won28.4bn in 1991. Sales increased by 25 per
cent to Won20,000bn.
The results were encouraging for Daewoo, which has had slim profit margins
in the last few years due to losses in its key industries. Profitability had
also suffered from a mounting debt burden, with high-interest short-term
loans accounting for about one-third of outstanding borrowings in 1991.
Daewoo Securities reported a sharp increase in earnings, which climbed to
Won55bn from Won1.3bn. This reflected increased brokerage activity as the
Seoul bourse posted its first annual gain in three years. Turnover for the
firm rose by 68 per cent to Won380bn.
Daewoo Shipbuilding, which is unlisted, posted the biggest profits among the
group companies with earnings of Won211bn, a 167 per cent increase over the
year before. Sales rose by 43 per cent to Won1,550bn.
The sharp profit increase at the shipbuilding unit was due to
rationalisation and a rise in orders. The company also diversified into
vehicle production last year and reported good sales for its range of
mini-cars and vans.
The results represent a dramatic turnround for Daewoo Shipbuilding, which
suffered huge losses in the late 1980s and had to be rescued from possible
bankruptcy in 1989 with a Won400bn government loan.
As part of the rescue package, the government ordered Daewoo Shipbuilding to
merge with Daewoo Heavy Industries, traditionally one of the group's
strongest units, by the end of 1994 to improve its financial stability.
Sales and earnings at Daewoo Heavy Industries, a machinery manufacturer,
declined in 1992 after three years of growth.
Earnings fell by 44 per cent to Won10.5bn, while sales dropped by 10 per
cent to Won904.7bn. The decrease was blamed on sluggish domestic industrial
investment and a downturn in construction.

1.6%

LEND LEASE, the Australian life insurance and property group, yesterday
announced a 1.6 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 111m (USDollars
79m) for the six months to the end of December.
The result included a sharply higher contribution from financial services
activities, offsetting a further decline in property earnings, which fell
from 32 per cent of net profit to 27 per cent.
Mr Stuart Hornery, chairman, said the group expected to exceed last year's
full-year net profit of ADollars 195.3m. The interim dividend was raised
from 32 cents to 33 cents, fully franked.
The group said retail financial services contributed ADollars 75m to net
profit, compared with ADollars 56m in the previous comparable six months.
The result included a dividend of ADollars 13m from Australian Eagle Life,
which was acquired last year.
Lend Lease said the downward trend in profits from property development,
construction and management was believed to have stabilised. The property
services division earned ADollars 43m before tax, compared with ADollars
51m.
The group said it expected strong growth in the contribution from management
of corporate superannuation funds. Premium income from corporate
superannuation rose to ADollars 751mn from ADollars 340m during the period.

<TEXT>
SHOUGANG Corporation, the acquisitive mainland Chinese iron and steel maker,
has purchased 25.12 per cent of Eastern Century, a Hong Kong-based metals
and minerals trader, for HKDollars 164.2m (USDollars 21.2m).
This is Shougang's second foray into the Hong Kong market - in October it
bought a controlling interest in Tung Wing Steel, a steel trader and
distributor - and follows acquisitions as far afield as Peru and California.
The company, also known as Capital Steel, is believed to be in the bidding
for Overseas Trust Bank, which has been put up for sale by the Hong Kong
government.
Eastern Century was listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange in April last
year. Its main business is the trading of manganese ore and manganese
ferro-alloys - essential raw materials for steel making.
Last year it went into a mainland venture for the production of manganese
ferro-alloys when it established Xinyu Far East Ferro Manganese and Shanghai
Shenjia Ferro-Alloys.
Shougang, with headquarters in Beijing, published its financial results to
coincide with the deal.
Last year, it earned pre-tax profits of Yn3.2bn (Dollars 555.5m) on turnover
of Yn13.4bn - the highest profit before tax of China's top 500 national
companies. Fixed assets were valued at Yn30bn.
Mr Chan Chun Keung, chairman of Eastern Century, said: 'The injection of
Shougang's capital, expertise in technology and management will further the
group's interest in the People's Republic.'
After the deal, Mr Chan's shareholding in Eastern Century, will fall to
28.28 per cent from 45.98 per cent, and that of Deeside International, a
French investor, will fall from 16.61 per cent to 5.79 per cent.

EARNINGS at Iscor, South Africa's largest steel producer, dropped by 27 per
cent in the six months to December as a higher portion of sales were
exported while dollar prices were weak.
Although turnover rose by 5.8 per cent to R4.3bn (Dollars 1.37bn) from
R4.05bn a year earlier, weak export prices eroded profit margins.
Pre-tax profits fell 18.4 per cent to R307m, from R376m, despite the
benefits from the rand depreciating by more than 10 per cent against the
dollar in the second half of 1992.
Iscor was also helped by a reduction in financing costs, the result of lower
interest rates and strict cash management.
Attributable profits fell 27 per cent to R125m, from R171m, while earnings
per share dropped to 6.7 cents, from 9.2 cents. The interim dividend was cut
by one-third to 2 cents a share from 3 cents.
Total steel tonnage sold during the year fell by 1.8 per cent, with domestic
sales falling by 9.9 per cent. The shortfall was made up by a 6.5 per cent
increase in exports, which rose to 53.3 per cent of total sales volumes from
49.1 per cent in 1991.
As an austerity measure, capital expenditure was reduced to R267m from
R393m, with only essential replacements and maintenance taking place.
Iscor predicted a similar level of earnings for the second half. The
domestic market is not expected to improve, and dollar prices of exports are
expected to remain weak. Offsetting this will be benefits from lower
inflation and interest rates in South Africa.

FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: An unpromising corporate
couple's marriage still flies - Nikki Tait examines the partnership between
American International Group and International Lease Finance Corp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE world of corporate marriages, a large, conservative insurance group
and go-go aircraft leasing business would seem an unpromising couple. But,
two-and-a-half years after New York-based American International Group and
California's International Lease Finance Corporation tied the knot, the
sceptics have fallen conspicuously silent.
Yesterday, announcing annual results, AIG noted a 'record' year for ILFC.
The achievement was made all the more remarkable by ghastly airline industry
conditions and turmoil beseting ILFC's Shannon-based rival, GPA.
The results are only the latest outward sign of ILFC's success: its
portfolio has doubled to over 200 jets during the past 30 months, while a
Dollars 4.1bn order for 82 new aircraft, placed last December, was one of
the few happy moments enjoyed by aircraft manufacturers recently .
Since matters are seldom simple in any leasing business, can business really
be as good as it looks ? And, if yes, how has the curious coupling to an
insurance colossus helped?
Scepticism abounded when AIG's Dollars 1.26bn purchase of ILFC was announced
in June 1990. AIG, one of the world's biggest commercial insurers, is
renowned for financial discipline, firm overseas links, and a sharp-tongued
chief executive, Mr Maurice 'Hank' Greenberg.
ILFC, by contrast, is a corporate stripling. It was born 20 years ago, when
two Los Angeles-based college friends, Steven Udvar-Hazy and Louis Gonda,
acquired a DC-8 and leased it to a Mexican airline. When AIG offered to buy,
ILFC employed just 25 people and had posted 1989 profits of Dollars 61.2m
after-tax. Given the cyclical character of the airline business and
questions about residual aircraft values, Wall Street wondered if Mr
Greenberg had taken leave of his senses.
From ILFC's viewpoint, the desire for corporate parentage was simple: it
knew capital would be needed to expand its business and build up the jet
portfolio. But it feared Wall Street would be skittish about the airline
industry at the very moment when money was most in demand. 'AIG, in one
clean sweep, became our equity source,' says the company today.
ILFC's appeal to AIG was a little more subtle. 'AIG felt their domestic
insurance operations would not grow as quickly as our business,' Mr
Udvar-Hazy explains. 'By augmenting their financial services division with a
company which had fast-growing earnings they could stabilise that end of
their business.'
Analysts make the point a little differently. 'ILFC should not be viewed as
part of AIG's basic insurance or even financial services businesses, but
rather as an investment vehicle for a large company in a declining interest
rate environment,' suggested a recent Salomon Brothers circular.
This 'investment' aspect to the marriage seems to have been borne out by the
minimal operational integration over the past two years. ILFC remains firmly
planted on the west coast, a continent away from AIG's headquarters,
employing just 43 people. The lessor's top management has stayed in place.
And contact between the two businesses is limited to top-level executives.
'They've had many opportunities to put a financial watchdog here . . .
that's never been done,' says Mr Udvar-Hazy. 'So long as we meet the
financial targets that have been established, we're effectively an
autonomous subsidiary.'
To keep the marriage sweet, ILFC had to perform, and AIG had to provide,
financial security. AIG infused Dollars 125m of additional equity into the
business at the time of the purchase and has committed another Dollars 200m,
the last tranche coming in the final quarter of 1992.
To alleviate its own shareholders' concerns, AIG made clear it would not
underpin any of ILFC's debts, which run to over Dollars 4bn.
But the solid corporate parentage still encouraged some upgrading of ILFC's
debt rating. Moody's, for example, raised its rating of the senior debt by
one notch to a2, and the commercial paper to Prime-1, its highest rating.
ILFC's ability to perform in the current market is more surprising, given
all the red ink in the airline industry and the fact that a glut of aircraft
means lease rates are soft.
Mr Udvar-Hazy's response is that any airline leasing business becomes a
financing source for carriers in the tough times, and the lessor's
credit-worthiness is all-important. 'Airline balance sheets are hurting,' he
says. 'So those carriers that do need aircraft generally have to resort to
off-balance sheet financing, using someone else's financial statements.'
He adds: 'It's true we've had pressure on lease rates, but that has been
more than offset by the lower cost of financing. We may have seen a 10 to 15
per cent erosion of lease rates, but we've probably had a 20 to 25 per cent
decrease in our borrowing costs. In 1992, ILFC had the highest core leasing
margins that we've had in 20 years.'
But what about the reliability of airline payments and the danger that
aircraft can be tied up in bankruptcy or administration processes?
Mr Udvar-Hazy's response is more pragmatic. He notes all ILFC aircraft are
owned 'free and clear' - that is, without the company's debt-providers
having any mortgage interest on the aircraft themselves - and argues that
this provides flexibility vis-a-vis customers.
There is a firm policy of pulling back aircraft from troubled lessees at the
first opportunity. As a result, 86 per cent of the fleet is leased outside
the US, up from 60 per cent, and only one aircraft is operated by a bankrupt
US carrier - by TWA.
But business can still be nerve-wracking. 'We beat the administrator at Air
Europe by nine minutes,' remembers Mr Udvar-Hazy. 'We had four aircraft
leased there, and we filed our default notice and court papers just ahead of
the administrator. We got our aircraft out of there in 24 hours, but some
people had aircraft stuck at Gatwick for 13 months.'
As for profits, ILFC made Dollars 139.7m before tax in 1991, against Dollars
123m in the previous 13-month period. In the first nine months of 1992, the
figure rose to Dollars 165.3m, against Dollars 110m in 1991. But the company
changed its depreciation policies in 1992, writing down the value of
aircraft more slowly. This lowered the depreciation charge - and bucked
profits - to the tune of Dollars 28.4m in the first nine months of 1992.
Perhaps the most interesting question is how long ILFC can continue on this
path? Mr Udvar-Hazy acknowledges that, once the company has built up a
portfolio of 325 to 375 jets - that is by the mid-1990s - the dynamics will
change.
'I don't think we can handle 400 or more aircraft, the way we're set up now
in terms of administrative support', he says.
Growth, he adds, should continue as more wide-bodied aircraft enter the
portfolio. But, unless the business is radically restructured, the rate will
probably slow.
But Mr Ed Matthews, head of AIG's financial services division, discourages
the notion that ILFC will have then outlasted its usefulness to the insurer.
'ILFC's future rate of growth should be at least equal to AIG's,' he claims,
'which, we've said, should be 15 per cent or better.'

FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Japan eases broking and banking
restrictions

JAPAN'S ministry of finance yesterday announced specific rules on easing of
the barrier between the country's banks and securities industries.
The Japanese government last year decided the broad outline of rule changes
in the financial markets, which come into effect in April. The banks and
brokerages will then be able to enter some areas of each other's businesses
through subsidiaries.
The details, which are expected to be approved by the cabinet today, lays
out the conditions such as costs and rules concerning 'firewall'
restrictions between the parent company and subsidiary.
Banking subsidiaries of brokerages will need minimum capital of Y2bn, while
Y10bn will be required to set up an underwriting brokerage. Last year's
package allows banks' affiliates to issue but not to market convertible and
warrant bonds and to deal in straight bonds. Banks will be kept out of stock
trading for the indefinite future.
The new rules will allow banks to deal in commercial paper, certificates of
deposit placed overseas, housing loan trust certificates and card loan
trusts. Rule changes which place such products as 'securities' under the
Securities and Exchange Law, and are expected to bolster secondary markets
especially that of asset backed securities.
Bangkok Bank, Thailand's largest commercial bank, said yesterday its board
had approved a doubling of the company's registered capital to Bt20bn
(Dollars 788m )from Bt10bn, writes Victor Mallet in Bangkok.
'Whether we're going to call up the Bt10bn depends entirely on the bank's
lending position,' said Mr Piti Sithi-Amnuai, executive vice-chairman.
Bangkok Bank also predicted net profits would rise to Bt12.3bn in 1993, to
Bt14.9bn in 1994 and Bt16.5bn in 1995. Last year, its net profits rose 45.3
per cent to Bt10.54bn.

loss

<TEXT>
DEN DANSKE BANK reported a loss of DKr1.7bn (Dollars 274m) in 1992, against
a profit of DKr1.22bn in the previous 12 months, but the board expects an
improvement this year. Profits on core operations rose from DKr334m to
DKr702m.
The bank displayed its confidence in the future by proposing to maintain
unchanged the dividend of DKr12 a share. Continued high provisions and a
large loss on the valuation of the securities portfolio pulled down the 1992
performance.
Loss provisions increased from DKr2.88bn to DKr2.94bn, but were considerably
lower in both years that in 1990, when they peaked at DKr 4.25bn. The value
of the group's shares and bonds portfolio fell by DKr1.03bn.
The downturn in the economy of the Faeroe Islands contributed to the group's
loss. Foroya Bank, in which Danske owns 81 per cent, made a loss of DKr395m
and had to be recapitalised by Danske.
The bank's equity capital and reserves declined from DKr20.7bn to DKr18.3bn,
but total capitalisation, including tier 2 capital, was virtually unchanged
at DKr27.6bn.
As the balance sheet was reduced to DKr336.7bn from DKr363.4bn, the capital
adequacy ratio increased from 10.2 to 11.0 per cent.
An independent report has criticised Norwegian authorities for failing to
stop Norway's biggest insurance firm, UNI Storebrand, from launching a
disastrous raid on Swedish rival Forsakrings Skandia.
A commission led by former supreme court judge Erling Sandene said the
Finance Ministry and the Banking, Insurance and Securities Commission should
have blocked UNI purchases of Skandia shares - which later crashed in value.

AMERICAN International Group yesterday reported after-tax profits of Dollars
458.9m in the fourth quarter of 1992, up from Dollars 399.8m in the same
period of 1991. The figures included realised capital gains of Dollars 13.2m
and Dollars 10.3m respectively, writes Nikki Tait in New York.
The quarter's results take AIG's net profits total for the year to Dollars
1.66bn, against Dollars 1.55bn in 1991. The 1992 figure includes realised
capital gains of Dollars 64.2m, up from Dollars 60.7m in the 1991, and a
Dollars 31.9m boost from accounting changes.
The insurer noted that, like most of the industry, it had been badly hit by
catastrophe losses last year - to the tune of over Dollars 190m  - but
attributed the results to the spread of its business.
For the year overall, AIG's general insurance division produced operating
profits of Dollars 1.12bn, a decline of 9.9 per cent from 1991's Dollars
1.25bn. Feeling the impact of catastrophe losses, the underwriting deficit
rose from Dollars 4.8m to Dollars 195m, while net investment income
increased from Dollars 1.16bn to Dollars 1.25bn.
On the life insurance side, operating profits rose from Dollars 561.8m to
Dollars 667.4m, while the financial services division overall made an
operating profit of Dollars 346.4m, up from Dollars 222.2m.

<TEXT>
JC PENNEY, one of the largest department store and catalogue retailers in
the US, registered a sharp improvement in final-quarter results for 1992-93,
with the after-tax profits reaching Dollars 375m.
The figure, for the three months to end-January, was scored on sales of
Dollars 6.08bn, up from Dollars 5.37bn in the previous year. In the final
quarter of 1991-92, the Texas-based retailer recorded after-tax profits of
Dollars 37m, but this lowly figure came after net restructuring charges of
Dollars 264m.
The results take Penney's full-year profits to Dollars 777m after tax, and
sales to Dollars 18bn. In the previous year, there was a net profit of
Dollars 80m after restructuring and accounting-related charges of Dollars
448m.
J. C. Penney's shares rose strongly on the quarter's figures, adding Dollars
2 3/8 at Dollars 78 1/4 .
The company said the improvements last year had been spread across all of
its main merchandise divisions - including womens and menswear,
childrenswear, home furnishings, and catalogue. It also said early spring
merchandise sales in the current year boded well.

PEOPLES Jewellers, the Canadian jewellery chain forced into court protection
by a 1980s acquisition spree in the US, has disclosed details of numerous
discrepancies in its financial statements and accepted the resignation of
its long-serving chief executive. The 230-store chain also plans to seek
court permission to solicit bids from prospective buyers for its entire
business or for specific assets.
Mr Irving Gerstein, whose family owns about 86 per cent of Peoples' shares,
has resigned as chairman and chief executive. The company said Mr Gerstein,
who will remain a director, is putting together a restructuring or
acquisition proposal with 'independent sources of financing'.
Peoples filed for bankruptcy protection in December, following similar
action by Zale Corp, the largest jewellery chain in the US, in which Peoples
had a 47 per cent stake.
Peoples, in partnership with Swarovski International of Switzerland, bought
control of Zale in 1986 in a USDollars 650m leveraged buy-out engineered by
junk-bond pioneer Mr Michael Milken.
Peoples said yesterday that an examination of its books by auditors Deloitte
&amp; Touche haduncovered, among other things, an unfunded shortfall in the
executive pension plan and an unauthorised purchase for cash of almost
20,000 shares by the employee profit-sharing plan.
The company is also considering changes to its accounting practices, which
it warned could result in further writedowns. It plans to apply for a 10-day
extension, until early March, of the deadline for filing a plan of
arrangement.
The board named Mr Duff Scott, a former head of Prudential-Bache Securities'
Canadian subsidiary as acting chairman. The chief financial officer has been
appointed acting chief operating officer, leaving the company without a
chief executive for the time being. Mr Charles Gill quit late last year as
president.

GE CAPITAL, the fast-expand-ing financial services arm of General Electric,
is spending some Dollars 500m to buy about half the portfolio of troubled
real estate assets put up for sale last September by First Chicago, the
mid-western bank.
GE Capital is one of the most aggressive buyers of troubled property
portfolios in the US market, having avoided serious real estate invest-ment
problems of its own during the slump of the late 1980s.
First Chicago was one of the first banks to announce the wholesale disposal
and write-down of its troubled property loans, which were originally valued
at Dollars 2.1bn. It decided that there were no near-term signs of recovery
in the US market.
The assets being sold to GE Capital had an original book value of about
Dollars 1bn and are diverse, both geographically and by collateral type.

SIR Michael Sandberg, former chairman of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, is
behind the acquisition of First American International Bank of Miami, a
subsidiary of the BCCI-tainted First American Bank of Georgia, which is in
liquidation.
First American of Miami, which specialises in trade finance for Latin
America, will be acquired for Dollars 6.5m by AmTrade International Bank of
Georgia.
Amtrade International Bank, which is being created for the Miami
acquisition, also intends to start the only bank exclusively devoted to
trade finance in Georgia.
AmTrade International is 94 per cent owned by a holding company called
Broadstreet, organised last year and chaired by Sir Michael. Broadstreet won
approval this week from the US Federal Reserve for the two transactions.
Mr Robert Glustrom, an Atlanta attorney who is president of Broadstreet,
said the group aimed to expand substantially the trade finance business of
the Miami bank, which will be renamed AmTrade International Bank of Florida.
The bank last year was rolling over around Dollars 75m to Dollars 80m in
trade financing every 90 days, according Mr Vincent Cater, formerly an
official with First American in Miami and now president of AmTrade
International. The company is linked to a network of 450 corresponding banks
in 88 countries.
AmTrade International in Atlanta will target small and medium-sized
companies, said Mr Glustrom. He said both banks would focus on building
trade finance business with Asia and Europe. The Miami branch will seek to
expand its US-Latin American business to finance Latin American trade with
Europe and Asia.
Given the Federal Reserve's approval, the creation of AmTrade International
of Georgia and the Miami acquisition are expected to be completed in the
next few weeks.

campaign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BELL ATLANTIC, one of the seven 'Baby Bell' local US telephone companies,
said yesterday it would seek the support of the Justice Department in a
campaign to be allowed to poke a toe into the long-distance communications
market so as to deliver video programmes to customers.
The Baby Bells were spun off from long-distance carrier AT&amp;T in 1984 under a
court-ordered anti-trust settlement which also forbade them to enter the
long-distance market.
Bell Atlantic is the first to make a filing of this kind to enter the
long-distance market. Its move forms part of a battle between the US cable
television and local telephone industries over which will provide
information services and entertainment to the home in the 21st century.
Bell Atlantic has developed several initiatives to deliver video to the
home, but it said it needed relief from the ban on long distance operations
to deploy these services in a cost-effective manner.
It explained that it planned to use multi-million dollar digital servers for
storing and forwarding video programming, and it would be most effective if
these could be used beyond the major urban areas where it is allowed to
carry calls.
The views of the Clinton administration's Justice Department on the issue
are unknown. But even if it backs Bell Atlantic, the company's request would
still require the approval of Judge Harold Greene, the man who oversaw the
break-up of AT&amp;T. He has generally opposed relaxing restrictions on the Baby
Bells.

TORONTO-DOMINION Bank's first-quarter earnings were virtually wiped out by
the costs of absorbing an ailing Canadian trust company, higher loan
writedowns and losses on securities investments.
The bank reported earnings of CDollars 1m (USDollars 700m), equal to a loss
of 2 cents a share, in the three months to January 31, compared with income
of CDollars 106m, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier.
The latest figure includes an after-tax charge of CDollars 79m related to
restructuring required by the purchase of the 154-branch Central Guaranty
Trust.
TD also posted a CDollars 22m loss on its securities investments.
Loan loss provisions rose to CDollars 150m from CDollars 120m, due largely
to the continued difficulties of some Canadian corporate customers.
Non-performing loans stood at CDollars 1.7bn at end-January, up from
CDollars 1.6bn a year earlier, including a 69 per cent jump in troubled
loans to large domestic customers.
Assets stood at CDollars 81bn on January 31, up from CDollars 69.5bn a year
earlier. The bank noted that its capital-to-assets ratio of 9.4 per cent
remains well above regulatory guidelines.
National Bank of Canada reported first-quarter net profits of CDollars 45m,
or 28 cents a share, down from CDollars 50m, or 32 cents, a year earlier,
writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Return on average assets of the country's sixth-largest chartered bank was
0.46 per cent against 0.53 per cent. However, performance improved from the
previous quarter. Interest margins contracted because of bigger volumes of
non-performing loans, volatile interest rates and higher levels of cash
resources. But assets grew, especially in retail business.
The brokerage unit had lower profits. Loan loss provision for the latest
quarter was CDollars 75m and for the full fiscal year is estimated at
CDollars 300m.
Total assets at January 31 were CDollars 41.6bn, up CDollars 1.6bn from
end-October 1992.

VIASA, the Venezuelan international airline that was privatised in 1991,
suffered a loss of USDollars 50m in 1992, according to Mr Rafael Ordozgoiti,
the company's vice-president.
The Viasa executive said the airline hoped to reduce losses this year to
Dollars 25m and shareholders would be asked to raise Dollars 63m in new
capital to cover past losses.
Viasa, formerly owned by the Venezuelan government, was the first major
privatisation carried out by the administration of President Carlos Andreas
Perez. In 1991, Iberia, the Spanish carrier, bought 45 per cent of the
airline's shares, while a large Venezuelan financial organisation, Banco
Provincial Group, acquired 15 per cent (Credit Lyonnaise holds a minority
provincial in Banco Provincial).
The government retains control of a 40 per cent stake of the shares, part of
which is being sold to employees.

<TEXT>
ALITALIA, Europe's fourth-largest airline, yesterday reported a further
contraction in net group losses during 1992, which fell from L34.5bn to
L14.7bn.
The Italian state-controlled airline claimed yesterday that it had
strengthened its position in the market place.
The board, however, warned that 1993 promised to be a difficult year which
'might see a slowdown in the process of renewal and relaunching so
positively under way'.
During the period 1993-96, Alitalia plans to invest L4,270bn (Dollars
2.76bn). Last year, the airline carried out fleet investment worth L363bn.
To cover financial needs of L134bn, assets were sold, including unwanted
aircraft worth L101bn. Provision for potential foreign exchange losses as a
result of the lira's float since September amounted to L60.3bn.
Group revenues rose by 17 per cent to L5,428bn, and if domestic and
international traffic carried is measured against 1990 to exclude the
anomalous effects of the 1991 Gulf war, the rise was 26 per cent. The load
factor edged up to 66.3 per cent compared with 61.3 per cent during the Gulf
war year.
The airline continued to prune its workforce during the year, with job
losses totalling 67. The company claimed productivity had been raised 26 per
cent over the past two years.
The board gave no estimate of the impact of last December's purchase of a 30
per cent stake in Malev, the Hungarian airline, but in 1991 it had earnings
of Dollars 28m.

<TEXT>
LAWSON MARDON, the Can-adian-based international packaging group, staged a
turnround in 1992. The group registered a net profit of CDollars 17.4m
(USDollars 13.8m), or 58 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 10.8m, or
38 cents, including restructuring charges, in 1991.
Revenues rose 7.3 per cent to CDollars 1.3bn, despite the North American and
European recessions.
Last autumn, Lawson raised CDollars 105m in new equity. About two-thirds of
its sales are made in Britain, but late last year it bought Spain's largest
packaging company from Cragnotti &amp; Partners, the Italian investment group
that holds 48 per cent of Lawson. Other acquisitions are planned in Europe
and North America.
Mr Andrea Mattiussi, president, said the results proved that the
restructuring last year was a success and the group could face continuing
pressure on margins with confidence.
'The Spanish acquisition was a key part of our plan to consolidate Lawson's
position in southern Europe, complementing the northern Europe operations
and serving as a base for future growth.'
Domtar, the Quebec-based pulp and paper and building materials group, has
raised CDollars 150m by the sale of 8 per cent convertible unsecured
debentures to a group of investment dealers headed by Burns Fry. The funds
will be used to repay maturing debentures and for capital spending.
Two Quebec government agencies, the Caisse Depot and Societe Generale de
Financement have bought CDollars 66m of the issue.
The government indirectly owns 44 per cent of Domtar.

RIO ALGOM, an independent copper, uranium, potash and coal producer since
Rio Tinto Zinc sold its 51 per cent control to the public last June, has
reported lower profit for 1992.
Though copper prices were favourable, potash operations improved and the
Canadian dollar was lower, uranium and metals distribution results were
lower.
Profit from continuing operations declined to CDollars 39.4m (USDollars
31.2m), or 85 cents a share, from CDollars 44.8m, or 97 cents, a year
earlier.
Revenues were little changed at CDollars 1.03bn.
On the same basis, fourth-quarter net equalled 22 cents a share against 29
cents, on revenues of CDollars 263m against CDollars 264.5m.

<TEXT>
UP TO 11,000 blue-collar workers at General Motors are expected to be
indefinitely laid off next week as a fund, set up by the troubled car
company to keep unneeded workers on full pay, runs out of money.
The development had been widely expected, and the blow will be softened by
the fact that the laid-off workers will continue to receive a proportion of
their pay through a separate GM unemployment fund.
However, the ending of the scheme will not help smooth relations between GM
and the United Auto Workers union at a time when the company is seeking
union co-operation in its massive restructuring programme and ahead of
crucial talks next autumn on a new three-year labour contract.
The job guarantee programme was established in 1990 under the labour
agreement expiring this year.
GM has begun notifying workers involved in the scheme that it is expected to
run out of money next week.
The UAW's agreement to the retirement programme last December was taken as a
sign of improving relations between the union and the company after a series
of autumn strikes, several of which appeared to be UAW warning shots over
the company's restructuring plans.

CREDIT Lyonnais, the French state-controlled banking group, has strengthened
its position at BfG, the German bank in which it recently acquired a
majority shareholding, by securing an agreement that gives it the right to
intervene in the running of the bank.
BfG is in the throes of a rationalisation programme to reduce its
5,100-strong workforce to 4,400 over the next two years.
Credit Lyonnais in November ended a five year campaign to expand into
Germany by buying 50.1 per cent of BfG for DM1.42bn.
The French bank yesterday also announced it was expanding its domestic
interests by raising its stake in SDR Expanso, a Bordeaux-based regional
development agency, by 5 per cent leaving it with a total holding of 5.8 per
cent.

The group expected cash-flow and profit figures for the year to be lower,

The company, which increased output by 14 per cent to DM6bn (Dollars

1991, it paid out DM10 a share after a 50 per cent rise in net profits to

However, figures released yesterday suggested that progress had slowed in

DR PETER Sjostrand resigned abruptly yesterday as executive vice-president
and chief financial officer of Astra, the leading Swedish pharmaceutical
group, writes Christopher Brown-Humes.
His departure stems from a personal disagreement with Mr Hakan Mogren, Astra
chief executive, over the future division of responsibilities. Neither the
company nor Dr Sjostrand were willing to elaborate.
Dr Sjostrand, 46, joined Astra in 1975 and has been on the group's executive
committee for the past 15 years. He was secretary of the board between 1976
and 1988 and a deputy of the board since then.

profits
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GROUP operating profits at Westdeutsche Landesbank rose by nearly a quarter
last year, the large German public-sector bank reported yesterday.
But stripping out the effects of integrating a subsidised housing subsidiary
for the first time - and the income from the bank's own account trading
activities - 'partial' operating profits were up only slightly over the
DM780m (Dollars 487m) made in 1991.
The bank pointed put that the rise in total group operating profits, to
DM1.16bn last year from DM960m in 1991, was strongly influenced by the
integration of Wohnungsbauforderungsanstalt des Landes NRW (WfA), acquired
from the government of North-Rhine Westphalia at the beginning of last year.
Total operating earnings - which include the contribution from own account
trading - would have risen by 10 per cent without the contribution from WfA,
WestLB said yesterday.
Reflecting the effect of a 17 per cent increase in staff costs, partial
operating profits - which exclude own account trading results - rose by 11.8
per cent from DM637.3m to DM719.5m. WestLB said most of this rise was due to
WfA.
Total assets of the group rose 17 per cent to approximately DM270bn,
consolidating WestLB's position as one of Germany's top three or four banks
in terms of balance sheet size. The contribution to assets from WfA was
DM14bn, the bank said.
'Even if we disregard the special effect of the WfA integration, we were
able to stabilise the positive development of our operating result, despite
the unfavourable interest rate scenario,' commented Mr Friedel Neuber, chief
executive.
He said this would be helped through the bank's recent expansion in the
state banking sector. WestLB, the state bank for North-Rhine Westphalia,
recently took a 37.5 per cent stake in the Mainz-based Landesbank
Rheinland-Pfalz.

FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: SKF passes payout after posting
SKr1.8bn deficit

<TEXT>
SKF, the world's leading roller bearing manufacturer, has passed its
dividend after slumping to a SKr1.8bn (Dollars 229m) loss in 1992.
The result was in line with the group's December forecast and reflects the
impact of depressed markets, restructuring, and heavy losses within Ovako
Steel. In 1991, when the group paid a SKr4.25 dividend, its loss amounted to
SKr221m. This is the first time the group has not paid a dividend since
1923.
Sales rose to SKr26.65bn from SKr26.30bn, thanks to the consolidation of
Ovako Steel which had previously been reported as an associate company.
Excluding Ovako, sales were 7 per cent lower at SKr24.37bn.
The group said demand in the European market, which accounts for 60 per cent
of its sales, declined steadily, and the trend accelerated towards the end
of the year. The group has been particularly badly hit by the drop in
European car production and Germany has become a particularly difficult
market.
By contrast, conditions improved in the US and the group increased its sales
and earnings there for the second year running.
In 1993, the group expects to make another loss because of continuing poor
conditions in its key European markets but it has not given a specific
forecast. 'Last year we finished weakly, and this year we have started
weakly,' said a spokesman.
The group's 1992 result includes a SKr1.1bn provision to cover the cost of
further restructuring in 1993 and 1994 when the group expects to shed
another 5,000 jobs. This will bring staff levels down to 42,000 by 1995.
The group's core business, rolling bearings and seals, saw 1992 sales fall
to SKr22.69bn from SKr24.35bn, while the loss after financial items
increased to SKr1.26bn from SKr135m.
Its second largest business, Ovako Steel, reported a SKr442m loss because of
the drop in European special steel demand. It is expected to remain in the
red again this year.
SKF has been increasing its focus on its rolling bearings and seals
operations, leading to the sale of its tools business, CTT Tools, to Sandvik
from the start of this year. Last year the tools business made a SKr117m
loss on sales of SKr1.73bn.
The group says it has benefited from a fall in inventories and the impact of
restructuring.
The loss per share before extraordinary items amounted to SKr13.20, compared
with SKr10.40 a year ago.

shortfall in fourth term

<TEXT>
THE EQUITABLE, the large and troubled US insurance group in which France's
Axa holds a 49 per cent stake, yesterday reported an after-tax loss of
Dollars 28.9m in the final three months of 1992.
This was a sharp reduction on the Dollars 246.9m deficit registered in the
same period of 1991.
The Equitable, which recently completed a lengthy 'demutualisation' process
which turned it into a shareholder-owned company, said that, if results were
confined to 'continuing operations', the 1991 final quarter deficit stood at
Dollars 161.3m, with the 1992 figure remaining at Dollars 28.9m.
The fourth-quarter results mean that The Equitable is posting a Dollars
128.6m deficit for the year after tax, compared with a Dollars 898m loss in
1991.
However, both these figures are muddied by special items; the 1992 figure
comes after a Dollars 101.3m extraordinary charge to cover demutualisation
expenses, and the 1991 result comes after a Dollars 28.3m extraordinary item
and a Dollars 561.9m loss from discontinued operations. The insurer said the
loss from continuing operations, and before extraordinary charges, improved
from a Dollars 307.8m deficit in 1991, to a Dollars 32.2m loss last year.
Within the core insurance division, The Equitable reported an annual
after-tax loss of Dollars 7.5m, compared with a Dollars 44.8m deficit in
1991. The 1992 figure excludes a loss on investment transactions of Dollars
22.7m, and Dollars 15.6m of restructuring charges. However, the company's
continuing investment services operations - which include the Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette brokerage business and the Alliance Capital fund
management arm - turned in after-tax profits of Dollars 192.5m, up from
Dollars 111.6m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTIANIA Bank, Norway's second-biggest bank, has cut losses significantly
during 1992 due to a huge increase in net interest income, a sharp reduction
in operating expenses and a substantial cut in credit losses.
Net losses at the state-owned bank fell to NKr1.3bn (Dollars 187m) from
NKr9.2bn as net interest income rose by NKr357m to NKr3.1bn, despite a
NKr300m reduction in loan volume.
Mr Borger Lenth, chief executive, hopes to reach breakeven this year, but
said there was still uncertainty over corporate customers' ability to
service debt. Non-interest income surged by 52 per cent, by NKr576m to
NKr1.67bn, due to higher foreign exchange income and significantly lower
losses on securities.
Foreign exchange income nearly doubled to NKr605m from NKr392m as securities
losses were cut to NKr94m from NKr359m. Operating expenses were slashed by
19 per cent, or by NKr653m to NKr2.86bn, allowing the bank to fulfil
authorities' demands by a good margin to reduce costs by 15 per cent in
1992. Christiania cut 665 jobs last year to 4,236, and 1,100 jobs over the
past two years.
Mr Lenth said the level of loan losses was still unacceptably high,
especially among large corporate customers, but noted there had been a
substantial improvement at the operating level.
'This is a direct result of measures taken last year to return the bank to
profit. Our retail division . . . is in the black,' Mr Lenth said.
Losses on loans and guarantees fell to NKr2.8bn from NKr7.2bn in 1991. Gross
non-performing loans fell by NKr1.7bn to NKr12.1bn during the course of last
year.
Provisions for loan losses include NKr1.8bn related to large corporate
customers. Four commitments accounted for NKr1bn of the provision.
Losses by retail customers plunged by 60 per cent to NKr300m from NKr800m.
Losses by small to medium-sized corporate customers accounted for NKr500m of
provisions while the international subsidiary and branches accounted for
NKr200m. IBCA, the UK credit rating agency, has placed three Finnish banks
on RatingWatch for possible upgrade, after the Finnish parliament
strengthened its commitment to resolving the country's banking crisis
earlier this week, writes Christopher Brown-Humes.
The agency says the move affects the long and short-term ratings of
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Union Bank of Finland and Postipankki.

<TEXT>
GOTA BANK, the troubled Swedish bank under state control, saw its operating
loss deepen to SKr2.4bn (Dollars 306m) in 1992 from SKr1.9bn a year earlier
after credit losses more than tripled to SKr12.5bn from SKr3.7bn.
The loss would have been SKr12.9bn without SKr4.5bn in financial insurance
and SKr6bn in state guarantees.
The bank said its capital adequacy ratio at the year-end stood at 8.46 per
cent, although it noted that without state support its capital base would
have been negative.
The government agreed last month to provide a total of SKr10bn in guarantees
to Gota, so it has some additional loss coverage for the current year.
Credit losses ballooned well beyond the SKr8bn level predicted last
September when it first became apparent that the bank would need state
support.
The bank said 96 per cent of its credit losses arose from the corporate and
financial sector, and 59 per cent of this total was related to real estate.
It said just 15 loss engagements accounted for 38 per cent of total credit
losses.
Gota did not provide a forecast for 1993.

FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Provident Financial shows 30% advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROVIDENT Financial, the personal loan and consumer finance group, yesterday
announced a 30 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for 1992 after a year of
extensive restructuring in its main consumer credit business.
The company also announced a 16.6 per cent increase in its final dividend to
19.25p (16.5p), making a total of 28.5p (25p).
It will propose a 5-for-2 split of its 25p ordinary shares at the annual
meeting.
Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 44.5m compared with Pounds 34.1m. There is an
extraordinary loss of Pounds 1.9m because of a goodwill writeback of Pounds
4.2m on selling its Car Care Plan (Holdings) and People's Motor Finance
businesses.
Mr John van Kuffeler, chief executive, said the 'excellent' performance was
achieved despite unemployment and a lack of consumer confidence. The changes
from company restructuring would produce continuing benefits in the coming
year.
He said closure of retail operations and most merchandising activities had
been offset by a 'significant expansion' in the underlying loan and
insurance businesses.
Mr van Kuffeler said the company had been advised to make a share split
because the rise in the price of its shares made them more difficult to
trade.
Provident's shares yesterday closed up 20p at 794p.
Provident's main business is a Pounds 400m portfolio of weekly collected
credit.
It offers unsecured loans, the majority to tenants on council estates, on
which it charges high rates of interest to compensate for collection costs
and risk.
During the year, it closed its Lawson Fisher business offering goods on
credit in 14 stores. It also ended the catalogue goods business of its HT
Greenwood offshoot and closed a network of warehouses for retail goods.
It also reduced its network of branches from over 400 to 360 while cutting
staff levels. Its force of local loan payment collectors was cut by 1,200 to
4,200.
The insurance division raised profits to Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 900,000). Its
Halifax Insurance operation expanded policy holders by 40 per cent to
400,000 at the year end. It expanded its supporting network of brokers to
over 5,000.
The banking division made a profit of Pounds 1m (Pounds 1.5m loss) partly
through cost cutting. The number of branches was reduced from 13 to 6. The
company said there had been 'a determined focus' on debt collection in motor
finance.
Group turnover increased to Pounds 371m (Pounds 359m) and profit after tax
and before the extraordinary item rose to Pounds 30.7m (Pounds 24.1m). After
deducting Pounds 15.1m in paid and proposed dividends, it made a retained
profit of Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 11.1m).
Earnings per share rose to 58.37p (46.63p).

FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Overseas side helps stem fall at British
Gas - Warmer weather, loss of market share and lower domestic prices blamed
for downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Gas saw profits in its core UK business decline by Pounds 276m in
1992 as a result of warmer weather, loss of market share and lower prices
for the supply of household gas. But this was partly offset by an increase
in earnings from the company's overseas divisions.
On 12 months' turnover of Pounds 10.25bn (Pounds 10.49bn) group pre-tax
profits came out at Pounds 1.05bn, after exceptional charges of Pounds 320m,
compared with Pounds 1.71bn.
Mr Philip Rogerson, British Gas's director of finance, pointed to a strong
improvement in fourth quarter profits at the exploration and production
division, where income doubled from Pounds 60m to Pounds 128m, following the
increase in production at its South Morecambe bay field in the North Sea.
For the full year, exploration and production, where most revenues come from
overseas, increased slightly to Pounds 224m compared with Pounds 221m.
The overseas gas supply business saw a rise in profits for the year to
Pounds 137m, against Pounds 125m, following an increase in sales volumes
abroad and a drop in the purchase price of gas. The rise came mainly in the
fourth quarter, which accounted for Pounds 42m (Pounds 33m).
Mr Robert Evans, chairman, said the overseas divisions provided a 'welcome
contribution,' to profits, accounting for roughly 25 per cent of the total.
He hoped the two divisions would provide 60 per cent of profits by the end
of the decade.
The profits of the UK gas business fell from Pounds 1.5bn to Pounds 1.2bn
last year. Factors behind the decline were the warmer weather, which
accounted for Pounds 140m of the drop; the squeeze on prices as a result of
the tough new formula imposed by the regulator, leading to a fall of Pounds
50m; and the loss of market share in the industrial market, taking out
Pounds 70m.
Non-gas costs also increased and pipeline revenues improved.
In the final quarter of 1992, the UK gas business showed a roughly stable
profit of Pounds 626m, compared with Pounds 636m.
Earnings per share were 15.8p for the full year, compared with 27.3p. In the
final quarter earnings per share were 5.4p (11.3p).
The company declared a final dividend of 7.8p, which made a total for the
year of 14.2p - a rise of some 6 per cent from 10.25p for the previous 12
months.
Mr Rogerson said: 'The policy of increasing the dividend in real terms and
the ability to maintain it depends to a significant degree on the outcome of
the MMC inquiry.' British Gas is currently under review by the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission.
The company had a net cash outflow of Pounds 1.5bn, slightly higher than
analysts had forecast. This was chiefly because of heavier tax and dividend
payments during the 12 months after changing the reporting period from the
tax year to the calendar year.
British Gas's level of gearing rose to 33 per cent from 25 per cent.

FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Aberdeen declares Brabant offer final
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABERDEEN Petroleum yesterday declared final its hostile all-share offer for
fellow USM company Brabant Resources with the publication of an offer
document and annual results showing pre-tax profits up by Pounds 277,000 to
Pounds 355,000.
The group's shares rose 13 per cent on the news to close at 15p. Brabant's
shares held steady at 37p.
The profits increase was achieved on the back of lower overheads and an
exceptional gain of Pounds 201,000 on asset disposals. Sales, dampened by
the fall in the average oil price from Dollars 18.05 to Dollars 16.94,
declined from Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 2.6m.
Mr David Hooker, Aberdeen's managing director, said the group's profits were
the result of getting the 'housekeeping right'.
Referring to the bid for Brabant, he said that future substantial growth for
many small UK-quoted oil and gas companies depended on rationalisation in
the sector.
Aberdeen's offer document drew attention to the losses incurred at Brabant
and its 'historic lack of success' in the exploration field.
Aberdeen, which owns or has undertakings for 21.4 per cent of Brabant,
claimed that the bid of 35 of its shares for 10 of Brabant's valued the
target at 48.1p. This represented a 75 per cent premium over Brabant's price
the day before Aberdeen indicated its interest, the document said.
However, Mr Nicholas Gay, Brabant's finance director, said the valuation was
based on an inflated Aberdeen share price, 'supported by bid speculation'.
Using the 6p price for Aberdeen on December 7, Mr Gay said the bid valued
Brabant shares at 21p.
Analysts have speculated that if the offer for Brabant, which is largely UK
based, does not succeed, then Aberdeen will become the target of an
aggressive approach from Pittencrieff.
Pittencrieff earlier this week increased its stake in Aberdeen from 16.6 per
cent to 19.1 per cent. The acquisitive resources company is determined to
expand both in the US and Canada, where Aberdeen's assets are based.

FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Weak pound helps Micro Focus rise 23% to
Pounds 22.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIDED BY the weak pound, Micro Focus, the Newbury-based software company,
maintained its record as one of the UK electronics sector's strongest
performers with profits up 23 per cent and a cash reserve of Pounds 53m.
Pre-tax profits for the year to January 31 were Pounds 22.3m (Pounds 18.1m),
with turnover ahead 21 per cent to Pounds 67.7m (Pounds 55.9m).
The results were in line with City expectations and the shares closed down
80p at Pounds 25.15. At their peak last month they reached Pounds 29.98,
after a steep ascent from 800p at the start of 1991.
Earnings per share, fully diluted, increased by 28 per cent to 106.2p
(83.1p).
Most of the company's cash is held in dollars, the strength of which helped
to increase reserves to Pounds 52.9m at the end of January, 71 per cent up
on January 1992.
Mr Paul O'Grady, chairman, did not rule out an acquisition this year, but
said it was unlikely.
Micro Focus supplies software tools for programming in Cobol,
internationally the most widely used data processing language. Shipments of
Workbench, its leading package, were 29 per cent up, with maintenance
accounting for 21 per cent of direct revenues.
More than 40 per cent of the company's stock is now held in American
Depositary Receipts and another 5 per cent in other forms of US stock. The
group is traded on New York's Nasdaq market and has a foreign private issuer
status with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. More than half of
revenue comes from the US.
Mr O'Grady said that despite the depressed market he expected Micro Focus to
'maintain or exceed its current growth rates,' with the company's new 32 bit
technology released this year 'the foundation of our product strategy'.
Growth in direct sales of software products was up 25 per cent in dollar
terms, accounting for 80 per cent of total revenues. Sales to original
equipment manufacturers were up 6 per cent. Contracts renewals included Data
General, Motorola, Hitachi, Fujitsu, Siemens-Nixdorf and Bull.
Staff numbers rose to 613, up from 445 two years ago. Average revenues per
head are up from Dollars 382 to Dollars 580.
COMMENT
Micro Focus continues to dazzle a depressed electronics sector. Analysts
expect the rate of increase in US earnings to slow slightly this year, but
growth of 20 to 25 per cent remains impressive. With research and
development spending up by nearly a third and a cash mountain of Pounds 53m
 -which its chairman insists just lets him 'sleep easily at night' - nothing
is being left to chance. Both the direct marketing of its software tools,
and its maintenance contracts, offer sound prospects for medium-term growth.
Pre-tax profits are forecast to rise from Pounds 26.4m to about Pounds 34m
for 1993, equal to earnings per share of 157p. With a prospective multiple
of 16, it does not appear over-priced, although no change in dividend policy
is expected.

The conversion of record orders from the autumn/winter 1992 collections into
sales helped Frank Usher, the USM-quoted women's clothing group, report
interim pre-tax profits up 44 per cent on sales ahead 21 per cent.
However, with the second half usually less profitable and the costs of the
move to a new showroom falling due in the period, directors did not expect
the results to match those of the first.
Profits for the six months to November 30 were Pounds 843,000 (Pounds

Contra-Cyclical Investment Trust yesterday said that, due to the
deterioration of dividend levels, it would recommend a reduced distribution
for the 12 months to March 31 1994.
Sir Alan Walters, chairman, said: 'We are disappointed that we have had to
take this action which has been dictated by the current economic conditions.
The revised dividend level is one which we believe can be sustained and
which will do justice to the expectations of our other classes of
shareholder.'
The pay-out for the year was likely to be less than 9.5p per income share -
'a base from which dividend growth should resume'.
Directors stressed that the total dividend of 12.75p for the current year,
as forecast in the prospectus, would be achieved.

pre-tax profits by 39 per cent to IPounds 1.83m (Pounds 1.9m) in 1992

Net rents and other operating income rose to IPounds 5.32m (IPounds 4.71m).
An unchanged final dividend of 2.6p maintains the total at 3.8p, payable

Bellwinch, the Wembley-based builder, incurred a pre-tax deficit of Pounds
97,000 for the six months to December 31, against a loss of Pounds 385,000
last time.
Turnover was down slightly, from Pounds 6.01m to Pounds 5.44m, reflecting
the continuing lack of volume in the housebuilding market, with completions
in the period amounting to just 60 units against 61 for the comparable
period.
Interest payable fell to Pounds 63,000 (Pounds 500,000). Losses per share

That compared with a deficit of Pounds 17.5m last time and was struck on
turnover almost halved from Pounds 36.5m to Pounds 19.7m. However, last
year's profits were restated to conform with the FRS 3 accounting standard

FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Expansion in UK market planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSATLANTIC Holdings, the financial services group, is gearing up for
expansion in the UK.
'We intend to increase our exposure in the UK insurance market and
increasingly in the insurance markets of the English speaking world,' said
Mr Donald Gordon, the South African life insurance entrepreneur who chairs
the company.
Mr Gordon said a number of larger UK insurance companies were 'looking for a
big brother' and that TransAtlantic was aiming to acquire a business in the
'larger end of that market. The bigger they are, the better the bargain.'
Union des Assurances de Paris, the state-owned French company, which owns 18
per cent of TransAtlantic, was particularly keen to expand in UK non-life
business where increases in premium rates are leading to improved
profitability after three years of losses. The two companies jointly own Sun
Life, one of the UK's largest life insurance companies.
However, Mr Gordon ruled out any interest in Guardian Royal Exchange, the UK
composite with which he has had longstanding links. GRE sold part of its
South African subsidiary, Guardian National, to Liberty Life in 1978, but
retains a 51 per cent interest in the company. Mr Gordon is a member of the
GRE board. 'It is not part of an agenda I have for myself. It would get too
close to being incestuous.'
Mr Gordon also delivered some sharp criticisms of UK valuation techniques,
which he claimed exacerbated the downturn in the property market. They were
'particularly inappropriate' for high quality shopping centres such as
Thurrock Lakeside, he said.
Valuations of UK property depend on past property sales, since they are
based on the price that the property could be expected to fetch if it were
placed on the market by a willing seller. Mr Gordon argued that this process
was flawed in the case of large shopping centres because they were hard to
compare with each other and were rarely sold.
Furthermore, he claimed that 'no rational company or person would . . . be a
willing seller of a major, high potential regional shopping centre or any
other prime property in the depths of serious recession.'
Future valuations for the entire industry could be affected by forced sales
or a price obtained by a liquidator or receiver, he said. Valuation
techniques 'may have played a part in exacerbating the downward spiral of
values in recessionary conditions and the upward movement in valuations in
boom times.'
He claimed that valuers were wrong to value high street shops more highly
than shopping centres, which he said had better prospects for income growth.
If Thurrock Lakeside had been valued on a 6 per cent yield, like many high
street shops, it would increase its valuation by Pounds 45m to Pounds 425m.
Mr Gordon's criticisms of open market valuation techniques were dismissed by
Mr Andrew Cherry, head of the assets valuation standards committee of the
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Banks were only willing to lend
against the open market value of property, he said. 'At the end of the day,
a property is worth what someone is willing to pay for it.'

FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Exploration and production side lifts Royal
Dutch/Shell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS AT Royal Dutch/Shell, the international oil group, were boosted by
an exceptionally good result from the company's exploration and production
division, but depressed by the first annual loss in a decade from its
chemicals business.
Sir Peter Holmes, chairman of Shell Transport, the group's UK arm, said that
although the oil price had dropped by Dollars 4.50 a barrel since 1990, the
company's exploration business had increased production and cut costs to
report an improvement in profit from Pounds 1.44bn to Pounds 1.86bn.
During 1992, Shell saw its oil production increase by 3 per cent to 2.2m
barrels a day (b/d) - the highest level since mid-1970s - with gas sales
also up by 3 per cent.
In the fourth quarter, the company increased its profits from exploration
and production from Pounds 391m to Pounds 682m in what analysts called an
'unusual' result, part of which is attributable to a lower tax bill.
Shell's refining and marketing operations showed a slight improvement on
1991 with profits rising to Pounds 1.24bn (Pounds 1.16bn) largely on the
back of stronger sales in the Far East market.
Sir Peter said that refining margins in Europe and the US were too low to
encourage the renewal of old plant.
In the fourth quarter, the company's refining and marketing division
reported a profit of Pounds 278m compared with Pounds 251m in the same
quarter of 1991.
Chemicals, which suffered from a continued downturn in the market for bulk
products and persistent over-capacity, reported a loss of Pounds 223m
compared with a profit of Pounds 23m.
In the final quarter of last year the loss reached Pounds 183m compared with
losses of Pounds 90m.
Earnings per share increased to 32.5p against 24.9p and Shell declared a
final dividend of 12.6p (12p) to lift the total for the year from 20.9p to
21.9p - a rise of 4.8 per cent.
Shell has maintained its strong financial position with net debt at Pounds
2.4bn and its debt to equity ratio at 7 per cent.

FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: TransAtlantic slips to Pounds 60.7m -
Contribution from Sun Life nearly doubled to Pounds 36.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSATLANTIC Holdings, the property and life assurance group which obtained
a London stock market listing last year, yesterday announced a marginal fall
in pre-tax profits from Pounds 61.2m to Pounds 60.7m for the year to
December 31.
Earnings per share fell to 9.93p compared with 14.52p in 1991, reflecting
increases in the amount of unrelieved advance corporation tax and reduced
interest capitalisation.
A recommended final dividend of 6p raises the total for the year to 12p,
against 11.45p in 1991.
TransAtlantic is owned jointly by Liberty Life, the South African life
assurance company, and Union des Assurances de Paris, France's largest
insurer. It owns 50 per cent of Sun Life Holdings, the UK life insurer, and
Capital &amp; Counties, the property company.
Mr Donald Gordon, chairman, said he was 'especially encouraged by the
performance of Capital &amp; Counties' regional shopping centre property
portfolio, which has demonstrated strong signs of buoyancy both in turnover
and an improved market share of retail trade'.
Income from property investment amounted to Pounds 67.9m (Pounds 60m), while
proceeds from property trading were Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 2.2m).
Administrative expenses fell to Pounds 11.7m (Pounds 12.6m). Income from Sun
Life nearly doubled to Pounds 36.7m (Pounds 18.7m).
Interest payable amounted to Pounds 35.7m, against Pounds 7.4m in 1991,
reflecting a significant reduction in interest capitalised on property
development projects from Pounds 32.4m to Pounds 11.6m, principally because
interest capitalisation ceased at June 30 1991 on the Thurrock Lakeside
Shopping Centre development.
Share capital and reserves increased from Pounds 775m to Pounds 948m. The
value of investment properties rose to Pounds 1.05bn (Pounds 1.01bn), with
the advance reflecting a large rise in the valuation from Pounds 325m to
Pounds 380m of Thurrock Lakeside, which amounts to 40 per cent of
TransAtlantic's property portfolio.
Special assumptions were made about the exceptional turnover rent potential
of the Thurrock development. Pounds 25.9m of the increase was due to
exchange rate fluctuations.
Separately, Sun Life yesterday reported a 12 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 46.7m (Pounds 41.7m), although new premium income fell
marginally to Pounds 1.49bn compared with Pounds 1.5bn in 1991. New single
premiums amounted to Pounds 1.4bn (Pounds 1.41bn), with regular premiums
falling by 3 per cent to Pounds 85.6m.

FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Inchcape completes resources withdrawal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCHCAPE, the motor and business services group, yesterday lost another link
with its colonial past as Inchcape Berhad, its 63 per cent owned
Singapore-based subsidiary, sold its timber offshoot to local investors for
Pounds 24m.
The move completes Inchcape's withdrawal from resources operations.
In 1991 it sold its tea investments and is now almost exclusively focused on
its core motor, marketing and services businesses, apart from the odd
country club and time share operation, acquired in March 1992 when it bought
TKM, funded by a Pounds 376m rights issue.
Inchcape Timber Group has operations in Malaysia, Indonesia, Papua New
Guinea, Singapore and Hong Kong and is involved in the extraction of
tropical hardwood and softwood logs, and the processing and trading of
timber products.
Inchcape's interest in timber stretches back to the 1860s.
The company incurred a pre-tax loss of SDollars 200,000 (Pounds 83,875) for
the 1992 year on turnover of SDollars 198.1m.
Inchcape said that the sale would result in an extraordinary profit of
Pounds 3.5m, less expenses.
The sale is conditional on regulatory approval.
ITG's trading profit had declined in the last three financial years
following the expiry of its main logging concession, the difficult operating
environment at the new logging concession in Papua New Guinea between 1990
and 1992, and recessionary conditions in the main timber markets, Inchcape
said.
Mr Charles Mackay, chief executive, said: 'The deal is a good one for
Inchcape in both strategic and financial terms. At the same time, it will
ensure a good future for the partners, management and employees in the
timber business.'

18m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXPANSION of its international network helped London Forfaiting, the
specialist trade finance house, report a near 20 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits, from Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 18.1m, in 1992.
Forfaiting is the provision of trade finance through fixed rate loans, which
are sold at a discount to banks and international companies.
The company increased its presence in the US and Far East, and last month
opened an office in the Czech Republic. Some 80 per cent of its revenue is
generated overseas.
Mr Peter Buckley, chairman, said the international base would continue to be
widened.
The final dividend is increased to 5.5p for a total of 8.4p (7.625p).
Earnings per share rose to 13.75p (11.52p).
Because of his increasing executive commitments with Caledonia Investments,
Mr Buckley is standing down as chairman in favour of Mr Jack Wilson, chief
executive. Mr Stathis Papoutes, managing director, is to become chief
executive.

<TEXT>
COMPUTER Management Group, the privately-owned computing services company,
saw pre-tax profits improve by 4.7 per cent to Pounds 9.52m in 1992 as a
result of careful housekeeping, higher interest income and strong foreign
earnings.
The company now derives 60 per cent of its sales from overseas, chiefly the
Netherlands, where according to Mr Ronald White, chairman, the market
continues to grow strongly.
Revenue was Pounds 116.2m, a 12.8 per cent improvement over last time's
Pounds 103m. Operating profit was Pounds 9.01m (Pounds 9.07m).
Earnings per share increased to 41.3p (39.8p).
The group intends to seek a market listing.

SHARES IN Macro 4 jumped 23p to 633p after the software group lifted profits
by 29 per cent in the six months to December 31.
Profits before tax went up to Pounds 4.94m, against Pounds 3.83m, on
turnover ahead 27 per cent at Pounds 11.2m (Pounds 8.83m). Nearly 80 per
cent of sales are overseas.
Earnings per share rose to 14.8p (11.5p) and the interim dividend goes up to
6.27p (5.14p).
For the last full year to June 30 the group declared a special dividend of
5p on top of a final of 12.75p. Mr Terry Kelly, chairman, said he hoped to
see a final dividend 'similar' to last year, with performance for the second
half expected to be 'slightly better' than last year.
With 40 per cent of its business in the US, the group was helped by the
depreciation of sterling. Mr Kelly said business in the US and south-east
Asia was recovering but UK, Australian and Scandinavian business remained
'flat at best.'
The cash position improved by Pounds 600,000, with reserves of Pounds 16.2m
at the end of the period.
A Spanish subsidiary established last October is expected to break even this
year.

FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Royal Insurance trims deficit to Pounds
119m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL Insurance, one of the UK's largest insurance companies, yesterday
announced a Pounds 20m increase in its reserves against possible employers'
liability claims arising from industrial diseases such as industrial
deafness and repetitive stress injury.
This indicates that the industry, hard hit by weather and recession-related
claims in recent years, may soon face problems from a fresh source.
The decision, combined with news of heavier than expected losses at Royal
Re, the reinsurance subsidiary, clouded an otherwise impressive performance
by Royal Insurance during 1992, which saw pre-tax losses fall to Pounds 119m
from Pounds 373m in 1991.
Royal, which omitted its final dividend last year, declared a final dividend
of 3p, making a total of 5p (11.25p).
The group also announced a Pounds 100m subordinated bond issue. The proceeds
 -like those from a Pounds 75m convertible issue launched in December - will
be used to repay short term borrowings, lengthening the repayment profile of
Royal's debt.
Royal has seen no increase in either notifications or actual claims on
employers' liability business, but said that it was taking a more cautious
stance in the light of the more 'pro-active' stance being adopted by trades
unions.
The group has a market share of employers' liability business of about 5 per
cent, according to Mr Roy Elms, director of underwriting.
Mr Richard Gamble, chief executive, said that the Pounds 254m improvement in
trading reflected a lower level of weather and domestic mortgage indemnity
claims in the UK but was achieved despite three major weather catastrophes
in the United States.
Improvements reflected 'the new creed' of tighter underwriting controls,
added Mr Gamble. 'We don't write for market share. We write for profit.'
Worldwide premium income fell to Pounds 3.42bn (Pounds 3.46bn), with life
premiums dropping to Pounds 332m (Pounds 390m). The fall in general
insurance income largely reflected exchange rate factors.
However in the UK the company reduced its exposures sharply in motor
business (down 10 per cent) and motor fleet (down 8 per cent).
Underwriting losses fell to Pounds 588m (Pounds 887m), reflecting a decline
in losses on domestic mortgage indemnity - which insure borrowers against a
portion of their losses on the sales of repossessed property - losses from
Pounds 257m in 1991 to Pounds 160m in 1992 and an improvement in most other
lines.
Mr Gamble said that reserves against DMI losses were Pounds 367m at the end
of 1992. Some Pounds 60m in claims was paid out during the year. The group
had not increased its most recent estimate of potential DMI losses.
Claims frequency in motor business declined by 10 per cent, with UK
underwriting losses in personal motor falling to Pounds 12m (Pounds 34m).
Underwriting losses fell in the US and at Royal International, but increased
by Pounds 3m in Canada. Underwriting losses at Royal Re rose by Pounds 40m
to Pounds 96m, largely as a result of increased claims from recent
catastrophe losses such as hurricane Andrew in the US last year. Investment
income fell to Pounds 486m (Pounds 492m), while income from associated
undertakings dropped to Pounds 21m (Pounds 34m).
Estate agency losses rose to Pounds 33m, compared with a deficit of Pounds
19m in 1991. Costs associated with the restructuring of the network of
offices by 67 to 517, more than outweighed the benefit of new cost controls,
introduced by Mr Gamble.
Capital and reserves amounted to Pounds 1.5bn (up from Pounds 1.41bn), but
would have fallen without exchange rate gains of Pounds 198m. The solvency
margin - the yardstick which measures net assets as a percentage of non-life
premium income - amounted to 42 per cent, compared with 40 per cent at the
end of 1991.

FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Gascoigne sale helps to quadruple Spurs'
profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOTTENHAM Hotspur, the north London football club, made the bulk of its
first-half profits from selling players.
The pre-tax figure multiplied fourfold to Pounds 3.28m (Pounds 810,000) in
the six months to November 30. More than half the Pounds 15.1m (Pounds
9.22m) sales came from the disposal of players, including Pounds 5.5m for
Paul Gascoigne.
The share price, which had shot up from 90p to 113p this week, shed 12p to
close at 101p as profits were taken.
With Mr Alan Sugar, chairman, owning 48 per cent, and Mr Terry Venables,
chief executive, 22 per cent, not much of the stock trades freely.
Turnover other than player sales fell to Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 7.36m). Mr
Sugar said there had been fewer home fixtures in the first half and average
attendance was down because of the recession. The newly formed Premier
League had enhanced television and sponsorship income.
Tottenham cut its bank overdraft to Pounds 2.41m, compared with Pounds 4.29m
in May. Its debts peaked at about Pounds 15m in 1991, before a rescue rights
issue underwritten by Mr Sugar.
To comply with the Taylor report requirement for all-seater stadiums,
Tottenham is about to spend Pounds 2m on its North Stand. Second half
prospects have been improved by Spurs winning through to the quarter finals
of the FA Cup.
Earnings per share rose to 19.2p (8p).

FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Owners refutes claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OWNERS Abroad yesterday aimed to refute claims made during the hostile bid
from rival holiday group, Airtours, ahead of its final defence document
which due to be produced today.
Owners said it had not included details of a Pounds 6.5m contingent
liability with its preliminary results because it was not usual practice to
do so.
The liability, in any case, related to the possibility that London
properties vacated as part of the reorganisation of the group in Crawley
would have to be carried for the full period of their leases.
Owners had taken full provisions of Pounds 1.7m for two years, covering
rental and other costs up to the time of their anticipated disposal.
Owners said that contrary to what Airtours claimed, it had provided Pounds
7.5m for additional payments for the acquisition of Olympic and Extrawelcome
holiday companies that might fall due.
It also said it had Pounds 40.9m of distributable reserves in the group, of
which Pounds 8.8m was currently held in the parent company. There was no
legal restriction on subsidiaries making the balance distributable.

FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Woolwich Building Socy turns in rise to
Pounds 149m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOOLWICH Building Society, the fourth largest with assets of Pounds 23.3bn,
yesterday disclosed a 9.5 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 149.3m,
compared with Pounds 136.4m, despite doubling its provisions for possible
bad debts in the depressed housing market.
Woolwich made new provisions of Pounds 144.7m (Pounds 72.4m), raising its
total provisions to Pounds 207m. About 40 per cent of the rise in provisions
was estimated to relate to the Town &amp; Country Building Society, with which
it merged last May.
The society achieved a fall in its cost to income ratio to 50.7 per cent
(59.9 per cent). Mr John Wriglesworth, analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said
he believed this was the biggest single year fall achieved by a large
building society.
Mr Donald Kirkham, chief executive, said about 9 per cent of the society's
541,000 borrowers were in arrears. The number of properties taken into
possession fell to 3,364 (3,788). Town &amp; Country added 400 repossessions to
its stock.
The society declared an exceptional loss of Pounds 17.9m from restructuring
costs, and a Pounds 6.5m exceptional profit from tax reclaimed from the
Inland Revenue after litigation.
The aggregate net losses of the society's subsidiaries were reduced to
Pounds 24m (Pounds 30m). It managed to halve the trading loss in its estate
agency subsidiary to Pounds 11m after closing 55 branches during the year
and making 200 staff redundant.

Ensor Holdings, the USM-quoted building materials and motor group, is
raising about Pounds 1.5m through a rights issue and capital subscription.
Recent losses - Pounds 2.1m in the six months to September 30 - have
prompted 'strong demands' from the group's bankers to reduce debt by means
of disposals.
Ensor has agreed with Mr Kenneth Harrison, formerly chairman and chief
executive of Harrison Industries, that he will underwrite the rights issue
and subscribe for 10.4m shares.
He will be invited to join the board as chairman and managing director.
The rights shares are offered on a 3-for-5 basis at 10p each.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS YEAR'S first proposed rescue of a loss-making building society was
announced yesterday when the Surrey Building Society unveiled plans to merge
with the Northern Rock.
The Surrey said it expected to declare a small pre-tax loss for 1992.
With five branches in the south-east of England, it had been affected by the
severe downturn in the housing market. A transfer of engagements to Northern
Rock made 'a great deal of sense'.
The Surrey will offer its 8,900 shareholders a bonus payment of 0.75 per
cent gross on completion of the transfer.
The proposal will be put to a special meeting to be held at the same time as
its annual meeting in April.
Northern Rock, which has assets of over Pounds 6bn compared with the
Surrey's Pounds 79m, disclosed a 37 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for
1992.

FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Telegraph shows 9% advance to Pounds 44.3m
 -Advertising income up but circulation revenue improved to 46% of total
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TELEGRAPH newspaper group, which floated last July, yesterday announced
record pre-tax profits of Pounds 44.3m for 1992, an increase of 9 per cent
despite the impact of the continuing recession on newspaper advertising
revenues.
Mr Conrad Black, chairman of the Telegraph, which publishes both the Daily
Telegraph and the Sunday Telegraph, admitted that the company had been
apprehensive about 1992 because the recession showed so few signs of
improvement.
However, group turnover rose by 8.3 per cent to Pounds 237.2m and operating
profit increased by 14.7 per cent to Pounds 37.5m. The proposed final
dividend is 6.5p, higher than indicated at flotation, and makes a total of
11p for the year, a 22 per cent increase. This excludes the special dividend
of 10p paid before the company came to market.
Earnings per share have dropped by 6.3 per cent to 23.8p because of a
doubling of tax charges mainly because tax losses flowing from restructuring
charges have been used up.
Costs were contained during the year and advertising revenue rose by 4 per
cent, but the percentage of revenue from circulation rose to 46 per cent of
the total compared with 33 per cent in 1989.
There was also Pounds 5.9m income from associated companies, 90 per cent of
it from a 15 per cent stake in the John Fairfax group in Australia.
'Our policy has been fairly aggressive on price increases,' Mr Joe Cooke,
Telegraph managing director, said yesterday.
The money is then invested in promotion to try to improve the proportion of
15 to 34 year olds reading the paper.
A weekly 20-page Business News section will appear for the first time this
Saturday. The new sector is designed to strengthen the Saturday paper and
try to lure away some Sunday Times advertising.
The Telegraph will call an extraordinary meeting towards the end of next
month to vote on the plan to buy a stake in Southam, the Canadian newspaper
group.
Hollinger, which owns 68 per cent of the Telegraph, has bought 22.6 per cent
of Southam and proposes to sell half to the Telegraph. The Audit Committee
of the Telegraph, which includes directors such as Lord Hartwell, Lord
Swaythling and Lord Rawlinson, will decide whether to recommend the purchase
to the board.
COMMENT
The Telegraph's performance is a real achievement in the depths of a
recession, although papers such as the Daily Telegraph do engender
considerable loyalty. If there is an significant upturn, particularly in
classified advertising, a high proportion of the revenue will flow to the
bottom line, helped by the tight cost controls. Pre-tax profits could be as
high as Pounds 52m to Pounds 54m this year, giving earnings of about 27p for
an unchallenging p/e of 13. Further ahead, the Southam deal, followed
perhaps by US acquisitions, offer the prospect of enhanced growth.

FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Dixons enters computers superstores
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIXONS, the UK's largest electricals retailer, has entered the computer
superstores business with the Pounds 8.5m purchase of Vision Technology
Group.
VTG operates four PC World superstores in outer London at Croydon, Staples
Corner, Brentford and West Thurrock. In the year to last August it made
pre-tax profits of Pounds 400,000 on sales of Pounds 49.3m, after a charge
of Pounds 400,000 relating to the cost of launching PC World.
A fifth store is due to open in Cardiff, south Wales, later this year.
Dixons said PC World represented the UK's first chain of specialist
out-of-town computer superstores - a concept widely developed in the US.
'We are very excited about it,' said Mr Stanley Kalms, Dixons' chairman. 'It
gives us a running leap into this business and we are buying out a
competitor who is doing very well.'
Mr Kalms said PC World catered for more sophisticated customers looking to
replace and upgrade existing systems, rather than the families and
first-time computer buyers served by Dixons and Currys.
He said Dixons hoped quickly to establish market dominance in this sector,
and planned to open up to 30 PC World stores within 3 years. Each store was
likely to cost about Pounds 1m.

FT  26 FEB 93 / The ICI Demerger: Simple cash raising finds support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECISION to choose a 'plain vanilla' rights issue from Zeneca, to
coincide with the demerger in early June, may have been the price it had to
pay for investor support for the plan.
ICI shares rose sharply yesterday although the size of the issue at about
Pounds 1.3bn is higher than the stock market had expected.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, has had extensive discussions with
institutional shareholders in recent weeks and said yesterday that investors
were in favour of the deal.
One banker involved said that shareholders had indicated that they would
support the deal if their pre-emption rights were maintained.
An underwritten deal - underwriting will take place in mid-May before the
shareholders meet to vote on the demerger - will also give ICI the desired
certainty of finance for the split.
That will ensure that both of the demerged businesses are well-capitalised,
with relatively low gearing. Both companies will be cash positive, ICI said,
and able to fund growth and capital expenditure.
Even though the issue will be a standard rights, Zeneca wants the demerger
and the fund-raising to give it an opportunity to broaden its investor base.
It is keen to find new shareholders outside the UK. At present more than 90
per cent of ICI's shares are held in the UK, and only 5 per cent in the US.
Nearly half of Zeneca's business is in the US.
Mr John Mayo, the former Warburg corporate financier who is the new finance
director of Zeneca, said yesterday: 'We are examining all the options to
make sure Zeneca gets launched on an international basis.'
He said Zeneca was looking at transaction structures which would 'fully
honour pre-emption rights' but give the opportunity for an international
road show and one-to-one presentations to potential investors. These would
take Zeneca's team to the US and continental Europe.
'We will make sure that should foreign investors wish to invest during the
rights period they can come and buy in the secondary market,' Mr Mayo said.
These investors could either buy the rights shares in nil-paid form or buy
the shares issued through the demerger.
Bankers involved expect that there will be loose shares available and are
looking at ways, for example, to match demand in one country with supply in
another. Investment bankers are being invited to put forward proposals.
As part of the process Zeneca's shares will be registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in the US and an American depositary
receipt programme will be put in place.
Mr Mayo said that the 27.5p net dividend promised on Zeneca's shares would
be paid on the rights shares as well. That is expected to give Zeneca a
yield above that of similar companies, which, bankers said, could support
the shares until investors could see more clearly the new products in the
research pipeline.
Financial advisers to the demerger and issue will be SG Warburg, Goldman
Sachs International and de Zoete &amp; Bevan.

FT  26 FEB 93 / The ICI Demerger: Shocked unions to press for redundancies
to be voluntary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LOSS of 9,000 jobs at ICI by 1995 as part of the demerger plans came as
a shock to trade unions yesterday. Half of the cuts will be coming in the
British plants.
'This is a black day in the history of ICI,' said Mr Fred Higgs, chief union
negotiator with the company. 'It will never be the same again.'
The manpower reductions in the UK plants amount to about 10 per cent of the
44,000-strong labour force.
Mr Higgs added that the trade unions intended to 'do everything they could
to minimise the likely effect of ICI's demerger on the workforce'.
Mr Paul Talbot, national officer for the chemical industry in MSF, the
white-collar union, said: 'How can ICI hope to have an industrial future
when they are throwing thousands of highly skilled workers on to the dole?'
The company announced that 7,000 of the reductions in its global manpower of
114,000 will be in ICI and a further 2,000 in Zeneca.
That follows a cut of 21,000 at the combined group during the past two years
and comes on top of a 6,000 reduction expected in ICI's payroll this summer
when the sale of its nylon fibre business to Du Pont, the US company, is
expected to go ahead.
The cutback in employment will not just involve actual jobs losses.
About 1,000 employees will find themselves working for other companies
because of divestments.
However, the unions will seek assurances from management that if there are
to be redundancies they must be on a voluntary basis.
'We have co-operated for five years with ICI to help it avoid a hostile
takeover bid,' said Mr Higgs. 'The unions are not pleased, to put it mildly,
at what the company has announced today.'
However, he ruled out any suggestion that the trade unions at ICI would call
on their members for industrial action. 'Striking would just make the
situation worse,' he said.
The unions intend to press the company to invest more in the UK during the
next few years and to diversify its product range.
They remain extremely worried about the likely effects of the proposed
demerger, however.
Last July, when ICI announced its intention to split the company in two, Mr
Higgs denounced the move as 'a betrayal of the workforce' that demonstrated
'a total lack of commitment by ICI's board to maintain the company as
Britain's largest manufacturing concern'.
'We still do not think the demerger is in the best interests of our
members,' he said yesterday.
'The company is going to become much more vulnerable to a hostile takeover
bid when it is no longer a single entity.'
Two-thirds of the UK workforce will be in the new ICI which is badly
affected by depressed chemical markets.

FT  26 FEB 93 / The ICI Demerger: Pounds 1.3bn rights issue cools investors'
enthusiasm for bioscience demerger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSTITUTIONAL investors greeted ICI's plan to demerge its bioscience
business with resignation but no great enthusiasm yesterday. Several said
they failed to see strong investment attractions in either company.
There was particular concern that, in ending its year with
higher-than-expected debt of Pounds 2.3bn, ICI would have to accompany the
Zeneca demerger with a rights issue as large as Pounds 1.3bn.
'The world is a lot different now from nine months ago, certainly in terms
of the valuation of pharmaceuticals stocks,' said one large institutional
investor. 'And the trading position for bulk chemicals has not got any worse
but it certainly has not got any better. The amount they are seeking to
raise smacks slightly of robbing Peter to pay Paul, in that they have
committed to pay a level of dividend on the difficult bit - the bulk
chemical side - of the business.'
Shareholders were universally unimpressed by the 71p rise to Pounds 11.53
1/2 p in the share price yesterday after the demerger news. Not only did the
rise follow a run of recent falls, but institutions said the stock had
attracted heavy interest from US investors attracted by the yield of more
than 7 per cent. Once the stock went ex-dividend, this interest might be
reversed, they said.
Institutions appeared to need convincing that the alchemy of demerger -
whereby the value of the sum of the demerged parts is greater than the whole
 -would work. 'We are not saying we are against demerger in principle nor
are we saying that the pharmaceuticals division needs to be an integrated
part of ICI,' one invester said. 'But we are struggling to see whether two
and two does in reality make four and half.'
Some shareholders were also surprised at ICI's choice of raising finance
through the demerged Zeneca rather than through ICI.
Given the marked under-performance of the pharmaceuticals sector since ICI
announced it would demerge last year, Zeneca may be rated lower than the old
ICI, which has recovery potential.
There is also a large expectation that ICI's bulk chemicals business is
about to benefit from recovery, even though ICI is fairly dependent on sales
to continental Europe, where economies are slowing down.
Shareholders recognise this operational gearing but accept they will have to
more patient still.
One investor said that unless ICI and its advisers can dissuade them from
this less-than-enthusiastic view, they might sell enough ICI to take up the
Zeneca rights without having to put any new funds into the two companies.

FT  26 FEB 93 / The ICI Demerger: Exceptionals leave ICI Pounds 384m in red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BATTERED BY the long recession and reorganisation costs, Imperial Chemical
Industries, yesterday reported a Pounds 384m pre-tax loss for the year to
December 31, following exceptional charges of Pounds 949m.
Pre-tax profits before exceptional items fell 28 per cent from Pounds 789m
to Pounds 565m as demand and prices softened for many products.
The results were prepared according to the new FRS 3 accounting standard.
The pre-tax profits, which compare with Pounds 843m in 1991, were achieved
on a turnover of Pounds 12.1bn (Pounds 12.5bn). The board maintained the
full-year dividend at 55p with a second interim of 34p, although it was paid
from reserves.
The exceptional charge was to cover restructuring activities, including
disposals, closures, write-downs of certain asset values, a re-assessment of
environmental liabilities and demerger costs.
Rationalisation costs were Pounds 516m, including Pounds 313m for
employee-related costs, principally severance, and Pounds 160m for asset
write downs and provisions.
A further provision of Pounds 148m was made for environmental costs,
particularly for cleaning up soil and groundwater in the US. Loss on sale
and closure of operations provisions were Pounds 191m. Reorganisation costs
for the demerger, including professional fees, product registration and
labelling costs, amounted to Pounds 75m.
Lower selling prices and disposals accounted respectively for 1 per cent and
3 per cent of the fall in sales. Favourable exchange rates increased sales
by 1 per cent. UK turnover fell Pounds 350m, equivalent to 14 per cent of
sales.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman said the results reflected difficult trading
conditions throughout 1992. He added that the recession in the UK, which had
now lasted three years, had been one of the deepest since the 1930s.
'Signs of recovery from recession are patchy, but lower interest rates, a
more competitive pound, low UK inflation and some indications of the US
markets picking up plus the major restructuring efforts should ensure a
better year ahead for ICI and Zeneca.'
On a pro forma basis reflecting the pending split, trading profits before
exceptional items at the newly-formed Zeneca, which includes ICI's drugs,
agrochemicals and seeds, and specialities businesses, fell from Pounds 682m
to Pounds 587m. Sales increased from Pounds 3.93bn to Pounds 3.98bn.
Pharmaceuticals trading profits fell from Pounds 536m to Pounds 488m on
turnover of Pounds 1.61bn (Pounds 1.55bn). Sir Denys said this was mainly
due to the effects of generic competition against Tenormin, Zeneca's heart
drug, the US patents for which recently expired. Sales had fallen by between
40 and 50 per cent instead of the expected 30 to 35 per cent.
Agrochemicals and seeds trading profits dropped from Pounds 145m to Pounds
85m on turnover of Pounds 1.29bn (Pounds 1.32bn). The results were affected
by intense price competition in the US and reduced volumes in Europe. Sales
in eastern Europe had fallen about 30 per cent last year, while the reform
of the common agricultural policy had also had an impact.
Mr David Barnes, Zeneca chief executive, warned the worst of the impact of
the CAP reforms were yet to come, with a possible 3 to 5 per cent fall in
the European market this year.
Specialities operating profits fell from Pounds 29m to Pounds 26m on sales
of Pounds 936m (Pounds 916m). Mr Barnes said the colours business had had a
difficult year.
Zeneca's results included losses of Pounds 12m (loss of Pounds 28m) on sales
of Pounds 148m (Pounds 142m) under the heading of trading and miscellaneous.
The new ICI's trading profits fell from Pounds 324m to Pounds 148m on
turnover fell from Pounds 9.43bn to Pounds 8.89bn.
A breakdown of trading profits showed the paints division fell from Pounds
119m to Pounds 115m on turnover unchanged at Pounds 1.58bn, while explosives
rose to Pounds 59m (Pounds 56m) on Pounds 549m (Pounds 556m), and regional
businesses were Pounds 8m (Pounds 18m) on Pounds 1.35bn (Pounds 1.39bn).
However, there were losses at materials of Pounds 25m (Pounds 13m) on Pounds
1.86bn (Pounds 2.01bn) and industrial chemicals of Pounds 17m (Pounds 144m
profits) on Pounds 3.55bn (Pounds 3.88bn).
Earnings per share before exceptional items fell from 69.2p to 48.8p, or
losses of 79.9p (76.4p earnings) after exceptionals.
Debt rose to Pounds 2.3bn, for gearing of 53.5 per cent, from Pounds 1.58bn
a year earlier. Sir Denys blamed the recession, slower than expected asset
disposals and the impact of the exceptional charge.

FT  26 FEB 93 / The ICI Demerger: Focus will be on core businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ICI left behind after spinning off Zeneca is the world's sixth largest
chemical group, with sales of more than Pounds 8bn a year. It still
manufactures a large range of products: from bulk petrochemicals to
high-performance plastic films, from chlorine and caustic soda to paint and
explosives.
However, the range of activities is likely to be much narrower by 2000. Mr
Ronnie Hampel, chief executive of the new ICI, says the company 'is going to
focus during the 1990s on areas where we can be successful globally'.
That will mean continuing the process, started two years ago, of selling or
closing down activities in which ICI is not one of the world's top three
companies. The UK-based petrochemical (olefins and aromatics) and
chlor-alkali (chlorine and caustic soda) businesses are high on the
disposals list.
'The decision taken in the early 1980s to restrict petrochemicals and
chlor-alkali to Europe turned out to be wrong,' says Mr Hampel. 'The error
of judgment was to believe that the industry could be operated on a regional
rather than a global basis.'
He believes that the world petrochemicals industry is about to undergo
large-scale restructuring, which will end up with about five global groups
manufacturing on an integrated basis from oil and gas feedstocks to finished
plastics. ICI is not going to make the investment required to be one of
them.
Another error of the 1980s, as ICI moved away from bulk commodity chemicals,
was to expand into too wide a range of higher value-added products. That too
will be corrected, Mr Hampel says. 'Some businesses in the portfolio will
not survive. Those that are not global or not making an adequate return on
capital must go.'
The global businesses on which ICI will be relying for growth to make up for
cuts elsewhere include:
Paints. ICI is the world's largest paints manufacturer and, with its Dulux
and Glidden brands, is particularly strong in decorative finishes.
Explosives. The 1990 acquisition of Atlas in the US made ICI the undisputed
global leader in explosives. The products are used mainly in mining and
quarrying, although ICI hopes that safety airbags for cars will represent a
fast-growing new market: a mini-explosion of sodium azide fills the bag with
gas in the event of a crash.
Chlorofluorocarbon substitutes. Although ICI is losing revenue through the
global phase-out of CFCs to protect the ozone layer, it is investing heavily
in ozone-friendly hydrofluorocarbons to replace them. The leading substitute
HFC134a will be manufactured in the UK, US and Japan.
Specialised plastics. By swapping ICI Fibres for Du Pont's acrylics
division, ICI became the world's leading producer of acrylics. It is also
strong in polyurethane foams and polyester films.
The paints and explosives businesses have traded steadily through the
recession. During the three years from 1990 to 1992, sales have held at
about Pounds 1.6bn a year for paints and Pounds 550m for explosives, while
profits were Pounds 115m for paints and Pounds 55m for explosives. The
outlook for both divisions is for slow, steady growth in turnover and
profits.
In contrast, the remaining parts of ICI - materials and industrial chemicals
 -have suffered a decline in sales and profits. They made a trading loss of
Pounds 42m on Pounds 5.4bn turnover in 1992. There is an opportunity for a
sharp revival in profits as the world economy recovers, but analysts see no
prospects of the exceptional returns in the late 1980s.
Mr Hampel says ICI will inevitably remain an essentially cyclical company,
but his long-term aim is to achieve on average a 20 per cent return on
capital employed.
The other executive directors of ICI will be Mr Chris Hampson, Mr Rob
Margetts and Mr Colin Short. Non-executives will be Sir Anthony Pilkington,
Miss Ellen Schneider-Lenne and Mr Paul Volcker.

FT  26 FEB 93 / The ICI Demerger: Tenormin sales collapse hits Zeneca
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZENECA, ICI's newly formed bioscience company, will comprise the group's
drugs, agrochemicals and seeds, and speciality chemicals divisions.
With an annual turnover of nearly Pounds 4bn, Zeneca's products range from
beta-blockers to dyes, genetically engineered tomatoes and herbicides to
anti-cancer drugs. It will be about the 15th largest bioscience group in the
world.
Mr David Barnes, Zeneca's chief executive, faces a considerable challenge
putting the company back on the rails. Last year its operating profits fell
from Pounds 682m to Pounds 587m. All three divisions encountered
difficulties.
The main short-term problem was in drugs. American sales of Tenormin, ICI's
heart drug and once the world's fourth biggest-selling medicine with a
turnover of Dollars 1.18bn, collapsed by as much as 50 per cent last year.
The fall followed the expiry of Tenormin's US patents.
Mr Barnes says the group had expected a fall in Tenormin sales of between 30
and 35 per cent but the drug proved an irresistible target for generic
manufacturers.
'It was the single largest-selling product to come off patent since the
generic industry was set up,' he says. He expects Tenormin's US sales to
stabilise at between 25 and 30 per cent of original turnover.
Tenormin's collapse affected not only sales but also profits, admits Mr
Barnes. Tenormin was a high-margin product. Newer products offset the fall
in Tenormin sales - pharmaceutical turnover was up from Pounds 1.55bn to
Pounds 1.61bn - but operating profits fell from Pounds 536m to Pounds 488m.
Sales of Zestril, a newer heart drug, grew 30 per cent, while Diprivan, an
anaesthetic, and Zoladex, a cancer treatment, both rose by 50 per cent last
year. These three products represent 30 per cent of Zeneca's drugs sales.
Much of the future of Zeneca depends on new drugs in research and
development. Mr Barnes is dismissive of those who argue the pipeline is
thin.
'The quality of the pipeline of new products is better than at any time in
the last 35 years,' he says.
He points to Merrem, an antibiotic, which was filed for licensing last
December. Casodex, a treatment for prostate cancer, and Accolate, a
promising asthma treatment, will be filed next year.
Mr Barnes says the group is moving from its core of anti-cancer and heart
drugs into new therapeutic areas such as asthma, in which the group has less
marketing experience.
'We will look at all forms of strategic alliance,' he says. These will
include cross-licensing, co-marketing and even acquisition. But Zeneca is
not racing out to buy another company.
Nearly all of Zeneca's earnings growth - for this year at least - will come
from pharmaceuticals. The main impact of Tenormin's US decline has probably
come to an end.
Meanwhile, the new products will continue to grow. The group will also
benefit from currency changes - about 40 per cent of drug sales are in the
US.
While the drugs division has been suffering, so, too, have the agrochemicals
and seeds operations. Trading profits fell from Pounds 145m to Pounds 85m
last year on turnover down from Pounds 1.32bn to Pounds 1.29bn. The decline
would have been worse but for rigorous cost-containment.
Pricing pressure and a cold wet spring in the US dented turnover, as did a
30 per cent plunge in sales to the East European market.
Zeneca also suffered from a decline of between 3 and 5 per cent last year in
the west European agrochemicals market after the announcement of the reforms
of the common agricultural policy. Mr Barnes said there would be a
continuing decline in Europe this year, perhaps of between 1 and 2 per cent.
Meanwhile, specialities have also been hit by the recession. Colours, which
represent about 30 per cent of the division's Pounds 936bn turnover, have
been suffering particularly, since their performance is tied to the textile
industry.
Mr Barnes accepts that the division's profits of Pounds 26m on such a large
turnover is unacceptable. However, he insists the colours operations are not
for sale.
For the next couple of years, any improvement in Zeneca's earnings is likely
to come from renewed growth in pharmaceuticals, currency benefits and
cost-cutting.
Specialities should benefit from an upturn in the economic cycle, when it
happens. But the problems at the agrochemicals operations are more related
to structural problems within the industry and are unlikely to be resolved
quickly.
The other executive directors at Zeneca will be Dr Peter Doyle, Mr John
Mayo, Mr Alan Pink and Mr Tony Rodgers. The non-executive directors will be
Lord Chilver, Sir Richard Greenbury, Miss Gill Lewis, Sir Jeremy Morse and
Mr Tom Wyman.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Tokyo struggles to avert fresh stock prices plunge: Emiko
Terazono and Robert Thomson on swift erosion of Japan's market reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO and ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the sixth floor of an otherwise undistinguished Tokyo office building,
the electronic boards of a large securities dealing room flicker on the wall
as white-shirted men hunch over terminals.
The setting is the ministry of posts, part of the government rescue team
attempting to prop up stock prices. Stock prices have fallen 56 per cent in
the past three years.
There are widespread fears that companies, financial and non-financial, will
offload stocks, bolstering their own accounts, but further undermining the
market. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic
Organisations (Keidanren), has expressed 'serious concern' about any
sell-off and the consequent 'price plunge'.
The government has urged banks and life assurers not to sell shares. The
Bank of Japan has cut official interest rates. Disclosure rules have been
relaxed by the finance ministry, which expects that financial institutions
will keep their side of the no-selling bargain.
The campaign is however having a serious side-effect. After a decade of
slow, selective reforms to make markets more open, financial officials are
returning to wink-and-nod tactics. They are reviving the cosy relationships
severed during the stock industry scandals of the past two years.
The four biggest brokers - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko
Securities and Yamaichi Securities - are quick to remind ministry officials
of the industry's successful Black Monday salvage operation in October 1987,
when the Nikkei's fall was limited by concerted buying.
Now the aim is to keep the Nikkei average at about the 17,000 level until
the close of the financial year next month. The longer-term goal is to hold
prices steady until there is a recovery in investor demand for stocks. That
is supported by a range of Japanese institutions now under pressure:
Banks. The lower the Nikkei, the lower their capital adequacy ratios, which
must be above 8 per cent at end-March to meet international standards. The
banks also plan to write off some of the their non-performing property loans
and are keen to limit write-offs on stock portfolios.
Life assurers. They rely on unrealised gains on their stock portfolios to
cover other losses, including heavy losses on foreign bond investments.
Stock profits are needed to make up the difference between the average
dividend, about 6.5 per cent, and the return on the assurers' total
investments. Brokers. They must deal with losses on their in-house stock
portfolios, and they welcome price support.
Industrial companies. Big stock investors during the 'bubble era' of the
late 1980s. Each time the Nikkei falls, they are further weakened. Their
unrealised stock gains, a measure of corporate strength in Japan, are
depleted. Write-offs are rising.
Each sector is waiting for the others to start buying stocks. Most potential
investors feel prices will continue to fall, and dividends are no incentive
to buy; the average yield on Nikkei stocks last year was 0.89 per cent.
Japanese brokers were big sellers last year.
The finance ministry has 'advised' banks, life assurers, and brokers not to
dump stocks this year. The ministry will bend accounting rules and allow
assurers to book unrealised gains.
The ministry is making other favourable rule changes. It has relaxed
controls on employee share ownership. The use of companies' funds to buy
their own shares is now being debated.
These changes will not be enough if stock prices spiral downward. Last
August, the Nikkei hit 14,309.41, its lowest level in six years, prompting
the government to announce that an extra Y1,120bn in public funds would be
available for stock investment. It also announced an emergency public
spending package. Another may be introduced this year, but the use of public
and postal funds is controversial. Japanese who deposit money at the local
post office do so on the understanding that it will be used conservatively.
Japanese brokers, ministry officials, and the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party are looking to history for examples of successful salvage operations.
The obvious model for a rescue is the operation of the early and mid-1960s,
when investment trusts, the Japanese version of mutual funds, were
overwhelmed by loss-making stocks. Demand had virtually disappeared and
fears of broker collapse were rife.
The government established the Nihon Kyodo Shoken (Japan Securities
Co-operative) in 1964, which bought shares with funds received indirectly
from the Bank of Japan. The buying operation was unsuccessful, prompting the
government to back a brokers-run Nihon Shoken Kumiai (Japan Securities
Association), which purchased stocks directly from the ailing investment
trusts and was regarded as a success.
The difference between the two organisations was that the former attempted
to buy against a tide of selling, while the latter attempted to stop the
selling by accepting unwanted shares from the investment trusts.
Another lesson was the importance of collective action. Commercial banks
contributed to the rescue by feeding money into the market. There are clear
signs that the collective mentality is returning.
The securities industries scandals of the past three years were supposed to
end the exclusive relationships among the finance ministry, the brokerages
and the banks. Now severe market conditions have begun to draw old players
together again.
Instead of letting prices fall to a level at which buying will resume, the
government and the financial industry are intent on defying gravity. The
financial system is reverting to old habits, becoming more opaque, and
increasingly serving institutions rather than investors.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Shell lifts profits 8% to Pounds 3bn in spite of lower oil
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROYAL Dutch/Shell group, the multinational oil company, saw profits rise
8 per cent last year in spite of lower oil prices and the first annual loss
in its chemicals business for a decade.
A rise in oil production accompanied by cost-cutting and a boost from
exchange rate gains pushed Shell's profit up to Pounds 3.12bn from Pounds
2.89bn on a replacement cost basis which strips out gains and losses from
holding stocks.
Sir Peter Holmes, chairman of Shell Transport, the company's UK arm, said
1992 had been a difficult year. 'There was little respite on prices and no
respite for chemicals, but the core business did well. Now we've got to move
on and do better on the chemicals side.'
The company made a provision of Pounds 131m to cover its share of the Y125bn
(Pounds 744m) of potential losses on currency speculation at its Japanese
associate, Showa Shell Sekiyu, and said it would make an additional
provision of Pounds 65m in the first quarter.
Sir Peter said: 'I'm staggered by the scale of the losses and staggered it
could happen at all.' Top managers at Showa Shell resigned yesterday as they
accepted the blame for the unauthorised currency dealings.
However, the group as a whole benefited from favourable exchange rate
movements in 1992 to the tune of about Pounds 400m and the company's results
included a special credit of Pounds 425m from changes in pension provisions
in the US.
Sir Peter said the outlook for chemicals was better this year and the
company planned substantial investments in all of its businesses over the
next five years. Capital expenditure is planned to reach Pounds 7bn this
year up from Pounds 6bn last year which showed a 9 per cent decline from the
year before.
He said the chemicals division is planning to cut about 10 per cent of its
jobs, but that investment will be made to increase the division's
geographical spread.
'These figures are quite good, but a lot of the gain comes from currency
movements and that is reflected in the company's extreme caution on the
dividend,' said Mr Nick Antill, analyst at Hoare Govett, the UK
stockbrokers. Shell increased its payout for the year by 4.8 per cent to
21.9p a share.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Hollick splits with view of MGN board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD HOLLICK, the Labour peer, seemed isolated last night as a director of
Mirror Group Newspapers as all the other directors reaffirmed support for
the business policies of the group.
After a meeting called to remove uncertainty about the political stance of
the group, its future business direction, and the leadership of Mr David
Montgomery, the chief executive, Lord Hollick said that he could not fully
support the views of his fellow directors.
Lord Hollick, chief executive of MAI, the television, advertising and
financial services group, is a non-executive director of the popular
newspaper group.
The board yesterday confirmed its confidence in the MGN management and
authorised Mr Montgomery and his colleagues to continue the agreed strategy.
Yesterday's board meeting was also told that Mr John Talbot, the
administrator who holds 54.8 per cent of the shares in the group, has
expressed his confidence in the management and is pleased with the progress
made so far.
The latest row at the Daily Mirror blew up last week when Mr Montgomery, a
former editor of the newspaper Today, brought in Mr David Seymour as group
political editor.
That was seen as an effective demotion of Mr Alastair Campbell, the Daily
Mirror's political editor, who was close to both Mr Neil Kinnock, the former
Labour leader and to Lord Hollick. Mr Campbell resigned.
Ironically, he was yesterday appointed assistant editor of Today by Mr
Richard Stott, the newly appointed Today editor who was himself fired as
editor of the Daily Mirror by Mr Montgomery.
The MGN board emphasised that there never would be any question of the group
changing its left-of-centre political stance.
Sir Robert Clark, MGN chairman, said: 'I am glad that all the other 10
directors, as well as our controlling shareholder, have today reinforced
their support for the management and for the policies we have been pursuing.
Untrue speculation can now be laid to rest.'
Lord Hollick said: 'I have raised a number of concerns. The chairman has
informed me that the board will be looking into these matters and hopefully
steps can be taken to enable me to give my full support.'

FT  26 FEB 93 / NHL to raise funds from mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Home Loans, the troubled mortgage lender, has repackaged most of
its non-performing mortgages into an offering of mortgage-backed securities,
in order to raise funds to repay some of its bank and bond debt. The
process, known as securitisation, allows the company to remove Pounds 175m
of non-performing mortgages from its books, leaving a mortgage book
totalling only Pounds 325m.
It is the first publicly offered issue of sterling mortgage-backed
securities consisting of mortgages which are in arrears.
It is the latest step in NHL's efforts to repay its debt and reduce heavy
financing costs. The company's funding costs soared after the rescheduling
of its debt, when it came close to collapse last June. 'We need to restore
our financial position by de-gearing,' said Mr Nigel Terrington, NHL's
treasurer. 'With this latest deal, we will have paid down 40 per cent of our
total debt in nine months.'
In spite of the poor credit quality of the mortgages, the issue has been
rated triple-A by Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's. The rating agencies awarded
their top ratings because of the high level of collateralisation: the Pounds
105m issue is backed by a Pounds 175m pool of mortgages. Also, interest
payments on the securities can be delayed, to allow for the uncertain
cash-flow on non-performing mortgages.
'The general assumption is that (the mortgages) go bad,' said Mr Paul
Taylor, a director at Standard &amp; Poor's. 'We focused on how much cash (could
be recovered) from the property when it is sold.' As properties are
repossessed and sold off, the proceeds are used to pay interest and
principal to bondholders. much
Investors are prepared to buy the paper, in spite of the weak quality of the
underlying assets and the interest deferral feature, because the bonds offer
a considerably higher return than for other mortgage-backed securities.
The deal, which pays interest of about one point above the London interbank
offered rate, halves NHL's current funding costs on current bank and bond
debt. Other centralised mortgage lenders, including the Household Mortgage
Corporation, have securitised non-performing mortgages, but previous deals
were not privately placed.

FT  26 FEB 93 / British Gas sheds 2,400 jobs after fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Gas said it would make 2,400 job cuts over the next two years after
last year's profits dropped sharply following an increase in competition in
its core UK market and a tough new pricing formula which forced the company
to cut prices. Profits were also hit by warmer weather.
British Gas's profit for last year almost halved to Pounds 681m from Pounds
1.16bn the previous year. An exceptional charge of Pounds 320m to pay for
redundancies, environmental clean-up provisions and restructuring the
corporate centre, accounted for a large part of the decline.
Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, said the job cuts would 'slim down the
contract trading side and respond to the squeeze on margins in the tariff
sector'. He emphasised that the reduction would be achieved through
voluntary redundancies and natural wastage.
The planned cut in the workforce follows the loss of 800 jobs last year and
an announcement earlier this year that the company would reduce its
headquarters staff by 1,200.
Unions have blamed the job reductions on the regulator, which has imposed
the tough new pricing regime and forced British Gas to give up much of its
industrial market share. Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB
union, which represents most gas workers, criticised the company's
management for mishandling its relationship with the regulator, by 'adopting
an arrogant attitude'.
However, Mr Brown said the company's relations with the regulator had
improved. One of the fruits of this was the publication yesterday of a joint
document by British Gas and Ofgas on proposals for the operation of the
company's pipeline and storage business from October, when it becomes a
separate subsidiary.
Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, said: 'We've been making
progress, but there are inevitably points which flare up: it's not bayonets
drawn, but it is not all sweetness and light.'
British Gas's plans, including the job cuts, could be upturned in April when
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission will report on the structure of its
business. Mr Brown said yesterday the job cuts 'do not anticipate the
outcome of the MMC inquiry'.

FT  26 FEB 93 / EC takes 'significant step' to save steel industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRY MINISTERS for the European Community yesterday agreed on a broad
strategy to support Europe's ailing steelmakers, but divisions emerged over
which countries should bear the brunt of deep cuts in capacity.
Ministers and the European Commission said it was now up to EC steelmakers
to put forward concrete proposals for wide-ranging capacity cuts by the end
of September. Except in special cases, closures - which could cost EC
producers 50,000-100,000 jobs - will have to be carried out by the end of
1994. The Commission believes 30m tonnes must be cut in crude steel, and 20m
tonnes in rolled products.
The Commission is expected to submit formal proposals to ministers at their
meeting in May, but Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner, welcomed
yesterday's agreement as 'a very significant step' towards the salvation of
the EC industry.
French and British ministers leapt to the defence of their own industries.
They suggested the main burden of capacity cuts would be borne by Italian,
Spanish and east German industries, which they said had yet to carry out
necessary restructuring programmes.
In return, Mr Giuseppe Guarino, the Italian industry minister, said Rome
would not be prepared to approve an EC-wide plan, unless the Commission and
member states backed his government's proposals for a L650bn (Pounds 296.5m)
recapitalisation of state-owned steel producer, Ilva.
Mr Claudio Aranzadi of Spain said his country was committed to its
controversial plan to subsidise steelmaking in the volatile Basque country
in return for capacity cuts elsewhere. The Commission has indicated that the
balance between aid and cuts in Spain will have to be altered.
Mr Gunther Rexrodt, German economics minister, distanced himself from German
industry predictions that up to 40,000 jobs would be lost in the domestic
industry, and said it was up to steelmakers themselves to decide where cuts
should be made. But he admitted the German government might soon be faced
with difficult decisions about the future of its lossmaking east German
producer, Ekostahl.
Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, said if steelmakers approached
national governments for extra subsidies, they could trigger a futile race
to subsidise national industries.
Ministers were firm on the need for protection from cheap non-EC imports,
although they stepped back from the Commission's suggestion that it should
negotiate three-year tariff or volume restrictions on imports from eastern
and central Europe.

FT  26 FEB 93 / In-car guidance system could help Scots beat traffic jams
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CENTRAL SCOTLAND could be-come the first place in Britain where cars will be
equipped with guidance systems to direct motorists along the best route to
their destination and provide an instant warning of traffic jams.
Cars would be fitted with devices loaded with electronic maps using
technology similar to that of a cruise missile. Drivers would type in their
destination and receive route instructions by voice simulator or display.
The in-car device would suggest alternative routes when traffic jams were
reported and would follow the creation of an integrated traffic management
system. The system would monitor main roads in the greater Glasgow area and
those north and south of the Forth estuary including Edinburgh.
Lord James Douglas Hamilton, the Scottish Office roads minister, is expected
today to name the four companies which have been shortlisted to bid for the
upgrading and expansion of the two existing traffic management systems in
these areas.
The four, pre-selected from 20 applicants to tender for the project, are
thought likely to include GEC, which has developed traffic management and
in-car guidance systems, and Siemens. The first stage will cost about Pounds
12m and the traffic management project will eventually total Pounds 33m.
The new system will use electronic detectors under roads to measure traffic
flows more accurately than the present systems. The data will be fed to a
central computer and information about unexpected hold-ups, and alternative
routes, will be displayed on new roadside indicator boards.
It will also be fed to local radio stations for instant broadcast to cars
with radios fitted to receive dedicated traffic information. Many newer car
radios have an RDS (radio data system) button to receive traffic messages.
Once the new traffic management system is in place, probably by 1995, the
central computer can be used to support in-car guidance systems which would
be introduced on a commercial basis. The Scottish Office will issue a
consultation document today on how this could be done.
The existence of the central computer reduces the entry costs for potential
commercial operators of in-car guidance systems, and therefore the Scottish
Office wants to find a way of financing the entire project which recognises
the advantages to both the public and private sector.
It is considering leasing the traffic management system to the company which
installs it and allowing that company to operate it under contract. In last
November's Autumn Statement, the government eased the rules on mixing public
and private finance in infrastructure projects.
Although a small pilot scheme for in-car guidance is likely to be launched
in a part of London next year, the Glasgow and Edinburgh areas could be the
first in Britain to have a comprehensive in-car guidance system.
A system named Trafficmaster, which informs drivers of the location of
hold-ups, already operates around the M25 and is spreading to other
motorways.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Italy's crisis deepens as key figures face probe: Corruption
investigation draws in more leaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ever-widening investigation into corruption in Italy yesterday claimed
three more leading figures in the political and business worlds, deepening
the crisis over bribes and illegal financing of political parties.
Mr Giorgio La Malfa resigned as leader of the small Republican party, and Mr
Giampiero Pesenti, a top industrialist whose group includes Italcementi, the
country's largest cement company, was granted bail pending charges.
The three cases, although unrelated, combined to overshadow yesterday's
no-confidence debate in parliament. The Amato government emerged from the
debate with the full support of the four coalition parties, heading off what
this week threatened to be a major crisis.
However, shortly after the vote the lira came under renewed pressure when
Moody's, the US credit agency, said it was considering cutting Italy's
credit rating from its present Aa3.
Mr La Malfa resigned from the Republican leadership yesterday immediately
after he had been notified he was under investigation for alleged illicit
financing of the party. The allegations relate to some L50m (Pounds 22,800)
received by the party from the Lombardy industrialists' association, money
derived from professional training courses funded by the European Community.
Mr Pesenti, who voluntarily presented himself to Milan magistrates, was
granted bail pending charges of alleged corruption and illicit funding of
political parties. He is alleged to have paid L7bn each to the Christian
Democrats and Socialists concerning power industry contracts.
Mr La Malfa is the second party leader to be directly affected. Two weeks
ago, Mr Bettino Craxi was forced to step down from the leadership of the
Socialist party, having received no fewer than 11 warrants advising him he
was under investigation for alleged corruption.
Although Mr La Malfa, aged 53, is likely to be asked to stay on as leader of
Republicans, his image has been badly damaged. He has promoted the
Republicans, who won 4.5 per cent of the vote last April, as 'the party of
honest people'. But the threat of losing one of the most dynamic members of
the younger generation of Italian politicians yesterday underlined the way
in which the corruption scandals are eroding Italy's political class.
The business class is being equally damaged. The charges against Mr Pesenti,
who is on the board of the most eminent Italian business groups including
Fiat and Mediobanca, follow the arrest on Monday of Mr Francesco Paolo
Mattioli, Fiat's chief financial officer.
Mr Mattioli was still being detained yesterday in a Milan jail on charges
allegedly relating to pay-outs on a metro contract.
Near Rome yesterday, the body of Mr Sergio Castellari, a former director at
the ministry for state shareholdings, was found. Police said he had
committed suicide. Mr Castellari had been wanted for questioning over the
alleged inflated price paid by ENI, the state oil concern, to Ferruzzi
Montedison for the latter's 40 per cent stake in the chemical group,
Enimont. This was the seventh suicide connected to corruption investigations
since last June.
Mr Lorrenzo Necci, the head of the state railways, was last night also
warned he was under investigation. Mr Necci was served notice of
investigation for his role in the Enimont deal, being at the time the
group's president.
With so many leading figures now implicated, moves were afoot to find ways
to prevent the investigation getting out of hand.

FT  26 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Royal Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Insurance is obliged to make a virtue out of its capital constraint.
Since growth prospects are limited, it aims to improve profitability by
increased operating efficiency. It is thus less likely than better endowed
competitors to succumb to excess in the upswing. Lloyds has shown that money
can be made by shrinking and cutting costs in banking. But Royal is unlikely
to acquire similar status in insurance. For one thing, its competitors are
also bent on greater efficiency. For another, any battle for market share
can ruin pricing for everybody. In those circumstances, a little spare
capital is always a comfort to management.
Royal could hardly raise fresh equity now. Things might look different next
year, given the improving trend on a range of fronts from reinsurance to
estate agency. Its rebased dividend could then be increased modestly and
still be well covered. The market might even welcome a rights issue next
year on the albeit short-sighted grounds that enhanced growth prospects
would narrow Royal's discount to the rest of the sector.
Those with strong nerves might be tempted to hold on until after Royal has
managed to raise some capital and before the proceeds have been frittered
away. That is a gamble, though, which assumes that mortgage indemnity losses
will continue to fall in 1994. The opposite could happen if building
societies step up repossessions as soon as house prices have risen to the
point where the entire loss is covered by insurance.

FT  26 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Shell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The patrician sang froid of the Shell board in London yesterday was in
marked and unwelcome contrast to the ritual slaughter at Showa Shell in
Tokyo. While there are some decent excuses for the failure to pick up the
unauthorised forex dealings, a little public abasement goes a long way
towards drawing the sting of tabloid criticism. It is also a bit thick for
Shell to hide behind Showa Shell's associate status as an explanation for
lack of control. Associate or not, such companies can bite back.
Still, at least Shell could find plenty of plusses to fill in the hole in
its preliminary figures. The artificial assistance of tax credits and,
ironically enough, foreign exchange movements, rather flatter the total. At
the operational level, things remain tough. European chemicals losses are
accelerating and the situation will not improve without substantial
retrenchment. Refining margins remain low and production cannot offer much
further help without a significant rise in the oil price.
Earnings in dollar terms are likely to fall this year, which explains the
cautious 5 per cent final dividend increase at Transport and Trading.
Indeed, the final dividend at Royal Dutch rose by a mere 2 per cent -
presumably because continental investors take a longer view than those in
the UK. Only the continued weakness of the pound will make things look
better, come the 1993 sterling accounts.

FT  26 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Not many companies go to such lengths to highlight their weaknesses as
British Gas. But then not many companies' fates depend so hugely on the
outcome of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry. If British Gas's
directors owned hair shirts, they would surely have worn them yesterday.
Annual profits were hit by Pounds 320m of extremely prudent exceptional
charges. By refraining from capitalising interest on Pounds 1bn of
exploration expenditure, the company further depressed its bottom line.
At the operating level, the results contained few surprises. Ofgas's pricing
regime is clearly squeezing the company, forcing it to cut costs to improve
efficiency. The effects of more rigorous competition are also becoming
apparent. For the moment at least, the weather remains a greater variable
affecting profitability.
Gas's shares are supported by a dividend yield above 6 per cent. The MMC's
conclusions could send them sharply either way. Having seen their shares
climb 20 per cent since the referral, nervous investors may wish to switch
into other utility stocks until the horizon clears. But the suspicion must
be that the company's plight will ease. The MMC is due to report in April -
probably just before the government launches its third sale of shares in
British Telecommunications. That would be an embarrassing moment for the
government come down hard on a privatised utility.

FT  26 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: An Imperial past
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For an exercise designed to enhance shareholder value, ICI's demerger has
got off to a poor start. Paying a portion of this year's dividend out of
reserves only to ask for the cash back in June is hardly the most
tax-efficient way to proceed. If the demerged chemicals side keeps its
promise to maintain the pay-out this year, that may also come indirectly
from the proceeds of Zeneca's rights issue. Shareholders might equally be
forgiven for balking at the Pounds 75m cost of separation. These
misdemeanours will only be forgiven if demerger reverses ICI's long-term
decline relative to the market.
Yesterday's 6 per cent rise in the shares is therefore encouraging. The
promise of a maintained dividend limits the downside in the near term: the
yield is a match for the return on cash. But the act of demerger is unlikely
to unlock much further value. Assuming a yield of perhaps 7 per cent for the
degeared, demerged chemicals side results in a share price close to 500p.
Given the market's suspicion of pharmaceuticals stocks and Zeneca's
lacklustre performance, a yield over 5 per cent might be required to get the
rights issue away. That suggests a valuation for the group not far from
yesterday's closing price.
The real test is whether liberated management can transform the fortunes of
the group. Shorn of cash-generative pharmaceuticals, ICI chemicals will be
under particular pressure to eliminate losses and take out costs.
Yesterday's Pounds 516m rationalisation provision is another step in that
direction. But ICI still looks over-manned, judged against the best of the
competition. If ICI's management does not deliver this time around, someone
else may be tempted to step in and do the chemicals job for them. Split, the
business looks much less imperial than when Hanson bought its stake.

FT  26 FEB 93 / In sight of the summit: Richard Waters says that the current
bull run in the world's main bond markets could lose momentum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bull market in bonds around the world has taken a further, dizzying turn
in the past fortnight. Bond prices have soared, pushing yields down to
levels not seen for more than two decades in the US and UK markets. The
Japanese bond market has risen to heights not touched for more than 25
years, save for a three-month interlude in the 1980s.
Is this bull market about to run out of steam, or is the world economy as
weak as the buyers of bonds seem to believe? Most market observers believe
the top of the market may soon be reached.
'We're not there yet - but we're much closer to it than we have been for a
long time,' says Mr Gordon Johns, a managing director with Kemper Investment
Management, the US fund management company.
The argument for buying bonds rests on the economic slump that has afflicted
industrialised nations. Without economic growth, companies cannot generate
the higher profits and pay the bigger dividends that make investors buy
equities.
Also, with the slowdown encouraging governments in Japan and the US to cut
short-term interest rates to historic lows, investors have had little
incentive to leave cash in short-term deposits with banks or in money-market
instruments. Result: a rush into bonds.
The US bond market has led the surge. The market's bell-wether, the 30-year
bond (known as the 'long bond'), hit its highest level since the early 1970s
at the start of this week. The yield on the bond tumbled below 7 per cent,
encouraged by the economic plan announced by President Bill Clinton in his
state of the union address last week.
The romance between Mr Clinton and the bond market has been remarkable. Last
autumn, the prospect of a Democratic victory in the presidential election
for the first time in 17 years seemed a bond investors' nightmare. The
market feared the incoming president would bring in measures to stimulate
the economy, in the process stoking up inflation and adding to the US fiscal
deficit.
Mr Clinton's tax-raising and deficit-reducing plan has eased those fears. In
the past week, the yield on the long bond has fallen from 7.12 per cent to
6.82 per cent. This suggests a high level of confidence in an untried
president, whose ability to push through a tough economic package is still
uncertain.
The leap in bond prices in Japan has been equally marked. Last summer, the
yield on the benchmark government bond No 145 stood comfortably above 5 per
cent. An admission by the authorities that the real economy was slowing down
sharply after the collapse in property and share prices since the end of the
1980s forced the yield down to 4.5 per cent by the turn of the year.
Earlier this week, the yield fell below 4 per cent. The rise of the yen has
provoked fears that Japanese exports will become less competitive, further
undermining the country's manufacturing sector. Finance minister Mr Yoshiro
Hayashi said earlier this week that another reduction in the country's
discount rate - cut to just 2.5 per cent earlier this month - could follow.
The buying spree in part reflects disillusionment with equities. The Nikkei
average is stuck at about 17,000, less than half its peak in 1989, and
investors have little confidence that share prices will rise soon. As a
result, they have channelled money into bonds.
That contrasts with the 1980s bull market, when Japanese bonds rose with the
stock market. 'This time, it's the sort of buying you get in a slump,' says
Mr Stephen Lewis, an economist at London Bond Broking Company. 'Bonds are
simply the least bad investment.'
By comparison, Europe's bond market rally seems almost sedate. Nevertheless,
the yield on long-dated UK government bonds (gilts) fell below 8 1/2 per
cent a fortnight ago, its lowest level since the early 1970s.
Can these price rises be sustained? At least three factors suggest that the
bond markets are entering testing times, and that further gains depend on a
break with recent investment trends.
First, real (after-inflation) yields stand at low levels by recent
standards. The average real yield of the three main bond markets (the US,
Japan and Germany) dropped from 4.6 per cent two years ago to just 2.9 per
cent at the start of this year, according to Kemper Investment Management.
During the 1980s, real yields averaged 4 per cent.
This suggests either that bond investors expect inflation rates to fall
further, or that they think the threat of resurgent inflation has receded
and are prepared to accept lower real returns. It may be a return to the
pre-1970s investment landscape. Before the oil shocks of that decade knocked
confidence in low-inflation growth, real returns were noticeably lower (in
the 1960s, they averaged 3 per cent). Even on this yardstick, though, the
main bond markets have reached testing levels.
The second factor restraining bond prices is the relationship be-tween
equity and bond yields. The pattern in the UK in the 1980s was for bonds to
yield more than twice the level of equities, reflecting the way anticipated
inflation benefits equity investors while hitting bond markets. The ratio of
bond to equity yields has now fallen below two.
In the US, meanwhile, bonds yield about 4 percentage points more than
equities, roughly the level they have held for the past three or four years.
Bond prices will only rise further if this relationship shifts.
That could be about to happen, according to observers such as Mr Lewis. He
argues that investors in the US have overly optimistic expectations of
earnings growth in US companies as the economy comes out of recession. As
their hopes are disappointed, he expects a switch from equities into bonds.
However, he adds that this would give only a limited extra lease of life to
the bond market because of the historically low level of yields.
The third shadow over the bond markets comes from the large overhang of
bonds that governments around the world will have to sell this year. Members
of the G7 group of leading industrial nations are expected to raise more
than Pounds 500bn between them to finance the large budget deficits that
have resulted from economic downturn.
Borrowing needs of several European countries threaten to outpace the
capacity of their domestic bond markets, forcing them to the international
bond (Eurobond) market for money. Italy, Sweden and Finland have borrowed
internationally this year. This competition for capital could prevent
long-term interest rates falling, limiting further gains in bond prices.
The combination of these factors is prompting investors to review their
exposure to bonds. 'The case for being bullish on bonds is nowhere near as
clear as it has been,' says Mr Johns of Kemper Investment Management.
Nevertheless, there may still be areas of growth. Markets in Europe where
currencies are still tied to the exchange rate mechanism should offer the
best hope. High German interest rates have kept European bond yields higher
than they would otherwise have been given the slowdown in the European
economy. Further easing of the Bundesbank's monetary policy - provided it
does not imply a relaxation of Germany's anti-inflationary stance - can only
be good for bonds.
However, even here prices could have risen too far, too fast. With financial
markets anticipating a quick fall in German short-term interest rates,
10-year bonds have fallen sharply this year, nudging below 7 per cent 10
days ago.
For the other big markets, the market peak seems even closer. There may be
little current risk of an inflationary spiral, sending bond prices crashing.
But the world economy will need to take a further lurch towards the abyss if
the bull market in bonds is to maintain its recent momentum.

Although the official winners of the Weekend FT's crossword competition on
February 13 won't be announced until tomorrow, Observer is awarding a
special advance prize to Jimmy Page of Richmond, Surrey.
When someone bet him he couldn't complete the puzzle, offering odds of a
half-bottle of scotch to his stake of 50p, his first thought was that a
magnum of champagne to 5p would have been a fairer reflection of the risk.
But he had a go, failed, and paid up.
The reason why he merits a full bottle of malt is not so much that he fell
short by only two of the 32 clues in the crossword, as that he is 97 years
old.

year's unhelpfully clement weather.
The atmosphere was hardly improved when the letter 'h' fell off the British
Gas sign which was hanging behind their heads and clanged on to the floor.
'Times are hard and the squeeze is on,' muttered the deadpan chief
executive, Cedric Brown, through gritted teeth.

Another small explosion behind the scenes at the new-look Labour party. Lord
Bill Wedderburn, Britain's leading authority on trade union law, has
resigned from Labour's front bench in the Lords on the eve of its debate on
the trade union reform and employment rights bill.
Lord Wedderburn, the 65-year-old Cassel professor of commercial law at
London University, has spent the past 14 years fighting Conservative
industrial relations legislation in the Lords.
But he has grown increasingly frustrated at what he sees as the lack of
enthusiasm inside his party at resisting those parts of the latest measure
that curtail trade union rights.
Current Labour tactics consist of concentrating on opposing the abolition of
wages councils and trying to improve the government's bill on sex equality
issues, but keeping away from proposed changes in more sensitive clauses
that cover trade union organisation, such as the right of a worker to join
any union of his choice.
Wedderburn can't stand this sort of pussy-footing any longer and intends to
get on the record his own objections to the bill from the backbenches.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Observer: Problem for the Gatt pack
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If a job's worth doing, it's worth doing well. The old saw may be in the
mind of ousted Canadian premier Brian Mulroney whose name has rapidly joined
those being canvassed as a successor to Arthur Dunkel as director-general of
the fate-temptingly named General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Canada's involvement in international trade questions should have given
Mulroney the background to do the Gatt job as well as any of the others
mooted as candidates.
He is on first-name terms with most of his fellow G7 leaders and has the
added experience of knowing how to hold together a country which, like the
international trading system, is in danger of disintegrating.
However, he is not the only understretched international statesman looking
for a big job. The names of Lord Lawson and Peter Sutherland, the Irish
predecessor of Sir Leon Brittan as the European Community's
competition-policy commissioner, have been mentioned, as has Mexico's
President Salinas, even though he's not expected to step down until next
year.
The problem for all of them, however, is whether the job will be worth doing
after Dunkel's half-year extension of his term in the post runs out this
summer. The answer is impossible to predict while the plight of the Uruguay
Round of talks on world trade liberalisation hangs in the balance - and with
it the plight of a more powerful Multilateral Trade Organisation.
If the talks fail, Gatt and its secretariat could be marginalised, deterring
any budding global deal-maker from considering the job, which in turn could
hamper the institution's ability to strong-arm world leaders to commit their
nations to further trade liberalisation.
No wonder the staff at Gatt's headquarters in Geneva are currently talking
gloomily about vicious circles.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Merseyside covets neighbour's lifestyle: Ian Hamilton Fazey
on the contrasting fortunes of two cities in the north-west of England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Market forces are playing havoc with north-west England. The European
Community this week proposed Merseyside should be downgraded in Europe's
league table of economic distress to Corsican levels, qualifying for extra
funding.
Yet only 35 miles away, its old rival Manchester is celebrating. Next week
the Pounds 265m first phase of Manchester Airport's Terminal 2 will open - a
symbol of economic resurgence. This week, the city beat off London and
Santiago de Compostela in Spain to stage this summer's world chess
championship match between Garry Kasparov and Nigel Short. In September, the
city hosts the second Earth Summit and will hear if its bid for the 2000
Olympic Games has succeeded against the front-runners, Sydney and Beijing.
This is the league a buoyant Manchester is playing in. But Merseyside wants
to spoil the party: local leaders say Liverpool airport should be expanded
from 400,000 to 12m passengers a year. Their proposal would preclude the
need for a second runway at Manchester airport, which Manchester wants to
handle 30m passengers a year by 2005, compared with its present 12.4m.
Since the second runway would intrude into the affluent Cheshire green belt,
Merseyside will join some of the north's richest residents next year to
fight it on both environmental and economic planning grounds at a public
inquiry.
Planners estimate that every 1m passengers a year passing through an airport
generate about 1,000 jobs. The five Merseyside boroughs - Liverpool,
Knowsley, St Helens, Sefton and Wirral - want them funnelled where they are
needed most.
Merseyside's unemployment rate of 17.5 per cent compares poorly with Greater
Manchester's 11.4 per cent, which is nearer the national average. The
latter's economy is diversified and has withstood the current recession
well, while Merseyside's has continued to struggle.
Indeed, the economic tide has been running against Merseyside for most of
the century. The Right Reverend David Sheppard, bishop of Liverpool, says:
'In every recession, Merseyside has gone down further and faster than
anywhere else and has never recovered to the level from which it started.
Unemployment here is not cyclical, but chronic and structural.'
Changing patterns of trade, coupled with new technology in bulk shipping and
stevedoring, have continuously reduced demand for unskilled labour and
port-related services in the Mersey docks.
The catalyst for reversing decline, says Mr Ian Berry, chief executive of
Liverpool Chamber of Commerce of Industry, 'is to improve strategic sites
and create a better image'. Many of these sites are derelict and near
Liverpool airport.
Mr Harry Rimmer, leader of Liverpool City Council and an airport director,
says EC money would go towards reclaiming derelict land and improving road
and rail links between the airport, motorways, railways - and Manchester.
He says Merseyside was already on the slide before the financially
disastrous period of 1983-87, when Militant, a Marxist grouping he has
helped purge from the Labour party, controlled Liverpool council.
The area had 619,000 jobs in 1977, but by 1981 this was down to 560,000. The
figure dropped further to about 480,000 by 1986 and about 420,000 in 1990.
Most lost jobs were manual. Most of the area's employment is now in service
businesses, which require an educated or skilled workforce.
An exodus of people with the wrong skills, unable to get work locally, saw
Merseyside's population shrink by 276,000 to fewer than 1.4m between 1971
and 1991 - the most rapid rate of contraction in Britain in that period.
Paradoxically, depopulation has not seriously damaged the tax base and local
spending power, because the remaining workers are better paid.
What drags Merseyside down to EC disaster levels, however, are 47,000
long-term unemployed. Mr Peter Stoney, a Liverpool University economist,
says more than three-quarters of these are male manual workers and half live
in council houses, so they cannot move.
'We need the type of economic growth that will match the quality of the
labour available. Retraining has not had a noticeable effect,' Mr Stoney
says. 'We need more port-related and 'brown' (manufacturing) industries.
Leisure and office developments push land values above what manufacturers
can afford.'
No-nonsense business parks for manufacturers, clustered around an expanding
airport, might do the trick, thinks Mr Rimmer. But if Manchester gets its
second runway - never mind the Olympics - Merseyside's fear is that it will
always be the poor relation.

</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FOUR-THOUSAND more UK jobs to go at ICI, 2,400 at British Gas
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
day by day the toll continues. The scale of the cutbacks at some of
Britain's leading companies is striking. Is UK industry in a
self-reinforcing spiral of pessimism?
Behind the wave of cuts lie the pressures of an agonisingly long-drawn-out
recession. But there are also deeper trends.
In all developed countries, there is a steady fall in the proportion of the
labour force engaged in manufacturing production. The shrinkage of
employment in the manufacturing sector as a whole - a drop of 16 per cent in
the UK since 1988 - if anything understates this, since more and more
manufacturing workers have service-type jobs, in design, marketing,
after-sales, and so on.
Europe must also cope with the restructuring of production and distribution
during the creation of an integrated regional economy. Any individual
European economy is likely to gain jobs from this process as well as lose
them - but in hard times bad news is always more striking than good.
Though services are destined to play a larger role in future employment,
they have been undergoing their own shakeout, in both the US and the UK.
Middle-managers in big companies, clerks in banking and insurance,
stockbrokers and telephone engineers - no service occupation has been
immune. Deregulation and privatisation are special cases of this trend.
At worst, these forces are inescapable. At best, they contribute to the
long-term health of companies and the economy: everyone gains from the cost
savings forced on British Gas by its regulator.
Still, there was something in the tone of yesterday's message from ICI - the
emphasis on continued cost-cutting, the born-again ruthlessness about
businesses which fail to meet profitability targets - that hints at the
emergence of a mood of contagious pessimism among British industrialists.
That darker mood will serve a purpose if it is accompanied - as at ICI  - by
a willingness to address difficult strategic issues. Companies that do not
ask themselves such questions are not helping their shareholders or their
employees. Pessimism alone is not a strategy.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Not so special
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Major yesterday seemed well satisfied with his first meeting with
President Bill Clinton. Indeed there is no reason to think it went badly.
But it would have had to go very badly for Mr Major to say so in public,
since its main purpose was to demonstrate, for British domestic consumption,
that the 'special relationship' is still in working order.
The truth is that this relationship is special above all in its
lop-sidedness. For a time the personal respect and affection of the then
President Ronald Reagan for the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher did something to
offset the manifest inequality between their two countries. But even the
afterglow of that time has now faded.
All the world can now see is, on the one hand, a self-confident young
American leader, fully engaged in an ambitious project of national recovery
and not in the least disposed to be sentimental about any foreign country;
and, on the other hand, a nervous and defensive British leader whose project
has already been derailed. Mr Major desperately needs to be seen to get on
well with Mr Clinton. Mr Clinton has no reason to quarrel with Mr Major, but
that is as much as one can say.
On two issues Mr Major's advisers claim that he was able to influence the
president. On one of them, the handling of the war in Bosnia, the Clinton
administration has indeed moved closer to the European view and away from
its early twitches of more forthright interventionism - but this change
occurred a fortnight ago. All that happened this week was a fairly simple
bargain: Mr Major agreed to swallow his doubts about the wisdom of
parachuting relief supplies into the Moslem enclaves, in return for being
publicly exempted from participation, with a gracious acknowledgement of
what British troops are already doing on the ground.
On the other issue, trade, the differences are real and important. It will
have done no harm for Mr Clinton to be reminded personally by a European
leader of what is at stake. But no one should imagine that by reiterating
his commitment to a successful conclusion of the Uruguay round he actually
shifted the US position on any of the points in dispute; still less that Mr
Major was able to convince him that European governments' advances to the
Airbus consortium are not really subsidies. If anyone did think so, they
will have been disabused yesterday by the US trade representative, Mr Mickey
Kantor, who revealed that he is asking for 'special consultations' on Airbus
before the present agreement expires in July.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Italian question
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH EACH passing day, the political crisis in Italy more closely resembles
a fin de regime. One by one, some of the highest in the land are toppled by
a spreading series of corruption scandals. The political parties that ran
the country in shifting anti-communist coalitions during the cold-war
decades are discredited to the point of illegitimacy. Top public and private
sector company managers find themselves in increasing numbers behind bars.
The government teeters and the lira plunges. Beneath it all, a groundswell
of public discontent is forcing fundamental political change on to the
agenda, and if Italy's ruling class fails to find an adequate response, it
may simply be swept away.
That change was on the way has been increasingly apparent since general
elections delivered an unprecedented rebuke to Italy's established parties
last April. The coalition government created in response, under the deputy
leader of the Socialist party, Mr Giuliano Amato, set out an ambitious and
long overdue programme of economic reform. It has managed  - by political
guile and by dint of the weakness of traditional party bosses - not only to
survive but to push through a surprising number of changes to Italy's
bloated welfare state and its ossified wage-bargaining system.
But it always had something of the air of a transitional regime, and that
impression has become irresistible in recent weeks. The main reason is the
spreading array of investigations into senior politicians and businessmen
being conducted by magistrates up and down the land. Emboldened by strong
public support, the magistracy has provided detailed evidence of a network
of bribery and corruption that reaches into the fabric of Italian political
and economic life. The politicians have been paying the price - from Mr
Bettino Craxi, who was forced to resign as Socialist leader earlier this
month, to the latest casualty, Republican Mr Giorgio La Malfa.
As a result of all this, and of the government's own divisions, Mr Amato's
government is clearly living on borrowed time. Its sole realistic raison
d'etre is now to survive long enough to oversee changes to Italy's voting
system that will enable new general elections to be held later this year.
Even the shaping of the new system is out of the hands of the established
politicians, and will probably be decided by referendum in April.
New elections are the only way that Italy will begin to pull itself out of
the present morass, and it would make no sense for them to be held under the
current system of proportional representation, which has been in some
measure responsible for the country's history of weak government. After the
proposed plebiscites, Italy will probably end up with a mixed system of
first-past-the-post and proportional systems, which at least stands a
greater chance of presenting voters with genuine political choices and the
possibility of alternance in power.
However, such technical changes are only a first, small step towards the
more thoroughgoing constitutional, political and economic changes Italy
needs, including greater transparency in the operations of its public
sector, radical reform of the state budget and of party finances, vigorous
privatisation of state assets, and a more sensible distribution of power
between central government and the regions.
Indeed, tinkering with the electoral system without more broad-based reform
could just as easily exacerbate Italy's existing divisions, with the
regionalist Lega Nord predominant in the north and the Christian Democrats
in the centre and south. The result could be stalemate, further damaging
drift on fiscal and other policies, and even ultimately the break-up of the
country.
Any newly elected Chamber of Deputies and Senate will have to assume the
role of a constituent assembly with the task of drafting a new constitution,
and confronting the real dilemmas Italy's political system has enabled it to
duck for so long. That is what the voters, in the south of the country as
much as the north, seem to be ready for.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Letter: Government should remove bias against full-time jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr FRANK FIELD MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Edward Balls writes ('A scar that will persist for years to come',
February 18) on the high level of unemployment which will continue to exist
after the UK economy recovers from the present slump. One reason why the
outlook is so pessimistic for the unemployed is, he says, that
'technological change and competition from low-cost producers in developing
countries has reduced the demand for unskilled labour other than in
low-wage, often part-time employment. These jobs have . . . been mainly
taken by female entrants into the labour markets'.
Evidence on part-time working is usually cited in support of this view.
Since June 1978, well over 2.5m full-time jobs have been lost. Over the same
time there has been an increase of more than 1.25m of part-time jobs.
Indeed, a third of those in employment now work part-time. This trend is way
out of line with other European countries, with Britain currently employing
40 per cent of Europe's part-time workforce.
But is this due to the market forces which Edward Balls describes? Or are
there particular circumstances in Britain which make such an outcome
inevitably unfavourable to those wishing to seek full-time employment?
I would suggest that such an outcome is inevitable, given the way the
contributions for national insurance are structured. Employees and employers
pay no contribution on the first Pounds 54 of earnings. When creating new
posts, many employers bear this in mind and often offer part-time rather
than full-time posts. Some employers, Burton is a recent example, are now
cutting full-time jobs and offering only part-time work.
I believe it is time that these national insurance rules were looked at
critically. I would hope that the government would consider in next month's
budget levying national insurance contributions for employers from the very
first pound of earnings. As the move would not be aimed at raising
additional revenue (which would be an additional tax on jobs) the overall
level of employer contributions would therefore be adjusted to make the move
revenue-neutral.
Such a simple change would remove the present bias which is working in
favour of creating only part-time employment. It would not, of course,
prevent employers and employees negotiating packages of less than full-time
employment. But it would mean the removal of the current penalty which
operates against the creation of full-time posts.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Modest step for reformers: Political tensions will limit the
scope of India's budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Demonstrators, armed police and the smell of tear gas were the talk of Delhi
yesterday. Tomorrow it will be economics.
The Indian government survived an important challenge by suppressing a
planned mass rally by Hindu militants in the centre of the capital. Tomorrow
it meets an equally significant test when Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance
minister, presents his annual budget and launches a new phase of India's
wide-ranging reform programme.
When he addresses parliament, Mr Singh must try to convince the nation and
foreign countries that the passions raised by the destruction of the Ayodhya
mosque last December have not deflected the government from the vital task
of modernising the economy and opening it up to international trade and
investment.
He faces a daunting challenge, given the determination of the Bharatiya
Janata party, the rightwing Hindu party whose supporters stormed the mosque,
to prolong the atmosphere of political crisis. As Mr Kantikumar Poddar, the
president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry,
says: 'This is a very important budget for the country because of the
uncertainty which has been created about the future of economic reform.'
Mr Singh does not have political support for the kind of radical measures
which might turn the spotlight away from Ayodhya. Mr Narasimha Rao, the
prime minister, prefers to keep his head down, in the hope that the storm
raised by the BJP will blow itself out. So instead the finance minister is
likely to present a modest package - and hope it will be enough to keep
India on the road to economic recovery.
He will take credit for the measures he has carried out so far, including
cuts in protectionist customs duties, easing restrictions on foreign
investors, reductions in government subsidies, and the scrapping of much of
the 'licence raj' - the system under which companies needed government
permission to build or expand factories. Last summer's scandal in the Bombay
securities market and the Ayodhya crisis limited the speed of reform in the
second half of last year, but the government has sought to regain the
initiative in the past month with a spate of announcements, including the
partial liberalisation of state-controlled fuel prices.
The finance minister will also point out the fruits of these changes: he has
pulled India out of a balance-of-payments crisis, curbed government
borrowing and cut inflation in half to about 7 per cent a year. With the
help of a good monsoon, economic output is growing this year at a steady
annual rate of 4 per cent, up from 1.2 per cent in the year to March 1992.
Exports are increasing and foreign investors have pledged about USDollars
1.3bn in the past 18 months - more than in the previous decade.
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund pronounce themselves
satisfied with India's progress. As the government's annual economic survey
said this week: 'The phase of crisis management is over.'
The question is what comes next. The budget is almost certain to contain a
reduction in import duties of perhaps 20 percentage points from a current
maximum of 110 per cent. There could be tax changes to encourage
private-sector investment and some extra incentives for exports. The finance
minister may also signal further liberalisation of the foreign exchange
rate, a move which would allow the rupee to devalue, so helping exporters.
All these non-controversial measures will be welcomed by Indian and foreign
businessmen alike - and can be done with little fear of opposition.
The finance minister is likely to propose further cuts in government
borrowing, which has already fallen from 8.4 per cent of GDP to 5 per cent.
His preferred route will be to reduce subsidies for fuel and fertilisers, in
order to pave the way for free pricing in these vital markets.
But the scope for cuts is limited. Last year, farmers, the biggest
beneficiaries of hand-outs, protested so strongly against reductions that
they had to be paid compensation. This year, with the government weakened by
the Ayodhya crisis, ministers will tread even more warily.
Mr Singh is also expected to press ahead with financial market reform, which
was delayed by last year's scandal in which Rs35bn (Pounds 814m) was
diverted from banks into the stock market. A top priority for reformers is
the restructuring of the state-owned banks on commercial lines. In
particular they want changes in a rule which requires them to put 30 per
cent of their deposits into low-yield government accounts - a drain of
credit away from industry.
However, Mr Singh is limited by the fact that these funds are a cheap source
of finance for the government. So banking reform is dependent on reform of
public spending - including cuts in support for state-owned industry and
consumer subsidies.
If reform of subsidies and of banking will be limited by political
considerations, a third important area - redundancy laws - will probably be
off the agenda. The government believes that, to help promote investment, it
should relax restraints on employers' powers to dismiss workers. It has been
told as much by businessmen, including the British delegation which last
month visited India with Mr John Major, the prime minister.
But ministers have been wary of advancing reform for fear of political
opposition, particularly from the left. In the wake of the Ayodhya crisis,
the ruling Congress (I) party needs support from leftwing parties and labour
unions to help counter the rightwing BJP and its allies. So, Mr Singh is
even less likely to be bold in this area than he was before.
India, therefore, will not rush its reforms. With each passing month, Mr
Rao's liberalisation programme looks less like a blitz and more like a
drawn-out campaign. The democratic tradition, the decentralisation of power
to the provincial states, and the ability of the bureaucrats to block
changes that might threaten their power all serve to stifle change. Ayodhya
is yet another excuse for going slow. As Mr Freddie Mehta, a senior director
of the Tata group, India's largest industrial group, says: 'You can't go as
fast as Margaret Thatcher in India.'
The problem is that some challenges will become harder with the passage of
time. The longer it takes for the government to cut wasteful public
spending, for example, the longer it will be before funds are available to
invest in education and infrastructure. Half of India's population is
illiterate. A quarter of the electricity produced is wasted through
inefficient transmission.
The government hopes that the current reforms will lay the foundations for a
substantial jump in the rate of economic growth, perhaps to 7 per cent a
year. With such a leap, India will be able to generate funds to meet some of
its chronic investment needs and attract foreign capital. But such a
take-off is still some distance away, and Mr Singh's budget is likely to be
but a modest step in the right direction.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Letter: UK mechanical engineering sector can fight back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr P SALISBURY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Andrew Baxter ('Charting the mechanics of decline', February 22) makes
reference to the fact that UK industrialists complain that they are forced
to buy foreign equipment. He goes on to say that process plant contractors
say it is 'no longer possible to buy big UK-produced compressors'.
As managing director of Peter Brotherhood, I can assure him that large gas
compression equipment, whether reciprocating, centrifugal or screw machines,
is manufactured in the UK, most notably by ourselves in Peterborough. While
I cannot speak for any other UK manufacturer, I can assure him that process
plant contractors, and other customers, continue to buy our equipment on the
basis that our quality, delivery and prices are competitive with those of
any other manufacturers throughout the world.
In view of the dismissive comment about the British machine-tool sector by
the head of a German machine-tool company, I can only hope that the
complacency contained in his remarks continues.
While there are many aspects of German industry worthy of study, my
experience of buying specialised equipment from Germany is that the
equipment is often delivered late, of poor quality and accompanied by an
attitude on commercial matters that borders on arrogance. On that basis,
maybe UK industry can start to fight back.
Finally I would say that size is not the issue with regard to the mechanical
engineering sector. Neither indeed is the absolute value of currency.
What really matters is the ability of UK companies to penetrate their
markets properly and to offer high-quality goods delivered on time, and
manufactured cost-effectively. If we get these matters right, then
everything else will follow.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Faint signs of life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's Labour party is showing faint signs of recovery from the torpor
into which it sank last April. Its leader, Mr John Smith, has begun to find
his feet. He is performing better in parliament. He is also, in his own way,
stage-managing the half-modernisation of his party, to the extent that his
cautious nature permits. Although not good enough, the process is
significant.
For the past two weeks Mr Smith has managed to excoriate Mr John Major so
effectively that on Tuesday the prime minister took up the traditional whine
of the contemporary politician in trouble. The Labour leader, Mr Major
bleated, is indulging in 'sound-bite' politics. Titch. Some of Mr Smith's
remarks about how unemployment has risen under the Tories have turned up on
the radio and television news. Voters might have overheard.
The extent to which the electorate is taking any notice at all of
politicians who have so signally failed them is questionable. None of the
parties has an attentive audience right now. Backstage, however, some of
what Labour's conservative critics have been asking for is being taken
seriously. This should be acknowledged. What might pass, in a poor year with
the lights out, for a 'new' Labour party is being constructed. Mr Smith set
the tone in a speech in Bournemouth on February 7. Labour's goal, he said
then, 'must be about the advancement of individual people'. This could only
be fully achieved, he added, 'in the context of a strong and supportive
society'.
Oops. Wait a minute. What did he mean by 'strong and supportive society'?
Not state ownership, or excessively high taxation, or 'government simply for
its own sake'. But, believe you me, untold shelf-miles of regulations. 'In
the modern world, you simply cannot leave everything to the market any more
than you can leave everything to the state,' said Mr Smith. Coming from a
Tory moderate, such a remark might sound unexceptionable. Coming from a
leader of the left wing, it arouses suspicions.
Labour is the creature of the trade unions that founded it. In whose
interests would regulations be drafted? Mr Smith needs to spread the belief
that the answer is us, as citizens and consumers. He needs to be convincing.
That is why he moved on Wednesday to weaken the hold of the unions over the
party organisation. They commanded 40 per cent of the votes in the electoral
college that chose him last July. He now favours excluding them from future
party leadership contests. He would also have unions excluded from the
process of selecting parliamentary candidates, although on this he offered a
sop - a future register of union members who support Labour - to soothe any
wounded feelings.
Then he blew it. The trade union bloc vote at Labour's annual conference
provides annual sound-bites that confirm that the unions run the party. The
bloc will command a mere 70 per cent of the votes this year, down from 90
per cent. Mr Smith now supports a gradual reduction of the union presence to
50 per cent, as the number of individual members increases. As he said this
week, that is not a divorce; he never wanted a divorce. Yet the suspicion
that Labour is the tool of a powerful vested interest will persist until
there is an arm's-length relationship with the unions. They should live
separately, as do the Democrats and the AFL-CIO in the US. The unions can
always send a cheque through what will soon be the privatised mail.
Mr Smith is also being too cautious about the removal of clause 4 - the one
interpreted as threatening the old-fashioned nationalisation of industries -
from the party's constitution. He regards this as of little concern to the
average voter. True, but it is no use deploying the words 'new' and
'renewal' 25 times in a 37-minute speech, as he did at Bournemouth, if there
is to be no symbolic deconstruction of Labour's socialist past.
There are also significant noises coming from other Labour spokesmen. The
twin slogan - individual and community - is being deployed to some effect.
As I suggested on Tuesday, Mr Tony Blair has the Tories rattled with his
attacks on their record on crime. Mr Gordon Brown is two speeches on in a
series in which he will seek to convince us that Labour's 'new economics' is
a serious alternative to the government's non-strategy.
Mr Brown has not yet found the magic formula. His 'investment in people' and
'partnership' between industry and government sound Clinton-esque. He is
calling for more competition for the privatised utilities. He might evolve
into a credible trust-buster if he stops being over-enthusiastic about
regulation and stops over-stressing the cross-directorships between Tory
MPs, ex-ministers, and the new companies. In the delicate art of attacking
the Tories on their right flank Mr Blair is the master, Mr Brown the
apprentice.
Mr Smith's unique selling point may be his passion for constitutional
reform. Britain is 'one of the most centralised states in Europe', he
pointed out in his acceptance speech. 'I want . . . a future that puts power
back in the hands of our citizens,' he said in Bournemouth. He will be more
specific at a meeting of Charter 88 on Monday, although he will be coy about
proportional representation. He will doubtless speak of his belief in
regional government, devolution to the Celtic nations, a bill of rights and
a freedom of information bill. In his view, the latter would include
consumer rights and corporate information.
The Labour leader is an admirer of the German federal constitution, and a
true believer in decentralisation - unlike his predecessor, who never bought
devolution, and quite unlike Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's former deputy
leader, who gagged on the bill of rights. When he packages all this as a new
'open society' Mr Smith may be able to command greater verisimilitude than
does Mr Major with his carefully controlled Citizen's Charter.
This emphasis on constitutional change is music to my ears, but it is hardly
pop. It would be a treat to say that Mr Smith is bringing British political
debate back to life. Alas, it is far too early to draw any such happy
conclusion. We are still saddled with an ineffably weak government that
appears likely to complete its term, and an opposition that seems
insufficiently aware of how radically it must change if it is to win next
time.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Letter: A suggested cure to the problem of surplus ACT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTOPHER DAWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Howard Davies (Letters, February 23) is right on diagnosis but wrong on
the cure. 'Surplus ACT' is indeed an incentive to move costs offshore.
Unpalatably, however, an effective cure would increase the tax bill of those
companies which are now complaining.
Contrary to general perceptions, the ACT system positively encourages
companies to invest overseas, up to a point. This is because they reduce
their UK tax bill by paying dividends out of the overseas profits and
claiming, quite legitimately, that the dividends come from UK profits. Of
course, this analysis regards the ACT as a withholding of income tax on the
gross dividend, and not as a tax on the company profits, as your leader of
February 19 ('Budget for the supply side') states.
If the overseas profits go beyond a point - typically around half of group
profits - the company will have made this claim to the full and will run
into 'surplus ACT'. It will by then be paying only 8 per cent tax on all its
UK profits.
A well-advised chancellor would stop dividends funded from overseas profits
being used to reduce UK tax bills. UK companies would then find they had a
marginal corporation tax rate of 33 per cent and would no longer have a tax
reason to export their administrative and development functions. This move
would increase the tax liabilities of most UK companies investing overseas
and put them on to the same footing as overseas companies investing here.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Letter: Income stream
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN DUFFIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Paying for roads' (February 23), referred to 'the lack
of any income stream from the roads'. I do not know how much income the
government gets from excise duty on petrol and road fund tax, but, as Damon
Runyan would have put it, if this is not an income stream from the roads, it
will do until an income stream comes along.
Given this, any further income should be raised by increasing one or both of
these. The marginal cost of collection is nil, so the take is
correspondingly maximised.

Sir, Michael Arditti is to be congratulated on his article 'Drama at the

</HEADLINE>

   From Mr ROBERT JENKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The battle between the large customer and the small supplier is rougher
than Michael Cassell ('The dangers that lurk in delay', February 23) makes
out. A couple of weeks ago a colleague and I went to a large customer which
owed what was to us a large sum - the debt going back five months. All
telephone attempts to get the debt had received the now usual response of
'the cheque is in the post' and similar excuses.
We waited patiently for more than three hours until we eventually got to
meet the company's finance director. His view was stark - his company had
not produced the necessary internal documentation to allow him to pay us. So
he was not going to pay us. Bad luck, goodbye]
We persisted as courteously as the circumstances permitted, only for me to
end up in hospital with damage to my spine resulting from the finance
director losing his cool and tipping me on to the floor.
And the company still hasn't paid up.

Broadcasters seem incapable of adopting a sane policy on repeats. Either
they fail to provide second screenings for programmes that clearly deserve
them, or they run so many together that viewers protest. Tonight BBC2 packs
its schedule with repeats of The Man From UNCLE, Doctor Who, Red Dwarf V,
and Heimat. True, Red Dwarf (9.00), which parodies all those space sagas
from 2001 to Aliens, is one of the best of the current comedy series, and
Heimat, (11.20) the long story of a small country town in Germany on either
side of the Second World War, is one of the most impressive drama serials
ever made. Yet it still seems barmy to show quite so many repeats on the
same evening. Two slabs of Marks and Spencer drama clash: The Good Guys runs
for an hour on ITV starting at 9.00, and Love Hurts runs for an hour on BBC1
starting at 9.30. The Good Guys with chance acquaintances Nigel Havers and
Keith Barron playing knights errant, is one of those ideas that look better
on paper than on screen. Love Hurts with ill-assorted lovers Adam Faith and
Zoe Wanamaker, wealthy plumber and trendy charity worker respectively, is
usually better.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Arts: Pauk and Kirshbaum - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Radio 3's Monday lunchtime broadcasts, live from St John's, Smith Square,
have long served us as reminders that serious concerts need not submit to
the standard two-hours-plus format. Monday's recital by the violinist Gyorgy
Pauk and the cellist Ralph Kirshbaum was a rewarding case in point. Here we
had a piquant pairing: a near Old Master, as Pauk certainly is, known
equally for his objective musical penetration and his virtuoso finesse - and
a much younger, ultra-sincere American whose musicianly intimacies are his
great trump.
There is no violin-and-cello repertoire but the duo-sonatas of Ravel and
Kodaly; but instead of doing the obvious and playing both those duo-sonatas,
or exhuming some forgotten duo for the sake of variety, Pauk and Kirshbaum
began with expansive unaccompanied solo works. The violinist chose neither
lofty Bach or Bartok, nor brilliant Paganini or Ysaye, but old Prokofiev's
Sonata op. 115 (1947) - designed for performance by student violins in
unison, posthumously published and still virtually unknown.
Prokofiev must have had senior students in mind, for his writing presupposes
quite advanced technique and confident bravura attack. Under Pauk's bow it
sprang to tough, pungent, wholly characteristic life: we can no longer count
this as a negligible work. Kirshbaum opted for Bach's Suite no. 1 in G, and
addressed it with as much authority as he invested it with personal,
moment-to-moment feeling.
These performances prepared the way superbly for Ravel's 1922 duo-sonata.
Though it used to be thought dismayingly astringent, its stern merits have
lodged it in the repertoire willy-nilly. Nothing could introduce it better
than Prokofiev's robust, linear wit and Bach's leanly expressive patterns.
Ravel's instrumental pair afforded him room for more exposed contrapuntal
friction than he had previously dared, and Pauk and Kirshbaum gave the music
full value without any mollifying gloss. The muscular shifts of tone in all
the quicker tempi were stark, unlubricated, compelling. The scherzo
suggested a properly baleful subtext - and yet the slow movement was wistful
enough to betray a clear echo of the Andantino of Debussy's long-honoured
string quartet.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Arts: On the Piste - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Godber's plays are immensely popular. Only Alan Ayckbourn among living
British playwrights attracts a bigger audience. It is easy to believe in his
appeal. When Dave (Ivan Kaye), the used car salesman in On the Piste,
describes girlfriend Bev (Gillian Tompkins) as 'something to do when the
pubs close' he gets a hiss that would have pleased any villain in Victorian
melodrama.
Godber catches the speech and prejudices of the working class with the
facility of a writer of television soaps, and his plots would seem familiar
to an addict of EastEnders. His magic ingredient is to set the plays in
specific oddball locations - a night club in Boun-cers; a rugby club in Up
'n' Under: and an Austrian skiing village welcoming its weekly band of
British holidaymakers in On the Piste.
This has toured the provinces for some time but has been drastically
re-written and re-designed for its London debut. The biggest change is to
the sets, by Julie Godfrey. These are truly impressive, as nursery slope
follows mountain top, with a sauna and hotel lobby thrown in. Few actors can
have addressed the West End suspended from a stalled ski lift. For the first
10 minutes you marvel as the actors snow plow and traverse down the astro
turf (the secret is to line the skis with baby bubble-bath), and speak their
lines, too.
It is a fresh approach for Godber, who traditionally favoured minimalist
sets and plenty of action, but gives an undoubted fillip to the evening. The
plot is familiar - the falling apart of a group of no hopers who by the end
have had as miserable a time as the cast of Hamlet - but some characters are
woefully under written and strangely unbelievable.
Tony, the ski instructor, is the only link with Austria (the action could
really take place anywhere), and although Peter Birch is chillingly familiar
as he goes through his weekly sales pitch to his band of ski virgins you
never quite know whether he is as superficial as he seems or dying quietly
inside. You might like to guess whether he sleeps with frustrated Alison
(Julia Deakin), superior Melissa (Stephanie Pack) or good natured Bev.
Melissa, too, the Sloane fallen among plebs, never gets her moment at the
confessional, and remains elusive, and in making the nerdish Chris (Paul
Bown) a successful voice-over in TV commercials Godber is way off-target.
Olivier, Welles, even Angus Deayton, have milked this lucrative and much
sought after profession.
Still there are pleasures along the way as we re-learn the familiar lesson
that men are bastards and women are weak. Bev, with her macaw voice and
bruised heart, is a memorable character, and the involved audience, well
seasoned with skiiers, loved it, happy to laugh at the tumbles, cry with the
rejections, and shriek with embarrassment at the sauna scene. Bob Thomson
directs.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Arts: Romantic views of nature - Susan Moore admires the
landscapes of JC Dahl
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Johann Christian Dahl's heroic landscapes, of thundering waterfalls and
mountains majestically rising under brooding skies, established him as a
leading Romantic painter and the founding father of the Norwegian school. In
carefully orchestrated canvases such as the 9ft-wide 'View of Stalheim', it
seems as if the gentler natural dramas of Ruisdael and Everdingen have been
transferred to the untamed North. 'A landscape must not only show a
particular country or region, it must also represent the character of this
country,' he wrote in 1841: 'It must speak to the sensitive beholder in a
poetic way.'
What we find in an imaginative loan exhibition opening at the Whitworth Art
Gallery in Manchester, is the more intimate work of Dahl and his protege
Thomas Fearnley. Their oil sketches, watercolours and drawings are little
known outside Scandinavia, but they are immediately familiar. For Dahl and
Fearnley are revealed to belong to that mainstream of early 19th century
European painters - from Constable in England to Corot in France and Dillis
in Munich - who sought truth in Nature by scrutinising and recording her
often fleeting effects in the open air. This relatively modest show
triumphantly places another piece into the still unfinished jigsaw of
European naturalism.
At a time when nationalistic impulses prompted most European landscape
painters to focus their attention on their native land, Dahl was obliged to
go into artistic exile. Although recently freed from Danish control, Norway
had no formalised system of art education and no means of providing a living
for an ambitious artist. Copenhagen, the cultural capital of Northern
Europe, was an obvious first stop, a Wanderjahre in Italy essential. Dahl
was to settle finally in Dresden, becoming an intimate of Caspar David
Friedrich. He returned to Norway only five times, making study trips that
resulted in the earliest paintings of the country's most remote and dramatic
regions.
He appears to have painted outdoors almost from the start. 'View near
Presto' of 1816 - which he described as a 'study from nature' - seems an
attempt to reconcile the landscape style of the Dutch masters with the new
directness of the widely admired plein-air oil studies sent back from Paris
and Rome by the Danish master CW Eckersberg. The precise handling of the
foreground vegetation is echoed in the careful, scrupulously observed
graphite and wash drawings here of rocks, trees and boats. It is the
experience of Italy, of working in oils directly before Nature in the
time-honoured tradition of the resident foreign artists, which seems to have
liberated Dahl's art.
Faced with the heat-hazy panorama across the Bay of Naples, for instance, he
instinctively lightens his palette and improvises with his brush in an
attempt to seize the limpid atmospheric effects. In a prospect of Ischia his
fluid touch is assured. The unusual 'Scene from the Villa Malta' in Rome
shows this ever-changing artist harking back to the classical lucidity and
heightened colour of the Italian oil studies of de Valenciennes and Thomas
Jones.
For all his directness, Dahl cannot resist introducing favoured Romantic
devices. We are encouraged to take a subjective view of nature either by
looking through open windows or through the eyes of isolated foreground
figures who stand, backs towards us, silhouetted against the gloaming. Dahl
may not invest his landscape motifs with symbolic meaning like Friedrich,
but it is tempting none the less to detect a reverence in the face of God's
creation - and some significance in, say, his decision to record the salvos
of cannon shot fired at dawn on Easter Day.
No one could dispute the immediacy or the emotive power of the astonishing
small moonscapes and cloud studies painted in and around Dresden. These
alone make the exhibition a must. The latter beg comparison with the closely
observed skies of Constable, 14 years his senior. Revealingly, Constable -
like Turner - applied the lessons learnt in the field to the working
practices of the studio and in so doing developed an entirely new and
dynamic pictorial language. For Dahl and the majority of the early 19th
century plein-air painters, oil sketching remained an entirely independent
activity, a personal response to nature painted for its own sake.
The even less known and more peripatetic Thomas Fearnley, the grandson of a
Yorkshire merchant's representative who settled in Norway, proves a markedly
different artistic personality. His works are confident, deliberately
monumental and theatrically Sublime - he is another Francis Danby of
Romantic art. Dahl dubbed him the 'Professor of Effect Landscape Painting'.
His oil studies are none the less joyous, remarkably facile, sumptuously
rich and freely painted. A visit to the show amply reveals why Dahl advised
the Nasjonalgalleriat in Oslo to buy these nature studies rather than the
finished paintings.
'Nature's Way: Romantic landscapes from Norway' continues at the Whitworth
Art Gallery, University of Manchester, until March 27, and shows at the
Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, April 20-June 20

FT  26 FEB 93 / Arts: ENB's 'Swan Lake' - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
English National Ballet has just presented us with a new Swan Lake. More
exactly, the company has invited Raissa Struchkova, greatly loved ballerina
of the Bolshoy Ballet for more than three decades, to mount a version of the
production which she knew in her home theatre during the 1940s and '50s. And
as frame for it, the designs that Carl Toms made for ENB's Swan Lake
before-last have been restored. The result is an effective and acceptable
presentation.
The company's track record with this ancient death-trap has not been happy.
One staging in the mid-1960s brought financial ruin; others have played
merry hell with the text; much of the designing has been unspeakable.
The rescuing of the Carl Toms decorations reveals them as being better than
memory recalled in the John Field production for which they were made in
1984.
A Gothic palace, a mistily evocative lake, a grand ball-room, provide
excellent locations for Mme Struchkova's production.
Costuming tends rather to an unsaturated and creamy beige, but outlines are
handsome, and when von Rothbart has been treated for his make-up - galloping
sequinitis - all will be visually well.
In matter of staging, Mme Struchkova has clearly had to reduce and edit the
text she knew as ballerina, but the choreographic vision is consistent and,
mostly, coherent.
The first three acts - and there is, mercifully, no attempt to jam acts
together in order to shorten running time - are the text according to
Alexander Gorsky, who made no less than five Swan Lake recensions in Moscow
in the first decades of this century when he directed the Bolshoy Ballet.
The choreography is fluent, interesting in its patternings. The final
lake-side act is that provided by Asaf Messerer for the Bolshoy in 1937.
None of this choreography can efface the merits of the Petipa/Ivanov text we
know, but it is sympathetic to its dancers, and to its viewers. There are a
few navetes, and the national dances of the third act - staged and rehearsed
by another Moscow artist, Alla Boguslavskaya - are beyond the competence of
any Western European dancers. (When Natalia Makarova staged ENB's previous
Swan Lake she excised them, rather than see them abused. As performed by the
Russian artists they can be the best thing of the evening: a look at a
currently available video of the Kirov Swan Lake testifies to this. But
Petersburg and Moscow train specialists in national dance; we give them to
the nearest available dancer). Only the tarantella, brightly done by Alice
Crawford and Eugenio Scigliano on Monday night, when I saw the staging,
looked credible.
This Swan Lake, as with so many Soviet-age productions, has the happy ending
demanded by socialist realism. Love conquers von Rothbart's spell, and
though the stage action sits oddly on the music (and von Rothbart's last
moments are not unlike a man trying to tango with himself), we are spared
the sight of Odette and Siegfried going to paradise in a spectral dodgem
car. We accept the good emotional intentions.
The production, in sum, is a success, and more than that, it has engaged the
attentions of ENB's artists, who are dancing with a sense of purpose that
seemed missing in the quagmire of last season's repertory. But Swan Lake is
still a 19th century ballerina-vehicle, and in an age perilously short of
artists worthy of the title, this must present serious problems. Agnes Oaks,
the Odette/Odile on Monday night, has a clear, true physique.
Her view of the double role is dutiful, but as yet she has not found the
lyric urgency, the hallucinatory beauty, that will bring this choreography
to full emotional life. At her best, in the final act, she shows a grieving
dignity that is appealing, and a largeness of physical outline to make the
final happy resolution credible.
It is Thomas Edur, as Siegfried, who dominates the evening by the elegance
of his means. As a dancer, his every step, every action, is polished,
graceful. His manner combines purity with very considerable technical
resource - movement deeply satisfying not just because he jumps high, turns
well, but because he shows how noble is his art in its physical ideals. As
an actor he is sensitive, and establishes a climate of feeling proper for
the action. His 'quietness' on stage is fascinating: nothing is forced, or
misshapen by temperament. He is an aristocrat, and he dignifies everything
he dances.
In an age over-populated with swans - most of whom, as readers of these
columns must be aware, are hideous mutants - this staging does its duty by
Tchaikovsky and by the popular image of Swan Lake.
It shows not only what audiences want to see, but what they deserve to see.
And that is no mean achievement.
English National Ballet is touring this new 'Swan Lake': at the Mayflower
Theatre, Southampton until February 27; at the Manchester Opera House from
March 8 - 13. The production is sponsored by Unilever

FT  26 FEB 93 / Arts: Royal Liverpool Philharmonic/Kempf - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The controversy over the return to favour of examinations in the
government's education policy has been a reminder of how difficult it is to
evaluate the performance of students in any subject area. Competitions, in
particular, cause heated debate in musical circles, especially when they pit
one instrument against another, as does the BBC's Young Musician of the
Year.
It has always seemed to me that the pianist there enjoys an unfair
advantage. The concerto repertoire is so much wider; the virtuoso
opportunities so eye-catching, if the competitor chooses a big, romantic
piece. Frederick Kempf (born 1977) won last year playing Rakhmaninov, but in
his case it would be difficult to argue against his first place. Kempf did
not play like a child prodigy. He sounded a genuine musician, who just
happens still to be young.
For his Barbican concert on Monday, with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic
Orchestra, he chose Rakhmaninov again: the Third Piano Concerto. It was an
ambitious undertaking, for the concerto is hard work for young fingers. Much
of the first movement seemed to be sensitively played, but it was
underprojected, leaving the orchestra to lead the way.
His energies, however, were being conserved. The cadenza brought
determination into play; the lead out of it was magical, the scale of the
playing suddenly better judged. All of the slow movement had a fine,
impulsive lyricism and the finale scampered off towards a scintillating
finish at a pace that the conductor, Libor Pesek, had no intention of
allowing. For all that, Kempf showed that he has a real interpretation of
this concerto in the making.
If Pesek kept his young soloist rather sternly in check, he was
correspondingly lax with the orchestra during the opening movements of
Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique. Ensemble was not sharp, nor were the
textures very clear. The best playing came in the final witches' sabbath,
where the forward drive at last started to make the flesh tingle a bit: the
bells, tolling noisily out from on high, really did sound like an invitation
to hell.

FT  26 FEB 93 / People: AITC picks stockbroker
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Association of Investment Trust Companies has again gone outside the
immediate confines of the industry to find its next boss, replacing Philip
Chappell, who retired last November because of ill health.
Ernest Fenton, who had latterly been chairman and chief executive of
Greenwell Montagu Stockbrokers, has spent almost all his working life in
stockbroking, having joined W Greenwell in 1968. Chappell, credited with
having greatly raised the profile of the investment trust business, had a
largely merchant banking background.
'We wanted another fresh face,' says AITC chairman Paul Manduca. 'He has run
a business, he has good communication skills and he is steeped in the City.'
Fenton, 54, whose Scottish pedigree will be regarded as an asset in an
important quarter of the industry, says he has become increasingly
interested in investments trusts in recent years; he was closely involved in
setting up the Fleming Income &amp; Capital investment trust a year ago and has
gone on its board.
Greenwell Montagu Stockbrokers was merged into James Capel last autumn as a
result of the Hongkong Bank takeover of Midland.
Whereas Chappell, who spent only two or three days a week on the job, was
plain old 'director' at the AITC, Fenton becomes the association's
'director-general', a full-time position, reflecting how the business has
grown.
'Clearly there is still a big job to do in educating the consumer about
investment trusts,' Manduca says, adding that work has just begun on
convincing independent financial advisers of the industry's merits. 'But
Fenton will need to be more methodical and planned in what he does. You
cannot expect investment trusts to lift their marketing expenditure in the
current climate of falling dividends across British industry. In the
short-term, he will have to use existing resources more effectively'.

FT  26 FEB 93 / People: BBC's new finance director chosen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The former group financial control director of Midland Bank has been
appointed director of finance and information technology at the BBC. Rodney
Baker-Bates who will take up his appointment on March 22.
Baker-Bates, who was born in Liverpool and educated at Shrewsbury School and
Hertford College, Oxford, succeeds Ian Phillips who was director of finance
and chairman of BBC Enterprises, the commercial arm of the BBC.
In December Phillips sought an assurance about his long-term future from
John Birt, then director general designate. When he did not receive such an
assurance, he decided to resign.
The finance director's job has since been expanded to take in responsibility
for information technology. A chartered accountant, Baker-Bates, 48, joined
Midland Bank in 1984 and held several positions; a casualty of the Hongkong
Bank acquisition of Midland, he left at the end of last year.
Previous posts included the group finance directorship at Orion Bank, and he
has also worked for consultants Arthur Andersen, spending six years working
on major IT projects.
Although Birt said yesterday that Baker-Bates brought great financial
strength and experience to the BBC 'and will ensure the effectiveness of all
our finance functions and information systems', he will also have to try to
ensure that there is no repetition of the over-spends or potential
overspends of the past two years. Birt recently estimated the total involved
over the two year period as Pounds 59m.

FT  26 FEB 93 / People: Henderson moved at Alexon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The campaign to get women into commanding positions in British publicly
quoted companies has sufferred a setback with the latest reshuffle at
Alexon, the clothing company, where Ruth Henderson has been stripped of her
chief executive's title.
Ruth Henderson became chief executive in June 1991 when Alexon demerged from
Claremont Garments, the Marks and Spencer supplier. However, following a
reorganisation of board responsibilities Henderson has been named joint
chief operating officer.
Alexon says this is not a demotion for her, although it does mark promotion
for the joint holder of the title, Peter Ridsdale. Neither has had a salary
change. In 1991-92, Henderson earned more than Pounds 160,000.
Since a decline set in in Alexon's performance - it has warned of a Pounds
1m pre-tax loss in 1992-93 - there has been speculation about Henderson's
position. One source close to the company said it was no more accurate to
portray the decline as her fault than to praise her for the previous good
performance.
It was hoped that a side effect of the announcement would be that the
company would no longer 'suffer the high-profile problem of having a woman
chief executive'.
Henderson will concentrate on product and merchandising; Ridsdale - who came
from the Burton Group in September 1991 - will focus on marketing and
retail. The group has recently relaunched its two main brands: Alexon
womenswear and Dash leisurewear.
The share price, which peaked at 444p about 18 months ago, closed unchanged
at 80p yesterday.
A few quoted companies have female managing directors; two reported results
yesterday - Frank Usher and Honeysuckle Group, both USM-quoted fashion
companies.

The Japanese are now going wild over something the British have had for
years - a cassette which calms crying babies and persuades them to sleep.
The soundtrack, put together by Roger Wannell, of Somerset, combines three
rhythms with a background of 'pink' noise. Although to adults the track
sounds like a washing machine, to a baby it sounds like a combination of the
mother's womb and the human voice. The British Technology Group has licensed
the soundtrack to Victor Musical Industries, a subsidiary of JVC. JVC:

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Biotechnology specialist Genzyme, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, has been
granted clearance to sell a test kit to US laboratories for measuring the
level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol - or 'bad' cholesterol -
in the patient's bloodstream.
LDL is recognised as a primary factor contributing to coronary heart disease
and atherogenesis - clogging of the arteries. The kit enables laboratories
to measure directly the levels of LDL in a sample and so cuts down the time
needed to get the test results to the doctor and patient.
The traditional method of determining LDL involves indirect measurements
using calculations and means the patient has to fast for 12-14 hours before
the test is conducted. Genzyme: US, 617 252 7570.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Counting on the zeta potential
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZETA potential has little to do with starry galaxies or even movie starlets.
It involves the way particles interact in a liquid.
When ions in the liquid attach themselves to the charged particles, they
affect the speed with which the particles move. This velocity (the zeta
potential) can be measured when an electric current is applied.
By measuring the zeta potential companies can calculate how liquid products
will react over time and so cut down on testing. Lots of movement means the
liquid will form a long-lasting emulsion - good for face creams - while a
low score means the liquid will destabilise, useful in oil recovery.
The Zetamaster, from Malvern Instruments, should enable medium-sized
companies to carry out the tests at the press of a button. Malvern
Instruments: UK, 0684 892456.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Technology: On target with a single shot - Paul Abrahams
continues a series on drug discoveries by examining the latest advances in
vaccines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the remote south of Zambia, not far from the banks of the Zambezi river,
about 50 women sit under the shade of an immense tree. All carry infants,
most less than a year old. Some mothers have travelled nearly 50 miles on
foot, carrying children on their backs for up to two days.
The mothers' trek allows them to participate in the worldwide battle between
disease and man-made vaccines. The event is part of the Expanded Programme
of Immunisation, run by the World Health Organisation. Its aim is to
vaccinate children against six childhood diseases: polio, measles,
tuberculosis, diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus. By the end of 1990,
the programme had helped inoculate 80 per cent of the world's children
against these diseases. The target is 90 per cent by 2000.
The vaccines involved in the programme are well-established products that
have considerable drawbacks. The main problem is although those for
diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough can be injected together, other
vaccines cannot be used simultaneously because they interact with each
other. Others have to be boosted by further doses to create immunity. This
means the Zambian mothers will have to repeat their journey if their child
is to be fully immunised. The logistics involved mean not all children
complete the vaccination course.
In addition, many vaccines are heat-sensitive. In tropical countries with
little primary health care, a special transport infrastructure must be built
up specially to ensure the vaccines have been kept cold and are still
potent.
However, the application of biotechnology and, in particular, recombinant
DNA technology, is leading to a second generation of vaccines. These are
more resistant to heat and less likely to interact with each other. They are
also safer than first-generation products, with fewer side-effects. These
new technologies are also opening up the possibility of inoculation against
a far wider range of diseases, ranging from herpes and hepatitis to Aids and
even certain forms of cancer.
The creation of vaccines for diseases against which it was previously
impossible to inoculate is driving the growth of the world vaccine market.
Previously, vaccines were low-priced, high-volume commodity products. The
sector was dominated by demography - how many new-born children required
vaccination.
However, the market, valued at about Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn), is
expanding at 15 to 18 per cent by value, faster than the traditional
pharmaceuticals market, according to Institut Merieux, the French group. The
new products, for the most part generated through biotechnology, can be
patented and therefore command higher prices than their traditional
commodity counterparts.
The market growth has been helped by a reduction in the level of litigation
associated with vaccination. Some vaccines create side effects in a small
number of patients. In the US, vaccine companies found themselves involved
in product liability claims.
First-generation vaccines come in three forms.
Live vaccines are based on weakened strains of the micro-organism causing
the disease. These provoke an immune response from the body without
generating the full-blown disease. When an inoculated patient is later
infected naturally, the body's immune system is ready to react against the
disease.
Inactivated vaccines involve creating immunity by injecting micro-organisms
that have had the dangerous elements within them inactivated or have been
completely killed. The obvious risk associated with these killed vaccines
remains the danger of injecting patients with only partially inactivated
organisms. Outbreaks of tuberculosis and polio have occurred because of
poorly prepared vaccines. On the other hand, if the inactivation is too
effective, then poor immunisation occurs - sometimes even leading to
patients being more sensitive to later infection.
The third type of first-generation vaccine involves inactivated toxins -
such as tetanus.
The second-generation products are mostly based on recombinant DNA
technology. This allows the previously hazardous attenuation process to be
carried out more effectively. The genes within an organism that lead to the
disease can be identified, and then inactivated or cut out. The weakened
organism can then be bred by using something as simple as yeast. When
injected into the body it creates an immune response.
The rapid growth of the market is driven by new products for previously
untreatable diseases. Ignace Goethals, senior vice-president of SmithKline
Beecham's vaccine business, believes 40 per cent of the world market is made
up of hepatitis vaccines. Eight years ago, none existed. Sales of SB's
Engerix-B, a hepatitis product, grew from Pounds 103m in 1991 to Pounds 267m
last year.
The next generation of products to drive the market will be multi-dose
products, combining a number of vaccines in the same dose, says Michel
Greco, European director at Institut Merieux. The eventual aim, set out in a
WHO programme called the Children's Vaccine Initiative, is to create a
super-vaccine. This should require only one or two doses, be given orally,
be heat stable, have a low rate of side effects and be affordable.
However, while a laudable target, the super-vaccine is technically a long
way off, says Greco. In the medium term, any vaccine is likely to remain
injectable rather than oral. Institut Merieux is registering a product which
covers diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, HIB (against meningitis) and
polio in a single injection. The next aim is to add hepatitis B, which
should be developed by 1997.
In the long term, one technology that should prove useful in creating
multidose vaccines is microspheres, says Greco. This would involve covering
the different vaccines with retardant coatings that dissolve at different
speeds. These should allow the vaccines to be released into the body at
different times, preventing interaction. But this technology could take 20
years to develop.
The rapid expansion of the vaccine industry has led to changes in its
structure. In the past, the industry has been dominated by a few competitors
with international sales structures, notably Institut Merieux and SmithKline
Beecham in Europe and Merck and Lederle in the US.
Although the market is growing fast, the barriers to entry remain immense,
says Greco. They include:
Large development costs. A long-term Swedish clinical trial designed to test
the safety of a whooping cough vaccine involves 50,000 children.
Significant manufacturing costs. Each product needs to have its separate
production line and often a separate building to prevent contamination.
Ensuring that vaccines are potent but not dangerous requires considerable
expertise.
Marketing reach. To keep down production costs, companies must be
international, supplying large volumes around the globe.
Products. Groups must be able to supply customers with the range of products
they need. Moreover, as multi-dose vaccines become more important, companies
must have access to the range of vaccines necessary to put them together.
In spite of these entry barriers, the emerging technologies allow small
companies to enter the industry. They are typically biotechnology companies
that create a vaccine but do not have the means to develop and market it.
Their products are instead licensed to the larger groups.
Although growth in the vaccines market has been rapid, the sector remains
concerned that pricing could hold it back. This month US President Bill
Clinton attacked the industry, claiming low US vaccination rates were due to
the high prices of vaccines. SB's Goethals denies this, pointing out that 90
per cent of vaccination costs are related to the healthcare infrastructure
and only 10 per cent to the vaccine.
Paradoxically, the single-shot vaccine programmes originally aimed at
reducing the burden on those mothers by the Zambezi may also boost the
health of America's inner cities.
The series continues next month with a look at drugs for the treatment of
high blood pressure.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Management: Driving force - Audi's new chairman has
inherited ambitious plans for the German car group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A wooden oar looks more than a little incongruous leaning against the wall
in the glass, chrome and leather office of Audi's new chairman.
But Franz-Josef Kortum, 42, sets great store by the welcoming gift presented
to him by Ferdinand Piech, who moved out in January to take the wheel at
Volkswagen, Audi's lacklustre parent.
It is a symbolic reminder of the responsibilities of a steersman, says
Kortum. But it also has what amounts to an explicit directive burnt into the
blade: 'Audi, the most attractive European in the world market.'
Piech's parting homily lacks the appeal of the brand's world-renowned
'Vorsprung durch Technik' slogan, but then the author is an engineer, not a
copywriter. Kortum, by contrast, is a salesman, hardened on the forecourts
of the family motor business, tempted away from Mercedes-Benz last May to
take charge of Audi's new marketing division and promptly bumped up to the
top job in Volkswagen's showpiece subsidiary.
His arrival from relative obscurity outside the closed circuit of Volkswagen
management, his youth and his business background provide ample fuel for
speculation on Piech's mould-breaking intentions within VW's hide-bound
central bureaucracy in Wolfsburg.
Despite the apparent risks of appointing a young unknown, the clues Piech
left behind at Audi show the new group chairman is no gambler. He prepared
the ground meticulously before handing over. Plans to extend the model range
 -with a new flagship V8 car at the top and a cheaper model to slot in below
the popular Audi 80 at the bottom - were already well advanced at the time
of his departure. A dedicated marketing division, separate from that of VW,
was established a year ago.
Since then Piech has replaced most of the old hands at the Audi helm. Most
recently, he poached a production director, 48-year-old Jurgen Gebhardt,
from his job as manager of General Motors' brand-new, low-cost Opel works in
Eisenach, eastern Germany.
Erich Schmitt, 46, was brought in from Vauxhall, another GM subsidiary, to
fill a new board seat devoted to purchasing, finance and organisation.
Sitting in Ingoldstadt, Bavaria, Kortum contemplates his inheritance.
Behind Mercedes-Benz and BMW, he states, the Audi marque is recognised as
the third German player in the quality car market.
There is less than one percentage point between the market shares of the
three inside Germany, where Mercedes had 6.5 per cent last year.
Customers are relatively well-off. Most Audi buyers in Britain and the US
are well-educated, senior, white-collar workers or managers. A typical
German customer, who may not have spent so much time at college, takes home
double the national average pay.
Even so, the vast bulk of sales in Germany are still accounted for by the
more modest models bearing the Audi 80 badge.
'What we need now is to stabilise our position in the top rank. Perhaps I
can explain in a picture . . . Here we are in our Audi house.'
Villa Audi has two sound middle storeys, represented in Kortum's 'picture'
by the popular Audi 80 and the upmarket 100 model. But it has a flat roof
and no ground floor. It needs a fine, status-symbol roof to reflect the
charisma of the whole structure. This is the role of the incoming V8, due
out next spring.
The front garden, he adds, is represented by the distributors. Although many
Audis will continue to be sold with other group brands, selected dealerships
in key urban centres - a matter for negotiation with Wolfsburg - will be
dedicated as prestige showplaces for Audi. The purchase of the British sales
network from Lonrho and the takeover of 17 JAX distributorships in the Tokyo
area, mark the beginning of this process.
Meanwhile, the house needs more structural work. Kortum is preoccupied by
the fact that Villa Audi still lacks a ground floor and, by implication, an
easily accessible front door.
Customer profiles show the average Audi purchaser in Germany is aged 49, in
Britain 45 and somewhere between the two in the US. Although Kortum claims
there is a downward trend at the lower margin of the age profile, he admits
there are still too few young people on dealers' registers.
Enter the Audi 50 - a car pitched close to the market position now occupied
by the evergreen VW Golf. Kortum sounds less than certain when he promises
its arrival for sometime in the second half of the decade. However, he
considers it essential for his strategy of drawing in new buyers early and
keeping them moving upstairs in the Audi house rather than down the road to
Mercedes.
He recognises the strengthening tendency for car buyers to switch brands
more readily. New competition is emerging from all sides - not least from
Mercedes, which also plans to introduce a cheaper entry-level model to its
heavyweight range. Demand is also undergoing subtle changes influenced by a
reluctance among the well-off to flaunt their possessions. Environmental
awareness is generating new trends in taste and behaviour.
Despite the present structural deficiencies, Kortum considers Audi
well-armed to cope. The marque's carefully nurtured reputation as a
high-tech maker will be protected. The 'Vorsprung durch Technik' selling
line will remain, however, future promotions will be 'a bit more emotional',
extending the appeal to people looking for a 'sympathetic' brand.
These qualities, he promises, will become wholly apparent with the launch of
the flagship V8. 'It will be elegant and overall an
environmentally-compatible compromise in terms of weight, fuel consumption
and recyclability,' Kortum claims.
That may be so, but Kortum, who is faced with having to cut Audi's total
output by up to 15 per cent this year and does not foresee an upturn in the
depressed motor market until 1995-96, cannot hope for more than modest early
sales.
While the recession runs its course, his oar will act as a reminder of why
he was brought in. His job is to ensure the brand's new age aura is
radiating at full wattage when Villa Audi is complete.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Management: Shaking off the heavy brigade - Christopher
Lorenz argues that diversity is dying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The phrase 'charge of the light brigade' has been associated in Britain for
almost 140 years with a self-inflicted, but glorious military defeat in the
Crimean War, when Lord Cardigan's cavalry rode out to capture the enemy's
guns but was annihilated by them.
In the future it could take on a more modern meaning: the outcome of ICI's
bold decision yesterday to go ahead with its plan to de-merge into two. For,
among other influences, the plan reflects the final triumph of decades of
pressure from ICI's self-christened 'light brigade' to get out from under
the resource-hungry weight of the company's bulk chemicals side and make a
dash for growth in pharmaceuticals and elsewhere.
By de-merging, ICI will expose Zeneca (pharmaceuticals and agro-chemicals)
and the new ICI (bulk chemicals and paints) to the almost certain fire of
stock market predators. But it will also put them under an unprecedented
degree of market and managerial discipline.
Whether the move results in victory or defeat, it will be seen by future
business historians as in keeping with the times and entirely logical. In
many senses it marks merely a further stride in a stampede of strategic
revisionism which has gripped western industry over the past decade. The new
orthodoxy argues:
Cross-business 'synergies' of any kind - technological, marketing or any
other - are far more elusive than was thought in the 1960s and 1970s.
Diverse corporate portfolios are hard for stock markets to understand and
value, and for executives to manage, especially in an era when most
individual businesses are growing more global.
The most effective way to create value for both the customer and the
shareholder is therefore to substitute diversity with focus.
There has also been a growing realisation that focus is not just a matter of
concentrating on businesses in related product markets, technologies and
geographic areas. As Hanson, BTR and other specialist conglomerates have
shown, it is even more a matter of the managerial characteristics of those
businesses, such as the relative maturity of their industry, their
technology and marketing intensity, and their investment-time horizons. A
set of businesses without similar managerial characteristics is difficult
for the same company to 'parent' effectively.
In the terminology formulated by Britain's Ashridge Strategic Management
Centre, which is influential in this field, these principles apply to
'vertical parenting' - the relations between the group corporate centre and
an individual business - and to 'horizontal parenting' - the centre's
ability to foster synergies between the different businesses. Growing
awareness of the importance of these various types of relatedness and focus
has spurred the flood of divestments and the growing number of de-mergers.
Companies have not just 'spun off' diversifications they made through
acquisition, but which have failed. They have also divested businesses which
they developed organically, but for which they are no longer a suitable
'parent'.
One of the clearest examples of the second type - leaving aside stock
market-driven de-mergers such as Racal's 1991 split with Vodafone - was the
separation three years ago of the British Courtaulds combine into a
chemicals and a textiles group. Martin Taylor, chief executive of the
latter, points out not only that the shares of both companies have
outperformed the stock market ever since, but that the split has enabled
each management to concentrate more single-mindedly on its own industries.
Which brings us back to ICI's 'light brigade'. For the best part of the last
40 years, this band of managers - especially those running pharmaceuticals,
but also those at agro-chemicals, paints and some specialties - felt
frustrated at the priority given to the heavy side by the ICI board, which
until very recently was dominated by heavy chemicals people.
Andrew Pettigrew, a Warwick University professor of strategic change who
researched an acclaimed study of the company more than a decade ago, says:
'There's always been an atmosphere of great distance between pharma and
heavy chemicals at ICI.' As long ago as the 1960s, he says, the 'light
brigade' felt neglected and starved of funds. This attitude fermented
through the 1970s and early 1980s, he recalls, as the internal power of the
'heavy brigade' persisted long past the point at which its side of the
business was the more important in terms of profitability and growth
potential.
In the minds of the 'light brigade', the thinking behind the de-merger goes
back to the mid-1970s, says Pettigrew. But only since the mid-1980s has its
weight on the board been sufficient to give its view real force.
It should be clear from the foregoing that the managerial logic behind ICI's
de-merger makes it by no means a peculiarly Anglo-Saxon move, as critics
have alleged. In common with Union Carbide in the US, France's Rhone-Poulenc
has already been moving in a similar direction through a string of
divestments.
By the same token, the new Zeneca and ICI portfolios will be far from
sacrosanct. A management consultant who specialises in the chemical industry
says that much so-called synergy in chemicals is merely 'historical'. He
agrees different chemical businesses often share technology and production
facilities, partly because they have grown out of each other. But, 'unlike
the branches of a tree, little sap sometimes flows between them - or needs
to'.
So Zeneca and the new ICI are quite capable of being dismembered by outside
intervention. In military terms, they will both now mount a charge for
victory. But they could still suffer the sort of treatment meted out to Lord
Cardigan and his men in 1854.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Watchdog begins Granada inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Independent Television Commission will today start investigating claims
by Mrs Ann Clwyd, the shadow heritage secretary, that Granada Television is
in breach of its licence.
Sir George Russell, commission chairman, yesterday received a letter from
Mrs Clwyd asking him to consider revoking Granada's licence and accusing the
commission of being in default of its statutory duties for not taking action
sooner.
A copy of the dossier which talks of 'boardroom savagery' and a television
company 'having its heart ripped out' has also been sent to Mr Peter Brooke,
heritage secretary.
Mrs Clwyd's paper lists the number of Granada Television directors who have
left or been fired since the company bid for its new licence. Only two are
left out of 13.
A further 25 senior people 'have disappeared', the study claims, saying they
include the head of documentaries and arts, the chief engineer and head of
sound. A total of 370 staff have lost their jobs or face redundancy at
Granada.
Granada boasted in its application about its research in broadcast
engineering. But Mrs Clwyd claimed the people responsible have gone.
The commission is likely to be more interested to see whether Granada is
fulfilling the terms of its licence than carrying out the promises in its
application. In particular the commission will want to ensure that Granada
is providing a good quality service of regional broadcasting.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs say Bank 'fell down' on its
BCCI duties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPS ACCUSED the Bank of England yesterday of failing 'to discharge its
supervisory duties' towards Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the
corrupt international bank which was closed in 1991.
The cross-party Commons Treasury and Civil Service select committee also
said that the absence of disciplinary action against Bank employees in the
wake of the BCCI affair undermined the 'future effectiveness of the Bank'.
This was because it might lead staff to conclude that poor performance
carried 'no adverse consequences' for them as individuals. The report added:
'We consider it is incumbent on the Bank of England to accept responsibility
for its failure as the supervisor of BCCI'.
But the committee stopped short of demanding that the government reconsider
the question of compensation for BCCI's UK depositors after Conservative MPs
on the committee joined forces to excise the relevant sentence from the
final report.
Mr Quentin Davies, MP for Stamford and Spalding, one of the Tories who
supported the omission, said he felt it would be 'quite wrong in principle'
for the Bank to pay compensation in this case.
The rejected sentence, which sparked clashes between Labour and Tory
committee members during yesterday's stormy press conference, argued that Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, was 'honour-bound to reconsider the case for
partial compensation' to BCCI's UK depositors.
Mr Giles Radice, Labour MP for Durham North, the committee's acting
chairman, said the committee's central finding - that the Bank 'fell down'
on its job as a supervisor - was backed by the whole committee.
Plans were in hand for the body to conduct a wide-ranging inquiry into the
Bank's general role in supervising financial markets, he said. There was 'a
strong case' for separating the Bank's regulatory and monetary roles.
The Bank said it did not accept 'either the judgments or the conclusions' of
the committee. There was 'nothing new in the report at all: it is simply a
precis of all the negative parts of the Bingham report,' an official said.
The Bank had nothing to add to the response it gave at the time Lord Justice
Bingham's report was published last autumn, he added.
It did not believe there was 'any case for giving additional compensation to
UK depositors over and above that already provided by the statutory Deposit
Protection Scheme (which provides depositors with compensation equal to 75
per cent of lost deposits up to a maximum of Pounds 15,000)'.
It is widely accepted within the Bank that the 'culture' of the supervision
department was not aggressive enough for the Bank to act effectively against
BCCI.
It has set up new legal and investigative units in an attempt to become more
professional and rigorous in the assessment of whether banks are being
managed honestly and prudently.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Straw demands review of grants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INDEPENDENT review of the local government grant system was urged
yesterday by Mr Jack Straw, the shadow minister for local government.
He condemned the present method of distributing council grants as 'bent and
flawed'.
The government has already conceded that standard spending assessments, its
estimates of what councils need to spend, should be thoroughly reviewed and
the process has started.
Ministers admit privately that as the system of limiting local spending
becomes increasingly dependent on SSAs, the present system might not be
'robust' enough to be a fair basis.
Next month officials of the Department of the Environment will start talking
to local authority associations about the review. The exercise will be
completed by the autumn in order to take effect in the spring next year.
But Mr Straw argued that there should be a wide review of SSAs, which should
be independent of ministers and carried out by a team chosen after
consultation with local authority associations and the Audit Commission, the
council spending watchdog.
The average council tax bill in England will be Pounds 447 per household,
according to a survey for Public Finance and Accountancy magazine and
Channel Four News based on council tax figures recommended or approved by
313 of 529 councils.
Labour-led Harlow District Council in Essex voted last night to shed 176
jobs from its total of 1,400 and to reduce its budget from Pounds 24m in
1992-93 to Pounds 18.2m in 1993-94.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Familiar chorus urges compensation
for depositors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE MPS may have ensured that yesterday's committee report did not
formally recommend that the government reconsider the question of
compensation for BCCI's UK depositors. But that did not stop the document
producing a chorus of similar demands.
In the Commons Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, highlighted prime
minister John Major's 'commitment that, under the Citizen's Charter, the
public would be compensated where the authorities had failed.'
The report concluded the Bank of England had 'manifestly failed' in its
supervisory duties in the case of BCCI, he said - did this mean sufferers
would be compensated?
But Mr Tony Newton, Leader of the Commons, standing in for Mr Major, sought
to damp expectations, saying chancellor Norman Lamont had already examined
the issue after the publication of Lord Justice Bingham's report.
While the government would 'study carefully' the new report, Mr Newton did
not anticipate it would alter the original conclusion which was that no
extra compensation should be offered beyond that already available by law.
Mr Keith Vaz, the Labour MP for Leicester East - who has campaigned hard for
BCCI depositors - described the report as 'brilliant' and said the case for
compensation was now 'unanswerable'.
He said: 'So severe is this latest criticism that I would be astonished if
the government proceeded with the appointment of the deputy governor Eddie
George to the governorship.'
Mr Rory Mair, chief executive of Ross and Cromarty district council and
spokesman for the committee co-ordinating local authority action for
compensation, said the report 'shows there is a substantial case for
compensation for those depositors who lost money in the closure of BCCI'.
For Labour's front bench Mr Alastair Darling concentrated on regulatory
matters, saying there was 'clearly a case for considering a new body whose
sole responsibility would be banking supervision.'
In its carefully worded conclusions, the report cites a pledge attributed to
Mr Lamont in July 1991 that he would consider the implications for
compensation if the Bank was found not to have 'discharged its role and duty
properly and competently'.
In one of many references to Sir Thomas Bingham's earlier inquiry into BCCI
it goes on to say: 'It is, in our view, impossible to conclude from the
Bingham report that the Bank's role and duty as supervisor was discharged
'properly and competently'.
'On the contrary, we believe that the Bingham Report demonstrates
conclusively that the Bank of England 'failed to discharge its supervisory
duties' in respect of BCCI.'
The committee singled out Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the out-going Bank
governor, for personal criticism over some of his comments during an
appearance before the committee last November.
The report also criticises aspects of the Bank's response to the two reports
produced in 1990 by Price Waterhouse, BCCI's auditors, and the final
attempts to restructure the bank before its closure in July 1991.
The committee welcomed the government's response to the Bingham report's
recommendations and the Bank's decision to implement those aspects of Sir
Thomas's findings that fell directly within its control.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Move on service charges rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday rejected recommendations that would have prevented
restaurants adding additional service and cover charges to bills.
A committee set up by the government to monitor the pricing provisions of
the Consumer Protection Act recommended last year that compulsory cover and
service charges should be incorporated into the prices of individual items
on the menu. This would give customers a clear idea of what the final bill
would be.
Baroness Denton, consumer affairs minister, said yesterday that further
regulation was not the best way forward. She said she would prefer to rely
on a voluntary approach and customers' common sense.
She added: 'I know that payment for service charges can sometimes cause
difficulties and confusion but I am not convinced that further legislation
is the answer. We are looking to reduce rather than increase regulation. I
would prefer to rely on the responsibility and good sense of those in the
industry.'

TRUSTEES OF British Rail's pension scheme are to meet Mr John MacGregor, the
transport secretary, on Tuesday to protest about government plans to take
over the scheme's assets.
The trustees, with trade union representatives, will argue that a government
guarantee to pay index-linked pensions in exchange for taking over the
assets is of little value.
BR pension fund sources cite a 1980 speech by Mr Kenneth Clarke, then a
junior transport minister, during a Commons debate, which they say amounted
to a government guarantee to fund the pension schemes indefinitely.
The government has proposed, as part of its planned privatisation of BR,
that the pension scheme be split into two parts, one for current workers and
another for current and deferred pensioners.
A portion of the scheme's Pounds 8.5bn assets would be turned over to the
Treasury in exchange for a government guarantee to increase pensions
annually in line with inflation.
Union representatives are concerned that this would mean current pensioners
receiving no further increase in benefits. Many pensioners are on very low
incomes. Blue-collar workers were first allowed to join the scheme in 1967
and those retiring now will receive significantly less than a full pension.
In 1991 BR's 150,000 pensioners received an average of Pounds 44 per week,
while several thousand got Pounds 10 per week.
In recent years the scheme's trustees have targeted benefit improvements at
the oldest and least well-off pensioners, and they fear the government's
plans will allow no further aid to this category of pensioner.
The trustees are to meet Mr MacGregor's staff on Wednesday to explain why
they believe the government's plans are unworkable.
They have also been asked to give evidence to a wide-ranging pensions
inquiry to be undertaken by the Commons social security committee.
Mr Frank Field, the committee chairman, has called for evidence on the
pension funds of London Regional Transport, British Rail, the Post Office,
British Telecom, the Harland and Wolff and Swan Hunter shipyards, Belling,
Lucas and Dormobile.
The committee said it was interested in 'the consequences for pension funds
of privatisation of companies, consultation with fund members about major
changes in funds, the use of surpluses, and the level of pension benefits of
the most senior officers of privatised companies'.
In a speech to the National Association of Pension Funds conference
yesterday, Mr Field said employers had played a 'confidence trick' on
pension scheme members by encouraging them to think that a final salary
pension scheme would enable them to retire on comfortable incomes.
He predicted a rise in money purchase schemes, into which both employees and
employers make fixed contributions, and urged the government to consider the
generosity of company pension schemes when deciding whether companies should
be eligible for government contracts.
He also called for the repeal of the section of the 1986 Finance Act which
taxes pension funds when their surpluses move above a certain level.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Euro-sceptics rebuked over bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, ALISON SMITH and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EURO-SCEPTIC Tory MPs faced angry protests from other Conservatives last
night for voting against the government and slowing progress over the
Maastricht bill.
At a stormy meeting of the backbench 1922 committee government loyalists led
attacks against the rebels, including some members of the 1922 executive.
The row reflected growing disquiet within Tory ranks over the snail-like
progress the bill is making through the Commons.
The loyalists complained that defying the government on matters of principle
was understandable, but that attempts to deliberately delay and extend
debates were unacceptable and unprecedented.
In the Commons a Labour attempt to re-ignite the Commons' debate over
Maastricht's social chapter had to be put on hold last night.
Mr George Robertson, Labour's Europe spokesman, formally announced that the
party's frontbench would support a fresh amendment intended to force the
government to include the chapter in the treaty.
But Mr Michael Morris, the deputy Speaker who is presiding over the bill's
committee stage, refused to say whether he would select the amendment for
consideration or whether he will allow a general debate on the social
chapter.
The earliest the issue can now be debated is Thursday when the Commons next
considers the treaty. Labour is confident there are other procedural devices
available if the latest attempt is thwarted.
During the 13th day of the bill's committee stage yesterday, Mr Tristan
Garel-Jones, foreign office minister, reaffirmed that the government would
consider all parties' views before deciding how the 24 UK members of the
committee of the regions - set up under the treaty - should be appointed.
An all-party campaign for a British referendum on Maastricht was launched
yesterday by the Maastricht Referendum Campaign which has Baroness Thatcher
as a patron.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Straw urges grants review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN independent review of the local government grant system was urged
yesterday by Mr Jack Straw, the shadow environment secretary, as he
condemned the present method of distributing council grants as 'bent and
flawed'.
The government has already conceded that standard spending assessments, the
government estimates of what councils need to spend, need to be thoroughly
reviewed, and the process has already started. Ministers admit privately
that as the system of limiting local spending becomes increasingly dependent
on SSAs, the present system might not be 'robust' enough to be a fair basis.
Next month, Department of the Environment officials will begin talking to
the local authority associations about the review, and the exercise will be
completed by the autumn, in order to come into effect in the spring next
year.
But Mr Straw argued that there should be a wide review of SSAs, which should
be independent of ministers and carried out by a team chosen after
consultation with local authority associations and the Audit Commission, the
local council spending watchdog.
His comments came as the local government information unit, a research unit
supported by councils and trade unions, published a report highlighting
differences in the increases in grants among councils since the mid 1980s.
The average council tax bill in England will be Pounds 447 per household,
according to a survey for Public Finance and Accountancy magazine and
Channel Four News based on council tax figures recommended or approved by
313 of 529 local authorities.
The average bill for households in Scotland will be Pounds 407 and for Wales
Pounds 258.
The figures do not include transitional relief which will further reduce
bills in areas facing steep increases.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSPORT Minister Mr Roger Freeman last night forecast an 'outstanding
success' for the government's rail privatisation plans.
He spelt out new arrangements for train operators to seek options for later
extensions of their services in deals with the Railtrack authority.
Mr Freeman was speaking during the line-by-line Commons Standing Committee
debate on the Railways Bill providing for private companies to seek
franchises to run trains.
He introduced a new clause to let operators agree options on access with the
Railtrack authority to extend services at a later date.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ashdown calls for credit card
photos
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PHOTOGRAPHS should be laser-engraved on credit cards as a crime prevention
measure, Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said yesterday.
As the debate about crime continued to exercise MPs Mr Ashdown said that
there was scope for making progress in taking practical steps to cut
opportunities for crime.
In a letter to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, he urged a renewed
emphasis on crime prevention, and in particular 'plastic fraud'. Losses from
credit cards and cheque guarantee cards had risen to Pounds 166m in 1991, he
said, an increase of one-third over the 1990 figure of Pounds 123m.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour rounds on Tories over jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT ministers were accused by Labour last night of encouraging a
'climate of fear' over unemployment, homelessness and business failures,
that lay 'at the root' of Britain's economic and social problems', Ralph
Atkins writes.
As Labour intensified its campaign against unemployment Mrs Margaret
Beckett, the party's deputy leader, said Britain 'should be planning to
prosper, and not just struggling to get by.'
At a rally in Swindon she linked rising joblessness and crime, saying the
Conservatives 'have encouraged us to abandon our basic sense of shared
concern, of responsibility one for another.'
Labour plans further rallies in Tory marginal seats where unemployment has
risen dramatically.

FT  26 FEB 93 / VAT idea bad news for bookworms: The Treasury may widen tax
to increase revenue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLUTTONOUS bookworms who feel the cold and have young families are not
looking forward to the March 16 Budget. They could be forced into
substantial increases in spending as a result of changes in value added tax
being examined at the Treasury.
Treasury officials are ploughing through their VAT calculations with an eye
to cutting Britain's mounting government deficit. One way to do this would
be to extend VAT to items such as food, books, newspapers, heating bills and
children's clothing which are exempt from taxation.
Important opposing arguments are that to increase VAT when the economy is
fragile could damage the chances of recovery. It would also add to inflation
and hit the poor particularly hard.
About a quarter of all consumer spending goes on goods and services that are
zero-rated for VAT. A further 4 per cent is spent on items which are exempt.
According to Treasury calculations charging VAT at the full 17.5 per cent
rate on all items that are either zero-rated or exempt from the tax
altogether would raise an extra Pounds 23.9bn a year.
Nobody expects Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to announce such a sweeping
measure on Budget day. He is thought more likely to decide to raise perhaps
Pounds 3bn by widening the scope of VAT through bringing a few specific
items into the tax net at a lower rate - possibly 5 per cent.
Increased taxation would help to reduce the growing gap between government
revenues and spending. This is thought likely to reach about Pounds 50bn in
1993-94 after Pounds 35bn to Pounds 40bn in the current financial year.
One relatively uncontroversial measure on VAT would be to tax domestic
energy at the full 17.5 per cent. That would raise Pounds 2.6bn a year and
could be presented as a green-tinged measure which would help to cut
emissions of carbon dioxide and reduce global warming.
Widening the scope of VAT appeals to economists who believe a substantial
element of zero-rating for such indirect taxes - which are only seen in
western Europe in the UK and the Irish republic - distorts market forces by
making certain goods and services cheaper than others.
Raising extra money from VAT would fit in with the government's moves in the
1980s to shift the fiscal burden away from taxes on income towards those on
spending. The argument is that this encourages people to increase earnings,
leading to a more dynamic economy.
As a cash-gathering vehicle VAT was, in 1979, the poor relation of income
tax. Every Pounds 1 flowing into the Treasury's coffers from income tax was
then matched by just 32p from VAT. Last year VAT's corresponding
contribution had doubled to 65p. The total raised through VAT was Pounds
37.4bn.
According to calculations by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an
independent research group, extending VAT at the full 17.5 per cent rate to
all zero-rated goods and services would add 3.7 percentage points to the
year-on-year rise in retail price inflation if wholesalers and retailers
passed on the full effects of the extra tax to customers.
Even a modest move to increase VAT would increase the risk that underlying
inflation, now 3.2 per cent, would breach Mr Lamont's target of 4 per cent
or less during the life of this parliament.
A further disincentive for Mr Lamont is that raising VAT would hit poor
families. According to the institute's calculations, bringing all zero-rated
goods and services into the tax net would add Pounds 6.97 a week, or about 7
per cent, to the bills of those in the bottom 10 per cent by income.
Households with average incomes would have to pay Pounds 9.01 a week more,
an extra 3.5 per cent, while families in the top 10 per cent by income would
see their weekly bills increase by Pounds 10.81, a rise of less than 2 per
cent.
Supporters of an end to zero-rating say these effects could be countered by
changes in the level of benefits.

FT  26 FEB 93 / BA and Virgin near to agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS AIMED at ending the 'dirty tricks' dispute between British Airways and
Virgin Atlantic continued throughout yesterday as the final details of an
agreement were put in place.
Both sides hoped a final deal would be announced yesterday, but it is now
expected that a package will be formally signed today.
Mr Robert Ayling, BA's group managing director and Mr Trevor Abbott,
managing director of Virgin Group, yesterday began negotiations at 7am and
continued throughout the day. Mr Richard Branson, Virgin's head, and Sir
Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, were kept in touch with developments.
Last night lawyers were completing the details of an agreement which is
expected to include a cash payment of between Pounds 10m and Pounds 15m to
Virgin to compensate the airline for the commercial damage inflicted on it
by BA's activities.
The delay in concluding a deal has centred on Virgin's demands for a
competition code defining legitimate and illegitimate areas of competition
between the two airlines. BA is pressing its case for freedom to try to
persuade some Virgin passengers to switch to its flights.
Virgin is demanding a deal which will set clear ground rules for future
relationships.

FT  26 FEB 93 / General Motors' output up 23.1%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors of the US, the world's largest vehicle maker, increased
output in the UK by 23.1 per cent last year to 350,914 from 285,129 in 1991.
Ford of the US remained the leading producer despite a 2.2 per cent fall to
474,123 from 484,639 in 1991 (including commercial vehicles, Jaguar and
Aston Martin), according to figures released by the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders.
Ford's UK car output (excluding Jaguar) fell 10.9 per cent to 302,416 under
the impact of extensive short-time working in the second half of last year.
But overall production was boosted by a 24 per cent jump in commercial
vehicle output, helped by the first full year of production of the Fiesta
Courier van at its plant at Dagenham, east London.
Rover, a subsidiary of British Aerospace, suffered a 4.8 per cent fall in
output to 399,661 from 419,907 a year earlier, although it was narrowly the
leading carmaker in the UK ahead of the Ford group.
GM's UK vehicle output was boosted by the first full year of production of
the Opel/Vauxhall Frontera, a four-wheel drive leisure/utility vehicle made
by IBC Vehicles, its 60/40 joint venture with Isuzu, the US group's Japanese
affiliate.
Total UK car output rose by 4.4 per cent last year to 1,219,880. Lower
production by Rover, Ford and Peugeot was offset by the rapid build-up of
production by Nissan, the Japanese carmaker, which raised output at its
Sunderland plant by 44 per cent to 179,009.
The presence of Japanese carmakers was marked by the first UK output from
Honda's plant near Swindon.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Further leak at Sellafield
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POLLUTION Inspectorate is becoming increasingly exasperated with
disclosure procedures at the Sellafield nuclear site after British Nuclear
Fuels yesterday reported a second leak of radiation within the past two
weeks.
BNF said yesterday more than seven times the usual weekly discharge of
radio-active iodine was emitted from one of the site's main chimneys in the
week ending February 13.
The inspectorate, which was told of the incident only yesterday, has sent
its second team in two weeks to Cumbria to investigate the cause. Senior
officials were irritated that BNF had waited a day before notifying them of
the first leak.
BNF said yesterday the second reported leak, like the first, had not
breached authorised limits and it had no obligation to report it, but had
done so 'because of all the criticism we got over the first incident'.
The second reported leak was three times greater than the one on February
10, but the beta radiation from the second reported leak is believed to be
less damaging than the alpha radiation from the first.
Environmentalists are concerned that iodine could enter the food chain and
accumulate in thyroid glands.
Dr Jack Cunningham, the shadow foreign secretary whose constituency covers
the Cumbrian plant, said yesterday: 'The leak does not seem to have been of
serious radiological impact, but it is yet another incident and it is
unhelpful in terms of public and political confidence.'
A spokeswoman for BNF said last night that as far as she was aware there had
not been a similar iodine leak before.

NEARLY 30 per cent of quoted companies failed in their most recent annual
reports to meet the requirements laid down by the Stock Exchange.
The exchange said it had written to all the companies warning them to make
amends in their next annual report.
Some 648 of the 2,200 quoted companies did not comply with the continued
listing obligations laid down by the exchange in its regulatory 'Yellow
Book'.
Errors included omitting to provide a breakdown of results by business
segment or region, and failure to provide sufficient detail of borrowings.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Levitt faces fewer charges
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FRAUD charges faced by Mr Roger Levitt and three other former directors of
the Levitt Group, the collapsed financial services company, were drastically
cut yesterday by Mr Justice Laws, the trial judge.
Mr Levitt, along with Mr Mark Reed, Mr Alan McNamara and Mr Robert Price,
will face just one charge of fraudulent trading contrary to section 458 of
the Company's Act when their trial starts in September. After his arrest Mr
Levitt was charged with 62 offences. This number was later reduced to 22.
The remaining joint charge - denied by all four defendants - alleges they
fraudulently produced and distributed false accounts about the Levitt Group,
fraudulently injected funds into the company and misled Fimbra by stating
more than Pounds 20m in fees had been earned by Mr Levitt's personal
advisory work in the 18 months up to June 1990.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Property company sues council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SLOUGH Estates, the property company that owns the Howard shopping centre in
Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, is suing Welwyn Hatfield Council for more
than Pounds 20m,
The dispute involves the Gallerias, a rival shopping centre at Hatfield. The
council said it would vigorously defend the action.
Slough says that in 1987 the council deliberately concealed plans to relax
restrictions on the type of tenants at the Gallerias. This complex was
originally intended to be a specialist leisure centre, with no fashion,
convenience or food shops, but the developer persuaded the council to allow
it greater flexibility.
Slough says it would not have built the Howard centre if it had known the
Gallerias would be able to attract similar tenants. The Gallerias went into
receivership last September.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Deficit on trade outside EC falls sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK'S trade deficit with countries outside the European Community shrank
by Pounds 324m last month, according to official figures released yesterday.
The deficit on visible or merchandise goods was Pounds 1.02bn in January,
compared with December's record Pounds 1.34bn deficit. The last time there
was a surplus on UK trade with non-EC countries - which accounts for less
than half of total overseas trade - was in the fourth quarter of 1986.
Imports and exports remained at historically high levels with the value of
exports reaching a record Pounds 4.29bn in January. The value of imports at
Pounds 5.31bn was the second highest level ever recorded. The record high
was in December when import values were Pounds 5.44bn.
The underlying deficit, which excludes oil and erratic items such as
aircraft, silver and precious stones, also narrowed to Pounds 776m in
January, from Pounds 1.04bn in December.
The Central Statistical Office gave no figures for trade with the EC as a
new system called Intrastat is being introduced for measuring intra-EC
trade, in line with the single market. The CSO said it expected to present
the first results of Intrastat towards the end of July.
In December, the last month for which a full set of figures is available,
the UK's visible deficit with the EC was Pounds 541m and with the whole
world Pounds 1.88bn.
Statisticians stressed that it was not possible to infer from the latest
non-EC trade figures what was happening to trade in the community.
The CSO said devaluation of sterling had yet to make much impact on exports.
The government said in the Autumn Statement in November that it did not
expect exports to benefit from devaluation until the first quarter of this
year.
In the three months to the end of January the value of exports to non-EC
countries grew by 6 per cent, compared with the previous three-month period.
Import values grew by 14 per cent.
Trade volumes showed a similar trend. Last month import and export volumes
reached record levels.
A breakdown of trade by area shows that the UK has a negative balance of
trade with all areas outside the EC except the oil exporting countries.
The deficit on visible trade with the US and Canada widened to Pounds 182m
in January from Pounds 123m in December. In the latest three months the
deficit was Pounds 367m compared with Pounds 44m in the three months to
October.
The 'real' or constant price estimates of the UK national accounts and other
economic statistics will be re-based on the year 1990 in August this year
instead of 1985 as at present, the Central Statistics Office said yesterday.
The re-basing is expected to add about half a percentage point to the
estimate of growth of UK gross domestic product between 1986 and 1991.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Growth hopes for invisible earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK COMPANIES expect invisible earnings from the European Community to grow
by 10 per cent over the next six months, according to a survey out
yesterday.
British Invisibles, a trade group which promotes UK financial and other
services abroad, said companies were 'cautiously optimistic' about invisible
earnings.
More than 60 per cent of the 99 companies surveyed thought the UK's
departure from the European exchange rate mechanism was a positive influence
on export performance, with only 7 per cent viewing it as negative. There
was widespread concern about the possible impact of a stronger pound.
The survey, which covered sectors including accountancy, banking,
commodities and futures, consultancy, insurance, legal services and tourism,
found 70 per cent of respondents forecast growth in their overseas earnings
over the next six months.
British Invisibles said the most important market was the combined region of
the EC and the European Free Trade Association. Most saw this region
growing, albeit modestly.
Two-thirds of the survey's respondents considered the US to be their main
competition in the Japanese market, with less than 10 per cent regarding
France and Germany as significant competitors.
The survey identified a number of perceived threats to the UK's performance.
The banking sector was concerned about EC recession while the consultancy
sector was worried about political stability in central Europe and the
Middle East.

<TEXT>
ADDITIONAL teaching funds will be provided next year to English universities
to attract more part-time students and encourage growth in science,
engineering and technology, John Willman writes.
Details published yesterday of the allocation of the Pounds 2.3bn budget of
the Higher Education Funding Council for Englandfor 1993-94 show that Pounds

There will also be a big rise in funding for research, with the former
polytechnics receiving a five-fold increase on their transition to

This is the first time government funding for higher education has been
distributed by the new council, which replaced the separate university,
polytechnic and college funding councils.
In spite of a cap on the student intake next year, this will mean less cash
to teach each student, according to the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and
Principals, because total student numbers continue to rise as former years
of expansion roll through the system.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Computer hacker 'cost FT Pounds 24,871'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SCHOOLBOY who allegedly hacked into a Financial Times computer which
stored data on share price indices caused considerable disruption at the
newspaper, Southwark Crown Court was told yesterday.
Mr Paul Bedworth, now a student at Edinburgh University, hacked into the
FT's computer to use its account with BT to reach other computing systems,
the jury was told.
Mr Anthony Johnson, former head of computing services for the FT, said the
hacking was noticed in May 1991. Systems engineers discovered a dialling
program had been inserted. It made one telephone call a second and increased
the FT's telephone bill by Pounds 705.
Part of the system had to be removed for investigations which took weeks.
Fresh equipment had to be rented while this work was carried out. The total
cost of the hacking was Pounds 24,871.
The security system had been designed so that only users with a password
could deliver information to the computer.
The hacker was able to use a 'back door' in the system to gain entry to the
computer without such a password, he said. The back doors had been put into
the system for the convenience of engineers, but were not removed before the
computer was issued.
Mr Johnson denied a suggestion from Mr Ian MacDonald QC, defending, that the
FT's computer was a 'hacker's dream'. Such back doors would not usually be
known to users of the system, he said.
Mr Bedworth, from Ilkley, West Yorkshire, denies three conspiracy charges
under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 alleging unauthorised modification of
computer information, securing unauthorised access to computer information
and obtaining telegraphic services unlawfully.
The trial continues today.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Unit trust sales increase sharply: Funds under management at
record Pounds 66.1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE unit trust industry had its best month for more than two years in
January, with net sales of Pounds 505m pushing funds under management to a
record of Pounds 66.1bn.
The sector is benefiting from the recent highs in the UK stockmarket and
from the fall in base rates, which have persuaded savers to consider
alternatives to building societies.
The effect of the 1987 stock-market crash has now dropped out of the
five-year performance statistics which unit trusts are required to show
investors.
A change in the Personal Equity Plan rules may also be helping. Until the
last Budget, investors could put only Pounds 3,000 per year into a unit
trust Pep compared with Pounds 6,000 for a general plan.
Now the full allowance can be placed in a unit trust Pep and many investors
who previously invested in direct equity-based Peps may be switching to unit
trust plans.
Since Pep sales are normally strongest in February and March, and the most
recent base rate cut was too late to affect January's sales, the positive
trend for the industry may well continue.
The best individual sector for sales was UK smaller companies, which made
net gains of Pounds 79m as investors hoped that economic recovery would
bring the long-awaited rally in small stocks.
Gross sales of unit trusts in January were Pounds 1.114bn compared with just
Pounds 555m in their recent nadir of August last year. Repurchases from
investors were Pounds 609m, giving the net figure of Pounds 505m.
If net investment ran at this rate throughout the year, the industry would
nearly match 1987's inflow of Pounds 6.33bn. Net investment for the whole of
last year was just Pounds 646m.
Further good news for the industry was that the number of unitholder
accounts, which had been declining steadily since 1987, rose from 4.35m to
4.39m.
The number of trusts also rose to 1,474 compared with 1,137 in 1987.
The Securities and Investments Board yesterday issued a consultative paper
on unit trust regulations. It was aimed mainly at redrafting the rules on
the use of futures and options.

FT  26 FEB 93 / 'Whenever equities do well, people pile in': Building
societies risk losing more ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FALL in base rates since sterling left the exchange rate mechanism has
caused turmoil in the savings industry as companies compete for British
nest-eggs.
Savers who rely on building societies for income have seen returns halve
since base rates were at their peak in 1990. That has caused many to
consider the alternatives to the traditional home of the cautious British
saver - the building society.
Although building society inflows perked up to Pounds 363m in January, the
sector had a dismal 1992, with inflows of just Pounds 295m compared with
Pounds 5.8bn in 1991.
One obvious alternative home for savings is the personal equity plan, which
pays tax-free income. These can now offer better dividend yields than the
interest payments available from building societies. Recent Pep launches
from Cazenove and Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial, for example, offered yields of 7
per cent and 10 per cent respectively. Peps were an important contributor to
the revival of unit trust sales in January. Ms Mary Blair, product
development director of Fidelity Investments, a leading unit trust
management group, says 'we have seen a lot of activity from about October of
last year, as interest rates started to come down. Recently we have seen
enquiry levels equal to those seen in 1987 before the stockmarket crash.'
Recent highs in the stock-market may be an important factor. Mr Ian
Shepherdson, UK economist at Greenwell Montagu, said: 'There is a very close
correlation between equity market performance and unit trust figures.
Whenever the equity market does well, people pile in.'
And since February and March tend to be the key months for Pep sales (ahead
of the tax year end on April 5), inflows into unit trusts may accelerate.
Another tax-driven investment is the Business Expansion Scheme. Devised as a
means of encouraging investors to back growing businesses, the scheme has
become a means of encouraging the private rented sector - and is due to be
abolished at the end of this year.
But the financial services industry has become so ingenious at exploiting
this scheme that higher-rate taxpayers can earn profits of 20 per cent in
six months at virtually no risk.
The combination of these returns and some 'Buy Now While Stocks Last'
marketing campaigns means that many scheme offers sell out within days.
Guaranteed equity products, which offer investors the rise in the FT-SE 100
Index or their money back, have also proved popular with those investors who
are nervous about the potential losses on conventional share-based schemes.
An estimated Pounds 500m has been raised by such products.
But it is not just the financial services industry which is competing for
savers' money. The government needs to raise about Pounds 1bn a week to fund
the budget deficit, and a good portion of that may have to come from
National Savings.
Building societies complained bitterly last summer about the success which
National Savings was having in competition against them. The government
retreated in the face of criticism and National Savings cut its rates and
temporarily withdrew one of its most popular products.
But National Savings is still advertising on television and did not reduce
its rates in response to the last base rate cut. Given that long term rates
are above short term rates at present - a positive yield curve in the jargon
 -some building society investors have also been persuaded to switch their
money into gilt edged stocks, which will also help the government's funding
problem.
Building societies are trying to fight back. When base rates were cut by one
percentage point in January, most societies responded with a cut of only 0.8
of a percentage point in savings rates.
Mr Jim Murgatroyd of Halifax says that the society is deliberately trying to
keep up rates for those with large sums in 90-day notice accounts.
Experience shows that around 80 per cent of the deposits come from 20 per
cent of the savers.
But societies may be limited in the degree to which they can protect their
savers at the expense of borrowers. Societies are keen to revive the housing
market, which will boost demand for mortgages and reduce their bad-debt
problem.
Mortgage rates are two percentage points above base rates (the margin was
only 0.4 of a percentage point in 1990). With margins at that level, Mr John
Wriglesworth, analyst at UBS Phillips and Drew, says societies are likely to
face increased competition in the mortgage market from the banks and
centralised lenders in 1993.
Societies thus face a squeeze from both directions.
Perhaps societies will continue to attract funds from those who are afraid
of unemployment (or have been made redundant) and who do not want to risk
the nominal value of their capital in equity-based products.
But what comes in through that door may disappear out of another as retired
savers are lured away by the government and the rest of the savings
industry.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Army defends Balkans job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARMY yesterday defended compulsory redundancies served on several
officers on duty in former Yugoslavia among 628 being made redundant in its
latest round of job cuts.
General Sir David Ramsbotham, the adjutant-general who is responsible for
Army personnel, said after strong criticism of the move from opposition MPs:
'We honestly could not exclude someone simply because he happened to be
serving somewhere on the 25th of February.'
Eight officers in Bosnia and Croatia were among those told by commanding
officers yesterday that they had to leave the Army. Applications for
voluntary redundancy have been accepted from nine others. A further 80
non-commissioned soldiers in former Yugoslavia are also being made
redundant.
Personnel being made redundant while in former Yugoslavia are being offered
extended notice periods because their tours of duty there will not expire
until April or May.
Normally volunteers have until October to leave the Army. Compulsory
redundancies allow for up to 12 months.
The new batch of redundancies involves a total of 6,460, including 1,308
officers.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, challenged the government at
Commons' questions over the redundancies.
'How would you feel if you were serving in the British Army under fire in
Bosnia and were handed a P45?' she asked Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the
Commons.
Mr Newton, standing in for Mr John Major while he was in the US, said the
reduction in numbers had to be handled 'in a fair and even-handed way, and
it would be much more unfair to leave troops serving in Bosnia in a state of
continuing uncertainty.'

FT  26 FEB 93 / Small increase in N-power proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JAMES HANN, chairman of Scottish Nuclear, the state-owned generator, last
night proposed only a modest increase in the proportion of the UK's
electricity needs met by nuclear power.
Mr Hann suggested that the government should state in its forthcoming energy
white paper what percentage of the electricity market should be held by each
energy source.
He recommended that nuclear power should have between 20 per cent and 25 per
cent of the market.
With nuclear energy at present meeting about 20 per cent of the market, Mr
Hann is advocating little expansion in nuclear capacity. He says Britain
should simply replace the older Magnox stations at the end of their useful
lives 'with new and more efficient designs'.
Scottish Nuclear has no operating Magnox stations but wants to replace the
Hunterston B advanced gas cooled plant in Ayrshire with a Hunterston C
station by about 2010.
The company has said the new station would probably be a pressurised water
reactor plant.
Mr Hann, in a speech in Glasgow, said coal should meet between 50 per cent
and 55 per cent of the UK electricity market (compared with 63 per cent in
1990-91), gas 15 per cent (1 per cent), oil and orimulsion zero (9 per cent)
and renewables 5 per cent (3 per cent).
After the government had laid down the percentage shares, Mr Hann said, 'a
simple mechanism based on financial incentive and disincentive would enable
the concept to work'.

FT  26 FEB 93 / PowerGen seeks Pounds 140m pit payment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWERGEN, the electricity generator, is seeking government compensation of
more than Pounds 140m over five years in return for agreeing to requests
that it keep coal stocks at existing levels to help preserve some of the
threatened 31 pits.
Its negotiating stance suggests that the government package for saving pits
may cost considerably more than the subsidy British Coal would need to
enable it to sell some of its output at world coal prices.
The British Coal subsidy is expected to be at least Pounds 500m over five
years. Any money paid to PowerGen and National Power, the other generator
for England and Wales, for holding stocks would add to this cost. National
Power's plant capacity is 50 per cent larger than PowerGen's.
PowerGen's stance on stocks is just one of the problems the government must
overcome before finding a way out of its predicament. A leaked National
Power letter showed last week that it is threatening the generators with
legislation to force them to take more coal unless they reach a voluntary
agreement.
The Department of Trade and Industry's preferred solution depends on
persuading the generators to buy 65.5m extra tonnes over five years.
Whitehall sources say PowerGen has told the government that, without
adjustments to the market, it believes the generators can take only 43m.
National Power's estimate is 40m.
Taking more than that, the generators say, would mean significant stockpiles
and the 65.5m would be achievable only if either some of the expected growth
in gas-fired or nuclear power was curtailed.
PowerGen's claim for more than Pounds 140m for stockpiling arises because it
wants to cut its stocks from 16m tonnes to 5m tonnes in the next few years.
For the government to come anywhere near its 65.5m tonnes target, the
generators would have to keep stocks at their present level and possibly
raise them.
PowerGen argues shareholders should not have to pay for the costs of
excessive stocks and that government money is needed to compensate it for
handling the stocks and for loss of interest on money tied up in stocks.
National Power stocks amount to 18m tonnes, about three times above what it
considers to be normal commercial levels.
In both companies' cases, stocks are higher than anticipated at
privatisation three years ago because of a fall in demand caused by the
recession, stronger competition from nuclear power plants and a warm winter.
National Power and PowerGen were committed to buying coal on three-year
contracts which end next month.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Chairman bows to criticism: Ambulance board considered
sacking senior executive Concern over lack of accountability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JIM HARRIS, chairman of the London Ambulance Service board, announced his
resignation when yesterday's report was published.
It was also announced that Mr John Wilby, the service's former chief
executive, was about to be dismissed when he resigned in October after the
computer collapse.
Mr Chris Spry, general manager of South West Thames regional health
authority, said a number of concerns had been raised with Mr Wilby at his
annual performance review in spring last year.
These included concerns about his leadership style. He said Mr Wilby would
not have been aware that the board had decided to terminate his contract
when he resigned.
Mr Harris, announcing his resignation at a press conference in the ambulance
service headquarters, said: 'It is clear that a review of the accountability
arrangements between the regional health authority and the London Ambulance
Service is necessary. In order to allow that process to proceed without
inappropriate distraction, I have decided to step aside as chairman of the
LAS board with effect from next Monday.'
It appeared from Mr Harris's replies to questions about the non-statutory
board's management of the service that it had experienced difficulties in
questioning decisions of executive directors. 'You either have to fire the
lot or accept what they say,' he said.
Yesterday's report raises important issues of managerial and public
accountability in the service and, by implica-tion, other areas of the
reformed National Health Service.
The resignations of both the chairman and former chief executive of the
service are unlikely to end discussion about whether the introduction of a
more devolved and supposedly business-like management structure may have
contributed to the computer problems not being spotted earlier.
In 1989 the government decided, as part of the process of shifting the NHS
towards locally-based management, that regional health authorities should
stop running non-core services. This led the South West Thames region, which
had managed the London Ambulance Service, to set up an arms-length board in
1990. While the regional authority remained accountable for the service the
board became responsible for day-to-day management.
The inquiry report concludes that, although lines of accountability looked
secure on paper, the board was in practice given insufficient information to
exercise its delegated responsibilities. 'Neither was it apparent that they
actively sought such information.'
The regional authority believed it important not to interfere, having set up
the board at arms-length.
Although the board and the regional authority realised there were continuing
problems with the implementation of the computer system, says the report,
both 'consistently accepted assurances' from ambulance service executive
directors that problems were being rectified and successful implementation
would be achieved. 'At no time was a full independent review commissioned of
the true state of the project.'
Union leaders say they repeatedly tried to draw concerns to the attention of
the management and board, and are calling on the entire board to join Mr
Harris in resigning.
Mr Stuart Barber, national officer of the public service union Nupe, said:
'I was personally the author of hundreds of letters to the board.'

FT  26 FEB 93 / When failure followed failure: Alan Pike on the inquiry into
the London Ambulance Service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLLAPSE of the London Ambulance Service's new computer for despatching
vehicles to emergencies was the final failure in a spectacular series of
failures.
The report of the inquiry into the computer crash, led by Mr Don Page, chief
executive of South Yorkshire ambulance service trust, catalogues the
failures.
There was failure to test the system properly and failure to win the
confidence of staff who, even before the introduction of the computer,
worked in an atmosphere of 'mistrust and obstructiveness'.
There was failure to adopt realistic timetables, failure by senior managers
to accept advice about the risks they were taking and failure by the
service's board to seek or obtain enough information to exercise its
responsibilities.
The report says an important factor in all this was a culture within the
ambulance service based on 'fear of failure'.
This may have put undue pressure on computer managers to introduce the
system on time and to budget, and blinded them to difficulties.
The report, one of the most forceful criticisms of the management of a
public sector body in recent times, stresses the need for continuing action
to improve public confidence in the London Ambulance Service, the largest
ambulance service in the world. But members of the inquiry team say it will
take several years to raise the service to a fully-acceptable standard.
The computer system was intended to allocate ambulances to incidents
automatically via display screens in vehicles. The report says this was a
high-risk quantum leap in the use of technology.
The system was withdrawn immediately after its full introduction on October
26 last year following a series of problems which, says the report, were not
systems failure in the technical sense but cumulatively led to 'all the
symptoms of systems failure'.
The report says it is clear that neither the system nor its users were ready
for full implementation on October 26 . The software was not complete,
properly tuned or fully tested. Hardware had not been tested under full-load
conditions. There were outstanding data transmission problems. Staff had no
confidence in the system and were not fully trained.
The report says there did not appear to be any rational process by which the
ambulance service's budget of about Pounds 1.5m was established. It may have
been based on misunderstanding of a management consultant's report. The
procurement of the system for the service was put in the hands of a contract
analyst and an 'arguably unsuitably-qualified systems manager who knew that
he was to be replaced and made redundant'.
The inquiry says a report to the ambulance service's board recommending
purchase of the system did not explain why the bid was 'significantly lower
than the nearest competitor'. Some bids were more than three times as high.
The project was managed by Systems Options, a small software house, as a
result of a decision that the report says was 'basically flawed'. The
ambulance service contract was larger than anything Systems Options had
handled before and the company rapidly found itself out of its depth, but
the report concludes that within the time constraints 'no software house
could have delivered a workable solution'.
Similarly, the report says that even with the best industrial relations
practices it is unlikely that the system would have succeeded 'in the
incomplete and unstable state in which it was implemented'. The ambulance
service had hoped that the computer system could be used to introduce
industrial relations changes but this was 'misguided or naive'.
The report says it would be misleading to see management problems in the
ambulance service only in the context of the past two years. There was clear
evidence that management had failed to modernise the service in the 1980s in
line with other ambulance services. This was reflected in a lack of
investment in paramedic training, the fleet or buildings.
It says: 'Poor communications between staff and staff associations and
senior LAS managers have created an atmosphere of mistrust.'
The report recommends a new bargaining structure between the service and its
unions and investment in management training.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Major confident on US relations: Britain's PM heaps praise
on Clinton after Washington visit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S prime minister, Mr John Major, left Washington yesterday offering
lavish praise for President Bill Clinton's domestic and foreign policy
agenda and voicing confidence that the arrival of a Democrat in the White
House would not weaken Anglo-US relations.
Reviewing his first meeting with the new president, Mr Major said he was 'in
no doubt whatever' that he was committed to an early conclusion of the Gatt
world trade talks. Mr Major said he had been given the clear impression that
the US would not seek to re-open the so-called Blair House accords on farm
trade which would be at the heart of any trade deal.
He also gave a broad hint that he settled with Mr Clinton the terms under
which a US emissary will be despatched to Northern Ireland. The two had
agreed on the priority of a political settlement between the communities in
the province, Mr Major said.
The president, in the UK view, is under intense pressure from Congress to
meet his campaign pledge to take an active role in Ulster. The US political
perspective is that this pressure is, by Washington standards, very modest.
Nevertheless, Mr Clinton is expected to announce the 'fact-finding' mission
within the next week or so. Mr Tom Foley, the speaker of the House of
Representatives, may be asked to lead it.
The prime minister was determined to show this week that he could establish
a good relationship with Mr Clinton.
He summed up their meeting with the comment: 'I don't think the relationship
could have been any more natural and easy than it has been.'
But in a series of interviews with the main US and UK television networks
yesterday Mr Major found himself pushed on to the defensive in defending his
domestic policies in Britain. Several of the interviewers pressed him on the
rising youth crime rate in the UK and on the high and rising level of

DISCONTENT is mounting in Washington over the slowness of the White House in
approving appointments to senior sub-cabinet positions in the new
administration.
The concern, now being voiced by some cabinet members, has been heightened
by the admission to hospital of Mr Les Aspin, defence secretary, for four
days this week. Yesterday, Mr William Perry, selected to be his deputy,
finally appeared before Senate committee confirmation hearings, but
meanwhile, the Pentagon's civilian command rests with a middle-level
appointee of President George Bush.
The Justice Department, too, is still under hold-over Republican management
pending confirmation of Ms Janet Reno as attorney-general. No other senior
Justice nominations have been made, including that to the important position
of solicitor-general.
Open or veiled criticism of the process has come from Mr Federico Pena,
transportation secretary, Mr Mike Espy, agriculture secretary, and Mr Henry
Cisneros, at housing and urban development.
According to yesterday's New York Times, the White House has so far
submitted only 30 names to fill the nearly 300 positions subject to Senate
confirmation - about half the pace of the Carter and Reagan administrations
at the same stage.
Two reasons are cited for the delay. First is the painfully slow process of
background checks by the White House and FBI. These have been made more
laborious by the need to ensure there are no skeletons in the household
closet, such as afflicted Ms Zoe Baird and Judge Kimber Wood, both
candidates for attorney-general.
The second is the White House insistence on ethnic, gender and geographic
diversity in appointments. A list submitted by Mr Cisneros was reportedly
rejected because it had too many New Yorkers. More common complaints concern
the search for women and members of racial minorities.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Smokers may face higher taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton warned yesterday that smokers may face higher tobacco
taxes to help pay the cost of giving everyone access to healthcare.
'I think we are spending a ton of money in private insurance and government
tax payments to deal with the healthcare problems occasioned by health
habits, particularly smoking,' Mr Clinton said yesterday. 'You do have to
find some way to recover some revenues to cover people who now don't have
coverage.'
Higher tobacco taxes are reported to figure on a list of potential ways of
raising money to pay for overhauling the healthcare system, which Mrs
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who heads the White House task force, is now working
on, along with other 'sin taxes' such as alcohol and gun levies.
The Los Angeles Times said yesterday that Mrs Clinton had ruled out the
option of taxing employees on company health insurance benefits, viewing
this as too damaging to her husband's chances of re-election in 1996.
Mr Clinton said he had not ruled anything out, and White House officials
said revenue options remained under consideration. Healthcare reform is
likely to save money over the long term; it is seen as essential if the
federal budget deficit is to be reduced, because programmes such as Medicare
and Medicaid are the fastest-growing items of government spending.
Extending coverage to the 35m people who do not have company health
insurance, but are not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid, is expected to
cost anywhere from Dollars 12bn (Pounds 8.40bn) to Dollars 44bn a year.
Costs of subsidising long-term nursing home care could drive the bill
higher.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that treating employer-paid health
insurance as a taxable benefit where it exceeds a reasonable average could
bring in Dollars 113bn over five years, and would introduce stronger
incentives to curb medical inflation.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Clinton-Yeltsin summit is set for early in April
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By OUR FOREIGN STAFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENTS Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin will hold their first summit on
April 4, at a venue yet to be decided.
The announcement was made by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state,
and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, at a joint news conference
which followed a three-hour meeting in Geneva yesterday.
Mr Clinton had hoped the meeting, which would be his first foreign trip
since becoming president, could be held sometime next month. But Mr Kozyrev
said the agenda could be so extensive as to require considerable
preparation.
The president is giving considerable attention both to finding ways of
helping Russian reforms and to continue to engage Moscow in global problems,
including bringing peace to former Yugoslavia.
He has also sought to play down talk in Washington that Mr Yeltsin's own
position was becoming increasingly parlous. A holdover Bush appointee at the
State Department was this week removed from his post for publicly suggesting
that the Russian president might no longer be a reliable partner because of
his domestic political difficulties.
On Wednesday, Mr Clinton expressed full confidence in Mr Yeltsin. The two
men met briefly last summer in Washington when Mr Clinton was still a
presidential candidate.
Mr Christopher said in Geneva that Mr Clinton had asked him to underscore
'his strong personal support for the reform policies of the Yeltsin
administration'.
Yesterday, Mr Yeltsin suffered a fresh humiliation in his battle with the
parliament chairman, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov. Deputies refused to even discuss
Mr Yeltsin's proposals for a constitutional truce after Mr Khasbulatov told
them they were designed to limit their powers. Parliament also put off until
next Thursday a debate on whether to call a special congress to discuss the
plans.
Mr Christopher described his meeting with Mr Kozyrev as 'very good and
businesslike'. They discussed issues likely to feature on the April summit
agenda. Apart from the Middle East, these included the conflict in
ex-Yugoslavia, arms control and proliferation, and US support for Russian
economic reforms.
Mr Kozyrev said they had discussed possible co-operation in trade and
investment, the rescheduling of Russia's foreign debt and Russian sales of
conventional weapons.

FT  26 FEB 93 / SEC says Japanese firms broke law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Securities and Exchange Commission, the US securities market watchdog,
yesterday charged four Japanese securities firms with breaking securities
laws.
Three of the firms - Daiwa, Nomura and Yamaichi - have reached settlements
with the SEC over the allegations, which relate principally to book-keeping,
and have agreed to retain independent consultants to review their internal
policies and procedures. The case against Nikko Securities is continuing.
Separately, Daiwa reached a settlement with the SEC over its role in the
Salomon Brothers bond auction 'scandal' - in which the Wall Street
investment bank was accused of rigging Treasury bond auctions between 1989
and 1991. A complaint filed by the SEC against Salomon last year described
how a dealer at another firm (known to be Daiwa) handed over to Salomon
Dollars 3bn in Treasury bills which he had secretly bought at the request of
the US firm's chief bond trader.
Daiwa was subsequently investigated by the SEC for its auction-related
conduct, and discussed a possible settlement with the US regulators last
year. However, as a result of yesterday's deal - which involves a profits
payback to the SEC - the Treasury is temporarily restricting Daiwa's bidding
in government auctions. Daiwa will only be permitted to make purchases for
its own account for a three-month period.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said it,too, was taking action,
suspending trading activity with Daiwa for a month from March 1.
The allegations of securities law violations against the four firms stem
from revelations two years ago that their parent companies had compensated
favoured customers for trading losses. These disclosures, in Japan, prompted
the SEC to investigate US subsidiaries, discovering instead other alleged
breaches of the law.
In Yamaichi's case, for example, the SEC claims that the firm improperly
repurchased from a 'favoured client' certain securities at a price which
exceeded their actual value. Daiwa is alleged to have improperly recorded
monies received from a client. The firms are each paying a Dollars 200,000
fine and will review internal procedures.
In the continuing Nikko case, the SEC alleges that the firm, 'acting through
its most senior officials, deliberately concealed' more than Dollars 18m in
foreign exchange-related trading losses.
Yesterday, Nikko said that it was contesting the action because the SEC was
demanding unduly heavy penalties.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Premier makes music in a minor key: The UK leader's visit
was cordial if unexciting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR came to Washington to make friends. He left yesterday
convinced that during his first encounter with President Bill Clinton he had
made a start.
The British prime minister could not claim that his visit had stirred the
excitement of a Washington establishment preoccupied with the new
administration's domestic programme. For its part, the local media's
interest in Britain this week has focused on the murder in Liverpool of
two-year-old James Bulger rather than on the warmth of Mr Major's reception
at the White House.
Nor did several hours of talks with Mr Clinton yield any diplomatic
breakthroughs on the issues facing the US and Europe. The days have gone
when Republican presidents and Conservative prime ministers would jointly
pre-empt the decisions of their allies.
But for Mr Major the trip had a limited objective. He had to prove that he
could get on with a Democratic president; that British influence in
Washington had not vanished with the departure of Mr George Bush; and that
Mr Clinton would not seek retribution for the help offered by the
Conservatives to the Bush campaign.
The president's calculated generosity during their joint appearance at the
White House allowed Mr Major to claim he had succeeded.
Mr Clinton deferred to Mr Major's greater experience of foreign policy
issues. He went out of his way to underline his commitment to the
transatlantic 'special relationship'. He reminded reporters that he was one
of only two presidents who had lived in England. To the visible relief of Mr
Major's entourage he made light of the British government's decision during
the presidential campaign to rummage through his Home Office files for
evidence of youthful wrongdoing.
For his part, Mr Major suppressed his private doubts about the US decision
to air-drop supplies into eastern Bosnia, declaring it a 'brave' and
'imaginative' initiative. He also heaped lavish praise on Mr Clinton's
programme to reduce the US budget deficit. It is not often that you hear
Conservative prime ministers offering plaudits for tax increases.
There was none of the natural chemistry apparent during Mr Major's meetings
with Mr George Bush or the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher's encounters with Mr
Ronald Reagan. But the prime minister had already scaled back once
extravagant claims for the relationship. And Mr Clinton, side-stepping
awkward questions about Northern Ireland and playing down differences over
trade issues, had clearly decided there was nothing to be gained from a
public snub.
The substance of the two leaders' discussions also offered Mr Major cause
for satisfaction, if not celebration. His claim that there had been a
'meeting of minds' over the need to conclude the stalled Uruguay Round of
world trade talks perhaps went too far. Mr Clinton speaks still of the need
for 'fair' trade, a coded demand for more concessions from his partners.
But the tone of the president's comments - and suggestions by US officials
that extension of congressional 'fast-track' approval arrangements for any
Gatt accord will be for months rather than years - reinforced the view that
he does want a settlement this year. 'I got no sense of a protectionism
president,' Mr Major said with some justice.
There were differences between the two men: over the 'map' of Bosnia being
proposed in the peace negotiations between the warring factions in the
former Yugoslav province; over the remit for an American emissary to
Northern Ireland; and over a raft of transatlantic trade disputes concerning
steel, Airbus and public procurement.
The activism in international economic management which Mr Clinton expects
of the Group of Seven countries may be difficult to square with the limited
expectations which Mr Major has of joint action to manage demand in the
world economy. But this week at least the differences remained below the
surface. Mr Clinton was generous. Mr Major was mightily relieved.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Drought declared over in California
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CALIFORNIA'S five-year drought is officially over, after last weekend's snow
storms in the Sierra Nevada capped a wet winter, bringing reservoir levels
close to normal levels.
Governor Pete Wilson declared the drought ended this week, but warned
citizens they should not give up their water conservation measures.
Officials had been reluctant to declare the drought over, for fear
Californians might resume their old ways of profligate water use, but Los
Angeles has received 23 inches of rain during this winter season.
But water experts warn that the ground has dried up so much since 1986, the
last wet year, that it may take several years for it to be replenished.
The drought has hurt California's farmers, who account for over 60 per cent
of the state's 50bn-gallon-a-day water consumption, harmed forests through
insect infestation flourishing in the dry conditions, and ravaged fisheries,
with salmon stocks particularly low. California has always depended on
billions of gallons of water being pumped to irrigate farms, water suburban
lawns and fill city bathtubs in defiance of its basically arid conditions.
Rainfall is usually low, averaging less than 10ins in San Diego, 14 in Los
Angeles and 20 in San Francisco, but since 1987 it has ranged between 61 per
cent and 86 per cent of these normal levels.
Reservoirs had dropped by last year to little more than half their normal
levels, and the snowpack on the Sierra dwindled.
Los Angeles considered building a water pipeline from Alaska, but instead
rationed water supplies for 13 months during the worst of the drought, and
retains curbs on watering lawns and hosing pavements. The city of Irvine
installed parallel plumbing systems in some office buildings to allow 'grey
water' from washing to be recycled for flushing.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Citicorp to make new loans to Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITICORP, Brazil's largest foreign bank creditor, will make substantial new
loans to Brazil under the debt restructuring package now before
international banks.
Under the accord, agreed late last year, banks can choose between six
options, most of which involve exchanging old loans for concessional bonds,
but one of which allowed banks to make new loans of Dollars 100 for every
Dollars 550 of existing exposure.
Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citicorp, said that the bank would
convert some of its exposure into concessional bonds, but that 'the largest
single commitment would be to new money'. US regulators had no objection to
Citibank taking this position.
Citibank has so far profited from a policy of lending new money where
possible in so-called Brady debt restructurings, and has opted to do so in
Mexico, Venezuela, Uruguay and the Philippines.
The secondary market prices of the debt have risen considerably in most
cases since the agreements went into effect.
However, the Brazilian package is regarded as more uncertain than most of
the preceding debt agreements, in part because as yet there is no agreement
between Brazil and the International Monetary Fund, and most banks are not
seen as likely to provide new funds.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US administration intends to back a financial support programme for
Peru, having been satisfied during talks with Peruvian ministers that the
Lima government intends to address US concerns about human rights.
The concerns, relating chiefly to the treatment of political prisoners and
the harassment of human rights groups, had led the administration to delay a
financial package designed to help Peru clear its arrears with the World
Bank and International Monetary Fund.
Assurances were given to the US this week in Washington by Mr Jorge Camet,
Peru's finance minister, and Mr Fernando Vega Santo Gadea, justice minister.
A State Department official said the commitments were sufficient to restart
moves towards the completion of the package, which includes a short-term
bridge loan of nearly Dollars 2bn to allow Peru to clear arrears with the
IMF and World Bank.
However, the commitments would be monitored as the multinational support
package, which is being arranged under the leadership of the US and Japan,
moves towards fruition.
The arrangement to clear Peru's arrears with the IMF was to have come before
the IMF board this week, but was postponed because of US concerns. It could
now come up as early as next week. Clearing arrears with the IMF and the
World Bank will allow them to resume lending.
The delay was seen as an indication that the US intends to link foreign aid
with human rights and democracy in recipient countries.

ANGLO-AMERICAN ties may be on a sounder footing, but this was not apparent

At their joint press conference, Mr John Major wore a proper Tory blue tie.
His attendant aides - Sir Robin Renwick, the UK ambassador, Sir Robin Butler
and Sir Roderick Braithwaite from Downing Street - were similarly attired.
Ms Sarah Hogg wore a blue dress.
But President Bill Clinton's tie was a shocking neo-socialist red. Vice
President Al Gore, Mr Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, and
Clifton Wharton, deputy secretary of state, all wore varying shades of red.
Only Mr Ray Seitz, US ambassador in London, was neutral - a darkish polka
dot. But his tenure is in doubt.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Forex sale cancelled as naira plunges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S central bank yesterday responded to a continuing plunge in the
naira by cancelling the result of Wednesday's foreign exchange auction in
which the currency fell sharply against the dollar for the second successive
week.
Bankers in Lagos said last night that most bids ranged between 30 and 33
naira to the dollar. It was valued at 25 after last week's auction, and 20.6
on January 19.
In a statement, the central bank of Nigeria (CBN) said: 'In view of the
outrageous rate that emerged from Wednesday's auction, authorised dealers
are advised that the CBN is constrained to cancel the result.'
Banks 'would be advised in due course' when the next sale will take place.
At last week's auction 80 of the 120 eligible banks participated, but bids
from 18 banks accounted for all the Dollars 80m on offer. A similar amount
was put up for auction this week.
The naira, worth more than a dollar in the early 1980s, was devalued by 41
per cent last March to close a gap with the parallel market.
The currency is expected to come under more pressure. The federal
government's 45 per cent pay rise for its staff last June was followed by
matching demands by state government employees and private sector unions.
Inflation exceeds 45 per cent.

<TEXT>
THE central Angolan city of Huambo was under constant shelling yesterday and
the streets were full of decomposing bodies from fighting between government
troops and the rebel Unita movement, write Michael Holman in London and
Reuter in Luanda.
In one of the first eyewitness accounts from Huambo, Angolan journalist
William Tonet, trapped in the besieged city since early January, said the
residents were in danger from Unita shelling whether they stayed at home or
went out in the streets to look for food. He estimated that 10,000 to 13,000
people had been killed there.
A report published in London today says neither the MPLA government nor
Unita can win an outright military victory. Compiled by the Economist
Intelligence Unit, the report concludes that both sides will ultimately be
'obliged to compromise.'
It says that the resumption of the peace process will require a larger role
for the United Nations. The UN has been monitoring the 1991 agreement which
paved the way for multi-party democracy.
Oil, diamonds and other minerals, and an abundance of arable land, make
Angola one of Africa's most richly endowed countries: 'If Angola enjoyed
political stability and good management, its economy should prosper'.

However, the plan to establish a broader political dialogue with Bonn marks
a recognition in Tokyo that the future of Japan's relations with the EC as
well as its involvement in eastern Europe will largely turn on its relations
with Germany.
Chancellor Kohl and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, are
expected to launch a bilateral discussion forum as the immediate focus for
efforts to strengthen ties. Such a move by the Japanese government is
expected to encourage private sector initiatives to strengthen bilateral
ties.
The talks are likely to focus on trade issues, particularly Japan's growing
surplus and market-opening measures in Japan, as well as the promotion of
foreign investment in eastern Germany.
Chancellor Kohl is likely to call for more Japanese aid to the former Soviet
Union and to suggest Japan should invite President Yeltsin of Russia as an
observer to the world summit in Tokyo in July.
Senior officials at the finance ministry and the foreign ministry are in
favour of more aid, but this is strongly opposed by senior figures within
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
The leaders will also discuss possible revisions to the United Nations
charter which could increase their influence within the organisation.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Indian security forces thwart BJP mass rally
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
INDIAN security forces yesterday thwarted an attempt by militant Hindus to
hold a banned mass rally in New Delhi, at the cost of bringing the capital
to a virtual standstill.
Some 80,000 police and troops kept demonstrators out of the city centre,
forcing thousands of protesters to gather instead at five points where they
staged noisy rallies and fought running battles with security forces for
much of the day.
Thousands of protesters were detained, including Mr LK Advani and other
leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the right-wing Hindu party which
organised the rally. The BJP said 50 demonstrators were injured, among them
Mr MM Joshi, the party president, who was taken to hospital with head
injuries.
The BJP claimed success in having forced the government to deploy so many
police and troops. Mr Advani said the government had gone 'berserk' and had
'let loose a reign of terror' in the city. The BJP said 100,000 supporters
had taken to the streets, though the figure was difficult to substantiate.
Crowds at the biggest rallying point, in the BJP stronghold of Rajinder
Nagar, numbered no more than 10,000.
The ruling Congress (I) party blamed the BJP for the disruption and said the
rally had been a 'complete failure and a flop'. It said the rally had been
banned because of the threat to public order. Although the BJP had promised
to stage a peaceful event, the government is wary after its supporters
stormed the Ayodhya mosque last December and set off nationwide
inter-religious violence.
The BJP staged the demonstration to press demands for lifting bans on Hindu
militant organisations proscribed after the Ayodhya incident, including the
RSS, a shadowy group from which many of the BJP's own cadres are drawn. The
BJP wants elections in the four states in which BJP-controlled assemblies
were suspended after the mosque's destruction, and are also seeking a
general election.
It is not clear how much yesterday's protests will have advanced the BJP's
cause. Some New Delhi residents blamed the party for disrupting their daily
lives, but others condemned the government. BJP officials plan to decide
their next step today.
The rally showed the BJP's organisational power and the dedication of its
supporters. Because of the government ban, supporters had to smuggle their
way into the city in ones and twos, then keep a low profile until yesterday.
They were housed and fed for up to five days by party supporters in the
capital. Among these was Mr Ramesh Babu, owner of a small bookbinding
business, who said 25 people slept in his home. 'I was proud to do it,' said
Mr Babu, who attended the rally.
The demonstrators travelled from as far away as Kerala, in the southern tip
of India. They were young and old, with a strong middle-class element -
including a tax consultant from Madras, a marine engineer from Bombay and a
lawyer from Rajasthan. Their common wish was to give India a greater sense
of identity as a Hindu nation. They said this meant removing privileges
given to India's Moslems, notably the right to observe Islamic civil laws.
Harking on a standard BJP theme, Mr Babu added that India's Moslems could
not be fully trusted because they favoured Pakistan.

<TEXT>
MR Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said yesterday he was ready to
invite Arab and Israeli delegations to resume stalled Middle East peace
talks in April, adding that his tour of the region made him 'confident
enough' that all parties were willing to return to the negotiations.
Mr Christopher's statement, made in Geneva after his departure yesterday
from Jerusalem, came as senior Palestinian leaders said a US proposal to
break the deadlock over 396 Palestinian deportees held the 'elements to a
solution' to the issue which has blocked the resumption of talks.
There is no indication yet whether the American proposals are acceptable to
the Israeli government which prior to Mr Christopher's visit had appeared to
rule out any further concessions on the deportees.
The revival of full bilateral peace talks by April would be deemed a
successful conclusion to a tour which Mr Christopher and his aides billed in
advance as principally a chance for the new secretary of state to meet the
main players and listen to the issues.
But in spite of continued US insistence that Mr Christopher carried no fresh
proposals to break the deadlock which has encased the talks since Israel's
deportation in mid-December of alleged activists belonging to the Hamas
Islamic movement, American diplomats have been quietly packaging a possible
compromise.
Palestine Liberation Organisation officials in Tunis said yesterday that the
US had proposed that Israel should accelerate the repatriation of the
deportees and issue assurances that it would not resort to further
expulsions in future.
Israel has previously stood by an earlier offer, made in consultation with
the US, to repatriate 101 deportees immediately, and the rest within a year.
Palestinian delegates rejected the offer, calling for Israel to implement
United Nations Security Council resolution 799, which demands the return of
all 396 immediately.
While the Palestinian delegation to the talks has not yet committed
themselves to returning to the table, they issued a statement from Jerusalem
yesterday saying that discussions on the US proposal were continuing and
that they hoped to 'solve outstanding issues in the near future.'
Senior Palestinian officials in Cairo said talks on the proposal would
continue quietly through 'diplomatic channels' and that no formal acceptance
of a compromise offer on the deportees was likely before Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
the Israeli prime minister, travels to Washington to meet President Clinton
next month.

MR KIM YOUNG-SAM, who was inaugurated yesterday as South Korea's seventh
president, said the main goals of his administration would be to deregulate
the economy, eliminate corruption, and reverse a declining work ethic,
writes John Burton in Seoul.
He also offered to meet Mr Kim Il-sung, the North Korean president, 'at any
time and any place' to discuss unification in what would be the first summit
conference between the leaders of the two Koreas.
The 65-year-old former dissident leader declared in his inaugural address
that his government, the first civilian administration in 32 years, would
build a 'New Korea.'
Mr Kim said South Korea threatened to 'become bogged down at the threshold
of the developed world' after achieving considerable economic progress in
the post-war era.
He blamed the country's problems on a declining work ethic and its
centralised economic structure.

FT  26 FEB 93 / China continues to penetrate its future territory: There is
concern over the growing number of Chinese investors in Hong Kong and their
interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN June 1991, Mr T T Tsui, one of Hong Kong's new rich, was in London doling
out HKDollars 16m to refurbish the Victoria and Albert Museum's display of
Chinese antiquities. The Prince of Wales turned up for the occasion.
Last week, Mr Tsui was in Beijing for the launch of a business venture, New
China Hong Kong Group, a company that plans to play the Hong Kong stock
market and invest in China - this time with Mr Li Peng, China's prime
minister, in attendance.
Mr Tsui's impeccable political connections are topped only by his ability to
entice many of Hong Kong's leading businessmen to invest in his company. Mr
Li Ka-shing, one of the colony's wealthiest men, Mr Stanley Ho, Macao's
casino king, and Mr Lim Por Yen, chairman of Lai Sun, a large property
developer are but three of the colony's personalities who have contributed
to the company's paid up capital of HKDollars 400m.
Sections of Hong Kong's business and political establishment have taken more
than a passing interest in Mr Tsui's new company. But their main concern is
with the list of mainland Chinese investors and one in particular, the Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council (cabinet), HKMAO. This is
China's top policy-making body on Hong Kong and reports directly to the
prime minister; it is widely believed to lead the mainland investors who
control about 32.5 per cent of New China Hong Kong's capital.
The Hong Kong government watches New China closely but is powerless to act.
The Securities and Futures Commission, the colony's financial watchdog, vets
management competence, not ownership.
Conflict of interest is the main concern. According to one government
official: 'It has been vividly demonstrated that a mere statement from HKMAO
can affect the Hong Kong stock market and indeed individual stocks. If Hong
Kong people thought that an important agency of the Chinese government had a
financial interest in its policy statements then they would be very
concerned indeed.'
This view has been echoed by merchant bankers and stock brokers in the
colony.
However, western diplomatic observers of Hong Kong take a less alarmist view
of the company. Says one: 'It possibly does give them an advantage, but I
don't think they are ready to compete with some of the more rapacious
personalities in Hong Kong.'
China has always had a presence in Hong Kong. Even in the late 1960s Bank of
China, China Merchants, China Resources and China Travel Service -
collectively known as the 'four heavenly sisters' - had a major role in the
colony's economy.
China Merchants and China Travel Service have both floated subsidiaries on
the Hong Kong stock market. Other Chinese enterprises, China International
Trust and Investment Corporation, CITIC, are now vying with the old British
'hongs', Jardine Matheson and John Swire.
The extent of China's ownership of assets in Hong Kong is not known with any
precision. But last month, a Chinese government official was reported in the
official media saying that in 1992 alone the mainland had invested USDollars
20bn in Hong Kong and Macao, but gave no details.
'The real figure is a lot different from what they admit publicly,' said a
western diplomat.
In the past year, mainland companies have become significant investors in,
and users of, the Hong Kong stock market. The current market value of the
mainland's investments in quoted Hong Kong companies is about HKDollars
45bn. The value of these investments is expected to grow significantly once
mainland Chinese companies begin to list directly on the Hong Kong stock
market.
Mainland companies have also been among the largest buyers of property in
Hong Kong. Brooke Hillier Parker, a property consultant, estimates on the
basis of publicly declared deals that mainland interests acquired property
in Hong Kong with a value of HKDollars 20bn in 1992. That compared with
purchases, mostly in the residential sector, totaling HKDollars 7.6bn in
1991.
Not everyone is optimistic. In a recent issue of Dangdai, a magazine
concerned with mainland politics and economics, an analyst writing under the
pseudonym Wan Li Xing, charted China's takeover of Hong Kong's economy,
based on the way the Communist Party took over Guangzhou (Canton) and
Shanghai 40 years ago.
Wan said that China would co-opt Hong Kong's leading businessmen by offering
them political status as a reward for fostering Hong Kong's economic
development. 'After a certain period of time Hong Kong's economic system
would be absorbed into China's. As a special economic zone, Hong Kong's
economy would not be allowed to develop independently for ever.'

FT  26 FEB 93 / Ghosts of gold and dollars take to the streets of Beijing:
Demand is ballooning for hedges against any further devaluations in China's
currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Beijing newspaper this week told its readers two ghosts were wandering the
city's streets - gold and US dollars.
This was a reference to ballooning Chinese demand for the two commodities as
a hedge against the continued depreciation of China's currency, the
Renminbi, amid persistent rumours of a further sharp devaluation.
The Beijing Youth Daily reported that in the six weeks to mid-February, the
city's main department store sold some RMB4.47m (Pounds 542,253)-worth of
gold jewellery, double the amount for the whole of last year.
Chinese officials this week signalled alarm at the continuing pressure on
the currency, although it was unclear whether this was genuine or connected
with the presence in Beijing of a team from the Office of the US Special
Trade Representative - the first high-level US delegation to visit China
since the change of administration in January.
The US, whose trade deficit with China last year reached Dollars 18bn, does
not want a further depreciation of the Renminbi, as this would make Chinese
exports even more competitive.
US officials have even been hinting that support for China's plans to rejoin
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade may be conditional on it
stabilising its exchange rate.
Chinese officials have pledged to move gradually towards a unified rate
based on the 'market value' of the Renminbi, but foreign bankers in Beijing
are sceptical that a single market rate is possible soon.
Many of China's faltering state enterprises are dependent on 'subsidised'
foreign exchange allocations for imports of raw materials and equipment.
Under China's foreign exchange system, there are broadly two rates: an
administered 'official' rate used largely for trade transactions under the
state plan, and a more market-based rate determined in the 100 or so foreign
exchange 'swap' centres throughout the country - where approved enterprises
are allowed to buy and sell.
Some 80 per cent of foreign exchange transactions are conducted through
these centres. There is also a street 'black market' in many Chinese cities.
Rates on the street shadow those in the swap centres.
Since December, 1989, China's official 'administered' rate has depreciated
by more than 60 per cent against the US dollar, due to several devaluations
and a managed float of the Renminbi. At one stage, the difference between
official and market rates was reduced to about 8 per cent, but in the latter
part of 1992, as China's economic boom and consequent demand for imports
gathered pace, the gap widened dramatically, with the differential this week
standing at about 30 per cent.
With China's economy continuing to grow at a rate exceeding 12 per cent,
there seems little prospect of the gap between official and market rates
narrowing, unless the authorities resorted to strong administrative
intervention - something they have vowed not to do.
Western economists in Beijing say that although Chinese officials are
worried about inflationary pressures caused by an overheated economy,
accompanied by a surge in imports and pressure on the Renminbi, it was
unlikely they would be stampeded into hasty action.
China's trade surplus reached about Dollars 5.5bn in 1992, its foreign
exchange reserves remain healthy at about Dollars 50bn, and it continued to
trade strongly through the first months of this year. 'Maybe they will be
happy to sit back and do little,' said a western official.
That may prove to be the case, although a further widening in the gap
between the official and market rates would almost certainly test the nerve
of Chinese central bankers. China's plans gradually to unify its dual
exchange rate system and bring about at least partial convertibility of its
currency have been set back. Speculation against the Renminbi seems set to
continue.

HOPES were raised last night that China would finally agree to talks with
Britain about Hong Kong's political development when the colonial government
issued a statement suggesting that an announcement of renewed dialogue was
expected shortly.
A government spokesman said that Governor Chris Patten's executive council,
his top advisory body, held a special session last night at which it was
decided not to gazette a bill containing Mr Patten's proposals for a
broadening of democracy in Hong Kong. He did not say when the bill would be
published.
On Wednesday in the legislative council, the colony's law-making body, Mr
Michael Sze, secretary for constitutional affairs, intimated that China
would have to signal its agreement to talks for the government to postpone
the publication of its legislation beyond the end of February.
Last night, the spokesman said the government would make a statement
'explaining the position on this issue within the next few days.' It is
understood the government expects this announcement will concern a return to
the talks with China.
Britain had planned to announce the start of talks last Wednesday, but
Beijing failed to give the go-ahead. It is understood that Britain received
a communication from the Chinese government suggesting it was nearing the
end of deliberations which, for the past week, have left an announcement in
abeyance.
The UK's position has been that it was willing to talk to China about the
arrangements for Hong Kong's 1994-95 elections without pre-conditions. China
has said it would be prepared to talk on the basis of past accords and
understandings, while maintaining opposition to Mr Patten's plans.

TRANSROUTE, the French toll-road operator, yesterday emerged ahead in the
bidding to finance, build and operate Hungary's first private-sector
motorway project.
Hungarian Euro-Expressway, a consortium led by Transroute Internationale,
won the tender for a Dollars 210m (Pounds 147.8m) extension of the M1
motorway to the Austrian and Slovak borders, the Budapest authorities
announced yesterday. Also participating in the consortium are Banque
Nationale de Paris, the French bank, Strabag, the construction group, and
OKHB and OTP, two Hungarian banks.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the London-based
institution aiding eastern Europe, has also agreed to support the venture in
a letter of intent concluded with Budapest. The Hungarian government is
limiting its contribution to Ft1bn (Pounds 8.4m) for the acquisition of land
along the route.
Hungary has an ambitious Dollars 3bn programme to build two bridges across
the Danube and nearly 600km of new motorway.
Three consortiums have already been shortlisted for a 130km extension
costing Dollars 460m (at 1992 prices) to the M5 south-eastern motorway down
to the Serbian and Romanian borders.
The bidders include the two finalists for the M1 tender and another group
led by Bouygues, the French construction company.

FT  26 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Kantor asks EC for talks on Airbus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, yesterday said he has asked
for consultations with the EC over Airbus subsidies and intends to seek
assurances that loans made to the consortiums are being repaid on schedule.
Although the Clinton administration has reassured the EC that it will hold
to the bilateral Airbus agreement, reached last July, a series of public
statements by both President Bill Clinton and Mr Kantor have demonstrated
the administration's continuing preoccupation with Airbus, as conditions in
the US aerospace industry have worsened.
In the last month the US industry has announced thousands of job losses at
McDonnell Douglas, Boeing and Pratt &amp; Whitney.
The president raised his concerns about Airbus at a lunch on Wednesday with
Mr John Major, the British prime minister.
He also told Boeing workers last Monday that he hoped it was not 'too late'
to counter the alleged Dollars 26bn (Pounds 18.3bn) in subsidies paid by the
Airbus governments.
Mr Kantor made the consultation request in a radio interview yesterday.
Under the Airbus pact, the two sides are supposed to meet bi-annually, but
they have yet to do so. The agreement also prohibits future production
supports and limits funding for aircraft development to 33 per cent of total
development costs.
The agreement also established strict terms and conditions for the repayment
of development funds advanced by governments.
According to the US trade representative's office, interest rates on the
funds must be set at close to market levels, which are 'significantly higher
than those charged in the past by Airbus governments'. The pact had strict
'transparency' requirements.
It said the EC would have to make available a complete list of funds
disbursed or committed, information on repayment, and any changes in
commitments which make conditions 'more favourable to Airbus'.
In yesterday's interview, Mr Kantor continued the provocative tone which the
administration - like the Congress - has been taking towards the EC since
coming to power.
'The Europeans,' he said, 'have screamed like pigs stuck under a gate' in
response to 'fairly mild' US actions taken to open markets.
He also said he would meet again with Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner
in charge of trade, next month.
Mr Kantor said he is studying legislation announced on Wednesday by Senators
Max Baucus and John Danforth, which would bring dumping and countervailing
duty complaints against Airbus.
It would also take a leaf from the book of the Airbus partners by helping to
finance a consortium to develop the next generation of US aircraft.
Senator Baucus said the US government would not stand by while the largest
US export industry 'falls victim to a European aerospace industry that would
not even exist if it were not for the treasuries of France, Spain, Germany
and the UK.'
Nothing in the bilateral Airbus pact restricts the rights of US producers'
to file unfair trade cases.
If they do, however, the EC can - after consultations - terminate the Airbus
agreement.
Furthermore, any cases brought by the US industry would risk alienating
European customers
Such a course of action would still not affect the sale of subsidised Airbus
aircraft to the rest of the world.

THE US Export-Import Bank yesterday granted Russia's leading natural gas
concern, Gazprom, an Dollars 86.2m (Pounds 60.7m) loan to purchase 295
tractors from Illinois-based Caterpillar.
The loan is the largest ever approved for a Russian project by the bank. The
US-backed financing comes at a time when Russia is Dollars 367.7m in arrears
on US-guaranteed grain credits, and is struggling to reschedule foreign
debt.
An Eximbank spokeswoman said fears that Caterpillar would lose the tractor
sale to Komatsu of Japan helped push the loan through. Caterpillar had
already lost the pipeline equipment portion of the deal to Komatsu, which
had arranged Japanese financing.
The loan is a coup for Caterpillar, which has been seeking to expand its
business to the Russian oil and gas industry. The Caterpillar earthmoving
tractors will be used in the construction of a large pipeline system
connecting the Yamal Peninsula in northern Siberia to Gazprom's gas pipeline
system to the west at Torzhok.
Gazprom controls 40 per cent of the world's natural gas production. Gazprom
will pay Mitsui, the Japanese trading company that arranged the Dollars
96.5m tractor sale, Dollars 14.5m in cash. The balance will come from the
Eximbank loan, which carries 5.93 per cent interest and extends over 5
years, beginning in March, 1994.
Gazprom's repayment to Eximbank is guaranteed by the Bank for Foreign Trade
of the Russian Federation. The Eximbank is in the process of arranging an
oil and gas sector agreement with Russia to have oil and gas revenues as
security for loan financing.
However, that agreement is not complete, and will not apply to this loan.
Caterpillar will begin producing the tractors in its East Peoria, Illinois,
plant in the second quarter. The order represents about eight months'
production.

FT  26 FEB 93 / World Trade News: US-Japan feud takes to the air - Michiyo
Nakamoto reports on the dispute over an aviation accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO

<TEXT>
HARDLY a week passes without a simmering trade dispute between Japan and the
US threatening to flare up into an all-out trade war.
This week, officials from the US and Japan are meeting in Washington to try
to avert a potentially damaging row over aviation rights which has already
triggered threats and counter-threats of retaliation.
At stake is a large market for Asian-Pacific air travel from Tokyo, an area
expected to be one of the largest growth markets for the industry.
The Japanese airline industry believes that its entire international
operation could be at risk and it is watching the outcome of the talks very
closely.
The current confrontation began with the refusal by Japan to allow United
Airlines, the US carrier, to extend its New York-Tokyo flights to Sydney.
Under a bilateral aviation accord signed between the US and Japan in 1952,
US carriers have what are known as 'beyond rights'.
These give permission to carry passengers not only from the US to Japan but
from there on to a third destination.
United saw the Japanese refusal as a violation of its 'beyond rights' and
took the matter to the US Department of Transport, which also ruled that
Japan had violated the bilateral aviation accord. Japan's Ministry of
Transport maintains that the flight is not an extension of the New
York-Tokyo route but for all practical purposes a separate flight that is
aimed at eating into the market for travel between Japan and Australia.
The two countries' aviation accord states that US airlines should serve
primarily US-Japan traffic.
US carriers exercising 'beyond rights' to a third destination out of Tokyo
should be carrying mainly US passengers, not Japanese passengers, to that
destination.
However, given the extra travelling time a Tokyo stop over entails, it is
highly unlikely that United will be carrying mainly US passengers via Tokyo.
'It is nothing less than an attempt by United to take Japanese passengers
away from Japanese airlines,' says an official at the Ministry of Transport.
Japan is prepared to give United the go-ahead on condition that passengers
from Tokyo to Sydney be restricted to less than 50 per cent. That, for the
Japanese, would be in line with the stipulation that the primary route be
between the US and Japan.
The US says that it is impossible to quantify what is meant by primary route
in the aviation accord.
From the US point of view, Japan's refusal to grant United unrestricted
'beyond rights' is an attempt unilaterally to redefine the bilateral accord
in order to protect the country's airlines from international competition.
'In order to keep JAL viable, it was necessary to keep market share at all
costs,' says a US industry official. The Japanese Ministry of Transport is
trying to protect the Japanese market by reining-in other countries' rights
and restricting foreign carriers' slots at Narita Airport and at Kansai,
which is scheduled to open in 1994, the US official says.
Japanese officials admit to being protective of their air traffic. If US
carriers, which have a much lower cost-base than the Japanese, are allowed
to compete for business from Tokyo to destinations other than the US,
Japan's airlines will be devastated.
'The supply-and-demand balance will be upset and we will see what the US
domestic industry is seeing - excessive competition leading to prices below
cost,' says Mr Chikara Sugimoto, director of international affairs at JAL.
But what Japan is most concerned about is that if United is allowed
unrestricted 'beyond rights' to Sydney now, it could set a precedent for US
airlines wanting to break into the most profitable routes Japanese airlines
have: Tokyo to Europe.
'It is a matter of life or death for Japanese airlines,' says Mr Sugimoto.
The dispute has led Japan to take an unusually firm stance against the US,
with Japanese aviation officials promising retaliation if the US attempts to
penalise Japanese carriers for the government's stance.
The feeling in Tokyo is that the US is taking excessive liberties with a
bilateral accord that was signed more than 40 years ago when the aviation
industry was dominated by US carriers and direct long-distance air travel
was impossible. That view is shared by other countries such as Thailand and
France which have abrogated their aviation treaties with the US. The UK in
1977 renegotiated its US aviation accord.
Meanwhile, Australia, which is also concerned about losing its share of
travel to and from Japan, has put in a formal request to Northwest Airlines
to limit one of its three flights from Tokyo to Sydney to US passengers
only.
The Japanese government may have to push for a renegotiation of the aviation
accord, a Ministry of Transport official said. However, as this would be
politically difficult, Japan would prefer to reach agreement on how to
define 'primary route' as stipulated in the accord.
'It is a question of interpretation and application,' JAL's Mr Sugimoto
says. As aviation authorities face each other across the negotiation table,
retaliation may have been averted for the time being. But as similar
agreements between the US and Japan have shown, a difference of
interpretation is usually the most difficult gap to breach.

MR Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America,
yesterday attacked the EC for 'building barricades between them and us'
while removing barriers between its member states.
The US government must not 'cut and run' at the Uruguay Round trade talks,
he said. Enraged by a number of EC directives governing broadcasting,
satellites and rental rights, he said the EC is regulating 'every nook and
cranny of the audio-visual landscape' to restrict US access to its market.
The colourful former aide to President Lyndon Johnson warned that without
full national treatment for US films and television programmes in the EC,
'we will, like Banquo's ghost, haunt the edges of the marketplace, our
clamours for access and equity unheeded and unheard'.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Moslem enclaves may fall to Serbs

<TEXT>
SERB forces are close to seizing control of some of the Moslem enclaves in
eastern Bosnia targeted for air drops of emergency relief supplies,
according to western diplomats in the Serbian capital.
They said a string of hamlets around the village of Cerska, where thousands
of Moslem refugees may be located, is the most vulnerable to Serb forces.
The town of Srebrenica is also under threat. Diplomats say it may house as
many as 70,000 people, twice its pre-war population.
Despite earlier warnings by Serb military leaders that the air drop risked
spreading the war, Bosnian Serb commanders yesterday issued an order not to
shoot at US aircraft, according to Tanjug, the Belgrade news agency. The
statement coincided with intensified preparations for the US operation.
Western diplomats in Belgrade said leaflets written in Serbo-Croat
describing the operation could be dropped in a matter of hours.
Meanwhile relief workers returning from the north-eastern city of Tuzla said
conditions were rapidly deteriorating in the largest of a handful of
government strongholds in the area.
Bosnian military leaders said support to Tuzla is essential and pleaded for
the opening of the city airfield for humanitarian relief.
'It would provide immediate access for aid to hundreds of thousands of
people,' said a western diplomat.
Swamped with refugees forced from their homes by Bosnian Serb forces,
Tuzla's population of 720,000 is barely coping, even though it has received
10 UN convoys in the last few months. It is not under direct attack, but it
has been cut off by Croat and Serb forces. Relief workers estimates energy
reserves will last six weeks.
If Tuzla is not opened up, diplomats are worried that the city will descend
into chaos.
Limited ground-based relief operations continued elsewhere in eastern
Bosnia.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's plan for high altitude air-drops of relief supplies
into Bosnia is intended to highlight not only his humanitarian concerns but
to demonstrate a new US willingness actively to engage in European security
problems.
At his press conference with Mr John Major, the British prime minister, on
Wednesday afternoon, he said he had been assured by General Colin Powell,
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, that operations could be conducted at
minimal risk to US pilots.
He conceded that high altitude air-drops might not be optimally accurate,
but that it was planned 'to leaflet the area in advance' so that if any
loads fell outside the intended half-mile target area they could easily be
located.
Mr Major again endorsed Mr Clinton's proposals in US television interviews
yesterday morning and the administration thinks it is in the process of
lining up enough allied support to minimise objections to the initiative.
Ms Jennone Walker, of the White House national security council, said that
even if Russia could not assist in this particular operation it was
administration's general policy to offer Moscow 'a constructive role in
European security, including a military role'.
In an address to the European Institute here, Ms Walker contrasted the new
US engagement in European security issues with that of the Bush
administration, which, she said, saw the unravelling of the former
Yugoslavia in purely humanitarian terms and had down-played US strategic
interests.
'The Yugoslav tragedy,' she said, 'illustrates that military power still
matters in Europe'.
She added that beyond the airdrops, 'I think you will see us willing to use
force again on a case-by-case basis, but in a variety of combinations.' She
cited possible umbrellas for action as the UN, the Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe and Nato.
Mr Clinton had also stressed the continuing US commitment to find a
negotiated settlement in Bosnia, though neither he nor Mr Major specifically
endorsed the existing Vance-Owen plan dividing up the country into
semi-autonomous provinces. Mr Major said he had 'no view' on its merits and
Mr Clinton said it might be difficult to monitor and enforce from a
peacekeeping point of view.

FRANCE'S beleaguered Socialist government yesterday faced a barrage of
strikes and demonstrations across the country from farmers, dockers,
scientists and factory workers.
Militant farmers blocked the Paris-Lille motorway with tractors in protest
against the fall in potato prices. The port of Dunkirk was disrupted by
dockers protesting against the government's dock reorganisation scheme.
The Socialists, already embarrassed by this week's violent demonstrations by
fishermen and facing humiliating defeat in next month's parliamentary
elections, have for some time been plagued by protests from farmers and
dockers.
However the government now faces industrial action from public sector
employees. The staff at the National Centre for Scientific Research in
Meudon-Bellevue yesterday protested against the proposed closure of the
site, which employs 400 people.
There was also a strike at Syseca, a subsidiary of Thomson, the
state-controlled electronics group, in Toulouse, in protest at job cuts.

DIGITAL Equipment, the troubled US computer maker, is closing its
manufacturing facility in Galway, Ireland, with the loss of 780 jobs.
Work will be phased out over the next 12 months, the company said yesterday.
Its European software development and distribution headquarters in the same
area, with 350 employees, will be retained.
In Dublin, Mr Ruari Quinn, minister for enterprise and employment, said the
decision was 'a major disappointment'.
There was intense lobbying by the UK and Irish governments when it seemed
Digital would choose between Ayr, Scotland, or Galway for closure. The Irish
government has asked the European Commission informally to investigate UK
government incentives, which Dublin suspects helped to keep the Ayr plant
open.
Manufacturing will also continue at South Queensferry, Scotland, where the
Alpha microprocessor, said to be the fastest in the world, is made.
Mr Edward McDonough, Digital's vice-president for manufacturing, said the
closure was part of a three-year restructuring programme. The Galway
operations would not go to Ayr but to other Digital plants.
The decision had been made on the basis of manufacturing efficiency and not
for social reasons.
Once the world's leading minicomputer manufacturer, Digital has been hit by
changes in the computer industry which have cut the profit margins on
computer hardware.

<TEXT>
MR Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French industry minister, said yesterday he
supported plans to concentrate the EC's advanced television strategy on the
development of wide-screen television programmes and equipment.
Mr Strauss-Kahn, in Brussels for a meeting of EC industry ministers, said he
thought such an approach might win the support of Britain, which is blocking
an earlier attempt to pump Ecu500m (Pounds 414.5m) of funding into
high-definition television (HDTV) over the next five years.
France has been one of the leading advocates of an aggressive HDTV strategy,
partly because Thomson, the French electronics manufacturer, has invested
heavily in the original 'Mac' family of HDTV standards promoted by the
European Commission.
Britain opposes funding because it believes the Mac standards are being
overtaken by digital HDTV technology developed in the US.
Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC industry commissioner, said last week there was
no need for Europe to develop its own exclusive digital HDTV standards,
because European companies - including Thomson, and Philips of the
Netherlands - were already bidding to produce the US technology.
Mr Strauss-Kahn agreed yesterday that European companies were playing a
leading role in developing digital technology, but he said digital HDTV
might not arrive before 2005. Mr Bangemann has indicated that digital HDTV
might be possible as early as 1997.

FT  26 FEB 93 / French left discovers green bolthole: But political
re-grouping spells trouble for recently formed ecologist coalition -
Assemblee Nationale Election '93
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BRICE Lalonde, the energetic head of Generation Ecologie, is plastered
all over the French press these days. He is pictured breakfasting with his
children for Paris-Match, cycling with his wife in Le Nouvel Observateur,
and even sniffing a spring of parsley on the cover of VSD.
The publicity is scarcely surprising. Mr Lalonde, 47, who resigned last year
as socialist environment minister, is a pivotal figure in the French
electoral campaign. Some polls suggest that GE's alliance with the
idealistic Greens could win second place, ahead of the socialists and behind
the conservatives, in next month's parliamentary elections.
Mr Lalonde is also in the limelight as a central player in the 'political
big bang' announced last week by Mr Michel Rocard, former premier, to create
a centre-left coalition of socialists and ecologists.
Until now, Mr Lalonde has steered an independent path, spurning the
socialists' suggestions of an electoral alliance and flirting inconclusively
with the conservatives, but he has been much more positive in his response
to Mr Rocard, the man who appointed him to the French cabinet in 1988.
Mr Antoine Waechter, 44, head of the Greens, immediately rejected the Rocard
proposals. Mr Lalonde praised his former boss and cordially invited him to
join GE in the current campaign.
The split between Mr Lalonde and Mr Waechter over the Rocard plan is the
first significant sign of strain between the two ecologist parties since the
start of the parliamentary campaign and could mark the return of their old
rivalry.
The Green party was the dominant force in French environmentalism until Mr
Lalonde formed GE in 1990.
But whereas the Green party sees itself as an ideological movement, GE is a
product of contemporary French politics. It is committed to environmental
issues. Mr Lalonde, former head of Friends of the Earth, left the cabinet
after a row over conservation. But GE is far less radical than the Green
party in key areas, notably nuclear power, where it advocates tighter
regulation of waste, rather than an outright ban.
Mr Lalonde has cleverly positioned it as a bolthole for socialist
sympathisers who are disillusioned with their own scandal-scarred party
after a decade in power, but who can not bring themselves to vote
conservative. Even before the Rocard plan he made no secret of his hopes
that GE would eventually be a linchpin in re-grouping of the French left.
Until recently the two ecologist parties were at loggerheads. The crunch
came at last year's regional elections when they clashed in separate
campaigns and won a combined 14 per cent of the vote, a significant advance
on the Greens' 3.8 per cent in the 1988 parliamentary elections and even on
their 10.6 per cent in the 1989 European elections.
Mr Waechter, well aware that other ambitious Greens, such as Ms Dominique
Voynet, the 34-year-old party spokeswoman, were snapping at his heels,
agreed in November to join forces with GE for the parliamentary poll.
So far the campaign has gone smoothly. Mr Lalonde, Mr Waechter and,
increasingly, Ms Voynet, have presented a united front. There have been no
ideological squabbles, possibly because the emphasis of campaigning has been
on possible liaison with the established parties, rather than on the
ecologists' own policies.
The ecologists have also benefited from the steady stream of scandals and
gloomy economic news that has haunted the socialists. The latest polls give
theecologists 15-20 per cent of the vote, leaving them, thanks to
idiosyncracies of the French electoral system, with between 2 and 12 of the
577 parliamentary seats.
The pollsters have not yet had a chance to gauge the impact of Mr Rocard's
proposals. The ecologists are confident it will give them another boost in
the polls. It may well do so. But once the elections are over and Mr Rocard
starts to assemble his alliance, his 'political big bang' may prove just as
explosive to the ecologists' coalition, as to his prime target, the
socialists.
Brice Lalonde, 47, Parisian journalist who founded Generation Ecologie in
1990. Previously in mainstream politics as the Socialists' environment
minister. Stormed out of cabinet last year, in protest at its conservation
policy. Has since concentrated on GE, helped by his wife, Patricia, his
communications director. Greens see him as political opportunist.
Antoine Waechter, 44, classic product of 1968 student riots, now heads the
Greens and embodies idealistic side of French environmentalism. Was
president of the local nature group at 16 and read ecology at university.
After career in environmentalism, now faces toughest challenge. Has to stave
off threat from Generation Ecologie, and from within his own party.

The city of Tomsk, which yesterday held its first auction of medium and

Mr Igor Piltsov, an entrepreneur and local council member, said his company,
Stix, had an agreement with Estee Lauder to set up shops in Tomsk and other
western Siberian cities such as Novosibirsk, Kemerovo and Novokuznetsk. Mr
Piltsov said the US cosmetics company had sent an architect to help him
design a shop in Tomsk and sales staff had been trained in Moscow, where
Estee Lauder is already established. A pot of face-cream costs Rbs5,000
(Pounds 6.3) at current exchange rates, or the minimum monthly rouble wage.

ONCE Mr Giorgio La Malfa learned yesterday he was under investigation for
alleged illicit financing of his Republican party, he had little option but
to resign from the leadership.
Ever since Milan magistrates began investigations into political corruption
a year ago, Mr La Malfa has sought to present the Republicans as 'the party
of the honest'. In May he even boasted how the party was not involved.
Some of Mr La Malfa's critics felt his being caught in the magistrates'
investigatory net was a form of poetic justice. But Italian politics risked
losing - albeit temporarily - one of the few national figures capable of
renovating the moribund postwar party structure.
Son of the long-time leader of the Republicans, Mr Ugo La Malfa, the
53-year-old economist has been in the forefront of those arguing for a
shake-up of the traditional party system.
His open manner, clear membership of a new generation and apparent personal
integrity gave him an influence out all proportion to the size of the
Republican party. His party won just 5 per cent of the vote in last April's
general elections.
The party's tradition as a stronghold of the Italian liberal intelligensia
and its potential as a government coalition partner gave added weight to Mr
La Malfa's position.
He took over as party leader in 1987 and became the first Republican to
break the postwar alliance with the ruling Christian Democrats. He refused
to join the seventh Andreotti government in June 1991. This was done largely
out of pique because the party was not offered the portfolios of its liking.
Nevertheless, Mr La Malfa was able to represent this subsequently as a
policy decision - cutting free from a discredited system of coalition
government.
Since then Mr La Malfa has effectively been in opposition, flirting with the
former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), the populist Lombard
League and dissidents in the Socialist and Christian Democrat parties such
as Mr Mario Segni, the referendum movement leader. In these contacts he has
sought to find a new and wider majority to rule during the current
transition period with the specific task of introducing electoral reforms
and supervising economic austerity. A minority within his party has
challenged this oppositional role at a time of such national emergency.
Well before his resignation the Republicans had begun to be implicated in
the ever-widening corruption scandal.
In particular a former Republican appointee on the board of Enel, the
national electricity authority, has begun to make a series of damaging
allegations about the latter's pay-offs to political parties, including the
Republicans.
These developments obliged Mr La Malfa to call a special party congress on
March 12 to consider the party's involvement in political corruption and to
seek a new endorsement for his mandate as party leader. Then last week Mr
Giorgio Meddri, former political secretary of the party and a close friend,
was arrested for allegedly receiving illegal funds for the Republicans.
It is still uncertain whether the party will accept Mr La Malfa's
resignation. But in the meantime the plight of Mr La Malfa, symbolising the
progressive decapitation of the Italian political class by the corruption
scandal, is likely to speed up discussion of ways to limit the scope of the
magistrates' investigations.
Mr Giovanni Conso, who became justice minister 12 days ago, said his
ministry was working on proposals to tackle the phenomenon of corruption
that took account of both the legal and politico-economic considerations at
stake. He said it was vital to come up with a quick solution.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Stalin's nuclear city goes on the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of Russia's most secret cities has taken on western privatisation
experts to help it sell off shops, restaurants and small businesses.
Tomsk-7, its secrecy denoted by the number, was created by Stalin in 1949 to
help the Soviet Union make a nuclear bomb.
Set in the heart of Siberian forestland, the town is still so heavily
guarded that even a trip to the beach involves crossing a Russian equivalent
of Checkpoint Charlie, lest intruders try swimming across from the other
side of the Tom river.
It is still closed to foreigners, and even Russians from other parts of the
country. Its main role is to produce enriched uranium and plutonium for
nuclear weapons. A spin-off is to supply 40 per cent of the heating for the
neighbouring city of Tomsk.
Barbed-wired gates to the town slam shut behind a bus carrying in a team
from the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's investment arm,
and another set of gates bar the way ahead. A guard from Russia's internal
troops checks passports.
The restrictions on visitors to the town will go once its remaining two
military reactors are closed, Mr Yuri Krasnov, the city council chief, says,
although the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry says this is unlikely to happen
until the year 2000.
It says a new power plant has to be built for Tomsk and a new centre made
ready to cleanse ageing plutonium which needs replacing in nuclear warheads
not earmarked for destruction.
The difficulties of shifting Russia's military-industrial machine mean that
Tomsk-7 will continue to produce new plutonium to renew existing warheads
for the foreseeable future.
The task of adjusting is especially hard for a town of 100,000 inhabitants
geared to just one thing. As one IFC official put it: 'Does anyone know how
to restructure a closed city which makes plutonium?'
'Two years ago we could not even invite foreigners here,' says Mr Krasnov,
who keeps in his office a portrait of Andrei Sakharov, the nuclear physicist
turned human rights champion.
A straw poll of residents asked about privatisation showed support for any
reform which might improve supplies of food and consumer goods that were
once among the best in the country thanks to the city's special status.
The IFC's brief is to try to help do just this. However, Mr Nikolai
Proponenko, Tomsk-7's deputy mayor, has also been quick to ask for IFC help
in finding investors or customers for the larger establishments which are
its main source of employment.
The city's chemical works, said to devote just 10 per cent of its capacity
to producing components for nuclear weapons, is looking, for instance, to
market extra-powerful magnets and metallic powders for the ceramics
industry.
'Apart from the service sector we have nothing that can generate new jobs,'
Mr Proponenko explained. 'We cannot change the profile of the industry we
already have.'

FT  26 FEB 93 / Storm clouds gather over global economy: The G7 must find a
rapport tomorrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIALLY, it will be a 'get to know you' session, with no decisions or
communique planned.
But tomorrow's meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers and central
bank governors in London could turn out to be one of the more important
gatherings of the policy-making group - as well as giving Mr Lloyd Bentsen,
the new US Treasury secretary, and Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, the
recently-appointed Japanese finance minister, a chance to meet G7
colleagues.
The ministers - from the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and
Canada - will be meeting in extremely difficult circumstances.
Europe's economy is causing particular concern, with output in Germany and
France falling and threatening to pull the rest of the continent into
recession.
Japan is facing one of its most serious economic crises since the second
world war and its trade surplus is growing.
Protectionist pressures, encouraged by difficult economic conditions, are
again emerging as a threat to world trade and welfare.
Currencies are under renewed strain with the yen testing new highs against
the dollar and sterling and the lira fluctuating around historic lows
against the D-Mark.
Of the G7 industrialised democracies only the US has a politically strong
administration.
Mr Brian Mulroney's resignation this week as Canadian prime minister has
come hard on the heels of corruption scandals and a cabinet reshuffle in
Italy.
France's Socialist government is facing defeat in next month's National
Assembly elections. The centre-right coalition in Germany has so far failed
to produce convincing answers to the economic and social problems caused by
unification. Japan has a weak government.
Since sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism last
September, the government of Mr John Major has been among the west's walking
wounded, with the Tory party divided over Europe and unable yet to declare
an end to the longest recession since the second world war.
The US, by contrast, appears to have returned to growth with a charismatic
young president and a programme to break years of budget gridlock in
Washington.
But in terms of international economic policy, President Bill Clinton's
administration is very much an unknown quantity. Other G7 members will be
looking to Mr Bentsen for clarification.
Mr Bentsen has said that he wants to revive the G7 as a forum for
co-operation, putting a recent history of bickering in the past. But nobody
has a clear idea of his plans while some of the new US administration's
actions over trade and currency have unsettled America's partners.
The Japanese have come away from preparatory talks with the US feeling
wrong-footed on currencies.
US officials first gave private assurances that Washington was not seeking
an increased value for the yen to combat Japan's growing trade surplus only
for Mr Bentsen to say last Friday that he favoured a higher yen.
Efforts have since been made to play down Mr Bentsen's remarks. Indeed, the
US Treasury line is to support Mr Hayashi and plans for fiscal stimulus in
Japan. Mr Bentsen may simply have made a mistake and spoken out of turn, but
his comments have left uncertainty in the air.
Recent US moves against imports of steel and leisure vehicles and President
Clinton's adverse comments about the European Airbus programme are difficult
to reconcile with the president's pledge to put a 'real effort' into
completing the Uruguay Round of world trade liberalisation talks.
The UK hosts of the meeting think that the US administration will support
the multilateral trading system and that its trade grumbles concern
'specifics'.
It is clear, however, that the new US administration will put America first
as part of its policy to revitalise the economy. Mr Bentsen pushed hard for
tomorrow's meeting, suggesting that the US will seek support from its allies
through action to boost growth and combat unemployment.
The German delegation can expect to be questioned over the Bundesbank's
monetary stance. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, will seek to
reassure his partners that the Bonn government is pressing ahead with its
solidarity pact, with its provisions for curbing the budget deficit and
controlling wages. There may even be discreet hints of an early cut in
Bundesbank interest rates to ease the pressure of Germany's tight monetary
policy on its ERM partners.
Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, will point to the UK's expansionary
fiscal policy and the substantial easing of monetary policy since September
as evidence that Britain has 'done its bit' for global growth. Japan may
outline a new fiscal package.
But the atmosphere of the talks will be as important as the substantive
discussions. Numerous economic problems are looming beyond the G7's
boundaries, with near hyperinflation in Russia topping the list. The big
industrial powers need to establish a rapport among themselves if they are
to deal effectively with such difficulties. If they achieve that in London,
the G7 meeting will have been a success.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Bundesbank in 'solidarity pact' appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German Bundesbank yesterday called for urgent action to conclude the
drawn-out negotiations in Bonn between the government, the federal states
and the opposition on a 'solidarity pact' to revive the east German economy.
In its most outspoken intervention to date, the central bank stepped up
pressure on the politicians to bury their broad differences over the size
and shape of extra taxes needed to finance soaring spending in the east.
'It is imperative that the phase of controversial discussions does not last
much longer,' said Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank.
'Business needs clarity about what the whole package of measures means, and
it needs it soon.'
His call suggests a growing concern in Frankfurt at the prospect of weeks if
not months of further negotiations, causing uncertainty in the financial and
currency markets, and reducing the room for the Bundesbank to cut further
its lead interest rates.
It came as the opposition Social Democrats in the German parliament
unanimously approved proposals, including sharp increases in taxation from
July 1, and excluding any cuts in social spending - in broad contradiction
to the government's plans.
Mr Tietmeyer said public spending cuts should be no less than those proposed
by the Finance Ministry, amounting to some DM20bn (Pounds 8.4bn) a year. He
warned that the scope for further tax increases was slim from an economic
viewpoint, and that the burden of taxes and other contributions was already
high in Germany in comparison to other countries.
'A further substantial increase (in the tax burden) could damage the
long-term competitive position of German business,' he warned.
On the positive side, he said that wage developments this year had been a
victory for good sense, referring to the 3 per cent settlement for public
sector workers.
Referring to the outlook for further cuts in interest rates, Mr Tietmeyer
said that money supply growth was showing signs of the desired slowdown.
Broad money, M3, fell by 2.3 per cent in January on a seasonally adjusted,
annualised basis. Mr Tietmeyer said that the figure had ben distorted by
special factors and over 6 months January M3 had grown by 6.5 per cent.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Britain and US are bright spots in bleak global economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain and the US are among the few bright spots in a bleak global economy,
according to the latest quarterly worldwide survey of business optimism from
Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group.
The survey of 11,000 executives in 16 countries recorded a sharp increase in
sales and profits expectations for the first quarter of this year among
managers in Britain, while hopes in the US were steady at a relatively high
level. However, in Europe as a whole first quarter sales expectations fell
to their lowest level since D&amp;B began polling in 1988. The Japanese survey
was the gloomiest since 1990.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Spending power in UK below EC average
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH people's real spending power fell well below the average of
continental Europeans in 1991, according to Eurostat, the EC statistics
office in Luxembourg.
The UK thus joined Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece at below the average
per capita income of the Community - but without being poor enough to get
the heavy funding earmarked for these member states to enable them to catch
up.
Nevertheless, the European Commission proposed on Wednesday that the
Merseyside and Highlands and Islands regions of the UK be made eligible for
the highest levels of EC regional aid. These are devoted to Europe's most
backward areas - and put the two UK regions on a par with the south of
Italy, Spain and Portugal, western Ireland and northern Greece.
Eurostat calculates that gross domestic product (GDP) per head in the UK in
1991 was 95.5 per cent of the EC average, based on purchasing power
parities. This is obtained through adjusting GDP by the ratio between prices
for comparable goods in different countries.
In 'real' or purchasing power terms, therefore, the UK income per head in
1991 was Ecu14,732 (Pounds 12,168.63), against an EC average of Ecu15,432.
Top of the list was Luxembourg at Ecu19,636 per head, followed by Germany
(Ecu18,345), and France (Ecu17,250 per head). Italy as a whole was
substantially above the UK at Ecu15,890 per head.
Of the four poorest countries below the average line, Spain, the best off,
is well below the UK at Ecu11,964 per capita - or 77.6 per cent of the EC
average - with the very poorest, Greece, at Ecu7,397, or 48 per cent,
according to Eurostat.
In international terms, no individual EC country exceeds the average US per
capita income of Ecu20,847, at 1991 purchasing power standards, and only
Luxembourg and Germany exceeded Japanese income levels of Ecu17,941.
The explanation for the British plunge in relative purchasing power was that
in 1991, UK GDP contracted by 2.2 per cent, according to Eurostat, against
average EC growth of 1.8 per cent.

FT  26 FEB 93 / German businessmen see deeper recession this year
</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN entrepreneurs see no prospect of a domestic economic improvement in
1993 and are instead planning further production cuts and redundancies,
according to the biannual poll of business opinion by the German chambers of
commerce and industry, the DIHT.
The survey, which takes the pulse of 20,000 companies in west Germany and
more than 5,000 in the east, suggests that the number of businessmen
believing the economy will slip further into recession is steadily
increasing.
In western Germany, 48 per cent of entrepreneurs see the state of the
economy worsening, compared with 31 per cent last autumn. Only 10 per cent
of them see the future with confidence, compared with 18 per cent six months
ago. Further job cuts are to be expected, with employers blaming high labour
costs as the main cause. Investment plans are to be revised downwards and
structural problems are apparent in all sectors of the economy, the report
says.
'The recession is widening and a spiraling economic decline cannot be ruled
out any longer,' Mr Franz Schoser, chief executive of DIHT, said yesterday.
What hopes there are for a recovery are pinned on economic growth in the US,
a moderate growth in salaries and a further reduction in interest rates, he
added.
But uncertainty over the future economic policy of the federal government is
aggravating feelings of instability among business men and hampering
investments. In western Germany, 43 per cent of companies are planning to
invest less this year, compared with 34 per cent last autumn.
Despite the recent appreciation of the dollar against the D-Mark, more than
a third of businessmen expect no immediate rise in their exports.
However, glimmers of hope come from eastern Germany where the mood is
slightly less pessimistic. While more entrepreneurs there also believe that
the overall economic situation is worsening, a third of them expect the
situation in their own companies to improve. This is slightly more than in
the last survey.
The most optimism is in the trade, services and construction sectors. Food
stuffs, luxury and consumer goods are the targets of increased investment.
In general, the level of investment is continuing to increase, showing the
sustained efforts of companies to improve productivity.

FT  26 FEB 93 / 1.5m lodge property claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FEWER than 15 per cent of all property claims in the former East Germany
have been settled, and it will take another decade to resolve the
outstanding claims, officials at the federal office for property questions
said yesterday.
In its first comprehensive report since December 31, 1992, when all
restitution and compensation claims had to be registered with the local
authorities, it shows that 1.5m people applied to claim 2.5m titles on
property.
Of that figure, over 119,700 claims for enterprises have been made, of which
23.16 per cent have been settled. Over 2m claims for houses have been
registered, but only 281,902 have settled.
Under the amended terms of the 1990 law on restitution and compensation of
property in east Germany, not all property can be returned to their original
owners, and compensation is neither full nor calculated at current prices.
In principle property confiscated by the former east German communist regime
between 1949 and 1990 can be returned, as well as property confiscated
between 1933 and 1945.
But compensation for the latter is calculated on the value of property in
the 1930s, while a a ceiling of DM300,000 (Pounds 127,000) has been
recommended by the finance ministry for property confiscated after 1949.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Gonzalez defends policy
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRIME MINISTER Felipe Gonzalez yesterday rejected calls to stage early
elections and insisted that Spain would remain within the European Monetary
System.
Mr Gonzalez, who is being buffeted by waning public support, divisions
within his governing socialist party and by market pressure on the peseta,
said it would 'irresponsible' to hold elections in the present climate. He
wished to serve out his term until the autumn, 'by which time it is possible
some of the uncertainties will have disappeared'.
Speaking to a large gathering of senior businessmen in Madrid, Mr Gonzalez
said he hoped economic pressures would abate as his government made it clear
that it would not swerve from its policy of tight monetary discipline within
the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS.
'We will resolutely and permanently maintain our rigorous policy to contain
the deficit and reduce inflation,' Mr Gonzalez said. He said the high
domestic interest rates would not be eased until salary restraint brought
down labour costs and boosted Spain's competitiveness.
Mr Gonzalez added he would resist calls to artificially inject growth into
the economy and that he had no intention of letting the peseta float. He
firmly backed the government's economic team and risked criticism from the
left wing of his party and the unions.
The business leaders, who are currently facing overnight money market rates
of 19 per cent, gave Mr Gonzalez a lukewarm reception. The leader of Spain's
employers' association said the pro-union strike law sponsored in parliament
by Mr Gonzalez's party was 'a declaration of war' against the business
community. Earlier the association's chief economist urged a major
devaluation of the peseta, even at the expense of leaving the ERM.
For the first time in several days, the Bank of Spain reduced its
intervention on the money markets as pressure on the peseta eased.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Midland calls for subsidised bank loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland Bank, last night called for the
government to subsidise banks to provide loans to small businesses, and to
give tax breaks to individuals to provide new forms of equity finance.
It is the first time a bank chief executive has publicly indicated that
losses suffered by banks on small business lending may lead to them limiting
their exposure to small companies unless they receive public subsidies.
Mr Pearse admitted that banks had sometimes 'pulled the rug too soon' from
under struggling small companies. But he said tax incentives were needed
because otherwise the return on equity capital for small businesses was not
high enough.
Banks have grown increasingly worried at these losses. National Westminster
this week disclosed that nearly half of its Pounds 1.3bn provisions for
possible bad debts in UK branch banking in 1992 were on loans of less than
Pounds 50,000.
Mr Pearse, speaking at the City University Business School last night, said
the government should promote a partnership between itself, businesses and
banks rather than the three 'being caught up in a rather sterile slanging
match'.
Mr Pearse called for two government innovations to attract more debt and
equity finance to small businesses:
A 'manufacturing support scheme' which would give tax breaks to individuals
to provide equity finance to small businesses. This would overcome the
obstacle of the small size of such investments and the poor risks associated
with them.
A Pounds 70m loan support scheme that would act as a form of subsidy to
industry. The government would provide support to banks to allow them to
offer medium and long-term loans to companies at 1 per cent over base rate.
Mr Pearse said that unless the government, banks and businesses found
answers to the financial difficulties facing business, failures would remain
at unacceptable levels and viable businesses would fail to achieve their
potential.
He called for a review of the tax regime to favour business owners who
retain profits within their company. At present the tax laws encourage
business owners to take out profits and put them into pension investments.
He said legislation should give suppliers a statutory right to interest on
the late payment of debt. The government should also alter the Loan
Guarantee Scheme to raise cover provided by the guarantee from 70 per cent
to 80 per cent.
The banks, for their part, should be more willing to take equity or equity
options in businesses and should make more long-term loan finance available,
Mr Pearse said.
Businesses, meanwhile, should be more willing to set aside funds to build up
equity and make more use of long-term loans.

FT  26 FEB 93 / End of recession insight, says Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, PETER NORMAN and KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, insisted yesterday that Britain was
emerging from recession after a bleak day for job loss announcements.
Mr Major's view appeared to be supported by a new Confederation of British
Industry survey which suggested that manufacturers may be starting to reap
the benefit of sterling's devaluation and lower interest rates.
The announcement by Imperial Chemical Industries of 4,500 job cuts in the UK
was followed by 2,400 job losses at British Gas and 6,500 redundancies in
the British army under the second phase of the Options for Change plan.
In Washington, Mr Major said after meeting President Bill Clinton that
Britain was moving out of recession. He blamed the recession's 'painful
kickback' for yesterday's spate of job losses.
However, Mr Robin Cook, Labour's shadow trade secretary, warned it was 'a
serious possibility that within this parliament the government could end up
with more people out of work than are employed in manufacturing industry'.
Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, yesterday urged the
government to develop urgently an industrial policy to restore the UK's
economic strength. He attacked previous Conservative governments for
'sidestepping' the issue of industrial policy during the 1980s. It was a
'myth' that services could generate the wealth the country needed to
survive, he said in a speech to the Executive Association of Great Britain.
The CBI's latest monthly industrial trends survey found that manufacturers'
order books, though still depressed, were at their best levels for 2 1/2
years.
Manufacturers reported improved output expectations for the fourth month
running in January, indicating that the easing of UK monetary conditions
since September was enhancing their competitiveness.
For the second consecutive month, manufacturers indicated that they expected
to increase output in the next four months. Export orders also improved
compared with January, suggesting that the devaluation may now be helping to
raise demand from foreign customers.
A separate survey of worldwide business opinion by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the
business information group, found a marked jump in optimism about profits
and sales among UK executives while optimism in France, Germany and Japan
slumped.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Ambulance inquiry criticises 'climate of mistrust'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday faced political embarrassment over a report
cataloguing repeated examples of flawed management leading to the collapse
of the London Ambulance Service's computer system.
Mr Jim Harris, former marketing director of British Airways, resigned as
chairman of the LAS board when the report, the result of an official
inquiry, was published, and Labour MPs called on Mr Tom Sackville, the
junior health minister responsible for the ambulance service, to join him in
resigning.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, has given health authority
officials a month to produce arrangements for better accountability in the
service.
The report's severe criticisms of LAS management follow National Audit
Office concern over inadequate financial controls in the West Midlands and
Wessex regional health authorities. It will heighten debate over whether the
new style of National Health Service management since the 1991 reforms is
contributing to difficulties.
London's computer despatch system, designed to locate and mobilise emergency
ambulances automatically, collapsed soon after going into full-scale
operation last October. It plunged the service into chaos although the
report concludes that, on the basis of coroners' court conclusions, there is
no evidence that late arrival of ambulances caused deaths. The collapse of
the computer followed prolonged criticism of the LAS for failing to attend
emergencies within official target times.
The report attacks not only what it describes as the LAS management's
high-risk strategy for introducing the computer system, but wider managerial
issues in the service. It says efforts to revitalise the LAS between 1990-92
to meet the cultural changes of the NHS reforms 'actually worsened what was
already a climate of mistrust and obstructiveness.' Management misjudged the
industrial relations climate so that
staff were alienated by changes rather than brought on board.
It was announced yesterday that the LAS board and health authority officials
had decided to terminate the contract of Mr John Wilby, the service's former
chief executive, before the computer failure in October. But he pre-empted
this by resigning.
Mrs Bottomley said that while standards had improved since last autumn,
other ambulance services provided a better service with fewer resources.
At Westminster, she and Mr Sackville came under fierce attack from London
Labour MPs, in particular for 'sweeping aside' earlier warnings that the
service was in difficulty. They also condemned Mrs Bottomley for refusing to
concede a management board of elected councillors.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said the report was 'a damning
indictment of government complacency, inaction and irresponsibility'.

FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Turnround at Lawson Mardon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LAWSON MARDON, the Can-adian-based international packaging group, staged a
turnround in 1992. The group registered a net profit of CDollars 17.4m
(USDollars 13.8m), or 58 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 10.8m, or
38 cents, including restructuring charges, in 1991.
Revenues rose 7.3 per cent to CDollars 1.3bn, despite the North American and
European recessions.
Last autumn, Lawson raised CDollars 105m in new equity. About two-thirds of
its sales are made in Britain, but late last year it bought Spain's largest
packaging company from Cragnotti &amp; Partners, the Italian investment group
that holds 48 per cent of Lawson. Other acquisitions are planned in Europe
and North America.
Mr Andrea Mattiussi, president, said the results proved that the
restructuring last year was a success and the group could face continuing
pressure on margins with confidence.
'The Spanish acquisition was a key part of our plan to consolidate Lawson's
position in southern Europe, complementing the northern Europe operations
and serving as a base for future growth.'
Domtar, the Quebec-based pulp and paper and building materials group, has
raised CDollars 150m by the sale of 8 per cent convertible unsecured
debentures to a group of investment dealers headed by Burns Fry. The funds
will be used to repay maturing debentures and for capital spending.
Two Quebec government agencies, the Caisse Depot and Societe Generale de
Financement have bought CDollars 66m of the issue.
The government indirectly owns 44 per cent of Domtar.

<TEXT>
JC PENNEY, one of the largest department store and catalogue retailers in
the US, registered a sharp improvement in final-quarter results for 1992-93,
with the after-tax profits reaching Dollars 375m.
The figure, for the three months to end-January, was scored on sales of
Dollars 6.08bn, up from Dollars 5.37bn in the previous year. In the final
quarter of 1991-92, the Texas-based retailer recorded after-tax profits of
Dollars 37m, but this lowly figure came after net restructuring charges of
Dollars 264m.
The results take Penney's full-year profits to Dollars 777m after tax, and
sales to Dollars 18bn. In the previous year, there was a net profit of
Dollars 80m after restructuring and accounting-related charges of Dollars
448m.
J. C. Penney's shares rose strongly on the quarter's figures, adding Dollars
2 3/8 at Dollars 78 1/4 .
The company said the improvements last year had been spread across all of
its main merchandise divisions - including womens and menswear,
childrenswear, home furnishings, and catalogue. It also said early spring
merchandise sales in the current year boded well.

profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER

<TEXT>
TOTTENHAM Hotspur, the north London football club, made the bulk of its
first-half profits from selling players.
The pre-tax figure multiplied fourfold to Pounds 3.28m (Pounds 810,000) in
the six months to November 30. More than half the Pounds 15.1m (Pounds
9.22m) sales came from the disposal of players, including Pounds 5.5m for
Paul Gascoigne.
The share price, which had shot up from 90p to 113p this week, shed 12p to
close at 101p as profits were taken.
With Mr Alan Sugar, chairman, owning 48 per cent, and Mr Terry Venables,
chief executive, 22 per cent, not much of the stock trades freely.
Turnover other than player sales fell to Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 7.36m). Mr
Sugar said there had been fewer home fixtures in the first half and average
attendance was down because of the recession. The newly formed Premier
League had enhanced television and sponsorship income.
Tottenham cut its bank overdraft to Pounds 2.41m, compared with Pounds 4.29m
in May. Its debts peaked at about Pounds 15m in 1991, before a rescue rights
issue underwritten by Mr Sugar.
To comply with the Taylor report requirement for all-seater stadiums,
Tottenham is about to spend Pounds 2m on its North Stand. Second half
prospects have been improved by Spurs winning through to the quarter finals
of the FA Cup.
Earnings per share rose to 19.2p (8p).

FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Bell Atlantic in TV video
campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BELL ATLANTIC, one of the seven 'Baby Bell' local US telephone companies,
said yesterday it would seek the support of the Justice Department in a
campaign to be allowed to poke a toe into the long-distance communications
market so as to deliver video programmes to customers.
The Baby Bells were spun off from long-distance carrier AT&amp;T in 1984 under a
court-ordered anti-trust settlement which also forbade them to enter the
long-distance market.
Bell Atlantic is the first to make a filing of this kind to enter the
long-distance market. Its move forms part of a battle between the US cable
television and local telephone industries over which will provide
information services and entertainment to the home in the 21st century.
Bell Atlantic has developed several initiatives to deliver video to the
home, but it said it needed relief from the ban on long distance operations
to deploy these services in a cost-effective manner.
It explained that it planned to use multi-million dollar digital servers for
storing and forwarding video programming, and it would be most effective if
these could be used beyond the major urban areas where it is allowed to
carry calls.
The views of the Clinton administration's Justice Department on the issue
are unknown. But even if it backs Bell Atlantic, the company's request would
still require the approval of Judge Harold Greene, the man who oversaw the
break-up of AT&amp;T. He has generally opposed relaxing restrictions on the Baby
Bells.

shortfall in fourth term

<TEXT>
THE EQUITABLE, the large and troubled US insurance group in which France's
Axa holds a 49 per cent stake, yesterday reported an after-tax loss of
Dollars 28.9m in the final three months of 1992.
This was a sharp reduction on the Dollars 246.9m deficit registered in the
same period of 1991.
The Equitable, which recently completed a lengthy 'demutualisation' process
which turned it into a shareholder-owned company, said that, if results were
confined to 'continuing operations', the 1991 final quarter deficit stood at
Dollars 161.3m, with the 1992 figure remaining at Dollars 28.9m.
The fourth-quarter results mean that The Equitable is posting a Dollars
128.6m deficit for the year after tax, compared with a Dollars 898m loss in
1991.
However, both these figures are muddied by special items; the 1992 figure
comes after a Dollars 101.3m extraordinary charge to cover demutualisation
expenses, and the 1991 result comes after a Dollars 28.3m extraordinary item
and a Dollars 561.9m loss from discontinued operations. The insurer said the
loss from continuing operations, and before extraordinary charges, improved
from a Dollars 307.8m deficit in 1991, to a Dollars 32.2m loss last year.
Within the core insurance division, The Equitable reported an annual
after-tax loss of Dollars 7.5m, compared with a Dollars 44.8m deficit in
1991. The 1992 figure excludes a loss on investment transactions of Dollars
22.7m, and Dollars 15.6m of restructuring charges. However, the company's
continuing investment services operations - which include the Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette brokerage business and the Alliance Capital fund
management arm - turned in after-tax profits of Dollars 192.5m, up from
Dollars 111.6m.

FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Telegraph shows 9% advance to Pounds 44.3m
 -Advertising income up but circulation revenue improved to 46% of total
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TELEGRAPH newspaper group, which floated last July, yesterday announced
record pre-tax profits of Pounds 44.3m for 1992, an increase of 9 per cent
despite the impact of the continuing recession on newspaper advertising
revenues.
Mr Conrad Black, chairman of the Telegraph, which publishes both the Daily
Telegraph and the Sunday Telegraph, admitted that the company had been
apprehensive about 1992 because the recession showed so few signs of
improvement.
However, group turnover rose by 8.3 per cent to Pounds 237.2m and operating
profit increased by 14.7 per cent to Pounds 37.5m. The proposed final
dividend is 6.5p, higher than indicated at flotation, and makes a total of
11p for the year, a 22 per cent increase. This excludes the special dividend
of 10p paid before the company came to market.
Earnings per share have dropped by 6.3 per cent to 23.8p because of a
doubling of tax charges mainly because tax losses flowing from restructuring
charges have been used up.
Costs were contained during the year and advertising revenue rose by 4 per
cent, but the percentage of revenue from circulation rose to 46 per cent of
the total compared with 33 per cent in 1989.
There was also Pounds 5.9m income from associated companies, 90 per cent of
it from a 15 per cent stake in the John Fairfax group in Australia.
'Our policy has been fairly aggressive on price increases,' Mr Joe Cooke,
Telegraph managing director, said yesterday.
The money is then invested in promotion to try to improve the proportion of
15 to 34 year olds reading the paper.
A weekly 20-page Business News section will appear for the first time this
Saturday. The new sector is designed to strengthen the Saturday paper and
try to lure away some Sunday Times advertising.
The Telegraph will call an extraordinary meeting towards the end of next
month to vote on the plan to buy a stake in Southam, the Canadian newspaper
group.
Hollinger, which owns 68 per cent of the Telegraph, has bought 22.6 per cent
of Southam and proposes to sell half to the Telegraph. The Audit Committee
of the Telegraph, which includes directors such as Lord Hartwell, Lord
Swaythling and Lord Rawlinson, will decide whether to recommend the purchase
to the board.
COMMENT
The Telegraph's performance is a real achievement in the depths of a
recession, although papers such as the Daily Telegraph do engender
considerable loyalty. If there is an significant upturn, particularly in
classified advertising, a high proportion of the revenue will flow to the
bottom line, helped by the tight cost controls. Pre-tax profits could be as
high as Pounds 52m to Pounds 54m this year, giving earnings of about 27p for
an unchallenging p/e of 13. Further ahead, the Southam deal, followed
perhaps by US acquisitions, offer the prospect of enhanced growth.

FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Inchcape completes resources withdrawal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCHCAPE, the motor and business services group, yesterday lost another link
with its colonial past as Inchcape Berhad, its 63 per cent owned
Singapore-based subsidiary, sold its timber offshoot to local investors for
Pounds 24m.
The move completes Inchcape's withdrawal from resources operations.
In 1991 it sold its tea investments and is now almost exclusively focused on
its core motor, marketing and services businesses, apart from the odd
country club and time share operation, acquired in March 1992 when it bought
TKM, funded by a Pounds 376m rights issue.
Inchcape Timber Group has operations in Malaysia, Indonesia, Papua New
Guinea, Singapore and Hong Kong and is involved in the extraction of
tropical hardwood and softwood logs, and the processing and trading of
timber products.
Inchcape's interest in timber stretches back to the 1860s.
The company incurred a pre-tax loss of SDollars 200,000 (Pounds 83,875) for
the 1992 year on turnover of SDollars 198.1m.
Inchcape said that the sale would result in an extraordinary profit of
Pounds 3.5m, less expenses.
The sale is conditional on regulatory approval.
ITG's trading profit had declined in the last three financial years
following the expiry of its main logging concession, the difficult operating
environment at the new logging concession in Papua New Guinea between 1990
and 1992, and recessionary conditions in the main timber markets, Inchcape
said.
Mr Charles Mackay, chief executive, said: 'The deal is a good one for
Inchcape in both strategic and financial terms. At the same time, it will
ensure a good future for the partners, management and employees in the
timber business.'

loss

<TEXT>
DEN DANSKE BANK reported a loss of DKr1.7bn (Dollars 274m) in 1992, against
a profit of DKr1.22bn in the previous 12 months, but the board expects an
improvement this year. Profits on core operations rose from DKr334m to
DKr702m.
The bank displayed its confidence in the future by proposing to maintain
unchanged the dividend of DKr12 a share. Continued high provisions and a
large loss on the valuation of the securities portfolio pulled down the 1992
performance.
Loss provisions increased from DKr2.88bn to DKr2.94bn, but were considerably
lower in both years that in 1990, when they peaked at DKr 4.25bn. The value
of the group's shares and bonds portfolio fell by DKr1.03bn.
The downturn in the economy of the Faeroe Islands contributed to the group's
loss. Foroya Bank, in which Danske owns 81 per cent, made a loss of DKr395m
and had to be recapitalised by Danske.
The bank's equity capital and reserves declined from DKr20.7bn to DKr18.3bn,
but total capitalisation, including tier 2 capital, was virtually unchanged
at DKr27.6bn.
As the balance sheet was reduced to DKr336.7bn from DKr363.4bn, the capital
adequacy ratio increased from 10.2 to 11.0 per cent.
An independent report has criticised Norwegian authorities for failing to
stop Norway's biggest insurance firm, UNI Storebrand, from launching a
disastrous raid on Swedish rival Forsakrings Skandia.
A commission led by former supreme court judge Erling Sandene said the
Finance Ministry and the Banking, Insurance and Securities Commission should
have blocked UNI purchases of Skandia shares - which later crashed in value.

CONTINENTAL Airlines, the fifth-largest US carrier, said yesterday that its
creditors had backed the company's proposed reorganisation plan to allow it
to emerge from the bankruptcy proceeding in which it has been involved since
1990.
The plan to reorganise Continental's capital structure and significantly
reduce its debt burden would be implemented in conjunction with an
investment proposal, accepted last year, from Air Canada and Air Partners.
Continental said that it would now present the final results of the creditor
balloting to the bankruptcy court on March 16. It is expected to emerge from
bankruptcy within a matter of weeks.
USAir, the US carrier into which British Airways has invested Dollars 300m
said yesterday that it had reached a tentative agreement with the city of
Philadelphia over improvements to the city's airport facilities.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Salvation Army 'knew of loss in August'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Salvation Army learned that Dollars 8.8m of its funds had gone missing
as long ago as last August, according to employees of the charity, although
it did not issue a writ to recover them until last week.
In spite of months of investigation by the accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand and
the solicitors Slaughter and May on the charity's behalf, it has yet to
trace the whereabouts of more than Dollars 6m of the missing funds.
An investigation by the Financial Times shows that Salvation Army officers
were naive in financial matters. The charity is reviewing its procedures to
try to prevent any repetition of the alleged fraud.
In early May Dollars 10m of charity funds were deposited in an account of
ASLK-CGER Bank in Antwerp, Belgium. At the time the charity was feeling
financially stretched, according to members.
An officer in charge of fund-raising, Colonel Grenville Burn, had been
persuaded by Mr Stuart Ford and Mr Gamil Naguib, two financiers, that the
charity could make a substantial profit by investing the Dollars 10m in
standby letters of credit. Other officers of the charity also approved the
proposed investment. Col Burn has since been suspended from his duties.
Approval for the opening of the Antwerp account was given by Commissioner
Larsson, the senior UK officer. Whenever an account for the charity is
opened, approval has to be given by Commissioner Larsson.
However, Dollars 8.8m of the funds were transferred to Banque Continentale
du Luxembourg over the summer, without the knowledge of most of the
charity's senior officers.
The Belgian bank account had four signatories: Col Burn; Colonel Ivor Rich,
another officer; Mr Ford and Mr Naguib. The charity had been persuaded to
allow Mr Ford and Mr Naguib to be signatories so that the bank would give
them account information, but employees of the charity insist that they
never expected Mr Ford or Mr Naguib to be involved in transferring the
funds. Any transfers from the account required two signatures.
Also during the summer, Mr John Renshaw, the chairman of the charity's
London Advisory Board and a former deputy chairman of building group John
Laing, warned the charity not to invest funds in standby letters of credit
because he was concerned the funds would be lost.
In August, Col Rich travelled to Antwerp and discovered that the Dollars
8.8m had been moved. He then travelled to the Luxembourg office of Banque
Continentale, but only Dollars 520,000 was left in the Luxembourg account.
Commissioner Larsson had not approved the opening of this account.
The funds had been transferred to Panama and Leichtenstein. The charity says
that some of the funds were eventually invested in a dogtrack in Ayr in
Scotland, a Scottish public house and a project to build an airport next to
a Scottish village. The charity has traced Dollars 1.825m of funds invested
in such projects, but is uncertain about the whereabouts of the remaining
funds.
Police were only informed officially last week of the alleged fraud by the
Salvation Army although it is understood that some police officers had
earlier obtained information that linked involved individuals with a
separate investigation.
Fraud Squad detectives are working on the theory that officers of the
Salvation Army were innocent victims in an alleged financial swindle
orchestrated by international fraudsters.

THE EUROPEAN Bank for Reconstruction and Development is set to become the
first western financial institution to take an equity stake in a Romanian
commercial bank since the end of communist rule in 1989. It has agreed in
principle to take a 20 per cent stake in the Ion Tiriac Bank.
The bank, the country's first post-communist private commercial bank, was
founded in 1991 by Mr Ion Tiriac, the Romanian-born former tennis player. Mr
Tiriac and his companies own 25 per cent of the bank with the remainder held
by more than 5,000 mainly local shareholders.
The bank has declared a provisional profit of 7.1bn lei (Dollars 13m) for
1992 on turnover of 53.6bn lei. This represents a return of 238 per cent on
the bank's paid-up capital of 3bn lei. The bank intends to increase its
capital with the EBRD expected to pay Ecu6m (Dollars 7.17m) for a 20 per
cent stake in the recapitalised bank.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Spain warns of tax on currency speculators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE governor of the Bank of Spain, Mr Luis Angel Rojo, issued a veiled
warning yesterday that measures to restrict short-term currency speculation
could be reintroduced if the peseta continued to come under pressure on the
foreign exchanges.
His remarks to the economy committee of the Madrid parliament came as the
peseta appreciated against the D-Mark following what dealers said was the
third successive day of large-scale intervention by the Bank of Spain.
'We do not want to return once more to administrative measures (against
speculators),' Mr Rojo said, 'but I must tell you that there is a thinking
under way which says that some sort of tax should be established against
short-term speculation. We have not used the measures because we hope the
situation will not become alarming.'
Last September, at the height of the currency turmoil within the exchange
rate mechanism, Spain introduced emergency measures that effectively froze
trading in the peseta. The measures caused sharp selling on the domestic
equity and debt market, and were largely lifted within two weeks.
Dealers yesterday said that the governor, by referring to a special 'tax',
could have had in mind a streamlined version of the measures which would
apply only to one- to three-day peseta swap operations.
They said money traders selling pesetas 'short' might be forced to deposit
with the Bank of Spain a sum equivalent to the day's transactions at an
interest free rate and for a period of up to a year.
The Bank of Spain was estimated by some dealers to have spent some Dollars
5bn, or just over 10 per cent of Spain's reserves, defending the peseta
since pressure built up against the currency late last week.
Late yesterday the peseta had appreciated to Pta72.04 to the D-Mark against
Tuesday's closing rate of Pta72.54.

monopolies in France or elsewhere in Europe, writes David Buchan in Paris.
The report, carried out for EdF employees by the Paris-based Technologia

privatisation masks an oligopoly of private companies, which have raised
prices more sharply, invested less, and created more redundancies than the
old UK state monopoly.

HUNGARY is set to open up infrastructure development to western investors in

said yesterday, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest.
Foreign companies could finance the construction of motorways, airports,
railways and eventually mines, Mr Ivan Szabo said at a parliamentary
confirmation hearing. The finance minister's infrastructure drive will
receive an early boost from the naming in the coming days of a western-led
consortium to finance, build and operate an extension of Hungary's M1
motorway to the Austrian border.
Mr Szabo also promised to back write-offs of bad debts to allow partial
sales of Hungary's four large state-owned commercial banks. This makes life
easier for the five western investment banks which last week began advising
on the privatisation of the banking sector.

Mr Lalonde's endorsement is a step forward for Mr Rocard, who needs to

FT  25 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend from BAe pleases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in British Aerospace (BAe) rose sharply, brushing aside the
announcement of Britain's largest ever corporate profits loss at just over
Pounds 1.2bn, for the year to December 1992.
The market had braced itself for the big loss from the UK's largest
manufacturer but was cheered by a lack of black holes in the figures, and
the higher than anticipated 4p dividend, against market expectations of a 3p
final.
There was strong demand for the stock and at the day's best, the shares were
up 17 at 269p, before coming off the top to close 13 up at 265p, after UBS
Phillips and Drew advised investors to switch out of BAe and into
Rolls-Royce. Turnover was a hefty 9.7m. Analysts also put the decline down
to a closer examination of the poor performance of the defence division.
Once again there was speculation that GEC could be considering a bid for
BAe, although this was largely disregarded by aerospace specialists.
Mr Paul Ruddle at NatWest Securities said: 'This marks a turnaround for the
group, and shows the management has got to grips with the problems.' He
retained his current year forecast at Pounds 60m, putting him at the bottom
of the range with brokers such as Hoare Govett, BAe's broker, said to be on
Pounds 125m and Smith New Court reported to be predicting Pounds 150m.
Analysts are due to have another meeting with the company tomorrow when
further details about the trading outlook are expected to emerge. Shares in
GEC eased 3 to 293p, while Rolls-Royce closed unchanged at 128p.
Kwik Save strong
Rumours continued to circulate around Kwik Save as the shares continued
their upward climb, yesterday adding a further 14 to 842p on talk of an
imminent bid from Dairy Farms. The shares' strength in recent weeks, in
stark contrast to a weak food retail sector, has been underpinned by the
continuing buying by the Hong Kong food group, which has taken its holding
in Kwik Save from 26 per cent to over 28 per cent this year.
Although Dairy Farms has always said it is a long-term passive investor in
Kwik Save, excitement was generated early on yesterday following market talk
in Hong Kong that Dairy Farms would make a big rights issue when it
announces results on March 16. With only around 8 per cent gearing, the
speculative implication was that the group was lining up a bid, with Kwik
Save the obvious contender. However, such a move would break all agreements
between the two groups.
UK food analysts, largely dismissive of a Dairy Farms bid, suggested that
the group may have been buying Kwik Save shares ahead of a possible rights
issue from the UK group, the proceeds of which could be used to buy stores
from Gateway.
New bid seen
There was almost universal support in the market for the necessity of an
increased bid from Airtours if it is to succeed in capturing its larger
rival Owners Abroad. The speculation followed the decision by the secretary
of state for trade and industry not to refer the bid to the Office of Fair
Trading.
Mr Hamish Dickson at Hoare Govett forecast that Airtours would probably
produce a cash incentive of around 17p on top of their current 113p a share
all-paper offer. Hoare's is advising Owners investors to sit tight in
expectation of a renewed offer, with Airtours a strong buy also.
Smith New Court believes Airtours may not be so generous, with analyst Mr
Bruce Jones suggesting an increased offer of 125p, with a possible cash
alternative. Some speculative investors thought otherwise, with the Owners
shares spurting to close 13 ahead at 129p in big turnover of nearly 9m.
Airtours put on 5 to 302p. Suggestions that LTU, the German travel group
which had planned a co-operative shareholding in Owners, might ride to the
rescue did not find much support among analysts.
ICI on alert
On the eve of its results due today, ICI shares put on a late spurt as
rumours abounded over the fate of the demerger and the threatened rights
issue. Analysts declared themselves none the wiser, as the shares first
languished on the belief that a Pounds 1bn cash call would be forthcoming
today, and then spurted forward as wild talk suggested that Glaxo was
putting together a bid for ICI's proposed bio-science division, Zeneca.
ICI shares added 8 to 1082p. Glaxo slipped a penny to 652p.
Bank shares continue to suffer from selling triggered by NatWest's poorly
received figures released on Tuesday. NatWest lost 8 more to 435p while
Barclays, the next high street bank to report, fell 3 1/2 to 424p.
Hambros was the pick of the merchant banks, moving up 8 to 316p.
Royal Insurance eased 2 to 285p in front of today's preliminary figures
which are expected to show losses sharply reduced at around Pounds 120m,
compared with last time's Pounds 373m loss. The main action in insurance,
however, was in Guardian Royal (GRE) which ran up 6 to 186p amid stories
that a buyer of 5m had been operating in the market; turnover of 9.3m in GRE
was the highest single day's business since November last year. GRE is
scheduled to report preliminary figures on March 3. A single big selling
order of 1.2m shares at 559p unsettled General Accident, 6 off at 567p.
Activity in the oil sector was concentrated on Shell and Royal Dutch.
Dealers reported heavy switching operations, out of Royal Dutch and into
Shell with the latter said to have been 8 to 8 1/2 per cent too cheap
against the Dutch group. Shell closed a shade firmer at 582p following
substantial turnover of 7.4m shares, ahead of today's preliminary figures.
Building stocks tended to lose ground on a mixture of rights issue fears,
broker sell recommendations and official statistics disclosing that UK
construction orders fell 9 per cent in the last quarter of 1992.
Yamaichi, the Japanese stockbroker, warned that 'there is strong evidence to
expect another wave of rights issues from the sector, similar to that
experienced in 1991 when 16 building sector companies raised a total of
Pounds 1.2bn'. Mr Scott Fulton, Yamaichi's building analyst, pointed out
that recovery hopes have seen the building materials and construction
sectors outperform the FT-A All-Share index by 21.6 per cent and 33.2 per
cent respectively since 'Black Wednesday'. Yamaichi pinpointed 'rights
risks' on five companies due to announce results in the next two months;
Amec, Mowlem, Persimmon, Taylor Woodrow and Wimpey. The building team at
Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken said 'we believe there are at least Pounds 1bn of fund
raising in the pipeline.'
Blue Circle Industries (BCI), a good market recently on renewed takeover
speculation, fell 7 to 225p, after 220p, with Kleinwort Benson said to have
reaffirmed its bearish stance. Several brokers have forecast a cut in BCI's
1993 payment.
Fears that the OFT may launch an investigation into the activities of
photocopier companies hurt several companies in the sector. Southern
Business Group, tumbled 34 to 79p, while Gestetner fell 11 to 131p.
A weighty tome on the UK property market from NatWest Securities found some
room for optimism that the sector had begun clawing its way back. Analyst Mr
Marc Gilbard added that there had been a significant shift in the market's
perception of valuing property stocks with net asset value being replaced by
dividend yield. NatWest is particularly keen on Land Securities off 2 at
482p.

FT  25 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK index futures traded in a tight range of 20 points for most of the
day, as the market waited to see if ICI will launch an anticipated Pounds
1bn rights issue with its demerger plans, writes Joel Kibazo.
The March contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,819, just ahead of its close on
Tuesday. After a period of sideways trading, the contract started drifting
lower as the talk of the possible ICI cash call increased.
The day's low of 2,810 was seen only 45 minutes after the start of trading,
before a bout of closing of positions led to a brief respite in the downward
trend.
That, however, did not last long and March once again drifted downwards with
the early strength on Wall Street having no impact.
March finished at 2,818, at the same level as its close on Tuesday and at a
small discount to the underlying cash market. Turnover was 8,037 trades by
the close.
In traded options, the expiry of the February stock options was the main
feature and it made a large contribution to the day's total turnover of
41,189 lots. Some 7,378 contracts were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option, and
the Euro-FT-SE saw a total of 2,890 trades.
BT was the most actively dealt stock option with a total of 4,450 contracts
and was followed by BTR at 3,243. Hanson, Asda and British Aerospace were
also busy.

FT  25 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities on hold for ICI statement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK STOCK market investors were keeping well below the parapet yesterday as
they waited for ICI, London's senior blue chip company, to disclose details
of the financing involved in its demerger plan when it announces trading
figures this morning. The likelihood of a near Pounds 1bn rights issue from
ICI, even though widely predicted by analysts, was enough to keep many fund
managers away from the market yesterday.
Indeed, the Footsie Index to a large extent tracked the ICI share price,
falling smartly in early trading but then rallying in the second half of the
session. The initial fall in UK equities was sparked off by a sharp fall in
the March contract on the Footsie, while the closing rally took in some
buying support from overseas investors attracted by weakness in sterling.
Also helping London was the early strength of the New York market which was
18 Dow points ahead in UK trading hours.
The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,817, a net loss on the day of 1
point. At these levels - the Footsie dipped to 2,810 in early deals, the
lower end of the market's trading range appears firmly held. The chances of
a fresh move to the upper end of the range, in the 2,900 area, waits upon
ICI.
The focus turned back towards the Footsie stocks, with the pharmaceuticals
leading the market when overseas buyers appeared in the final hour of trade.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index fell 7.2 to 3,029.9. Non-Footsie shares made up 65
per cent of the day's Seaq volume total of 592.7m. Tuesday's Seaq total of
597.8m shares was worth Pounds 1.23bn at retail level.
'We will all be amazed if ICI doesn't make a rights issue this morning,'
commented one leading dealer. However, wild rumours circulated, the most
prevailing being a suggestion that Glaxo might bid for Zeneca, the proposed
pharmaceutical and bio technology company to be formed if the ICI demerger
is carried through.
The rest of the market continued to lack direction, and it was left to
corporate developments to provide what few highlights there were. British
Aerospace, disclosing a Pounds 1.2bn loss for the year, nevertheless pleased
the market with its dividend policy. Bank shares remained easier in the wake
of the increased debt provisions announced this week by National
Westminster.
The weakness in sterling, which depressed government bond prices, was noted
cautiously in an equity market still expecting further cuts in domestic
interest rates. Some strategists, however, said that such hopes were now
being reined in to 'only half a point and not necessarily at Budget time.'
The strategy team at Smith New Court warned this week that the chances of
further big falls in short-term interest rates have diminished as signs of
economic recovery become more evident. While approving of the UK market 'in
absolute terms, Smith recommends a neutral stance.
With no further important data on the UK economy expected this week, share
prices appear dependent on weighty list of impending rights issue, in which
ICI may be the most prominent but is certainly not the only feature. Even
the Pounds 1bn issue predicted from ICI would probably be acceptable in the
market but traders will be happy to have the uncertainty taken off their
shoulders.

Wall Street
WALL STREET rallied with help of strong gains by healthcare and tobacco
stocks, Karen Zagor report from New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed steadily through the day and closed
33.23 higher at 3,356.50. The more broadly based Stan dard&amp;Poor's 500 gained
6.07 to 440.87, while the Amex compos ite was 3.45 higher at 403.41, and the
Nasdaq composite soared 11.06 to 662.46. Volume on the NYSE was about 300m
shares by 1pm, and rises outnum bered declines by 1209 to 692.
The market dismissed reports of a 1.7 per cent decline in January's durable
goods orders, which cast some doubts about the strength of the econ omy
although the drop was less than expected.
Philip Morris was one of the most active big board stocks, rising Dollars 2
3/4 to Dollars 66 3/8 , reversing its recent losses, while RJR Nab isco
firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 8 1/4 . Both stocks have been hit in recent
days by worries that the Clin ton administration will levy an excise tax on
cigarettes.
Among other blue chip issues, IBM rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 51 3/4 after
the group said that it was cutting 500 jobs at its head quarters.
Chrysler climbed Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 38 5/8 after saying that it will
announce plans to increase production of natural gas-pow ered vehicles,
which went into production last March.

Holdings ADRs eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 18 5/8 and Abbott Laboratories
improved Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 26.
In the Nasdaq market, a revival in biotechnology stocks contributed to a

spite of a sharp drop in Dell Computer shares which tum bled Dollars 6 1/8
to Dollars 30 1/8 in active trad ing after the group said that unfavourable
market condi tions had prompted it to with draw a planned 4m common shares
offering. Furthermore, Goldman Sachs removed its 'buy' rating on the shares.

Among other technology issues, Intel firmed Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 117 3/4
, Apple Computer fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 53 5/8 and Seagate Technol ogy

FT  25 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Optimism underlies the cautious mood in
Cyprus - Firm foundations are being laid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TEN-MONTH decline in Cyprus' over-the-counter stock market has been
attributed by brokers to the island's prolonged presidential election
campaign. Yet even after last week's narrow victory for Mr Glafcos Clerides,
Greek Cypriot investors show no inclination to celebrate.
The Cisco weekly all-share index closed at 245.8, down by 0.8 per cent,
although average daily volume did increase to CPounds 90,000 (Pounds
126,000) for the week. Since the start of the year, the index has declined
by 4.4 per cent, with daily volume averaging CPounds 70,000.
Nevertheless, optimism underlies the cautious mood. Mr Clerides was backed
by the Greek Cypriot business community which expects the unofficial stock
market to have a more solid foundation soon.
A draft stock exchange law, passed back and forth between parliament and the
finance ministry for the last three years, should be approved next month.
And an overhaul of company law, also under way, could lead to incentives for
more family-controlled Cypriot companies to go public.
The market is currently supervised by the Cyprus Chamber of Commerce which
is encouraging brokers to abandon telephone trading by providing a
purpose-built floor for public trading sessions. More than 70 per cent of
transactions now take place on the floor, watched by an enthusiastic crowd
of small investors.
While the market has expanded substantially, with trading volume rising by
17 per cent to an estimated CPounds 35m in 1992, local brokers say that the
absence of a regulatoryframework is hindering growth.
Mr Louis Clappas, chairman of Clappas Investments, says: 'Foreign investors
show more and more interest in Cyprus, but fund managers abroad are wary
because we don't have the proper legal backing, and because exchange
controls are still very tight.'
However, foreign investors now account for about 5 per cent of the market's
total capitalisation of CPounds 571m. The central bank, which allows
foreigners to invest on a case-by-case basis, claims that it has speeded up
procedures for approving share transfers. 'All it takes is a single phone
call,' says one official.
Foreigners are mainly attracted by the island's two leading banks, Bank of
Cyprus and Popular Bank of Cyprus, which are now stepping up their
operations abroad.
The Bank of Cyprus, which used to focus on the expatriate Greek Cypriot
community, is broadening its customer base in Britain and Australia.
Popular Bank, in which the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank has an equity stake,
last year set up an Athens-based subsidiary to gain a foothold in the single
European market.
The two banks, which accounted for around 70 per cent of total transactions
on the Cyprus market last year, helped to make up for weakness in other
sectors.
In spite of a booming economy, with GDP growth estimated at close to 9 per
cent last year, the stock market showed an overall decline in 1992.
Political uncertainty, caused by the collapse of talks between the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot leaders on reuniting Cyprus, followed by the closely-fought
presidential election campaign, drove the market down.
The Cisco all-share index fell by 8.1 per cent, led by tourism and transport
stocks where the sectoral index plunged by 26.3 per cent. A sharp fall in
1991 earnings, resulting from holiday cancellations during the Gulf war,
sent hotel stocks sharply down.
Fears that continuing recession in Britain, the island's main tourist
market, would damage future prospects prompted a move into defensive stocks,
mainly banks and insurance companies.
The prevailing gloom, together with capital increases totalling CPounds 37m
by the two big banks, discouraged smaller companies' plans for flotations.
Mr Socrates Solomides, manager of Cyprus Investment and Securities
Corporation, says: 'It will take a while for the market to come back. But
there are some good signs: for example, liquidity last year was just as high
as in the record year of 1990.'

FT  25 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent sees mixed

BOURSES saw mixed fortunes for carmakers, further weakness in chemicals and
a recovery for Swiss pharmaceutical stocks, writes Our Markets Staff. In the
meantime, Spanish dealers reflected further fears for the peseta, and a
belated degree of speculation in the equity market.
FRANKFURT registered falls in chemicals and carmakers in particular as the
DAX index fell 17.34 to 1,644.24 in turnover up from DM5.8bn to DM7.4bn.
Some professionals blamed weakness in the US dollar and its effect on export
margins.
However, Mr Hans-Peter Wodniok of James Capel in Frankfurt noted that
Volkswagen was firmer, up DM2.30 at DM271.30. He said that other carmakers,
like BMW, down DM13 to DM486, were extending their weakness of the last ten
days or so on poor industry figures; VW may have gone up on higher market
share figures but this, with the underlying trend still sharply down, was an
excuse rather than a reason.
Chemicals, he reckoned, were reflecting BASF's admission that its
pharmaceutical sales were 40 to 50 per cent down in February, following
Germany's strictures upon the ethical drugs market. Bayer and Hoechst,
especially the former, have bigger drug operations, but the latter paid for
a strong run of relative strength, leading the sector down with a fall of
DM5.60 to DM259.30.
AMSTERDAM was disappointed with Akzo's 1992 results, which came in at the
lower end of forecasts. The shares closed down Fl 2.10 or 1.4 per cent at Fl
149.90, although off the day's low of Fl 147.80.
However, there is a feeling among some analysts that although the group is
expected to show a deterioration in first half earnings this year, given the
depressed state of the European economy Akzo is still showing a better
performance than many of its competitors. DSM shed Fl 1.90 to Fl 73.50.
The CBS Tendency index eased 0.3 to 99.8.
Royal Dutch weakened Fl 1.80 to Fl 154.00 ahead of today's results with some
analysts forecasting an unchanged dividend. Rumours that Philips might have
approached the state to lobby for financial support saw the shares slip 40
cents to Fl 22.20.
PARIS came to life in the last few minutes of trading with a gain in the
CAC-40 index of 9.26 to 1,953.39, after a day's low of 1,927. Turnover was
FFr2.8bn.
The financial sector remained active with reports that Comptoir des
Entrepreneurs might be in financial difficulties depressing CFF, down FFr53
at FFr1,069 and AGF, off FFr11 at FFr545.
STOCKHOLM took a further look at Handelsbanken following Tuesday's results,
found some positive aspects and marked the B shares up SKr12 to SKr57.50.
Some analysts suggested that the bank remained relatively strong compared
with its competitors.
The Affarsvarlden General index, however, lost 10.1 to 977.8 in turnover of
some SKr1bn.
Atlas Copco weighed on the market, the B losing SKr10 or 3 per cent to
SKr318 on disappointment over its 1992 results and forecasts from the
company that it did not expect an upturn this year.
MILAN remained beset by worries over Prime Minister Guiliano Amato's
government as it faces today's confidence vote, and the outlook for the
economy as the lira dipped to a record low against the D-mark.
The Comit index eased 0.19 at 502.75 in spite of strong rallies by Fiat and
Montedison. The carmaker fixed L203 higher at L5,508 and rallied to L5,580
after hours, in largely domestic buying, amid expectations that the lira's
weakness would have a positive effect on its prospects this year, and
renewed rumours that a major disposal was planned.
Montedison ended L48 higher at L1,230 after hours on expectations of an
announcement shortly that it had agreed to sell its 51 per cent stake in
Erbamont to Sweden's Procordia.
ZURICH's SMI index rose 15.0 to 2065.4. Its drug companies reversed the
trend of the previous two days in line with the overnight performance of the
pharmaceutical sector on Wall Street and the view that the stocks' sharp
declines had been overdone.
Sandoz certificates rose SFr110 or 3.9 per cent to SFr2,880 while Ciba
registered shares rose SFr5 to SFr600.
MADRID dropped again at the outset, seeing heavy losses in the bond market
and continued instability in the peseta, and equities slid by two per cent
or more by mid-day.
However, after lunch there were reports that the governor of the Bank of
Spain, Mr Luis Angel Rojo, had told a parliamentary committee that the
central bank will not adopt capital controls to support the sagging peseta.
The corollary, a possible further devaluation, brought buyers back into the
market, and the general index ended only 0.02 lower at 227.90.
VIENNA's ATX index closed 11.1, or 1.3 per cent lower at 820.57 but ISTANBUL
climbed to another record, closing 215.26, or 3.7 per cent higher.

FT  25 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo eases despite
stable currency market

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A STABLE currency market and reports that the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party was drawing up a new fiscal stimulus package brightened sentiment, but
share prices lost ground on liquidation of margin positions ahead of
settlements in March, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 64.21 to 16,798.94 on small-lot trading, having
moved between 16,930.27 in early trading and 16,750.88 in the afternoon.
Volume remained subdued at 220m shares against 211m.
Margin traders and investment trusts were seen selling in small lots while
some foreign investors bought companies which had announced restructuring
measures. Declines led advances by 600 to 288, with 227 issues unchanged.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 6.03 to 1,275.28 and, in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was down 0.09 to 1,019.61.
Most large-lot investors remained on the sidelines ahead of this weekend's
Group of Seven meeting in spite of a fall in speculative activity on the
currency market.
Aids-related stocks, bought actively on six-month-long margin contracts
during September, lost ground as investors liquidated margin positions ahead
of settlement in March. Green Cross fell Y40 to Y1,170 and Okamoto
Industries, the condom maker, lost Y19 to Y981.
Showa Shell Sekiyu fell by its daily limit for the third consecutive day,
diving Y200 to Y800 on concerns over its foreign exchange loss.
Some food companies, dependent on imports, gained on hopes of larger profits
due to the higher yen. Nisshin Flour Milling advanced Y20 to Y1,130 while
Nitto Flour gained Y5 to Y425. However, electric utilities, previously
higher on hopes of improved earnings due to the yen's strength, lost ground
on profit taking. Tokyo Electric Power declined by Y20 to Y2,570.
Electric cable companies were firm on reports that the fiscal package to be
planned by the LDP will target the country's communication networks.
Fujikura gained Y15 to Y518 and Hitachi Cable added Y10 to Y620.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y1,000 to Y612,000 on profit taking,
while Nissan Motor lost Y1 to Y621. Both companies announced restructuring
measures and found buying support from foreign buyers, but later lost ground
as investors took profits.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 83.93 to 18,052.08 in volume of 67.6m shares.
Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y200 to Y9,720.
Roundup
SINGAPORE remained ebullient ahead of tomorrow's budget. Goldman Sachs, in a
recent research paper, comments that while the city-state stands to benefit
from accelerating regional growth in the next few years, it has to meet a
number of challenges. Among them, Goldman writes, is 'further adapting
industrial policy to a high-tech and service orientation, coping with a
rising exchange rate and increasing returns on capital to sustain high
investment rates'.
SINGAPORE reached its second straight record high on hopes that the budget
statement will provide measures to stimulate economic growth. The Straits
Times Industrial index put on 16.32 to 1,677.74 as volume rose to 248m
shares from 175m.
HONG KONG reversed early losses to close higher on bargain hunting. The Hang
Seng index put on 28.50 to 6,177.69 in turnover of HKDollars 2.8bn.
China Light advanced 75 cents to HKDollars 36.00, after issuing covered
warrants and Hongkong Land added 20 cents to HKDollars 13.80 on rumours of a
derivatives issue.
AUSTRALIA closed near the day's low following the release of a number of
disappointing first quarter results, including ayne Nickless, down 22 cents
at ADollars 6.75 on news that it was to cut its dividend, and Pioneer
International, off 9 cents at ADollars 2.36 after reporting a 23 per cent
fall in interim net profit. The All Ordinaries lost 3.4 to 1,604.8 in
turnover of ADollars 312.7m.
TAIWAN lost early gains as the market continued to weaken after its rally
earlier in the month. The weighted index declined 21.99 at 4,049.50 in
turnover down to TDollars 42.7bn.
BANGKOK rose 1.4 per cent on strong performances from the financial sector.
The SET index closed 13.04 higher.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Money Markets: Sterling futures slip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT-DATED sterling futures slipped sharply yesterday as the pound plunged
to a new historic low against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges, writes
James Blitz.
The pound's weakness damped earlier speculation that the UK authorities
would cut interest rates at or before next month's budget.
The March short sterling contract fell 14 basis points to a low of 93.94
before closing at 93.95. At this level, it effectively assumes that base
rates will be unchanged at 6 per cent immediately after the budget.
The June contract was also badly hit, falling 17 basis points to a close of
94.47. At this level, it assumes that base rates will be cut by around 50
basis points by the summer, although the market assumes that this will be
the only policy easing in this cycle. Dealers easily removed a large
shortage of Pounds 2.15bn forecast by the Bank of England yesterday, another
indication that there are no expectations of a rate cut in the short term.
The easier monetary conditions helped the slight easing in the cost of
3-month money from 6 3/16 per cent to 6 1/8 per cent on the offered side.
In European markets, the mood was a good deal more tense, partly because of
the release of poor inflation figures in Germany. In North Rhine
Westpahalia, the cost of living rose of 0.4 per cent in the month to
mid-February, a greater increase than the market had anticipated.
The Bundesbank did not help matters by keeping conditions relatively tight
and draining a net DM7.4bn from the banking system in this week's tender for
securities repurchase funds. Banks quoted call money at around 8.65 per
cent, little changed from the previous day. Thre-month money closed at 8.31
per cent.
The March Euromark contract continued its fall of recent days, closing 1
basis point down on the day at 91.85. The March French franc was even
weaker, closing 12 basis points down on the day at a new record low of
88.18. The June contract closed 28 basis points down at 90.68.
Both Spanish and Danish money market interest rates remained high as their
currencies came under pressure in the European exchange rate mechanism. By
the close of trading yesterday, 3-month Danish krone were being quoted as
high as 22 per cent, while 1-month pesetas were slightly easier on the day
at around 18 per cent.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling and lira fall sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Both sterling and the Italian lira - came under intense selling pressure
yesterday as the D-Mark consolidated the strong position it has established
against European currencies in recent days, writes James Blitz.
The pound fell nearly 4 pfennigs in European trading yesterday, to a new
historic low against the D-Mark of DM2.3125. The pound later closed in
London at DM2.3275, a new record closing low, and a level some 2 1/2
pfennigs lower than its previous close.
Sterling also fell to a new historic low of 76.0 against the Bank of
England's Exchange Rate Index, a level that was a full percentage point down
on the day. This effectively means that the pound is now worth 76 per cent
of what it was in 1985.
If anything, the lira was even more depressed against the D-Mark, falling as
low as L986.00, before closing at L985.00, some L8 down on the day. A
particular sign of weakness was that both sterling and the lira weakened
against the D-Mark despite the dollar's stronger performance against the
German currency. The dollar closed at DM1.6195, up more than  1/2 a pfennig
on the day.
Undermining both the European currencies was the ever-present concern that
Germany is lowering interest rates too slowly.
Fears that the Bundesbank will keep rates high were underlined by the
release of inflation figures for some German states, which were poorer than
the market had expected. In North Rhine Westphalia, for example, the cost of
living rose 0.4 per cent in the month to mid-February.
The lira's problems were exacerbated by the political difficulties of Mr
Giuliano Amato's government. One London-based market practitioner said that
the flight out of lire by native Italians was very great: he had anecdotal
evidence that Italians were carrying lira in suitcases over the border to
Switzerland, and buying Swiss francs.
The pressure on sterling, if a little less picturesque, was still a cause of
concern. One London-based dealer said it was always worrying when, as
happened yesterday, the pound came under pressure for no very obvious
reason.
One dealer claimed to have seen substantial selling of the pound by US fund
managers. Another claimed that the currency was coming under strong pressure
in the Far East. The general consenus was that nobody was in the market to
buy the UK's currency. Mr Mark Austin of Midland Global Markets saw no
reason why the pound should not fall below DM2.30 in the near term.
The pressures on the lira and sterling were partially felt by the peseta
inside the Exchange Rate Mechanism. But the Governor of the Bank of Spain
said the peseta could be defended by a tax on the movement of entirely
speculative short term capital - and this helped the peseta up to a close of
Pta71.94 against the D-Mark from a previous Pta72.58.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Inflation fears enliven US
commodity indices - Clinton's growth policy is reviving interest in price
rise hedging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE US securities traders have been busy pushing long-term interest rates
down to their lowest level in 15 years, they have been keeping a cautious
eye on the commodities markets, sensitive to signals that President Bill
Clinton's economic plan may be stirring inflation's embers. Inflation is
toxic to bond prices, driving up interest rates and increasing the cost of
debt.
Commodity prices have long been used as a proxy for inflation, a practice
lent legitimacy by the US Federal Reserve Board, which monitors price
stability by watching a 21-commodity index compiled by the New York-based
Commodity Research Bureau.
Recent contradictions in the commodity pits have been enough to drive
inflation-watchers to distraction. Palladium hit long time lows on Monday,
while another industrial commodity, lumber, posted all-time highs. Grain
prices have withered, but meat prices, which usually travel in tandem with
feed prices, are on the rise. International commodities like sugar and oil
have also rallied.
On the whole, analysts say that there has been a steady but mild rise in
several closely-watched commodity indices since late summer, when it became
apparent that Mr Clinton might clinch the presidency. However, since he took
office in January, the behaviour of the indices has diverged. Measures of
industrial commodities and those heavily weighted toward energy are rising,
while more broadly-based indices are flat. To date, none of the inflationary
measures have sounded an economic alarm.
'We're seeing some firmness in some commodities, but not firmness in all
commodities,' says Mr Samuel Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities. A
real economic pick-up would bring firmness across the board, he said.
The difference in behaviour of the commodities indices is explained by the
differences in their composition. Economists looking for trends in US
industrial production like to watch the Journal of Commerce Index. This
follows the prices of 18 raw industrial commodities, including copper and
steel scrap, burlap, old corrugated boxes and crude oil.
The JOC index rose to 100.6 this week, from 97.5 in early January. The
steady rally may signal a pick-up in industrial production, a natural
introduction to an economic recovery. However, nearly 15 per cent of the
index's weighing is in lumber and lumber products, largely domestic
commodities whose rally in recent months has, some analysts say, skewed the
index.
Industrial production may indeed be picking up, Mr Kahan says, but so long
as the pick-up tracks economic growth it may not be inflationary.
The Goldman Sachs Commodity Index has also been on the rise since January,
reaching 186 this week, from 181 the first week of the year. The two-month
rally is significant, says Mr. Ravi Bulchandani, commodities analyst at
Goldman Sachs, but is only a small increase over January a year ago.
Mr Bulchandani attributes the index's rise to firmer oil and meat prices.
The GSCI is weighted by trade volume, with nearly 50 per cent of its weight
in energy or oil, and another 24 per cent in livestock. Given the
international characteristics of the index, he attributes the GSCI's
strength to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries' recent
agreement on production cuts, and not to Mr Clinton's economic plans.
The Commodity Research Bureau's popular index of 21 commodity futures is
virtually unchanged since January, in part because each of its components
carries equal weight. A drop in the price of orange juice, for example,
carries the same weight as a rally in oil. The index is stuck around 203, up
about five points from its August low.
Mr Sean McNamara, president of CIG Asset Management, a firm that advises
investors on using commodity indices as a way to hedge against inflation and
diversify portfolios, calls the GSCI an 'economically sound' index, but says
the CRB remains popular because it offers historical data extending back 40
years.
Analysts say that while Mr Clinton's economic plan is front-loaded, with
much of the economic stimulus expected to take effect quickly, it can only
hope to boost US demand. As commodity trading spans the globe there is
potential for a flood of foreign imports if US prices move higher. This,
commodity traders say, is already happening in the lumber market.
Inflation fears are also tempered by excess capacity in the US in everything
from aluminium smelting to grain production.
In the long run Mr Clinton's policies are expected to have significant
impact in individual commodities. His energy tax, aimed at deficit
reduction, will cut demand for oil and coal. However, to the extent that his
energy taxes offend the US's Opec trading partners, they could also reduce
worldwide oil production, and raise energy costs, slowing global recovery.
His emphasis on rebuilding the country's infrastructure is bound to increase
demand for industrial commodities like copper and steel, analysts say.
However, the president's greater focus on the environment may raise costs to
livestock producers and other agricultural enterprises, limit expansion of
mining and metals processing in the US, and limit US timber production.
Clean Air provisions will further penalise energy producers.
On the trade side, Mr Clinton has said he will be more strict in his
dealings with China, an important customer for US wheat. He supports
economic reform in the former Soviet Union but has not yet liberalised farm
credits to Russia, allowing grain prices to languish. On the other hand, if
Mr Clinton succeeds in implementing the North American Free Trade Agreement,
US livestock producers are expected to benefit from broader export markets.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC likely to set price floors
on fish imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community is tomorrow expected to set minimum import prices on
white fish, to check the surge of produce coming in, which has been
dramatised by Breton fishermen protesting against depressed prices.
Commission officials warned yesterday, however, that the fishermen were
likely to be disappointed with the results, in view of the still unresolved
structural problems of the industry.
EC fishermen have long been subject to quotas under the common fisheries
policy. These have come down sharply in recent years, to conserve stocks
threatened by overfishing. As part of a major conservation effort, Brussels
has also obliged fleets to tie up for prescribed periods, and/or enforced
use of bigger net meshes to let immature fish escape. Last year the EC also
agreed an 8 per cent reduction of the community fleet over the next four
years, although scientific studies cited by the commission in 1990 claimed a
40 per cent reduction of the EC fleet was needed.
Before imports are taken into account, the current regime itself creates
surges in supply - especially about this time of year. Overall quotas are
exhausted towards the end of the preceding year, leaving many vessels idle
during winter. With bad weather usually keeping fishermen in port through
January, February often sees fish flooding on to the market as the industry
rushes to regenerate its flagging cash-flow.
All this is now combining with three factors, of which cheap imports from
Russia, Iceland, Poland and Norway is only the most egregious.
Recession has led to a fall in consumption in France - one of the EC's
biggest fish-eaters - and growing competition from rival foodstuffs like
poultry and pork, prices of which had fallen 25 per cent before the recent
15 to 30 per cent drops in white fish prices.
The spate of EC devaluations has also bitten into the French market. While
Paris maintains its franc fort big fish producers like the UK and Spain,
which have devalued their currencies, can sell more cheaply into France.
But cheap imports from outside the community, especially from Russia, are
now a big destabilising force because Commission officials maintain a good
deal of Russian fish is coming in from Iceland with disguised rules of
origin certificates. Russia's fish would normally pay a 12 per cent tariff,
against the 3.5 per cent charged to Iceland under a bilateral agreement.
The minimum import prices the commission is set to fix tomorrow are likely
only to be the reference prices the EC uses to monitor the market, and will
last six months. But if this does not work, commission officials say an
embargo on imports is virtually certain.
'If they don't get the message, or they can't control what their fishermen
do, that's the next step,' one Commission fisheries official said. 'I think
the Icelanders will get the message,' he added.

A GROUP of militant French fishermen left Brittany yesterday evening to
travel by coach to Brussels where they plan today to stage a 'peaceful'
demonstration outside the meeting of the EC management committee responsible
for fisheries, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
French fishermen have for the past fortnight staged furious protests against
the recent increase in imports of cheap fish into France, culminating on
Tuesday in a violent attack on the fish market at Rungis, outside Paris,
followed by a three-hour battle with police.
The mood of the Breton ports was slightly calmer yesterday following the
French government's assurances that the EC would agree to impose minimum
prices on imported fish. However a group of trawlers blocked off a stretch
of water in Les Landes usually used for military experiments in a gesture of
solidarity with the Breton fishermen. Back in Brittany an action group of
fishermen's wives plans to demonstrate this afternoon outside the town hall
of Quimper, one of France's largest fishing ports.

<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community is threatening an effective ban on direct aluminium
imports from the former Soviet Union if Russia does not stop under-cutting
world market prices, according to community officials, reports Reuter from
Brussels.
They said only Germany dissented from a plan to impose severe quotas on
Russian aluminium when it was discussed this week by officials of member
states worried at a looming crisis among the community's aluminium
producers.
The quotas under consideration were so tight, they added, that no fresh
shipments from Russia would be allowed because of the massive volume of
Russian stocks at London Metal Exchange warehouses.
'The Russians are up against the wall,' one official said.

weekend deadline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COCOA PRODUCING and consuming countries have been told that they must agree
on a package of price stabilisation measures by the weekend if they want an
International Cocoa Agreement with economic provisions.
If no agreement was reached, said Mr Peter Lai of Malaysia, the chairman of
UN-sponsored talks on a new accord, he would use the remaining week of this
fourth and final round of negotiations to conclude a purely administrative
pact to replace the 1986 agreement, which expires on September 30.
On Monday, the first day of the two-week negotiating session, Mr Lai put
forward compromise proposals on the price range to be defended and on
financing of the scheme. The proposals, which are still being considered by
the two sides, effectively split the difference between the price demands of
producers and consumers and provide for all pact members to share the costs
of the scheme.
The suggested price range of SDR1,040-1,560 a tonne, with a median price of
SDR1,300 (Dollars 1,780) is well above present market levels of about SDR730
a tonne and could only be defended if producers stuck to their expressed
intention of reining back production.
Earlier this week, the 45 or so producing and consuming countries taking
part in the talks agreed in principle on a limit of 350,000 tonnes to the
amount of cocoa that could be withheld from the market to support prices.
The 40 members of the accord account for about three-quarters of world
production and consumption, the most notable absentees being the US, the
biggest consumer, and Malaysia, the fourth largest producer.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gummer calls for further CAP
reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER REFORM of the European Community's common agricultural policy was
yesterday urged by Mr John Gummer, the UK agriculture minister.
He cited in particular the sugar regime. It was not acceptable that rich
countries should so support their agriculture that they destroyed the market
for poor countries, Mr Gummer told the Agra Europe Outlook '93 conference in
London.
'The sugar regime is one that does huge damage, and this reform is vital,'
he said. Other sectors that needed looking at were wine, fruit and
vegetables, olive oil, rice, cotton and beef.
Mr Gummer also warned farmers that the development of supply controls such
as acreage set-aside under last year's CAP reforms would place them under a
heavy bureaucratic burden.
Farmers would have to supply a great deal of information to qualify for aid
under the CAP. 'Supplying this information will be a time consuming task,
and the penalties for any mistakes could be severe,' he said.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia announces talks on
unified CIS energy policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS OF the Commonwealth of Independent States are to attempt to agree on
the creation of an inter-state energy council to co-ordinate oil and gas
supplies.
The project, announced earlier this week by Mr Yuri Shafranik, the Russian
energy minister, is likely to be a central theme of talks planned between
CIS heads of state in the Russian oil region of Tyumen next month. It is
raised at a time when energy is at the centre of increasing tension between
Russia and the other former Soviet republics, particularly Ukraine.
Mr Shafranik said that the Tyumen oil production associations would welcome
foreign investment - including from the CIS states. He also said, however,
that Russia would move to world prices in energy trade with these countries.
Mr Yuli Yoffe, Ukraine's deputy prime minister, arrived in Moscow yesterday
for talks with Mr Shafranik in a bid to avert a threatened cut in gas
supplies to Ukraine. The Russian state gas corporation Gasprom has said it
is owed Rbs165bn (Dollars 286m) by Ukraine, and has demanded that the
country pay Dollars 85 per 1,000 cubic metres for future supplies.
However, Mr Yevgeny Suhin, first deputy chairman of Ukraine's state oil and
gas committee said yesterday that all bills had been paid to Gasprom up to
March 1. Ukraine has already warned that it might disrupt the flow of
Russian gas through its territory to third countries especially Germany,
France, Italy, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.
Mr Leonid Kuchma, the Ukrainian prime minister, is also due in Moscow
tomorrow - an indication of how seriously the threat is now being taken. A
Gasprom official, Mr Anatoly Vorotyntsev, was quoted by the official news
agency Itar Tass as saying that gas supplies would be cut off today and
piped to southern parts of Russia instead.
The Russian government faces continuing and deepening difficulties in its
exploitation of energy sources. Mr Georgy Khizha, a deputy prime minister,
said yesterday that oil production would fall by 50m tonnes this year, but
energy consumption was continuing to rise - by 14 per cent last year.
Turkey and Azerbaijan are discussing a route for a westward pipeline for
Azeri oil and Turkey hopes it will end on its southern coast, the foreign
ministry said, reports Reuter from Ankara. 'The technical level talks in
Baku (the Azeri capital) are expected to continue into March before a
conclusion is reached. . . Our wish is to see Turkey chosen as the route and
Azeri oil transported to the Mediterranean,' said ministry spokeswoman Filiz
Dincmen.

Base metals were under pressure on the LME, with weakness in ZINC and COPPER
resulting in most closing lower. Zinc collapsed to 3 1/2 -month lows under
intense pressure from technical selling and liquidation, against a
background of weak fundamentals. Support for three-month metal at Dollars
1,070 and Dollars 1,060 gave way on the charts, while the market will remain
oversupplied despite recent mine and smelter cuts. Copper extended earlier
falls, with Comex weak, and as support around Dollars 2,215 for three-month
metal gave way the market retreated to end at Dollars 2,198, down Dollars
20. There are significant March put options at Dollars 2,200, so
follow-through hedge selling today could push the market down to Dollars
2,180. Follow-through buying powered London's May COCOA contract to close at
Pounds 759 a tonne, Pounds 4 above Tuesday's finish after the market
regained early losses. Earlier, the market went on the defensive under
pressure from jobber long liquidation, but prices began to firm by late
morning.

The market in Australia started to sag again when sales were resumed this
week and the Wool Corporation's market indicator yesterday fell 10 cents to
460c/kg, which is practically back to the lowest of the season. Withdrawals
by woolgrowers are still very high, reaching as much as 55pc af the
Fremantle sale on Tuesday, though 20pc is more typical. World demand is not
matching present supply. Recession in the world economy provides a major
reason, but the decline is itself creating a trading atmosphere of almost
unprecedented gloom.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: Currency movements supply focus as trade
slows

FOREIGN exchange move-ments continued to provide a focus for activity in the
bond markets, but the pace of activity slowed slightly as investors and
dealers yesterday paused to examine the sharp recent movements in currency
and bond rates, and in some cases decided to reassess recent shifts.
GERMAN bond prices retraced some of the gains they made earlier in the week,
but dealers said the declines appeared to represent a temporary correction
rather than a shift in sentiment.
Prices shed  3/8 -point after the latest provisional inflation data for
February from several German regions showed less of a slowdown than dealers
had hoped, prompting worries that any further cuts in interest rates could
be delayed.
THE JAPANESE market continued to forge ahead, buoyed by the strength of the
yen. Comments by Mr Yosihiro Hayashi, the Japanese finance minister, that
another discount rate cut could not be ruled out helped spur enthusiasm for
the market.
The 10-year No 145 benchmark was yielding just 3.79 per cent when the
Japanese market closed yesterday, down from 3.93 per cent at Tuesday's
close.
However, analysts warned that most of the good news was already in the
market and foreign investors might start taking profits following the rally
in both the Japanese bond and currency markets. For the moment, the market
is being supported by Japanese domestic investors loath to buy Japanese
equity or property.
THE weakness of sterling yesterday undermined the gilts market, which had
been in a fairly bullish mood. The March gilt futures contract at the London
International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange ended at 103 1/16 , down
from 103 25/32 at Tuesday's close.
The Bank of England announced that it had finally finished selling two
tranches of gilts totalling Pounds 1.35bn, announced on February 16. The
slow sales of the issue did little to reassure traders. While the currency
remains chronically weak, foreign investors are unlikely to help absorb
future gilt issues.
US TREASURY prices ended a five-day record-setting spree to move broadly
lower yesterday afternoon as the market reacted to weak bidding at the
Treasury's Dollars 11bn five-year note auction.
In spite of a substantial drop in price, the yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond remained comfortably below the 7 per cent level
through the day. In late trading, the long bond was off  27/32 at 102 15/16
, yielding 6.887 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was  1/8
lower to yield 3.960 per cent.
There was little reaction to news that durable goods orders fell 1.7 per
cent in January, slightly less than the 2 per cent the market had expected.
The Federal Reserve arranged Dollars 2.5bn in customer repurchase agreements
when Fed funds, the rate at which banks lend to each other, were trading at
2 15/16 per cent.
The open market intervention, which adds funds to the banking system, was
expected to counter a seasonal drop in vault cash - cash held by banks to
satisfy reserve requirements. There was no policy meaning associated with
the action. The Fed's perceived target for the rate remains 3 per cent.
Bond and note prices started to tumble after the afternoon auction, where
the five-year note had a yield of 5.23 per cent, well above the
widely-expected 5.16 per cent to 5.17 per cent level.
ITALIAN bonds outperformed most other European markets, after a difficult
couple of days, by staging a small rally when it emerged that the Christian
Democrat party will back prime minister Giuliano Amato in Thursday's
confidence vote.

FT  25 FEB 93 / International Bonds: EC and National Bank of Hungary raise
DM3.9bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE European Community and the National Bank of Hungary between them raised
a total of DM3.9bn in the international bond market yesterday.
The rapid placement of both seven-year issues reflected the strong demand
for D-Mark-denominated paper and fanned expectations that more borrowers
would tap this sector in the near-term.
The Kingdom of Belgium is studying proposals from various banks for a
planned DM600m offering with a maturity of seven or 10 years, and is
expected to make a decision by the beginning of next week.
Dresdner Bank, lead-manager of the EC's DM2.9bn offering, said that demand
across the board allowed the bonds to be priced to yield 8 basis points
above the 7 1/4 per cent bund due January 2000, at the lower end of the
indicated range of 8 to 10 basis points.
He added that German institutions had also shown interest in the EC bonds
despite their lack of yield pick-up over domestic bonds. He said they were
attracted by the high quality of the borrower and by Dresdner's promise to
ensure liquidity in the bonds by quoting a bid-offer spread in the bonds of
just 5 basis points. When the bonds were freed to trade, they were quoted
around their re-offer price of 99.75.
Hungary's DM1bn issue carried a yield spread of 265 basis points above the
same underlying bunds as in the EC's issue. An official at the lead-manager,
Deutsche Bank, said the bonds were mainly placed in the German retail
market. After the syndicate broke, the bonds were quoted around 99.05,
inside fees.
The offering, Hungary's largest ever in the international bond market, is
part of the country's programme to borrow Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 2bn
abroad in 1993 to help service a foreign debt of Dollars 21.9bn. It also
marks an increasing reliance on the international capital markets by the
country, which carries a Ba1/BB+ rating, putting it just below investment
grade.
The International Monetary Fund froze a special credit facility to Hungary
last summer after the country's public-sector deficit broke through agreed
limits.
Deutsche Bank also arranged a Dollars 200m five-year offering for United
Mexican States, the premier credit among Latin American borrowers. The deal,
the issuer's first Eurobond issue since the 1970s, will be priced today to
yield 208 basis points above the when-issued five-year US Treasuries.
Elsewhere, Peugeot Talbot Motor Company tapped the Eurosterling market for
the first time since 1981 with a Pounds 100m four-year offering, priced to
yield 90 basis points over the 8 3/4 per cent 1997 UK government bonds.
Syndicate managers involved in the deal said the fact that Peugeot's
long-term debt was not rated proved a drawback when placing the paper. The
bonds were not freed to trade by late yesterday.
The day's other French borrower was Caisse Autonome de Refinancement, a
public mortgage-refinancing body linked to the Caisse des Depots, which
raised FFr3bn. The maturity of six-and-a-half-years matched CAR's loans and
when the bonds were freed to trade, their yield over the 8 1/8 OATs due 1999
tightened to 28 from 30 basis points at launch.
Late in the day, Exxon Capital Corp awarded a mandate for a 10-year Dollars
250m offering to Kidder Peabody. The bonds are expected to be priced to
yield 16 basis points over comparable US Treasuries.
National Australia Bank raised ADollars 100m through a five-year offering,
priced to yield 34 basis points over government bonds. The spread tightened
later in the day to 29 basis points. Meanwhile, Tuesday's ADollars 150m bond
issue by Treasury Corp of Victoria was bid at 98.75, above the net price to
underwriters of 98.35.

FT  25 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Japanese groups face higher
cost of raising funds / Examining the impact of the expiry of equity-linked
warrant bonds worth Y9,000 bn during the year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS that Japanese companies would try to refinance a large part of the
Y9,000bn (Dollars 77bn) worth of equity-linked warrant bonds which expire
this year by issuing more of the same have subsided, but Japanese industry
is being forced to pay higher financing charges as a result.
The lacklustre outlook for the Tokyo stock market, as well as resentment
among investors who took part in the large round of equity-linked financing
at the end of the 1980s, has prompted large, blue-chip companies to redeem
the expiring issues by taking out bank loans or by issuing straight bonds in
the domestic debt market or in the Eurobond market.
They are opting for these methods of financing in spite of the additional
borrowing costs of around 2 per cent. According to the Bond Underwriters'
Association of Japan, domestic straight bond issuance by Japanese companies
rose to Y2,469bn in the last nine months of 1992, slightly higher than the
whole amount raised in 1991.
'We have to be responsible towards our investors,' says Nissan Motor. 'We
can't issue a warrant bond with a strike price at Y700 when investors are
holding old warrants with a strike price of Y1,600.'
Nissan will finance its Dollars 1.5bn warrant bond which expires in October
through the issue of straight bonds. Toshiba, the electronics company, says
it will use bank borrowing and straight bonds to refinance its USDollars
1.2bn warrant bonds expiring in November.
According to the Japanese finance ministry, about 70 per cent of the
refinancing has already been scheduled. Half will be done through bank
borrowings and the rest through mainly straight bonds and commercial paper.
Mr David Knee, economist at Daiwa Securities in London, believes that the
fall in corporate liquidity in Japan in recent months also suggests that
companies are not using their financial resources for investment but rather
to pay off debts or shore up reserves.
Kleinwort Benson, in Tokyo, calculates that about Y244bn, or 3.6 per cent of
pre-tax profits of industrial companies for the current financial year to
March, will be absorbed by increases in interest costs and refinancing fees.
However, some Japanese companies are once again dipping into equity-linked
financing to raise funds. In the last quarter of 1992, Japanese warrant bond
issues reached Dollars 5.5bn, the most active period since the middle of
1991, according to IFR Securities Data.
The companies' approach has outraged some institutional investors. Critics
claim that to help sell warrant bonds, underlying share prices are being
artificially lowered before the terms on the warrants are fixed, bringing
down the strike price.
Mr Kota Nakako, a senior analyst at Quick Research Institute, says that if
market forces were really at work, no company would be able to issue
equity-linked bonds. 'It's back to the old Japanese ways where everyone is
supporting the scheme and making it work,' he says.
Indeed, the Bank of Japan warns that, in the long run, equity financing may
not be as cheap as it looks at the moment. In a recent report, the bank says
that the dilution of earnings per share due to equity-linked financing will
lead to an eventual fall in share prices, thus reducing the scope for
further equity-linked financing. However, this is a lesson some Japanese
companies may not want to learn.

FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Pioneer's half-term profits fall
to ADollars 71.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PIONEER International, the Australian building products and petroleum group,
yesterday announced a 20 per cent fall in interim net profit to ADollars
71.5m (USDollars 49m), and warned that full-year profit was likely to fall
sharply.
Mr Rodney Price, chief executive, said the result for the six months to the
end of December was 'quite commendable' in the light of tough trading
conditions in Australia, the UK and Spain.
Mr Price said the 'subdued' outlook for the second half indicated that
profit for the full year would fall well short of the record level of
ADollars 178m in 1991-92.
However, the board maintained the interim dividend at 7.5 cents, franked to
35 per cent, and indicated that the longstanding policy of maintaining
dividend payments would continue. Operating revenue was steady at ADollars
2.6bn.
Pioneer said pre-tax profit from its building materials businesses fell by
31 per cent to ADollars 82.5m. Building materials profit in Australia fell
by 20 per cent to ADollars 47m.
Profit from European operations fell by half to ADollars 24m, mainly because
of recession in the UK and a downturn in Spain following the Olympic Games.
Asian profit fell to ADollars 600,000, mostly because of uncertainty in Hong
Kong.
Pioneer said Ampol, its wholly-owned petroleum subsidiary, suffered a 19 per
cent fall in profit to ADollars 88m. Higher sales were offset by poor
refining margins and renewed retail petrol discounting.
The group said it would retain a ADollars 43m investment in Westpac, the
Australian bank, which hit the group's share price after it was revealed
last year. Pioneer said it stood to make a profit of ADollars 10m on the
investment at current share prices.
Pioneer shares fell 9 cents on the Australian Stock Exchange to ADollars
2.36.

FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Earnings are revised down at
Siam Cement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIAM Cement, the largest cement producer in Thailand, yesterday disclosed
that its audited net profit in 1992 was substantially lower than the
unaudited profit figure announced last month.
The audited, unconsolidated figures showed net profit of Bt3.56bn (Dollars
142m), more than Bt400m below the previously announced sum of Bt3.98bn, and
also below the Bt3.89bn made in 1991.
The discrepancy is largely due to higher operating expenses. According to
Siam Cement's audited statement, operating costs were Bt5.38bn in 1992,
higher than the unaudited figure of Bt4.96bn.
A Siam Cement official told Reuters that the revision of costs was partly
related to investment in its new Khao Wong plant, one of the world's largest
cement factories; it cost nearly Bt10bn and has a capacity of 3.6m tonnes a
year.
Investors were disappointed with Siam Cement's 1992 performance even before
yesterday's announcement. Yesterday, the shares closed unchanged at Bt488 in
a rising market.
The cement shortages which characterised the Thai construction boom of the
late 1980s have given way to overcapacity in the industry, with newcomer TPI
Polene investing heavily in new plant.
Demand for cement in Thailand is now estimated to be growing at a modest 4
to 5 per cent a year, after 18 per cent only a year ago, but is likely to be
boosted by numerous projects to improve transport and other infrastructure,
including the construction of a new Bangkok airport, in the years ahead.
Siam Cement's unconsolidated sales in 1992 slipped to Bt33.35bn from
Bt33.80bn in 1991.
The company also declared an unchanged final dividend yesterday of Bt9 a
share, making a maintained total of Bt18 for the year.

FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Banks fail to agree terms for
Nippon Housing rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NINE banks which back the Nippon Housing Loan group, the Japanese financial
institution which has been worst hit by the implosion of the property
market, yesterday failed to agree on a rescue package for the company.
The future of the group, thought to have bad loans worth more than half its
outstanding loan book of Y2,200bn (Dollars 18.9bn), is the most sensitive
issue facing the troubled Japanese banking industry.
Nippon Housing Loan, which aggressively expanded its property lending in the
1980s, has become a test case for whether the commercial banks can find a
co-operative, private sector solution to the bad loans afflicting Japan's
banking system.
The rescue talks have been orchestrated by the Bank of Japan and the
Ministry of Finance. As yet, the government has insisted it will not fund a
rescue package. However, if the banks which are the main lenders to Nippon
Housing cannot agree a rescue plan, pressure for government intervention
will grow.
The nine commercial banks, which include Sanwa Bank and Sakura Bank, set up
Nippon Housing Loan in 1971 to lend to home buyers and property developers.
Agricultural banks, led by Norinchukin, later became large lenders to Nippon
Housing.
The banks yesterday rejected a restructuring plan presented by the company,
which called for all fresh loans to be made at the short-term prime rate of
about 4 per cent. The banks were also asked to forego interest payments on
outstanding loans for the next 10 years.
About 30 per cent of Nippon Housing's finance is provided by the commercial
banks.
Nippon Housing is estimated to need about Y60bn in fresh loans by the end of
March 1994 to help it to reimburse maturing mortgage securities, which it
marketed aggressively in the late 1980s. The outstanding securities are
worth about Y300bn.
Nippon Housing asked the agricultural banks to cut their interest rates on
loans to 4.5 per cent and other institutions to 2.5 epr cent.
The financial authorities are likely to encourage the banks involved to
resume the talks as soon as possible to avoid risking triggering a crisis of
confidence in the bank.

HONG KONG and China Gas, Hong Kong's monopoly gas supplier controlled by the
Lee family's Henderson Investment, yesterday announced a 20 per cent
increase in net profit to HKDollars 936m (USDollars 121m) in 1992, up from
HKDollars 779m in the previous year.
Earnings were boosted by 12 per cent growth in Towngas sales. The results
were in line with expectations, but the share price reacted favourably to
the announcement of a one-for-five bonus share issue.
There was a 7 per cent increase in gas tariffs from the start of 1993, and
Mr Lee Shau Kee, chairman, predicted an increase of 70,000 customers during
the year and double-digit sales growth.
The company's enlargement of its Tai Po plant will double capacity to more
than 11m cubic metres.

sales plummet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MITSUKOSHI, Japan's most prestigious retailer, yesterday underlined the
severity of the downturn in consumer spending in Japan by announcing it
would make a pre-tax loss of Y2.5bn (Dollars 21.5m) in the year to February.
Mitsukoshi has been hit by rising costs from its heavy investment programme
in the late 1980s and a slump in demand for luxury goods.
The company, which made a Y10.9bn pre-tax profit last year, had estimated it
would make a Y1.8bn profit this year. But the sharp downturn in consumer
spending in the second half, which continues unabated, has forced a further
downward revision in profits.
The company will make an after-tax profit, but only by selling assets.
After-tax profits are expected to fall by about 70 per cent to Y1.5bn.
Takashimaya, another leading department store, also recently lowered its
profit forecast for the year. More retailers are expected in the next few
weeks to announce profits sharply lower than expected last year.
Suntory, the leading liquor manufacturer, reported an 11.3 per cent drop in
pre-tax profits in the year to December. The company's sales were 5.2 per
cent down at Y758bn.
Pilot, the pen and office equipment manufacturer bucked the trend of recent
results by announcing a 25.3 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Y418m
in 1992.
Canon, the camera and office equipment maker, yesterday reported a 31 per
cent fall in consolidated pre-tax profits to Y101.63bn for 1992.
Sales edged up by 2.4 per cent to Y1,910bn from Y1,870bn, held back by the
appreciation of the yen, while earnings per share fell 29 per cent to
Y46.82. Canon said its markets in south east Asia and China grew further in
1992 and those the US economy crept back in the second half. But these
bright spots were countered by the slowdown in western Europe and Japan.

FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Mayne Nickless holds steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAYNE Nickless, the Australian transport, security, medical and
communications group, yesterday blamed subdued international trading
conditions for a 0.2 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 48.5m
(USDollars 33.4m) for the six months to January 3.
The group said the result was 'steady,' and in line with forecasts in the
annual report. But the interim dividend was reduced to 15 cents, franked to
30 per cent, from 17.5 cents, franked to 35 per cent.
Mayne said earnings before interest and tax increased by 14.6 per cent to
ADollars 85.6m. The improvement reflected better results from the transport
and healthcare divisions following extensive rationalisation.
The board said revenue improved by 11.1 per cent to ADollars 1.4bn,
reflecting the acquisition of the Centropa Group of companies in Europe, the
John Fawkner Hospital in Melbourne and Interlink in the UK.
It said revenues were maintained in most operating divisions in spite of
difficult trading conditions, confirming the underlying strength of the
group's diversified operations.
Mayne reported an equity-accounted loss of ADollars 12.3m on Optus, the
telecommunications group established to compete with Australia's
government-owned carrier.
The board said it had capitalised an interest cost of ADollars 7.7m because
of the nature of the investment. It said 'solid progress' had been made by
Optus, and the investment would generate strong future returns.
Mayne holds a 25 per cent stake of Optus, a joint venture with Cable &amp;
Wireless of the UK, BellSouth of the US, the AMP Society, National Mutual
and other Australian financial institutions.
Mr Bill Bytheway, managing director, said a proposed flotation of Optus
would probably not take place until the second half of 1994 because of
forecast delays in a proposed ballot of telephone users.
Mayne shares closed 22 cents lower at ADollars 6.97 on the Australian Stock
Exchange.

<TEXT>
MR KERRY PACKER, the Australian industrialist and publisher, yesterday
announced the appointment of Mr Brian Powers to replace Mr Al Dunlap as
managing director of Consolidated Press Holdings (ConsPress).
Mr Packer, the sole shareholder in ConsPress, said Mr Powers would lead the
company through 'a period of growth and development'. The announcement
fuelled speculation that Mr Packer is planning a substantial acquisition.
ConsPress recently acquired a 10 per cent stake in Westpac, the troubled
Australian bank, and is rumoured to be considering a bid for MGM Pathe
Communications, the US film studio.
Mr Powers, 43, is a partner in Hellman and Friedman, the US investment bank,
and a director of John Fairfax, the Australian newspaper group controlled by
Mr Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph group.
His appointment follows the resignation of Mr Dunlap, who returned to the US
last week after completing two years of a five-year contract, during which
he disposed of most of the group's non-core businesses.
Mr Dunlap, who earned the sobriquet 'chainsaw' for his zeal in cutting
operating costs, is believed to have left ConsPress after a disagreement
with Mr Packer about the legal interpretation of his remuneration package.
He reduced ConsPress to three main businesses - 49 per cent of Valassis
Communications, the US coupon insert business; 42 per cent of Nine Network,
Australia's top-rated television channel; and 45 per cent of Australian
Consolidated Press, the leading domestic magazine publisher.
Mr Powers, who was closely involved in the acquisition of the Fairfax group
by a consortium led by Mr Black, is regarded by analysts as a deal maker
whose style may be more in line with Mr Packer's renewed interest in
expansion.

THE depressed South African economy and industrial action caused earnings at
Murray and Roberts, the construction, engineering and supplies group, to
fall in the six months to the end of December.
Turnover rose 23 per cent to R3.27bn (Dollars 1.04bn) from R2.65bn, but this
was largely attributable to a number of acquisitions made during 1992
involving Blue Circle, Darling &amp; Hodgson and Standard Engineering.
These acquisitions also helped boost operating profits by 19 per cent to
R340m from R286m and attributable earnings by 16 per cent to R111m from
R96m.
An increase in the number of shares in issue, however, meant earnings per
share fell by 13 per cent to 177 cents from 204 cents.
The dividend, however, was increased by 6 per cent to 56 cents from 53 cents
a share.

<TEXT>
RIO ALGOM, an independent copper, uranium, potash and coal producer since
Rio Tinto Zinc sold its 51 per cent control to the public last June, has
reported lower profit for 1992.
Though copper prices were favourable, potash operations improved and the
Canadian dollar was lower, uranium and metals distribution results were
lower.
Profit from continuing operations was CDollars 39.4m (USDollars 31.2m), or
85 cents a share, against CDollars 44.8m, or 97 cents, a year earlier.
Revenues were little changed at CDollars 1.03bn.
On the same basis, fourth-quarter net equalled 22 cents a share against 29
cents, on revenues of CDollars 263m against CDollars 264.5m.
Rio Algom expects to be out of uranium mining by 1996 when supply contracts
with Ontario Hydro run out; it operates only one mine at present. It is
concentrating on building long-term low cost copper reserves, says the
president, Mr Colin MacAulay.
Rio's main Canadian copper holding is 34 per cent of the big Highland Valley
mine in British Columbia. It also has a strategic interest in the big El
Condor copper-gold property, also in British Columbia. Its other principal
copper holding is the Cerro Colorado mine in Chile.

<TEXT>
SHARES in Dell Computer, the fast-growing US personal computer manufacturer,
plunged by almost 17 per cent yesterday after the company announced that it
had withdrawn a planned share offering because of 'unfavourable market
conditions'.
The offering of 4m shares had originally been timed for last December but
was put off until early March following controversy over the company's
reporting of its foreign exchange dealings.
Dell's share price had fallen from Dollars 49 1/8 at the start of this month
to Dollars 36 1/4 on Tuesday amid growing concern that the personal computer
industry's price war is set to intensify.
Explaining the pulled issue, Mr Tom Meredith, Dell's chief financial
officer, said 'with interest rates where they are and with currently low
price/earnings multiples for technology stocks, we can do better for our
shareholders by accessing other sources of capital'.
He added: 'We have a strong financial position that allows us to take our
time and pick the method for funding our growth that best fits our needs.'
Dell, a pioneer in the direct selling of computers over the telephone, tried
to reassure investors that its earnings momentum was continuing. It
predicted that its revenue growth in the fiscal year to next January would
exceed 70 per cent and would make Dell a Dollars 3.4bn to Dollars 3.7bn
turnover business. It also forecast earnings per share of Dollars 3.30 to
Dollars 3.75 for 1993-94, compared to analysts' expectation of around
Dollars 2.57 in the year to last month.
Despite this, investors remained nervous at the outlook for the personal
computer market and Dell's shares closed yesterday on the Nasdaq
over-the-counter market at Dollars 30 1/8 , down Dollars 6 1/8 .
The market was particularly unsettled by reports that Mr Daniel Benton, a
computer analyst at Goldman,Sachs, yesterday removed his 'buy'
recommendation on both Dell and its rival Compaq. Goldman had been acting as
lead underwriter for the Dell offering and had been prevented from
commenting on the company until the issue was cancelled.
The currency controversy which led to the initial delay in the offering
arose last November when a Wall Street analyst suggested Dell might have
inflated earnings through its method of accounting for foreign exchange
trading.
Dell denied this, and a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation did
not find any reason for the company to restate its earnings. However, the
SEC did require Dell to make additional disclosures about its currency
trading practices.
Dell also announced yesterday that it would release its fourth quarter
results on March 9 but it added that it did not expect any appreciable
change from the projections announced on February 1, when it forecast
revenues of Dollars 615m, slightly below analysts' expectations, but more
than double the previous year.

CEMENTOS Mexicanos, the world's fourth-largest cement company, lifted net
profits to 1,725m new pesos (Dollars 548m) last year, a real increase of 13
per cent over 1991, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City.
The rise shows Cemex has weathered the slowdown in the Mexican economy.
Domestic cement sales rose by 7 per cent last year, with an increase of 12
per cent in the fourth quarter.
Mr Lorenzo Zambrano, chief executive, said: 'Cemex has continued to grow and
to upgrade operations despite the modest economic deceleration in Mexico.
Domestic demand for cement showed a significant increase during the second
half of the year.'
Operating profits reached 1,689m new pesos, 16 per cent more in real terms
than 1991.

<TEXT>
THE LONG recession and slump in major construction activity in eastern
Canada and the north-east US deepened losses at St Lawrence Cement, the
Swiss Holderbank's Canadian arm, in 1992.
Fourth-quarter loss deepened to CDollars 18.2m (USDollars 14.2m), or 43
cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 925,000, or 2 cents a share, a
year earlier. Sales at CDollars 136m were little changed.
The year's loss was CDollars 39.9m, or 94 cents, against a loss of CDollars
5.7m, or 14 cents, in 1991. Sales dipped 7.5 per cent to CDollars 467m.
The results include a CDollars 13m restructuring provision.
St Lawrence said it did not see any resumption of growth in construction for
several years.

<TEXT>
BLACK &amp; Decker, the US household equipment maker, yesterday posted a fourth-
quarter operating loss of Dollars 26.2m, partly reflecting continuing
pressure on profits in European markets.
A year ago, the company had operating income of Dollars 134m. during the
quarter.
The results were distorted by an after-tax charge of Dollars 134.7m to
reorganise its Dynapert business and to reduce overcapacity in consumer and
commercial businesses, mainly in Europe.
The balance sheet was also muddied by the adoption of new accounting
standards, including charges of Dollars 250m for the implementation of FAS
106.
Including one-time items, the company suffered a fourth quarter net loss of
Dollars 122.8m, or Dollars 1.51 a share, against net income of Dollars
31.9m, or 47 cents.
Stripping special items, Black &amp; Decker said it earned 34 cents a share in
the latest quarter. Revenues in the three months to December 31 rose 3 per
cent to Dollars 1.39bn from Dollars 1.35bn.
On Wall Street, Black &amp; Decker stock edged Dollars  3/8 lower to Dollars 17
7/8 .
The shares were trading at around Dollars 20 in September, before the
company warned investors of disappointing third-quarter earnings.
At that time, the company blamed its unsatisfactory outlook on deteriorating
European economies.
For the full year, Black &amp; Decker recorded a net deficit of Dollars 333.6m,
or Dollars 4.52 a share, compared with net income of Dollars 53m, or 81
cents, in 1991. Revenues rose to Dollars 4.78bn from Dollars 4.64bn.
Excluding special items and accounting changes, the company said net income
rose 25 per cent in 1992 to Dollars 66.4m from Dollars 53m.
Earnings per share fell to 72 cents from 81 cents, reflecting an increase in
shares outstanding.
The company also filed a shelf registration to issue up to Dollars 1bn of
debt securities. Proceeds will be used to to refinance existing debt.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, assigned a preliminary
rating of triple B-minus to the shelf registration and affirmed its ratings
of other Black &amp; Decker debt.

TEXAS Instruments expects the worldwide semiconductor market to grow 17 per
cent to Dollars 70bn in 1993, up from about 10 per cent and Dollars 59.9bn
in 1992, AP-DJ reports.
The upturn will be spurred primarily by an improved US market and strong
growth in the Asia-Pacific region, the company said.
It estimates the US semiconductor market will grow at 25 per cent to Dollars
23bn, due primarily to strong demand for computers and communications
products. For the first time since 1985, the North American semiconductor
market will be larger than Japan's, the US company predicted.
Japan will see market growth of 5 per cent in 1993, against a 7 per cent
decline in 1992. Its semiconductor market is expected to reach Dollars
20.4bn.

FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Cyanamid to spin off Dollars 1bn
chemicals arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Cyanamid, the US pharmaceuticals and chemicals company, is to spin
off its Dollars 1bn chemicals business to shareholders later this year.
The company had announced a restructuring of its chemical operations as far
back as December 1991, and a spin-off was widely expected. The announcement,
however, came earlier than anticipated.
Cyanamid has steadily distanced itself from its chemical operations over the
past two years.
It has already sold eight chemicals businesses and last year its remaining
chemical operations were set up as a separate unit, with its own
headquarters, under the Cytec Industries name.
Cyanamid's chemicals business had 1992 operating earnings of Dollars 34m, up
6 per cent from 1991, while sales slid 8 per cent to Dollars 1.05bn. In
contrast, the company's medical group saw sales rise 10 per cent in the year
to Dollars 2.89bn although operating earnings rose a more moderate 3 per
cent to Dollars 395m.
The decision to move away from chemicals to concentrate on higher-margin
drugs and life sciences operations was widely applauded in 1991, at a time
when many pharmaceuticals companies saw earnings growth in the 20 per cent
range.
In recent months, however, Cyanamid's stock price has fallen, along with
other pharmaceutical company issues, amid concern that the Clinton
administration's criticism of high drug prices will translate into slower
earnings growth.
The spin-off, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to be
completed towards the end of the year. Terms were not disclosed.

CEMENTOS Mexicanos, the world's fourth-largest cement company, lifted net
profits to 1,725m new pesos (Dollars 548m) last year, a real increase of 13
per cent over 1991.
The rise shows Cemex has weathered the slowdown in the Mexican economy.
Domestic cement sales rose by 7 per cent last year, with an increase of 12

Cemex's Dollars 1.8bn purchase of the Spanish cement companies, Sanson and
Valenciana, late last year hardly affected the results. The higher interest
on the debt taken out by Cemex was largely offset by the Spanish companies'
earnings of Dollars 8.5m in the last quarter.
The Spanish companies' margins were 7 per cent, compared with 25 per cent in
Mexico.

FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Unlikely allies fight Canada's
telephone war - Upheavals in the market will be increased by the battle's
ferocity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEROCIOUS battle between two pairs of unlikely partners is unfolding in
Canada's long-distance telephone market. In one corner is an alliance
between Stentor, the consortium of stuffy Canadian utilities which for years
held a monopoly on domestic trunk services, and MCI, the Washington-based
company which, in less than a decade, has captured 17 per cent of the US
long-distance market.
The nearest thing to MCI in Canada is Unitel Communications. Unitel had its
origins more than a century ago as a telegraph service for Canadian Pacific
and Canadian National railways, but last year gained regulatory approval to
break Stentor's grip on long-distance phone calls.
Unitel has hopped into bed with the grand old man of US telecommunications,
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph. AT&amp;T is buying a 20 per cent stake in the
Canadian company, leaving Canadian Pacific with 48 per cent and Rogers
Communications with 32 per cent. Rogers is Canada's biggest cable-TV
operator.
Besides testing the maxim that opposites attract, the alliances are bound to
increase the upheavals in the Canadian telecommunications market. They will
compete fiercely to bring new products and services to telephone users. Mr
Perrin Beatty, Canada's communications minister, is confident the rivalry
will stimulate what he calls 'our premier high-tech industry'.
The cross-border partnerships are also likely to lead to closer integration
of telephone services between the two countries.
Both sets of partners plan to create 'seamless' data and voice networks
across the border. 'Whether you're communicating with your affiliate in
Canada or the US, it will look identical,' says Mr Richard Stursberg,
Unitel's senior vice-president for government affairs. 'You'll have a single
set of products, a single point of ordering for services and a single bill.'
Regulatory barriers are crumbling in Canada. A ruling by the Canadian
Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) cleared the way
for Unitel to start offering long-distance service last November in
competition with the Stentor consortium.
Unitel, which claims to undercut Stentor charges by an average of 15 per
cent, says it has signed up 65,000 residential customers and 'several
thousand' business subscribers, mostly in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.
Although this is a minuscule share of the total market, Unitel is extending
its services to more cities, and claims to be well ahead of its projections.
Meanwhile, resellers, who lease lines in bulk from the telephone companies
and then provide discount services to users have garnered a surprisingly
high 6.5 per cent market share since the CRTC opened the market to them in
1990.
It is rumoured that one of the resellers will soon link up with GTE Sprint,
the third-biggest US long-distance carrier.
The Stentor consortium is not taking the challenge lightly. Unitel
subscribers require a 17-digit code to connect from the local network (owned
by the Stentor members) to Unitel's long-distance lines. An abortive court
challenge by Stentor against the CRTC decision has delayed by six to seven
months Unitel's plans to offer direct access to the long-distance switches.
In other areas of their business, Stentor's members are pressing for faster
deregulation. Mr Bob Kearney, chief executive of Bell Canada which is the
most powerful member in the Stentor consortium, says a phone company should
be allowed to carry whatever signals its customers want. 'If the local video
store wants us to carry its videos over the telephone line, why not?'
Unitel suspects an ulterior motive for the phone companies' conversion to
the free market. 'They think they can crush the competition before it gets
out of the gate,' says Mr Stursberg. Unitel has criticised Bell Canada's
request for the first increase in basic local-service charges in a decade.
To compensate customers for the rate increase, Bell has offered to expand
the local calling area in cities such as Toronto and Montreal. Unitel
objects. 'They're trying to make up for what they lost in the CRTC
proceedings by re-monopolising large parts of the market,' says Mr
Stursberg.
Each of the Canadian companies contends its US partner will give it a
headstart on its rival. Stentor was attracted by MCI's low costs, its
sophisticated telecommunications software and its aggressive corporate
culture. 'They've come up the hard way,' says Mr Kearney. In a bid to bring
some of that culture to the Stentor partners, MCI will participate in joint
marketing teams and others.
Mr Doug Cunningham, analyst at BBN James Capel in Toronto, notes that MCI's
costs are almost one-third lower than AT&amp;T's, and its customer base is
heavily concentrated in the lucrative big-business market.
Stentor considered teaming up with AT&amp;T. But Mr Kearney says 'we wanted a
more equal partnership than they were prepared (to offer).' He says MCI and
Stentor favour building alliances with telephone companies in other parts of
the world rather than, as he puts it, going 'toe-to-toe with the Bundespost'
as AT&amp;T might do.
But Unitel sees AT&amp;T's muscle as a plus. As part of the deal, it gets access
to AT&amp;T's switches, transmission facilities and other network technologies.
Unitel can also adapt AT&amp;T's US products to the Canadian market.
As an example of what AT&amp;T can provide, Mr Stursberg cites sophisticated
toll-free services which automatically route a call to the closest office
from the point where the call originates, or roll over calls to offices in
different time zones.
AT&amp;T's stake in Unitel is limited by law to 20 per cent. But an indication
of its influence is the recent appointment of senior AT&amp;T managers to top
network, operations and marketing jobs at Unitel.

THE dismantling of the Reichmanns' Canadian property empire is moving ahead.
The bondholders of First Canadian Place, the Reichmanns' former flagship
property in Toronto, have begun foreclosure proceedings.
Mr William Maclean, chairman of the bondholders' committee, said the move
followed the rejection on January 15 of Olympia &amp; York Developments'
financial restructuring plan by its creditors.
O&amp;Y went into bankruptcy protection last May. Since the rejection of its
restructuring plan, its creditors have been taking possession of the
Canadian properties.
Mr Maclean said bondholders for First Canadian Place, once valued at Dollars
450m, were acting with the Bank of Montreal and North American Life to
ensure the 2.5m sq ft building would have a sound future.

<TEXT>
GLAVERBEL, the Belgian glassmaker, yesterday blamed 'competitive
devaluation' of European currencies for a slump in export sales during the
second half of 1992.
Net profits at Glaverbel, western Europe's third-largest producer of flat
glass, edged up to BFr715m (Dollars 21.4m) in 1992, from BFr710m in 1991.
Sales rose to BFr33.1bn, from BFr30.8bn overall - an increase of 7.7 per
cent. But, in the second half, sales grew by only 3 per cent, excluding the
group's Czech operation.
Glaverbel blamed a decrease in sales to Italy, Spain and the UK after
devaluation, or suspension of their currencies from the European exchange
rate mechanism in the autumn. Belgium has insisted on linking the Belgian
franc to the D-Mark, which has given Glaverbel's competitors, such as
Pilkington of the UK, a hefty price advantage.
The group said it had also suffered from further price reductions in the
European market, although increased sales in added-value products, such as
automotive glass and laminated products for construction, helped compensate
for the decline.
Glaverbel is struggling to regain the prosperity of 1990, when net profits
stood at BFr2.27bn. The economic slowdown in Europe and the US has undercut
the group's sales of raw glass over the last two to three years.
Net income for the group increased last year to BFr1.02bn, from BFr799m, but
Glaverbel said that most of the growth was in partly-owned subsidiaries
outside Belgium.

to FFr438m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CASINO, one of France's largest food retailing groups, yesterday announced a
10 per cent fall in net profits to FFr438m (Dollars 80m) in 1992 from
FFr484m in 1991.
The group, which last year acquired the supermarket interests of Rallye,
another large French retailer, attributed the decline in net profits (which
have been restated for 1991 to allow for the Rallye deal) to a reduction in
exceptional gains. It registered an exceptional loss of FFr113m last year,
against an exceptional profit of FFr145m in 1991.
Sales increased to FFr61.6bn from FFr40.63bn in 1991, largely due to the
inclusion of the Rallye units. Operating profits rose to FFr1.32bn from
FFr775m last time with pre-tax profits increasing to FFr845m from FFr464m.
Casino, like other French retailers, has also been affected by weak economic
conditions. Consumer spending was static in France last year.

AKZO, the Dutch chemicals group, posted a 3 per cent rise in net profit
before extraordinary items in 1992, but warned that the result for the
current half-year may decline.
The downturn in Europe, where Akzo generates 70 per cent of its sales, is
expected to outweigh the emerging recovery in the US, which accounts for 22
per cent of turnover. However, Mr Aarnout Loudon, chairman, did not make a
forecast for the second-half result.
In 1992, net profit before extraordinaries increased to Fl 712m (Dollars
392m) from Fl 691m in 1991, in the face of stagnant economies in Europe and
turmoil on the currency markets. Sales were steady at Fl 16.85bn, with the
effects of adverse currency translations and divestments balanced by rises
in prices and sales volumes and by acquisitions. Operating profit rose by 6
per cent to Fl 1.23bn.
Net profit including extraordinaries rose by 11 per cent to Fl 646m. Akzo
had after-tax charges of Fl 66m in 1992, due in part to a pre-tax
restructuring provision of nearly Fl 175m, but this was still lower than the
1991 net charge of Fl 111m.
Akzo said it would hold its dividend at Fl 6.50.

FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Nobel blames currency losses for
halved profits

NOBEL Industries, the Swedish chemicals group, yesterday blamed poor
management and weak control for SKr750m (Dollars 97.6m) in foreign exchange
losses which more than halved 1992 profits to SKr200m.
The result is much worse than predicted last October when the group said
1992 profits would exceed 1991's SKr460m. The weakening of the krona in the
final months of last year lowered the group's result by SKr300m.
Mr Ove Mattsson, president and chief executive, said no unauthorised
transactions had come to light, but he admitted the group had made excessive
provisions for its tax exposure and said human error was partly to blame.
He did not rule out the possibility of some staff being dismissed on the
completion of an inquiry into the group's finance and control functions.
The group is taking immediate steps to correct its tax hedging position,
although it admits that a further weakening of the krona since the start of
1993 will result in additional foreign exchange losses of SKr150m at current
exchange rates. It said it still had SKr2bn in open currency positions
caused by tax-related hedging.
Mr Mattsson said SKr450m of last year's foreign exchange losses could be
blamed on hedging designed to limit the group's exposure to Swedish tax on
foreign assets. However, he stressed that this process became unnecessary
when the group's tax position changed in 1991 (it accumulated large tax loss
carry-forwards after the restructuring of the stricken finance company
Gamlestaden) and it should have changed its policy sooner.
The remaining SKr300m of exchange losses arose because 'we were unable to
protect all our positions and because of human error. It was a question of
late action and lack of communication,' said Mr Mattsson.
Shares in Nobel were suspended on Tuesday pending the results announcement
and resumed trading yesterday. The company said it requested the suspension
because it did not want to mislead the market when disclosing a separate
deal under which it will sell its defence electronics operations to the
state-owned Celsius group for SKr1.55bn.
Nobel stressed that its underlying business activities were performing well,
producing 1992 earnings after depreciation of SKr1.39bn, against SKr1.42bn a
year earlier.

JYSKE BANK, Denmark's fourth-ranking bank, is holding the annual dividend at
10 per cent after reporting a net loss of DKr919m (Dollars 148.16m) last
year against a profit of DKr47m in 1991.
Loss provisions increased to DKr1.26bn from DKr873m. A write-off of DKr344m
by a Gibraltar subsidiary contributed heavily to the provisions.
The second main item in the group's poor performance last year was a loss of
DKr25m on the adjustment for the value of the securities portfolio. In 1991,
this item yielded a gain of DKr558m.
The group slimmed the balance sheet by almost DKr10bn to end the year at
DKr53.3bn. The slimming exercise was a factor helping to increase the
group's capital adequacy ratio to 11.9 per cent from 11.6 per cent in 1991.
The legal minimum last year was 10 per cent.
The loss per share last year was DKr128m. The loss was equal to 30.4 per
cent of shareholder's equity, which was reduced from DKr3.44bn to DKr2.60bn,
the bank said. The group budgets for a profit on its ordinary activities of
DKr150mto DKr250m in 1993.

ATLAS COPCO, the Swedish tool manufacturing group, saw profits after
financial items rise 14 per cent in 1992 to SKr1.03bn (Dollars 134m) from
SKr902m in 1991.
The group said it benefited from restructuring and higher interest rates
which more than offset the impact of lower sales volumes. An unchanged
dividend of SKr8 per share is proposed on a 22 per cent increase in earnings
per share to SKr16.90.
Atlas forecast unchanged earnings for the current year, but it noted that
the weak sales trend which it experienced towards the end of 1992 had
continued into 1993.
Group sales rose 7 per cent last year to SKr16bn from SKr15bn, largely
reflecting the acquisition of AEG's electrical power tool operations at the
start of the year. Operating profits after depreciation climbed 7 per cent
to SKr1.13bn.
There was increased demand for drilling equipment, but low metal prices and
large inventories depressed demand in the mining sector. In industrial
markets, European demand was generally weak, apart from Germany.
Orders received rose 4 per cent to SKr15.88bn, but adjusted for comparable
units, the level dropped 4 per cent.
The group's construction and mining technique business area turned round a
SKr53m loss in 1991 to produce a SKr157m profit last year, despite a drop in
sales to SKr4.25bn from SKr4.49bn.

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEEPING changes in the top management of Volkswagen, Europe's biggest
carmaker, are expected to be approved at a meeting of the company's
supervisory board next month.
Speculation about the outcome of the March 16 sitting revived yesterday when
officials of the Lower Saxony government claimed that Mr Ferdinand Piech,
the new VW chairman, had enticed Mr Ignacio Lopez de Arriotua to quit his
job at General Motors of the US.
Mr Lopez moved within GM from Europe to Detroit last year, taking with him a
reputation as a hard-bargaining cost-cutter. He was recently promoted to
vice-president and group executive in charge of worldwide purchasing.
GM denied the reports. 'He is not leaving. He is happy here and is staying
here', the company said.
However, Mr Piech has already had marked success in poaching key GM
managers. Before he left his former job as head of Audi, he brought in Mr
Jurgen Gebhardt, former manager of Opel's car plant in Eisenach, as director
responsible for production at the upmarket VW subsidiary.
Mr Erich Schmitt, another GM manager, was given a boardroom seat and
responsibility for purchasing and finance.
Yesterday's reports that Mr Lopez was to join VW were given extra
credibility by their origins. The Lower Saxony government, with 20 per cent
of the shares, is VW's largest stockholder and is represented with several
seats on the supervisory board.
Other changes expected at the board meeting include the replacement of Mr
Dieter Ullsperger, finance director, and directors responsible for legal
affairs and the environment. Mr Daniel Goeudevert, deputy to Mr Piech and
responsible for the Volkswagen brand, is expected to be given other
day-to-day responsibilities.
Deteriorating conditions in VW's markets were underlined yesterday by the
announcement that group sales worldwide fell more than 16 per cent in
January.
Incoming orders were still unsatisfactory, the company said, and short-time
working was likely to be continued into the second quarter of this year.

<TEXT>
SCHINDLER, the second-largest lift group after Otis of the US, said its
consolidated net income jumped 26.8 per cent last year to SFr110.7m (Dollars
74.62m), due largely to the consolidation of the Also computer services
subsidiary and an unexpected improvement in interest income.
Excluding these special factors, net income was up 9.2 per cent to SFr95.3m
on sales up 11.3 per cent to SFr4.46bn.
The directors have proposed raising the dividends on registered and
non-voting shares from SFr25 per share to SFr26 and on bearer shares from
SFr125 per share to SFr130.
Orders eased 1.1 per cent during the year to SFr4.2bn, but orders for lifts
and escalators rose 3.9 per cent to SFr3.8bn. Overall, orders on hand at the
end of the year stood at SFr2.9bn, 8.5 per cent lower than a year earlier,
mainly because of a slump in demand for rolling stock.
Also, which distributes personal computers in Switzerland, was acquired in
1988, but proved initially unsuccessful. The group wrote down its
investment, but brought it back into the financial statements last year
after it completed its third year in profit.

FT  25 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Atreus to obtain official listing via
reverse takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATREUS, a shower screen and mirror supplier, yesterday joined the growing
trend of small companies using reverse takeovers to get an official listing,
following proposals to close the Unlisted Securities Market.
The group, which plans to merge with shell company URS International, is
expected to have a market value of just Pounds 7.2m, following a placing and
public offer of 27.5m shares at 20p each. The whole process is expected to
cost the company Pounds 500,000 - roughly half its latest estimated annual
profits.
It is likely that this method of reversing into listed shells to come to the
market will be increasingly pursued by smaller companies. 'The market is
strong and institutions have an appetite for smaller company issues at the
moment,' said one analyst.
Mr Rodney Harnett, chairman, said Atreus aimed to grow through expanding its
product ranges out of the bathroom, tackling new markets at home and abroad,
such as hotels, and by acquisition. It had come to the market to help it
finance that growth.
However, Atreus will raise just Pounds 1m from the placing and offer, after
issuing Pounds 4m in loan notes to the company's founders and executive
directors, Mr Bruce Ledwith and Mr David Howarth, and paying expenses.
Messers Ledwith and Howarth will retain between 20 and 25 per cent.
It is likely that Atreus, which currently has cash balances of about Pounds
1m, will have to return to shareholders for cash after about 18 months.
Mr Harnett said he aimed to show investors that the group was 'capable of
sustaining growth and using our cash resources wisely' before making a
further cash call.
Atreus is forecasting a 36 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.1m
for the year to January 31 on sales of Pounds 6.2m (Pounds 4.7m). The group
said a dividend of 0.75p would have been recommended had it been listed.

FT  25 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Costain appeals against US injunction -
Court decision poses questions about future of December's three-year loan
facility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COSTAIN, like an ageing heavyweight who has seen better times, is beset by
blows from all sides. Misfortune has piled upon misadventure as management
has struggled to keep the international construction and mining business on
its feet.
The British-based company, faced with its latest setback yesterday, appealed
against the granting of a permanent injunction by a United States court
preventing it from selling its Australian coalmining and commercial property
interests for Dollars 245m (Pounds 172.5m) to Altus Finance, a subsidiary of
Credit Lyonnais, the French bank.
Peabody, the US-based coal subsidiary of Britain's Hanson group, had asked
Stephen Limbaugh, the district judge, to block the deal on grounds that
Costain had previously agreed to sell it the Australian coal mining business
for Dollars 200m.
The decision in St Louis, Missouri, raises questions about a three-year loan
facility negotiated with Costain's bankers in December; the facility was
based upon the company receiving the proceeds from a sale to Altus.
It remained unclear yesterday whether all or part of this arrangement would
need to be renegotiated or what attitude lenders would take should Costain
have breached the terms of the refinancing agreement.
In the worst scenario, the banks could seek to put the British company into
administrative receivership. That might allow the new operators to relaunch
negotiations to sell Costain's Australian and US coal mining businesses
unencumbered by legal actions.
Among the reasons why banks may not adopt this course is that, having
supported the company so far, they might as well allow the appeal to
proceed.
The construction company also retains the option to accept the lower Peabody
offer for the Australian coal operations. With the pound's devaluation, that
looks more attractive in sterling terms than when first negotiated last
autumn. However, the sterling cost of Costain's borrowings, much of which
are in the US, will have also risen.
To allow such a well-known public company to fail would provoke a large
political and public relations fall-out for the banks, which are already
facing strong criticism. If administrators could successfully sell the coal
businesses, it would leave the banks with the problem of disposing of
Costain's construction and UK housebuilding operations, both of which would
have a 'distressed sale' sign hanging over them. Although the banks may
decide to remain with Costain, they cannot be pleased about how such a vital
disposal has become ensnared in the courts.
The group's debt, which was Pounds 344m when the rival deals with Peabody
and Altus were concluded last autumn, easily exceeds its book value, which
was Pounds 276m at the start of last year. Borrowings include Pounds 52m of
loans due on the Spitalfield commercial property joint venture in London.
Judge Limbaugh said that Costain, although still talking to Altus, had
decided to accept Peabody's offer on October 19 because 'the banks were
becoming increasingly concerned about Costain's position and at the end of
that week Costain needed to have bank approval to make a payment to
refinance the Spitalfield project'. He also revealed that Bouygues, the
large French construction group, had been discussing the possibility of
making a bid for the whole of Costain shortly before Altus emerged on the
scene.
The judgment is the latest in a series of setbacks for the group, which has
seen its share price fall by almost 90 per cent in just over two-and-a-half
years to 27p yesterday.
Costain's stock market value of only Pounds 62m is less than a third of that
of lesser-known domestic housebuilders such as Berkeley Group, Persimmon,
Wilson Bowden and Wilson Connolly.
A sale of the Australian coal operations to Peabody would still leave
gearing of more than 70 per cent. Although UK housebuilding is showing signs
of recovery, Costain has a poor track record in this market.
US coal operations have been lacklustre. Only international contracting has
displayed any promise. Margins on contracting however, remain low by
comparison with other businesses.
Costain, provided banks keep their nerve, has a lot of rebuilding still to
do.

FT  25 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Wickes stages recovery with turnround to
Pounds 6.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WICKES, the DIY and timber retailer which almost sunk two years ago,
returned to the black in 1992 but is again passing its dividend.
Pre-tax profit for the year was Pounds 6.57m, including exceptional Pounds
786,000 property profits and Pounds 1.98m reorganisation costs at Malden
Timber, one of its two ill-fated timber subsidiaries. The pre-tax loss for
1991 was Pounds 6.72m.
The results reflected a sharp fall in interest charges following a Pounds
42.6m rights issue in 1991.
Net interest payments were down to Pounds 13m (Pounds 16.9m), with group
debt down by Pounds 35.8m to Pounds 73.2m. Gearing at the year end stood at
92 per cent (232 per cent).
Operating profit more than doubled to Pounds 20.8m (Pounds 10.1m). Turnover
was slightly up at Pounds 548.4m (Pounds 542.6m). Earnings per share were
1.9p (losses of 2.1p).
The results were in line with City expectations, but the shares shed 4p to
93p amid continuing concern about the future of the timber business.
Wickes operates 102 DIY stores in the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands and
France. It plans to open another 15 in the UK and five on the Continent this
year.
The company has launched an expansion of Builders Mate, its UK chain of
low-cost timber outlets.
Seven Builders Mate stores are already trading; another 14 will be launched
this year after two years' work on repositioning the timber side. They will
offer a range of 2,000 core products - construction timber, sheet materials
and branded products - at up to 10 per cent below the 'headline' prices of
typical timber merchants.
Mr Henry Sweetbaum, chairman, said Builders Mate was 'a great market
opportunity. It applies our tried-and-tested sales approach to the
traditional timber merchant trade.'
The passing of the dividend, he said, was in order 'to continue to reduce
borrowings and finance the capital expenditure necessary for expansion.' The
payment of a dividend for 1993 is 'a priority'.
COMMENT
Wickes is not out of the woods yet. The DIY side is in sound shape, with
sales and margins continuing to outperform the sector average. Though
ambitious, its planned expansion applies a proven formula when sites and
building costs are cheap. Timber remains the problem. With only two of its
'pilot' stores trading for more than a year, Builders Mate is practically a
leap in the dark. Most trade customers are credit-dependent and tied to
traditional suppliers. A construction upturn may supply the credit; luring
the customers is another matter. Analysts are forecasting profits this year
of about Pounds 17m, putting the shares on a prospective multiple of 23. A
recovery stock.

Mr Simon Knott, chairman, said the increases compared with a rise of 14.8
per cent in the FT-A All-Share Index. 'This performance, while
disappointing, is still reasonable given the difficult environment for
smaller companies during the year.'
Net revenue amounted to Pounds 339,674 (Pounds 327,888) for earnings of
7.737p (7.446p) per income share. The dividend is raised to 8.3p (8p) via a

Shares in CRP Leisure yesterday fell 3 1/2 p to 4 1/2 p, after the
USM-traded group warned of financial difficulties at its CR Pursehouse
subsidiary, compounded by a sizeable bad debt on a building contract.
The company warned that trading at Pursehouse, a building contractor
acquired a year ago and mainly engaged in public house refurbishment, had
'deteriorated significantly' in recent months.
CRP said it was examining various options to resolve the problems at
Pursehouse, including possible refinancing and an arrangement with the

Net asset value at Dunedin Income Growth Investment Trust rose 10 per cent,
from 542.2p to 596.5p per share, over the 12 months to January 31.
Net revenue amounted to Pounds 6.92m, down from Pounds 7.91m last time, for
earnings of 21.75p (24.87p) per share. Directors attributed the decline to
dividend cuts in the trust's equity portfolio and lower levels of interest
on liquid funds.
The final dividend is held at a proposed 17p for a maintained total of
25.4p; the distribution requires a transfer of Pounds 1.16m from reserves.

Dakota Group, the Dublin-based packaging and paper company which has a USM
quote, announced pre-tax losses of IPounds 1.08m (Pounds 1.12m) for the year
to September 30. Last time profits were IPounds 1.18m.
Directors said the group had an extremely difficult year, primarily in its

Turnover fell to IPounds 26.9m (IPounds 29.8m). Losses per share worked
through at 4p (3.3p earnings) and there is no dividend. A total of 1.1p was
paid last time.
The group also announced the disposal of its 81 per cent interest in
Technodisc, the software manufacturing subsidiary,to BG Turnkey Services,
for a nominal consideration. The loss on disposal amounts to IPounds
400,000, which will be reflected in the current year's accounts.

FT  25 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Alfred McAlpine shows 61% fall to Pounds
3.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALFRED McAlpine, the UK construc-tion group which is still seeking a new
chief executive, yesterday announced a 61 per cent fall in pre-tax profits
and a cut in its final dividend of more than a third.
The group's share price fell 8p to close at 131p following the announcement
that the pre-tax surplus had fallen from Pounds 9.3m to Pounds 3.6m for the
year ended October 31 1992. Profits would have been higher but for a Pounds
2m exceptional provision mostly to cover redundancy costs.
Mr Graeme Odgers, who is quitting as chief executive to become chairman of
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, said that the final dividend would be
reduced from 5.8p to 3.5p making a total of 6.5p (10.3p) for the year.
Earnings per share fell from 14.1p to 5.1p. Interest charges were down from
Pounds 5.3m to Pounds 2.6m following a Pounds 39m 1-for-2 rights issue in
1991.
Turnover fell from Pounds 620.8m to Pounds 560.7m.
Mr Odgers said that the group had drawn up a short list of three highly
qualified candidates for the chief executive's job and expected to make an
announcement shortly.
The group said that it expected profits to increase in the current year,
although it would incur a loss in the first half. The UK construction market
remained very difficult, which was affecting McAlpine's contracting and
minerals operations.
Construction profits last year fell from Pounds 13m to Pounds 1.5m, while
profits from minerals dropped from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 1.9m. Mr Odgers
expected little improvement to be made in the current year.
The outlook for UK housing and the US was more promising, he said. The
number of house sales agreed by the group had jumped by 30 per cent since
January 1 compared with the corresponding period.
Housing, which made Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 1.2m loss), returned its first
profit for years. US profits had slipped from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 1.9m but
were also expected to do better this year.
Net debt averaged Pounds 49m during the last financial year, equivalent to
29 per cent of shareholders' funds of Pounds 170m.
Net debt in the current year was expected to average about Pounds 65m,
reflecting the purchase of the 40 per cent minority in the housing business,
the affect of currency movements and lower cash inflows from contracting.
COMMENT
McAlpine under Graeme Odgers' tenure has done all the right things. Debt has
been reduced, overheads cut and a clear well-defined business development
strategy introduced including expansion of overseas construction interests.
All of this has been recognised in the McAlpine share price, which slid
yesterday on news of the dividend cut and Mr Odgers' unfavourable comments
about the state of the UK contracting and building material markets. Profits
nonetheless could rise to Pounds 6m this year and might even reach Pounds
7m. This would provide earnings of between 7p and 8p leaving a maintained
dividend fully covered. A prospective p/e of between 16 and 18 would suggest
that the stock remains fully valued despite yesterday's slide in the share
price.

FT  25 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Two trusts consider placings to raise funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO INVESTMENT trusts have announced their intention to raise new capital.
Templeton Emerging Markets, the specialist trust which invests in developing
economies in areas such as Latin America and south east Asia, said it was
considering a placing of new shares, of which 25 per cent would be available
to existing share and warrant holders under an open offer.
Trusts can normally only offer new shares if they are trading at a premium
to their asset values; County NatWest figures show Templeton Emerging shares
trading at about a 10.6 per cent premium. Roughly speaking, when a trust's
shares are trading at a premium this indicates an excess of demand over
supply of the shares.
Templeton said the placing would enable the trust to make further
investments and to widen its shareholder base.
Meanwhile, Moorgate Smaller Companies Income said it was considering a
placing and offer to increase its size by a maximum of Pounds 25m; that
compares with net assets at the end of January 1993 of Pounds 56m.
Any offer will be made available to all shareholders; the trust's shares
trade at a near 7 per cent premium.

Exceptional charge of Pounds 1bn pushes pre-tax deficit to more than Pounds
1.2bn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace's decision to pay a larger than expected dividend meant
the company was feeling much more confident about the future, Mr John
Cahill, chairman, said yesterday.
'We have reduced our break-even point, and it's going down further,' he
said. 'We also have spare capacity to take up slack when the recovery takes
place.' Getting costs down was 'a religion' in BAe, he added.
In spite of making a net loss of Pounds 888m, the company declared dividends
worth Pounds 35m gross on top of Pounds 28m of preference dividends. That
left distributable reserves of Pounds 87m. Mr Richard Lapthorne, finance
director, said the policy was to have the gross dividend covered close to
three times by earnings.
Shareholders' funds fell from Pounds 2.7bn to Pounds 1.78bn. Mr Lapthorne
said that left 'comfortable headroom' over the Pounds 1.6bn minimum net
worth specified in the group's banking covenants.
Changes in accounting policy reduced profits by about Pounds 50m, Mr
Lapthorne said. The largest items were a Pounds 47m write-off of launch
costs on regional aircraft, offset by a reduction in pension fund payments
of Pounds 59m to reflect pension surpluses.
The heaviest losses came in regional aircraft, which lost Pounds 337m at the
operating level besides incurring exceptional costs of Pounds 1bn.
Losses in the second half were about Pounds 50m. They were likely to run at
a lower level this year, according to the company.
Mr Cahill said: 'The reason we lost Pounds 337m was partly to do with the
market, but above all because costs are too high. The challenge for the new
joint venture is to get costs out of the process.' The UK plants supplying
the joint venture had been given 36 months to reduce their overheads by
between 25 and 30 per cent, he said.
Mr Lapthorne said adverse changes in the order book for Airbus meant BAe's
share in the business would continue to consume cash until mid-1994, six
months longer than expected.
The group made an operating loss of Pounds 75m (1991 profit Pounds 212m) for
the year to December 1992. This was made up of a profit of Pounds 352m
(Pounds 371m) on defence and Pounds 14m (Pounds 28m) on construction, offset
by losses of Pounds 337m (Pounds 37m) on commercial aircraft, Pounds 49m
(Pounds 52m) on motor vehicles, Pounds 2m (Pounds 24m) on property
development and Pounds 53m (Pounds 74m) on other businesses and central
costs.
After interest charges of Pounds 126m (Pounds 58m) and exceptionals of
Pounds 1bn (Pounds 266m), there was a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.2bn (Pounds
112m). After tax of Pounds 272m (Pounds 26m) and minorities of Pounds 41m
(Pounds 51m), the net loss was Pounds 888m (Pounds 132m).

<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Fairway Group, the USM-quoted stationery supplies
distributor, fell 14 per cent, from Pounds 1.77m to Pounds 1.51m, in the
1992 year.
Turnover jumped 48 per cent to Pounds 29.3m, mainly because of a full
12-month contribution from GLS Fairway, against seven months.
Earnings per share were 3.44p (5.14p), and the final dividend is held at
2.15p to maintain a 3.15p total.

FT  25 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Mentor creditors pass scheme of arrangement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITORS OF Mentor, the Bermuda-based reinsurer which collapsed in 1985
with gross liabilities in excess of Dollars 790m, have approved a scheme of
arrangement, which should allow them to receive payment equivalent to at
least 40 cents on the dollar.
There are almost 800 UK and US creditors of Mentor. Under the provisions of
the scheme all known and potential creditors will have until June 30 1993 to
file any and all remaining claims, with the adjudication of these claims
expected to take an additional 18 months.
Mr Charles Kempe, partner of Ernst &amp; Young, said that the scheme would
require creditors to value any remaining unreported claims on an actuarial
basis which would then be adjudicated upon by Mr Kempe and Mr Nigel
Hamilton, the joint liquidators.
'The scheme represents a pioneering attempt to finalise the liquidation
through the usage of actuarial techniques,' said Mr Kempe.
Since their appointment in 1985 the joint liquidators have increased the
available assets of the estate by some Dollars 158m, including reinsurance
recoveries of Dollars 54m and Dollars 40m in cash settlements related to
litigation against the company's shareholders, directors and auditors.

FT  25 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Shrinking budgets but defence stays at the
core
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WAY British Aerospace talks about its military business it would be easy
to forget that defence budgets are shrinking throughout the industrialised
world and that the UK Ministry of Defence is in the throes of fresh
cost-cutting.
'The defence company is still at the core,' said Mr John Cahill, the
chairman who arrived at BAe last year as a newcomer to the arms business.
Mr Dick Evans, chief executive, echoed the optimistic tone about BAe's
aircraft-to-ammunition defence division, which accounts for 40 per cent of
group sales: 'Overall performance remains strong, with excellent prospects
for the future.'
Last year's defence profits of Pounds 352m before interest and tax
counterbalanced the Pounds 337m lost in commercial aircraft. However, the
result was lower than the restated profit figure of Pounds 371m for the
previous year. Military sales also fell to just over Pounds 4bn, compared
with Pounds 4.27bn in 1991 and a peak of Pounds 4.64bn in 1990.
In spite of the recent decline, BAe claims to have outperformed the rest of
the defence market since 1988 with an increase of about 10 per cent against
an overall market decline of some 12 per cent.
The results of cost-cutting, including the closure of facilities in the
missile, military aircraft and Royal Ordnance subsidiaries, were beginning
to bear fruit, Mr Evans said. Labour costs had been reduced by 40 per cent
since 1988. As a proportion of sales, labour and overheads had dropped from
45 per cent to 30 per cent.
Mr John Weston, chairman of BAe Defence, said all parts of the division were
profitable. Additional cutbacks were likely but there were no further
substantial closures in view.
Exports made up 74 per cent of BAe's military turnover last year, compared
with a level in the mid-1980s of just over 40 per cent.
Prospects have been boosted in the last 12 months by three crucial
breakthroughs: a Pounds 570m MoD contract to go ahead with the Asraam
air-to-air missile, agreement on a revised programme for the four-nation
Eurofighter and the recent Saudi order for 48 more Tornado bombers.
Mr Evans disclosed that payment for the Tornados, part of a package worth
between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 5bn, would be separate from the current
arrangements for the Al-Yamamah arms supply pact, to which Saudi Arabia
dedicates 500,000 barrels of oil per day. Final payment details were still
under negotiation, he said.

FT  25 FEB 93 / UK Company News: United Biscuits snaps up snack maker for
Pounds 24m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERWENT VALLEY Food, the northern England snacks maker whose rapid growth
made it one of the entrepreneurial success stories of the Thatcher era, is
to be sold to United Biscuits, Britain's largest biscuits and snacks
manufacturer, for about Pounds 24m.
Derwent Valley, founded 11 years ago in Consett, the former steel town in
County Durham, is best known for its Phileas Fogg tortilla chips and other
corn-based products. It pioneered the British market for adult premium
snacks, worth about Pounds 70m a year and the fastest-growing sector of the
snacks business.
Mr Roger McKechnie, managing director, said the company wanted to step up
its international expansion. After failing to find an industrial partner
willing to help, it had decided last year to seek a buyer.
The company had considered raising capital through a stock market flotation.
It rejected the idea, however, because it feared that pressure from
shareholders to maximise short-term returns would prevent it from making the
large investments needed to develop the business.
Derwent Valley, which has 350 employees, expects a Pounds 2m trading profit
on sales of Pounds 24m in the year to March. Its existing management have
agreed to continue, and Mr McKechnie will join the board of KP Foods, UB's
snacks division.
United Biscuits is paying Pounds 15m in cash and Pounds 9m in shares, and
assuming about Pounds 3m of debt. The deal is conditional on clearance by
the Office of Fair Trading.
About two thirds of Derwent Valley's shares are owned by founders and
directors and 27 per cent by 3i, the investment capital group which helped
finance the company's formation. The rest of the shares are owned by staff.
Mr McKechnie said that under United Biscuits' ownership, Derwent Valley
would enjoy stronger financial backing and planned to expand distribution
from 8,000 to about 50,000 UK retail outlets. Until now, relatively low
volumes and a small sales force had made it difficult to extend distribution
much beyond large supermarket chains.
The companies hope in the next five years to double the sales of Derwent
Valley and to turn Phileas Fogg into one of Britain's five best-selling
snack brands.
Derwent Valley has 2 per cent of total British snacks sales and about a
third of the adult premium sector. KP, which had estimated sales last year
of more than Pounds 530m, claims to be the leader of the UK snack market
with a 36 per cent share by value but it has only 4 per cent of the adult
products market.
Derwent Valley's management will remain responsible for manufacturing the
Phileas Fogg range in Britain. Mr McKechnie expects expanded production at
the Consett plant to add at least 100 jobs. 'This is a good day for
Consett,' he said yesterday.
Consett was reeling from the closure of its British Steel plant when Derwent
Valley was set up there in 1982 by Mr McKechnie, who had a background in the
food industry, and colleagues.
KP, which has operations in the US, continental Europe and Australia, plans
to step up Phileas Fogg's sales effort outside Britain and may eventually
make its products in factories abroad.
Derwent Valley has annual exports of about Pounds 2m, to Australia, France,
the Netherlands and Spain. Although it has tried for several years to expand
international sales, particularly in Europe, it has been handicapped by lack
of experience and limited distribution.
The company has held talks with several other prospective bidders. They are
believed to have included PepsiCo of the US, the world's largest snacks
manufacturer, which owns the Smith's and Walker's brands in Britain, and
Dalgety, owner of the Golden Wonder brand.
Mr McKechnie said United Biscuits had been chosen because it offered 'the
best fit in terms of clout, expertise and corporate culture'. He would not
say if it also submitted the highest bid.
Derwent Valley will remain an independent company within the KP group, and
its management will continue to be responsible for UK operations.

FT  25 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Rover still in loss as further jobs go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER, the motor vehicles subsidiary of British Aerospace, incurred an
operating loss before interest of Pounds 49m last year, compared with a loss
of Pounds 52m in 1991 and an operating profit of Pounds 65m in 1990.
The company cut another 1,277 jobs from its UK workforce last month through
an enhanced voluntary redundancy programme, Mr George Simpson, BAe deputy
chief executive and chairman of Rover, said yesterday.
Rover eliminated 1,800 jobs last year with a reduction in the workforce to
33,200 at the end of 1992 against 35,000 at December 1991 and 40,500 at the
end of 1990.
BAe said it expected Rover to move back into profit in 1993 after two years
of losses, helped by:
stronger new car demand, with UK new car sales forecast to rise from 1.59m
to 1.65m in 1993,
a further reduction in costs, following a 7.5 per cent improvement in
productivity in 1992,
the launch of the new Rover 600 large family car range in April, and
improved competitiveness gained by last autumn's devaluation of the pound.
Mr Simpson said break-even point had been reduced to a production of about
440,000 vehicles a year. The targeted break-even level remains 400,000
vehicles a year.
Rover vehicle production declined from 419,881 to 404,971. Car output fell
by 4.8 per cent to 347,639 (including 32,444 Honda Concertos for the
Japanese car maker).
Output in 1992 was supported by the success of the Land Rover four-wheel
drive vehicle business, which raised production by 5 per cent to 57,332
against 54,594 in 1991.
BAe has taken a charge of Pounds 36m for the write-off of its 10.9 per cent
holding in Daf, the Dutch commercial vehicle maker, which collapsed into
receivership three weeks ago.
Mr Simpson said it had managed to sell the holding in recent days via the
Amsterdam stock exchange for just over Pounds 1m or Fl 0.60 a share.
Turnover declined marginally to Pounds 3.68bn (Pounds 3.74bn), in spite of a
10.4 per cent decline in wholesale vehicle sales to 421,000, (470,000).
Retail vehicle sales to customers fell by 6.7 per cent to 445,000.
Rover's retail vehicle sales in the UK declined by 7.4 per cent from 243,082
to 225,199, and its share of the UK new car market fell to only 13.5 per
cent (14.4 per cent). The company is still dependent on the UK market for
about 57 per cent of its vehicle sales.
Sales in its three main continental European markets - France, Italy and
Spain - fell marginally, but export performance improved in the second half
and should be boosted this year by the devaluation of the pound.
Capital expenditure is forecast to rise to Pounds 233m this year against
Pounds 210m in 1992 and Pounds 250m in 1990, while spending on new product
development is expected to continue at about Pounds 150m a year.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Banks sue Coopers in Canada
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON, ROBERT GIBBENS and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of 16 banks has alleged that the Quebec branch of auditors Coopers
and Lybrand failed to disclose irregularities in the affairs of Castor
Holdings, the bankrupt Canadian property finance group backed by European
investors.
The banks, mostly based in Germany, have filed a suit in Quebec claiming
CDollars 127m (Pounds 71m) from 20 partners in Coopers' Montreal office,
alleging they 'grossly mis-stated (Castor's) real financial condition and
concealed the true picture'.
Castor, which was controlled by German-Canadian financier Mr Wolfgang
Stolzenberg, went into bankruptcy last July, leaving creditors with losses
expected to exceed CDollars 1bn.
According to a declaration filed with the Quebec Superior Court, the banks
allege that Coopers failed to recommend appropriate procedures to control
'possible abuse or improper activity' by senior Castor executives.
Mr Peter Blaikie, managing partner of Heenan Blaikie in Montreal, the law
firm acting for Coopers, said: 'We have a mandate to contest the writ. It is
clear and unequivocal.'

THOMAS Cook, the travel and financial services company controlled by
Westdeutsche Landesbank, yesterday reaffirmed its commitment to a proposed
tie-up with Owners Abroad, writes Richard Gourlay. 'We are fully committed
to the alliance,' it said. It was the best deal for Owners' shareholders and
for LTU, the German travel company also part of WestLB's travel interests.
This proposed alliance would allow Owners Abroad to market its holidays
through Thomas Cook travel agencies and would lead to savings for the two
companies of at least Pounds 15m during two years.

FT  25 FEB 93 / German bank travels beyond its heartland: Thomas Cook
decides about owners Abroad / Its unorthodox shareholder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
MR FRIEDEL NEUBER and the Westdeutsche Landesbank the German public sector
bank of which he is chief executive - never seem to be far from controversy.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
They ran into it again last week when WestLB agreed, after months of
negotiations, to buy a 40 per cent stake in the Landesbank
Schleswig-Holstein, the Kiel-based public sector bank. This is believed to
have cost between DM260m and DM300m (Pounds 127m).
The move came several months after WestLB, acting in tandem with the
Stuttgart-based SudwestLB, paid DM750m to acquire a 50 per cent stake in
Landesbank Rheinland Pfalz in Mainz.
The two transactions consolidate WestLB's position as Germany's dominant
public sector bank, its interests extending far beyond its North-Rhine
Westphalia heartland.
The bank today reports its 1992 figures. Group operating profits are likely
to be more than the DM970m made in 1991. With a balance sheet of DM260bn at
the end of last year, the house-bank to the state of North-Rhine Westphalia
is Germany's third biggest bank. With about a third of earnings coming from
31 offices abroad, its ability to compete with the likes of Deutsche Bank
and Dresdner Bank extends beyond the domestic market.
While other Landesbanken stick to looking after state governments' finances
and providing central banking services to local savings associations,
Dusseldorf-based WestLB has been pursuing more colourful activities. It is
thought to have spent at least DM1.6bn on buying stakes in industrial
companies since 1991.
Last year it and its LTU travel associate - Germany's largest airline
charter group in which WestLB has a 34.3 per cent stake - bought an 86 per
cent stake in Thomas Cook, the UK travel company, for Pounds 172m.
WestLB later bought the whole stake on its own account and fused it with
other travel interests in a newly formed subsidiary, TCT Touristik
Beteiligungs.
WestLB also had a 10 per cent stake in Hoesch, the steel group which
recently fell victim to an unwelcome takeover from Krupp, its Ruhr-based
rival. WestLB claims that it played a neutral role in the affair but
Frankfurt financiers are convinced that Mr Neuber helped Krupp plot and
execute the takeover.
The bank also has a 10 per cent stake in Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus, the large
German retailer acquired last year by Metro, the privately-owned Swiss
retail group. It is thought to have helped Metro with the purchase of its
majority stake in Asko.
'Wild-west capitalism,' is how Mr Peter Fischer, economics minister of the
state of Lower Saxony, describes the bank's stake-building in German
companies. It is believed to have stakes in up to 150 companies, the biggest
of which is a 32 per cent holding in Preussag, the large German steel and
engineering group.
Critics such as Mr Fischer raise a number of questions:
First, what is a bank doing straying so far away from financial services,
building an empire in the travel business and helping to shape the future of
the German steel and retail sectors?
Second, is this sort of activity not especially inappropriate for a public
sector institution? Third, could it not all go disastrously wrong with the
onset of recession on Germany? As one former WestLB executive puts it: 'It
is all very well building an empire when times are good . . . but can it
hold together in a slowdown?'
Mr Neuber, who began his working life as an apprentice at the Krupp steel
firm, brushes critics aside. 'I hear them complaining but I don't listen.
'We do not pursue industrial policy, we help companies develop their
strategies. And what we do, we do in order to make money.
'The buying and selling of corporate shareholdings is part and parcel of our
normal banking business, as it is for the large private sector banks. This
form of investment banking has been highly profitable for West LB for many
years.'
Mr Neuber adds that WestLB's industrial participations are only modest
compared with other banks' industrial participations - Deutsche Bank's 28
per cent holding in Daimler-Benz alone eclipses WestLB's entire portfolio.
The difference is that while the Deutsche Bank has adopted a deliberately
low profile in the three years since Mr Hilmar Kopper has been chief
executive, WestLB has hardly ever been out of the headlines. 'There has been
a lot of publicity,' he concedes.
It is unlikely to cease. To the fury of the private banks, WestLB's war
chest received a substantial increase last month when the German banking
authorities allowed WestLB to consolidate its subsidised housing finance
subsidiary, recently acquired from the government of North-Rhine Westphalia.
That gave it DM4bn of 'free' equity just as tough new capital adequacy
requirements came into force.
The private sector banks, which had to hold expensive rights issues to meet
the new requirements, cried foul, complaining that WestLB was getting an
unfair advantage. 'They would say that,' says Mr Neuber. 'They are the
competition.'

FT  25 FEB 93 / 'Delighted' Airtours sees its share price rise by 5p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRTOURS' hostile Pounds 225m bid for rival holiday group, Owners Abroad,
took on renewed urgency yesterday.
This followed the decision by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade secretary, not to
refer the bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The decision marks the end of the phoney war that has accompanied the early
stages of the bid as institutional shareholders have awaited Mr Heseltine's
decision.
Airtours' shares fell on the news before closing up 5p at 302p, while Owners
Abroad shares jumped 13p to 129p.
Airtours' three for eight share offer values each Owners share at 114p and
its partial cash alternative at 110p.
Owners Abroad welcomed Mr Heseltine's decision and Airtours said that it was
'delighted'.
Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad chairman, welcomed the removal of uncertainty
and a return to debate on the underlying value of Owners and its 'excellent
prospects'.
In a written statement , Mr David Crossland, chairman of Airtours, called on
the Owners Abroad's board to 'recommend the offers without delay'.
Mr Klein said Owners Abroad's final defence document, due by Friday, would
focus on the fact that Airtours has under-valued Owners' worth and potential
and that there is great promise in the proposed partnership between Owners
and Thomas Cook, the travel and financial services company, controlled by
Westdeutsche Landesbank, the German state bank.
City observers, said the proposed tie-up called on Thomas Cook to make a
minimal financial commitment of less than Pounds 2m for its 10 per cent
equity stake in Owners Abroad.
If Thomas Cook were to try to take even a blocking stake, it would have to
commit a greater amount of funds to the partnership.

FT  25 FEB 93 / BAe confident in spite of Pounds 1.2bn pre-tax loss: Chief
executive confirms no plans to dispose of Rover car business which reduced
its loss to Pounds 49m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE entered the record books yesterday with the biggest annual
loss in UK corporate history. The loss of Pounds 1.2bn before tax included
exceptional costs of Pounds 1bn, as forecast last year. However, BAe also
lost Pounds 75m at the operating level, compared with a Pounds 212m profit
the year before.
Mr John Cahill, BAe's chairman, said that while the position was 'clearly
unsatisfactory', he was much more confident about the outlook than six
months ago. 'We have delivered on our objectives for 1992,' he said.
These were to secure the future of the European Fighter Aircraft, to
establish a joint venture in regional aircraft with Taiwan Aerospace, and to
push forward the Al Yamamah defence contract with Saudi Arabia.
The Rover car business reduced its loss from Pounds 52m to Pounds 49m, in
spite of a 10 per cent fall in output to 421,000 units. Rover had reduced
its break-even production level to 440,000 units a year. This year's target
for break-even was 400,000; however, that was proving difficult to achieve.
Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, said: 'We cannot hope for help from
any immediate recovery in the UK economy.' He confirmed there were no plans
to dispose of Rover when its five-year agreement with the UK government
expires in August.
Mr Cahill said BAe was not worried about the threat of takeover. 'We might
look very attractive in terms of price, but you don't know what you're
getting,' he said. 'That's our poison pill'.
Mr Evans said relations with Lord Weinstock of GEC, rumoured as a predator,
were amicable: 'Arnold (Weinstock) is an honourable guy. He tells us that
unless we take any actions harmful to him, he has no intentions of moving
against us.'
Mr Evans dismissed President Clinton's attacks on European subsidies for
Airbus, in which BAe has a 20 per cent stake.
The company confirmed that Airbus was in talks with American Airlines about
the possible cancellation of an order. 'If these aircraft come back to us,
we will re-market them,' Mr Evans said. 'At present, we're playing a game of
brinkmanship.'
Mr Richard Lapthorne, BAe's finance director, said the group was comfortably
within its banking covenants. 'There could well be a constraint on the pace
at which we move in managing our portfolio of businesses. But as managers,
we're used to operating within constraints anyway.'
The final dividend was 4p per share, making 7p for the year (25p). BAe's
shares rose 13p to 265p.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Invesco MIM hires 'City's policeman' to review compliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BOB Wilkinson, the former head of surveillance at the London Stock
Exchange, has been hired by Invesco MIM to review the fund management
group's procedures for ensuring it does not breach City regulations.
Invesco said Mr Wilkinson had been employed as a consultant to help Mr
Charles Brady, the group's chief executive, improve the group's compliance
procedures.
The company has faced criticism from Mirror Group pensioners for allowing
the late Mr Robert Maxwell to take pensioners' assets which were under
Invesco's control. The company has been sued by Mirror Group pensioners.
Mr Wilkinson, who was nicknamed 'the City's policeman' until he retired just
over a year ago, is being encouraged in his review by IMRO, regulator of the
investment management industry, to whom he will show his report. He is
expected to concentrate on assessing whether there are appropriate checks to
prevent any repetition of incidents such as the transfer of shares to Mr
Maxwell. His review could take from three months to a year, according to an
Invesco employee.
Meanwhile Mr Brady is examining all aspects of Invesco's business. He is
expected by employees to split the group into three divisions and to replace
most non-executive directors at the annual meeting in June.
The chairman, Lord Stevens, announced last July, when he handed over his
executive duties to Mr Brady, that he intended to resign as chairman this
year.
In January, Invesco admitted it was under investigation by IMRO and could
face disciplinary proceedings. In October 1991 Invesco was fined Pounds
75,000 for poor administration of personal equity plans.
Invesco is one of the four biggest UK fund managers, with around Pounds 34bn
under management. However two thirds of its funds are managed in the US. The
group's US operations were described by an Invesco employee as 'clean as a
whistle'.
Mr Wilkinson's review will concentrate on the UK operations. When he was the
Exchange's director in charge of surveillance, his inquiries into National
Westminster Bank's role in the Blue Arrow rights issue in 1987 led to the
subsequent DTI investigation of the affair.

FT  25 FEB 93 / BA likely to pay Virgin Pounds 10m-Pounds 15m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS is today expected to agree to pay Virgin Atlantic Pounds
10m-Pounds 15m in compensation for the commercial damage inflicted on its
business by BA's 'dirty tricks' campaign.
The payment, which is likely to include Pounds 3m in settlement of a
five-year-old aircraft maintenance dispute, forms part of a proposed
agreement which both sides hope will end a period of open warfare and begin
a new relationship.
The deal should be finalised today against the background of threats by
Virgin to pursue its case against BA through the US and European courts.
Virgin, which would drop the threats if a deal is concluded, claims that
anti-trust action launched against BA in the US could net as much as Dollars
100m in compensation.
BA's covert campaign to undermine Virgin has already cost Britain's national
carrier Pounds 610,000 in libel fees and several million pounds in legal
costs.
In the aftermath of the out-of-court settlement of the libel case last
month, Lord King departed six months early as BA chairman, the board was
reshuffled and the company introduced a new code of conduct to ensure
similar malpractices were not repeated.
It had been hoped that a deal would be agreed yesterday but last night
lawyers were still discussing new ground rules for competition between the
airlines.
It is understood agreement had been reached on the use of computer-based
airline information but that difficulties remained over BA's claimed right
to win away Virgin's passengers.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Brussels aid to help ailing industrial areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission intends to devote more resources to poor and
industrially declining regions, including Merseyside in the UK, and eastern
Germany.
The Commission yesterday adopted a plan to try to arrest industrial decline
as part of the Ecu141.5bn (Pounds 117bn) EC structural aid programme agreed
at December's Edinburgh summit.
The traditional industrial regions of Merseyside, Hainaut in southern
Belgium, and the eastern Lander, or states, of Germany will be entitled to
the higher levels of funding until now directed to backward regions and the
poorest member states. Highlands and Islands in Scotland qualifies for the
higher funding too.
Brussels also wants to reform the Social Fund, currently used for training
both young and long-term unemployed, in order to target part of its war
chest to industries facing structural change. The aim is to retrain workers
before they become unemployed - a move seen by some members including the UK
as a disguised industrial policy. The Social Fund was worth Ecu7.2bn out of
a total EC structural aid budget of Ecu63bn in the 1989-93 period.
The Commission is also seeking more flexibility in the criteria for
allocating aid to 'Objective 2' areas, or industrial regions in decline. The
plan is to channel money to areas in danger of developing high unemployment
because they which are vulnerable to big factory closures.
This more direct attention to industrial restructuring was largely ignored
at the Edinburgh summit, when the 12 agreed the 'Delors 2' package on EC
finances for 1994-99. When the package was put together last year, the aim
was to target funds towards industries like defence, electronics, cars and
textiles, to improve EC competitiveness.
Although the emphasis now is on preserving and creating jobs, a row over
whether this constitutes market-distorting interventionism can be expected
when the Commission's plans go to the Council of Ministers.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Mulroney resigns to lift party's poll hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BRIAN MULRONEY, Canada's prime minister, announced his resignation
yesterday in an effort to bolster the chances of his Progressive
Conservative party in the general election due to be held later this year.
'I look forward to the enthusiasm and renewal which only new leadership can
bring,' he said.
Despite winning elections in 1984 and 1988, Mr Mulroney has become the most
unpopular leader in recent Canadian history, battered by recession and
opposition to government spending cuts. According to recent opinion polls,
fewer than one in five Canadians would vote for the Conservatives.
Mr Mulroney, 53, will remain in office until the Conservatives choose a new
leader at a party convention, probably in June. The frontrunners to succeed
him include Ms Kim Campbell, the defence minister, Mr Michael Wilson, who
holds the trade and industry portfolio, and Mr Perrin Beatty, the
communications minister.
Uncertainty over Canada's political outlook pushed the Canadian dollar down
sharply initially on foreign exchange markets, although it later recovered
some ground. The currency closed at 79.38 US cents, against 79.80 at
Tuesday's close.
In a view echoed by many political observers, Mr Mulroney said in a letter
to the party president yesterday that history's verdict of his years in
office 'will be a supportive one'. His initiatives have included free trade
agreements with the US and Mexico, privatisation of several Crown
corporations and the introduction of a controversial sales tax.
The Mulroney government twice achieved agreement among the 10 provinces on
constitutional reforms designed to cement relations between francophone
Quebec and the nine English-speaking provinces. Both agreements however,
proved impossible to implement.
The ability of his party to capitalise on Mr Mulroney's departure will
depend largely on its choice of a successor.
Mr Mulroney is a Quebecker and managed to command support both in English
Canada and his native francophone province. His successor will almost
certainly come from another part of the country. None of the present
leadership contenders has established a strong following in Quebec.
Mr Mulroney gave no hint of his future intentions. A lawyer by training, he
was the head of the Canadian subsidiary of a US iron ore mining company
before entering politics in the early 1980s.
He was mentioned in 1991 as a possible candidate for United Nations
secretary-general.
