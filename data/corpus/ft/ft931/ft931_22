FT  23 FEB 93 / Survey of Ontario (3): Likeable firefighter - Bernard Simon
meets the provincial premier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<TEXT>
MENTION the name Bob Rae to almost anyone in Ontario, from taxi drivers to
business leaders, and the response is unlikely to be flattering.
The taxi driver will probably give a snort of disgust. The business leader
will wonder aloud how such a likeable, intelligent man could preside over
such a mess.
Mr Rae readily acknowledges that times have been tough since he took over as
provincial premier after the New Democratic Party's surprise election win in
Sept 1990. But he also insists that criticism of his social-democratic
government is exaggerated.
In dealing with the province's business community, Mr Rae says: 'I find a
dramatic contrast between the rhetoric levels that I see in the newspapers
and hear in public speeches, and what people say to me in person.'
He ticks off several initiatives taken by his government which have
benefited business. Corporate income tax rates have gone down. Donations to
universities for research and development are now tax deductible.
The government is shaking up the provincial ministry of trade and industry
to provide better service for both local and foreign investors. In
particular, Mr Rae cites his government's strenuous efforts to contain the
health-care budget, which makes up almost a third of total government
spending. The health ministry's outlays for the year to March 31 1993 are
expected to be about CDollars 152m less than the CDollars 17bn projected in
last April's budget.
Bob Rae's background hardly fits the picture of a left-wing ideologue
painted by his political opponents and by many in the province's business
community.
A boyish-looking 44 years old, his father was a senior Canadian diplomat,
and he was educated at private schools in Ottawa, Washington and Geneva
before winning a Rhodes scholarship to Balliol College at Oxford.
Many outsiders consider him among the more pragmatic members of the NDP
government. But whether through inexperience or commitment to the party's
backbone of trade unions and social activists, the premier has found himself
in one firefight after another with business.
The most bruising battle has been over a new labour law, which among other
things, forbids companies from hiring replacement workers during a strike.
The government has also clashed with business over plans to reform the
motor-vehicle insurance system, the travails of Ontario Hydro, environmental
policy and the North American free trade agreement.
Ms Susan Murray, a lobbyist for several business groups, says that Mr Rae
and his NDP colleagues have been chastened by these battles. 'We're finding
them very different to deal with now than a year ago,' Ms Murray says.
'They're now not only looking for solutions on the economic side, but also
looking for investment.' She says that the government is increasingly
seeking advice from business leaders.
Ms Lyn Macleod, leader of the opposition Liberal party, is less charitable.
Ms Macleod still detects 'a profound distrust' of the private sector in
government circles.
While she acknowledges Mr Rae's efforts in containing health-care costs, she
notes that spending is increasingly being directed towards the non-profit
sector and away from business interests, such as privately-run medical
laboratories, retirement homes and child-care centres.
Mr Rae emphasises the importance of 'partnerships' between business and
government in such fields as worker training.
Asked whether tax increases are likely to feature in the forthcoming
provincial budget, he says that 'I don't want to see anything done in the
budget which is going to create competitive difficulties for Canadian
business.'
But Bob Rae will be judged by deeds rather than words. Despite some signs of
thaw in government-business relations, Ontario's captains of commerce and
industry have to be convinced that the NDP is out to help rather than
hinder.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Survey of Ontario (5): Europeans seem happier -
Dissatisfaction has driven some companies south of the Canadian border, but
others are doing fine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOANS and groans about doing business in Ontario have not discouraged
some foreign companies from investing in the province - and expressing
satisfaction with the results.
Chrysler's mini-van plant in Windsor and its car assembly line in Bramalea,
north-west of Toronto, contribute about a third of the company's total North
American output, a much higher proportion than General Motors' or Ford's
Canadian operations.
Chrysler chose the Bramalea factory to build its new LH mid-sized car. In
contrast to the cuts being made by other motor manufacturers, Mr Yves
Landry, president of Chrysler Canada, said recently that the future of 3,000
workers at the Bramalea plant 'looks bright indeed.' The factory, which
turned out 260,000 vehicles in 1992, added a second shift last December.
Toronto is home to the only restaurants in North America owned by Movenpick,
the German-Swiss chain.
Movenpick's newest outlet, in the atrium of one of the city's office towers,
has been a spectacular success since it opened last year. The self-service
restaurant, which has the feel of a bustling marketplace, serves 3,500 to
4,000 people a day, each of whom spends an average of CDollars 10.
Mr Johannes Karbach, Movenpick's operations director, says Toronto's big
advantage is its cosmopolitan population. 'We're not only fighting for
people who have roast beef and mashed potato,' he says.
But the return on Movenpick's CDollars 7m investment is still razor-thin.
According to Mr Karbach, food and other basic supplies are competitively
priced, but Movenpick has difficulty passing on steep increases in
electricity rates and municipal services.
Lear Seating, a US-owned car seat manufacturer, is currently building its
fourth factory in Oakville, on the outskirts of Toronto.
The site was chosen mainly because of its proximity to a Ford assembly line,
which will be its main customer. But Lear did look just across the border,
around Buffalo, New York, before settling on Oakville. Besides the location,
a company official says, Lear was attracted by an abundance of semi-skilled
labour. He adds that government agencies were 'very receptive' and worked
closely with Lear to smooth the way for construction of the 90,000 sq ft
factory.
The Ontario government is becoming much more aggressive in fighting for new
investment, according to Mr Peter Barnes, deputy minister for trade and
industry. 'The Japanese have learnt the value of stamina, we have to learn
it too,' says Mr Barnes, as he reels off details of his ministry's new
'customer-oriented' approach to investors.
Mr Barnes also says that Ontario's drawcards include political and economic
stability, the quality of life and a productive workforce. European firms,
in particular, appreciate that Toronto has a more cosmopolitan ambience than
most parts of the US.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Survey of Ontario (2): Stock exchange seeks more local
investors - The ranks of banks seem a little crowded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By THERESA BYRNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORONTO has not only overtaken Montreal as Canada's financial centre, but is
now home to almost all the biggest organisations in the financial services
industry.
The city has also attracted about 50 Canadian subsidiaries of foreign banks,
together with a growing number of North American, European and Japanese
investment managers, and a long list of foreign-controlled insurance
companies. The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) accounts for more than
three-quarters of the value of shares traded on Canada's five exchanges.
But the liveliness of the TSE trading floor will soon be history. The floor
will be converted into offices when the TSE completes its transition to a
fully-automated trading system, next January. The exchange will then take
its place among the 'most sophisticated trading systems in the world,'
according to Mr Pearce Bunting, its president.
The transition to a fully-automated floor has not been without problems. The
project was originally scheduled to be completed in early 1993. The deadline
was moved to the end of this year, then to early 1994. The delays have
arisen partly to give the TSE time to respond to suggestions made by
members.
Reliability is also an important concern. The TSE is anxious to avoid a
repetition of the criticism levelled at it last spring when problems with
new software closed the floor for four hours.
In 1992, the TSE traded 7.3bn shares, up 25.5 per cent from 1991. The value
of shares traded last year was CDollars 76.2bn, up 12.4 percent. Preliminary
figures show that trading on all Canadian exchanges rose 12.9 per cent to
CDollars 101.8bn in 1992. Upgrading the trading system has been a high - and
sometimes controversial - priority for Mr Bunting since he took over as TSE
president in 1977. A Computer Assisted Trading System, known as Cats, was
installed when the exchange moved to its current quarters in First Canadian
Place in 1983. (The Cats system was sold to exchanges in Brussels, Paris and
Madrid.)
The prospect of automation has dramatically lowered the cost of a seat on
the TSE. Previously, a seat entitled a member to only 6 traders. So the more
traders a firm wanted, the more seats it required. But the disappearance of
the trading floor means that each member will need only one. Seats changed
hands at a peak of about CDollars 370,000 in 1988, but the price has now
tumbled to roughly CDollars 50,000. A growing number of smaller 'niche'
firms is joining the TSE, Mr Bunting says.
The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's pension fund became the exchange's
first (and so far, only) institutional member late last year when it
purchased a seat on the exchange. Mr Jerome Lapointe, manager of the CBC
pension fund, said that lower membership fees and the opportunity to save on
brokerage commission were considerations in the decision to obtain a TSE
seat.
The TSE hopes to improve its appeal to investors with the introduction of a
third, medium-level index, to be composed largely of the 100 stocks with the
biggest market value. Currently, the TSE's performance is measured by its
TSE 35 and the more broadly-based TSE 300 composite index of stocks. Mr
Gordon Walker, director of derivative marketing, calls the TSE 300 the
'index of investor sentiment,' or a Canadian version of the Dow Jones index
on Wall Street.
But the TSE 300 includes many stocks which are not traded by the larger
institutions. The new TSE 100 will more closely reflect what money managers
in Canada are buying and selling, Mr Walker says.
Efforts to reach smaller investors include a 'mini-exchange' at a financial
trade show held in Toronto each February. Newcomers to the market can buy or
sell up to 100 shares of a select group of stocks at a fraction of the
regular brokerage fees. At last year's 'mini-exchange', members of the
public traded a record CDollars 2.9m in the 10 shares on offer.
Instead of trying to compete with other North American exchanges for
international capital flows, the TSE is focusing most of its attention on
Canadian investors. 'Our general view at the moment is to concentrate our
marketing on our existing products and try to improve their liquidity,' says
Mr Bunting.
Foreign financial institutions have taken a higher profile in the Toronto
securities market through their purchase of stakes in local firms. Deutsche
Bank, SG Warburg, James Capel and Sanwa Bank are among those which have
joined forces with Canadian firms over the past five years. Mr Patrick Mars,
president of Bunting Warburg, in which SG Warburg has a 50 per cent stake,
says that the link with a well-known international money manager has
broadened his firm's base. It has enabled the firm to expand its activity in
the primary financing area, managing a number of issues. Moreover, Mr Mars
says that the alliance has given the Canadian dealer greater access to
research worldwide, and improved its ability to advise Canadians on
investing overseas.
Many other financial institutions have not found life in Toronto so
rewarding. Some foreign-owned banks which set up operations following the
deregulation of the 1980s are struggling in the face of an unexpectedly
fierce competitive environment.
'The Canadian market is pretty over-banked as it is,' says Laurence Booth,
professor of finance at the University of Toronto. 'The (foreign banks) that
are in trouble are the ones which haven't got a focus.'
Insurance companies in Ontario worry about additional costs which would
follow the implementation of proposed auto insurance reforms in Bill 164.
Under the new rules, the provincial government has projected a 4 per cent
rise in costs which, among other things, would expand accident victims'
ability to sue for pain and suffering. But an Insurance Bureau of Canada
study predicts that costs could rise by between 12 and 15 per cent.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Survey of Ontario (1): Running to catch up with reality -
Living standards are still high, but Ontarians find themselves in less
comfortable circumstances since recession hit the province
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NASTY WINTERS aside, the 10m inhabitants of the Canadian province of Ontario
enjoy a lifestyle which most other parts of the world can only dream of.
Generous social security, free medical care of the highest quality, an
ultra-modern telephone service, superb public transport, a low crime rate .
. . such are the benefits of living in Canada's industrial heartland - the
wedge of North America squeezed between the Great Lakes and Hudson Bay.
High living standards have given Ontario the luxury of breaking new ground
in public policy. It is a pioneer in pay-equity, which seeks to provide
equal rewards to men and women for work of equal value. An Environmental
Bill of Rights, now under discussion, would give the public a degree of
power over polluters which is matched by few - if any - other national or
regional government.
Ontario even copes well with its frigid winters. Office workers and shoppers
in central Toronto can stroll warmly through miles of underground malls. The
Rideau Canal in Ottawa becomes a five-mile skating rink for commuters and
tourists between January and March.
And yet, for all its attractions and its leading-edge policies, Ontario is
not a happy place these days. Far from feeling comfortable, the province is
struggling to come to grips with some harsh realities.
The problem is summed up by Mr Peter Barnes, the province's most senior
civil servant, who is spearheading an overhaul of the industry and trade
ministry: 'Ontario has had a very easy time of it since 1945; it was a
complacent place. Now, we're having to run to catch up.'
Ontario has traditionally been the object of envy and resentment among
Canadians in other parts of the country. Contributing 40 per cent of the
country's output, it is the Canadian base for Detroit's Big Three carmakers
and the hub of Canada's steel industry. Ontario has drawn far more foreign
investment than any of the other nine provinces - including all but one of
the Asian car plants in Canada.
Toronto, the provincial capital, is Canada's financial centre; site of the
country's principal stock exchange, the head offices of five of the six
biggest banks, and several dozen foreign banks.
Mining and forestry have been the backbone of many smaller Ontario
communities. A large chunk of the world's nickel is mined in Sudbury, north
of Toronto. Gold and zinc, among other minerals, are found in abundance. But
many of the industries and resources which for years seemed to give Ontario
a competitive edge have lately turned out to be a millstone.
No region of Canada (and few anywhere else) enjoyed stronger economic
expansion in the early and mid-1980s. Real growth soared at an annual rate
of 6 per cent between 1983 and 1988. But Ontario's 'rust-belt', its service
and resource industries have also been hit hardest by the recession. The
economy contracted in 1990 and 1991 and barely grew last year.
Dofasco and Stelco, the pillars of the province's steel industry, have
racked up combined losses of CDollars 1.4bn in the past three years.
Toronto's office vacancy rate of almost 25 per cent is about five points
above the national average.
Slumping prices have devastated low-grade uranium producers, and forced
cutbacks by Inco and Falconbridge, the two nickel mining companies.
Similarly, falling demand and stiffening competition have doomed old and
inefficient newsprint mills. Ontario's structural weaknesses have been
further exposed by the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement and the trend
among North American companies to integrate their US and Canadian
operations.
Investors increasingly compare Ontario not to other provinces in Canada, but
to the states south of the Canadian border. While they may appreciate
Ontario's skilled labour force and its low health-care costs, their
enthusiasm for doing business in the province is dampened these days by high
taxes, ever-tightening environmental and workplace rules, and soaring
electricity costs.
The investment climate has not been helped by a spendthrift Liberal
government, which held office from 1985 to 1990, nor by its more left-wing
New Democratic Party (NDP) successor, which surprised everyone (including
itself) by winning a snap election in September 1990.
Despite the surge in economic growth, the Liberals ran a hefty budget
deficit in all but one of their years in office. The recession's squeeze on
tax revenues pushed up the deficit from CDollars 3bn in the year to March
1991, to almost CDollars 11bn in each of the last two years. The debt burden
has soared to the point where the Province of Ontario has recently had the
dubious distinction of being among the Euromarket's four biggest borrowers.
The present government, backed by labour and social activist groups, has
done little to brighten the business mood in its first two years in office.
Some NDP ministers, drawn from the ranks of organised labour or
special-interest groups, have either been out of their depth or
ideologically antagonistic to management concerns.
'There's a lack of understanding of what government costs do to make
industry uncompetitive,' says Mr Richard Sexton, president of ED Smith, an
Ontario-based food processor which recently hedged its bets by acquiring a
company in Mississippi.
The NDP government proposed - and then backed away from - a government-run
car insurance scheme. But other contentious insurance reforms are still on
the table. For instance, in the interests of gender equality, insurers will
be compelled to quote the same premiums to young male and female drivers,
despite the wide disparity in risk.
Mr Bob Rae, the provincial premier, has unsettled prospective investors with
his strong opposition both to the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement and to
the North American pact, including Mexico, which the federal government
would like to implement in January 1994. The NDP has so far ignored pleas
from business to harmonise the province's sales tax with the federal
government's politically unpopular Goods and Services Tax.
The business community is especially angered by a new labour law which gives
more muscle to trade unions. Among other things, the law known as Bill 40
bans the use of 'replacement' workers during strikes or lockouts. In these
days of just-in-time delivery, the ban means that a work stoppage at a small
components supplier could bring General Motors' or Ford's assembly lines to
a halt.
On the brighter side, the deepening fiscal mess and the loss of jobs appear
to have had a sobering effect on Mr Rae and some of his colleagues. 'There's
no question that necessity is the mother of invention,' Mr Rae said in a
recent interview. 'It's given us a tough framework in which to respond.'
To its credit, the NDP government has begun to crack down on ballooning
health-care costs, which make up about a third of the total provincial
budget. A decision to delay a CDollars 1bn pay-equity plan for the
provincial civil service flies in the face of the NDP's traditional
priorities. Mr Rae has given notice of plans to overhaul welfare programmes,
another costly budget item, linking them more closely with job training.
Transfers to universities, hospitals, schools and municipalities have barely
risen in the past year.
Meanwhile, new brooms are starting to sweep through Ontario Hydro, the
beleaguered power utility, and the trade and industry ministry, responsible
for attracting new investment to the province.
These signs of a shift from ideology to reality at Queen's Park, the seat of
government in Toronto, have yet to translate into an improved climate among
the business community or the public at large. An accelerating economy
should give the province a lift this year and next. But several years of
disciplined and far-sighted government are also required if Ontario is fully
to recover its reputation.

FT  23 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities hold steady in nervous trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUDDEN FEARS that ICI will hit the stock market with its Pounds 1bn rights
call this week, rather than waiting for completion of the planned demerger,
dominated the UK equity sector yesterday. ICI shares fell heavily but failed
to drag down the rest of the stock market which was helped by a Pounds
200m-plus trading programme from Smith New Court, weighted on the buy side
and effectively the largest such deal seen in London for several months.
The setback in ICI, which took about 3.8 per cent off the share price,
reflected growing worries over funding prospects for Zeneca, the proposed
pharmaceuticals and high tech part of the planned demerger. Pharmaceutical
stocks continued to fall yesterday in New York and on Continental European
bourses as well as in London. A decision from ICI on fund-raising is likely
on Thursday when it reports trading results.
The stock market moved nervously in narrow margins throughout the session,
rallying towards the close as the trading programme, a portfolio of share
trades by an institution via a marketmaking firm, passed across the trading
screens. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,838.3 for a net loss of
1.7 points.
Seaq volume increased smartly at the close as traders caught the hint of the
large programme trade, to record a final total of 553.2m shares against
Friday's 532m. A sharp jump in non-FT-SE deals to around 65 per cent of the
Seaq total confirmed that activity had increased in the second-liners where
the unidentified investment institution appeared to be switching out of the
cyclical sectors and into the defensive stocks.
Although the FT-SE Mid 250 Index was 0.7 off at 3,049.0, there were gains
among utilities and food retailers, matched by falls in breweries and
chemicals.
The steadiness of the market in the face of the fall in ICI was helped by
the favourable outcome of the rights issues announced recently by Asda and
Burton; Asda's Pounds 347m issue received 94 per cent acceptances and
Burton's Pounds 163m a 90 per cent take-up. Traders believe that the stock
market is prepared to further rights calls - even the large one predicted
from ICI - but fund managers are likely to be hoarding cash balances in
anticipation of such developments.
There was a strong performance from the bank sector where some analysts are
hoping for better news on the domestic debt situation when National
Westminster reports progress today. This optimism flowed over into the
property sector which extended the recovery seen since the turn of the year.
The continued slippage in sterling was seen in the stock market as a further
sign that the next base rate cut will come at the time of the UK Budget, now
only weeks away. The consensus on equity prospects is that share prices will
drift up towards FT-SE 2,900 although economic recovery in the UK may be
'very weak', according to Mr Peter Thorne at Nikko.
The strategy team at Strauss Turnbull, noting that the equity market found
support at just below FT-SE 2,800, said yesterday that the important
corporate results now pending could provide evidence of the benefits for
overseas earning companies of the devaluation of sterling since its
departure from the the ERM network.

FT  23 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Funding worry hits ICI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERN over the threat of a huge rights issue sent ICI shares plunging
yesterday morning and at first unsettled the rest of the stock market.
Analysts predicted a turbulent few days ahead for ICI shares prior to the
group's results meeting on Thursday where a decision has been promised over
the fate of the proposed demerger.
Should the move get the go-ahead, the market believes it is likely to be
accompanied by a cash-raising offer with speculation in the press that it
could be a Pounds 1bn rights issue. There were other suggestions, including
a bond issue, as a way of raising the money. Whatever the fund-raising
route, ICI shares responded badly to the speculation. The shares slumped 42
to 1076p, although turnover was a moderate 3m.
NatWest strong
The best individual performance from a generally strong bank sector came
from National Westminster (NatWest), scheduled to announce preliminary
results this morning.
'The market is looking for some good news from NatWest,' said one leading
marketmaker.
NatWest shares closed 14 higher at 459p, a rise of 2.92 per cent, against a
1.8 per cent jump in the FT Actuaries Banks Index and a marginal decline in
the Footsie 100 index. Turnover in NatWest was a hefty 5.9m shares, well
above usual levels of activity.
The shares' outperformance came as the market finally disregarded recent
suggestions of a heavy rights issue, and instead responded favourably to
talk that fund raising via a convertible bond issue could be on the cards.
There was also a hint that the bank may well write back provisions
previously made. Estimates of NatWest pre-tax profits ranged from Pounds
375m to Pounds 500m, against last year's Pounds 110m.
Other banks performed well, with renewed takeover speculation driving TSB up
5 1/2 to 174p on 6.2m traded. Lloyds, one of the market's favourite to
launch a takeover bid for TSB, rose 9 to 520p.
Barclays, due to announce preliminary numbers on March 4, added 7 to 449p.
HSBC, helped again by a good showing by the Hong Kong market, rose 6 to
587p. Abbey National, still boosted by recent broker buy recommendations,
climbed 8 to 385p.
Hammerson hints
The property sector perked up as bid talk was heard around Hammerson,
sending the shares smartly forward. Fellow property concern British Land was
said to be eyeing the group, with weekend press reports suggesting that an
approach had been made through Hammerson's largest shareholder, Standard
Life. This had been reportedly rebuffed, but analysts suggested that British
Land may have only been temporarily put off.
There were other rumours that the focus on Hammerson may have revived US
interest in the stock which surfaced in December and boosted the shares.
Mr Graham Stanley at NatWest Securities was sceptical over a British Land
bid. 'While Hammerson's net asset value is forecast to decline from Pounds
6.37 to Pounds 4.74 this year, and the shares might look cheap, the cash
flow implications of the bid at this level have little appeal,' he said.
Hammerson A shares jumped 10 to 304p.
Elsewhere, Land Securities added 11 to 485p. UBS Phillips and Drew moved
from a sell to a hold but retained its negative long-term stance on the
stock. MEPC gained 7 to 377p.
Rights success
There was large turnover in Burton and Asda as the remainder of their rights
issues were placed. The placing of the rump of the Asda issue was understood
to have been done at 64p by broker Morgan Grenfell, followed by a 27m
placing by Cazenove in Burton at 74p. Asda's issue was just over 94 per cent
subscribed. Its 3-for-10 at 53p raised Pounds 347m. The shares closed one
quarter of a penny off at 64p. Burton's received over 90 per cent
acceptances for its 1-for-4 issue raising Pounds 163m. The shares lost 1 1/2
to 75 1/2 p.
Welsh Water's Pounds 56m acquisition of Acer Group, the engineering
consultants, was well received by the market where Welsh Water shares rose 7
to 519p.
Other water stocks moved ahead strongly, responding, according to dealers,
to some big buying via yesterday programme trade activity. Anglian jumped 9
to 519p, North West 5 to 497p, Thames 7 to 519p and Yorkshire 8 to 558p.
News of Pounds 131m-worth of losses from currency speculation carried out by
Royal Dutch/Shell's 50 per cent owned Showa Shell Sekiyu associate,
triggered a flurry of selling pressure in Shell stock which retreated to
close 6 off at 575p. The selling took place during hectic dealings which saw
5.8m Shell traded. One analyst described the losses as 'a major irritation
but not a fundamental problem; the market didn't like this news one bit and
it provided some of the sceptics with a good excuse to sell the stock and
lock in good profits.' BP, on the other hand, drew strength from the good
performance of crude oil prices, the shares settling 4 1/2 ahead at 270p.
Specialists ascribed the rise in the share price to another bout of strong
buying from US investors; 'I wouldn't be surprised to see the US content of
BP shares rising to 24 per cent in the very near future,' said one analyst.
Brent crude moved up over 30 cents a barrel to Dollars 18.60, the highest
level since before the latest Opec meeting in Vienna. Detailed news on the
make up of production cuts in said to be imminent.
Lasmo eased 3 to 176p with aggressive activity in the shares attributed to
programme trade business rather than speculative business.
Continuing speculation that British Airways may soon be forced to have a
rights issue weakened the shares and they gave up 4 to 284p.
Shares in Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel were wanted and they moved 17
ahead to 497p, on hopes that its long running dispute with tunnel
constructor TML may be nearing a settlement.
Pipes and fittings maker Victaulic was boosted by favourable weekend press
comment. The shares closed 10 up at 364p. Demand was also seen for VSEL and
the shares also moved 10 ahead to 600p.
Profit-taking halted the recent advance of GKN leaving the shares 5 lighter
at 475p, while it was continued fears that a leading customer would soon
announce a cancellation of orders that left TI Group 6 lighter at 291p.
British Aerospace shed a penny to 261p, ahead of figures tomorrow. A loss of
around Pounds 1bn is predicted for the year to December 1992.
Shares in engineering company Wheway, which last week became the subject of
a Pounds 14.3m hostile bid from investment group McLeod Russel Holdings,
hardened a penny to 10 1/4 p, after it was revealed that McLeod had raised
its stake in the bid target from 4 to 7 per cent.
A buy recommendation from NatWest Markets helped Vinten Group jump 23 to
354p.
Hints of imminent news of an expected merger involving Union Discount saw
the latter's shares move up 6 to 115p. Cater Allen, which already held a
disclosable stake in Unions, jumped 19 to 459p. Gerrard &amp; National raced up
10 to 424p.
Royal Insurance attracted keen two-way interest, eventually settling 3 1/2
off at 287 1/2 p ahead of Thursday's preliminary figures which are expected
to reveal sharply reduced losses of around Pounds 115m and a dividend total
of 5p. Insurance broker Sedgwick managed a minor gain at 170p in front of
this morning's preliminary numbers which should see profits in the region of
Pounds 55m, down from last time's Pounds 82.4m and a halved dividend.
The resignation of Mr Neil Redding, a director of Southern Business Group,
following a newspaper article, saw the latter's shares slide 17 to 113p.

FT  23 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears of a Pounds 1bn rights issue in the market together with a general
lack of buying interest led to an exceptionally quiet day in the
derivatives, writes Joel Kibazo.
In futures, the March contract on the FT-SE opened strongly at 2,838. An
initial bout of buying took the contract to 2,846, which turned out to be
the high of the day. But talk of a rights issue from ICI unsettled the
futures and with the drying up of the earlier buying, March drifted lower.
It fell to the day's low of 2,829 over the lunch time period.
A firm Wall Street helped the contract recover some of the earlier falls and
March closed at 2,842, up 5 on Friday's close and at a premium to cash of
about 6 points. Turnover was poor reaching only 4,886 contracts by the
close.
The traded options sector was equally quiet and saw volume of only 20,781
lots. The business in the FT-SE 100 index accounted for 6,917 contracts with
the March 2950 calls the busiest series. The Euro FT-SE 100 index was very
dull with only 273 lots dealt by the close.
Among the stock options, trading in BTR was particularly heavy and volume
rose to 3,162 contracts. The Majority of the trades were carried out in the
August 500 calls in which 1,182 lots were dealt.
This was followed by Fisons with total volume of 1,445 contracts.

FT  23 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Biotechnology sell-off hits
OTC market

Wall Street
BIG BOARD equity prices posted strong gains yesterday afternoon, but the
advance masked a drop in the healthcare sector, while a sell-off in
biotechnology stocks depressed the over-the-counter market, writes Karen
Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 20.81 higher at 3,342.99. The more
broadly based Stan dard&amp;Poor's 500 was up 1.03 at 435.25, while the Amex
composite was down 3.09 at 399.29, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 11.19 to
652.42. Trading volume was heavy on the NYSE with more than 320m shares
changing hands. Rises narrowly outnumbered declines by 1,048 to 938.
On Friday, the Dow firmed 19.99 to close at 3,322.18 after a week which had
seen wild fluctuations following President Bill Clinton's first budget plan.
Healthcare issues took a battering on the NYSE, as well as in Nasdaq
trading. A number of drug com pany stocks hit 52-week lows yesterday in
active trading including Bristol-Myers Squibb, which fell Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 53 7/8 , Johnson &amp; Johnson dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 39 and
Pfizer fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 54.
Merck slid Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 36 5/8 . On Friday, an advisory committee
of the Food and Drug Administration recommended a broader indication for use
of Merck's Vasotec ACE inhibitor.
Among bank stocks, Mellon Bank firmed Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 57 7/8 after
the brokers Alex Brown started coverage of the stock with a 'strong buy'
rating, reflecting the company's potential for growth.
Philip Morris tumbled Dollars 3-1/2 to Dollars 64-1/2, a 52-week low, in
hectic trading. The price erosion follows concern about higher excise taxes
on cigarettes.
JC Penney rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 74 7/8 after an analyst at Bear
Stearns upgraded his rating on the stock to 'buy' from 'hold'. The analyst
expects JC Pen ney to gain market shares as a low priced mall operator fol
lowing Sears, Roebuck's deci sion to get out of the catalogue business.
Among other retailers, Sears added Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 53 7/8 , Wal-Mart
eased Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 60 3/4 and Wool worth added Dollars  1/8 to
Dollars 27 3/8 .
In Nasdaq trading, traders became nervous after Synergen posted
disappointing research data on its Antril sepsis drug. A number of analysts
down- graded ratings on the Colora do-based drug developer after Synergen
said the results did not match earlier trials.
The stock plunged Dollars 28 5/8 to Dollars 13 1/2 , significantly below its
previous 52-week low of Dollars 31 3/4 .
The Synergen sell-off drove other Nasdaq biotech issues lower in very heavy
trading, with Amgen dropping Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 41 1/2 , a 52-week
low, Chiron falling Dollars 5 1/8 to Dollars 45 5/8 and US Healthcare losing
Dollars 4 to Dollars 39 1/2 .
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed higher in moderately active trading, boosted by strong
gains in industrial products, paper and forest products and pipelines.
Based on preliminary data, the 300 composite index was up 21.36 points, or
0.62per cent, to 3,447.67, with advances leading declines 350 to 256.
Volume rose slightly to 39.8m shares from 39.0m shares Friday, and trading
value was CDollars 397m compared with CDollars 371.8m.
Air Canada was unchanged at 2.70 after reporting that its 1992 loss widened
to CDollars 6.13 a share from CDollars 2.94 in 1991.

FT  23 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Astra surprises with 2.7% fall
after results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHARMACEUTICAL stocks came under renewed pressure yesterday, partly on
worries over US proposals to regulate prices, writes Our Markets Staff.
STOCKHOLM went negative on Astra, even although the pharmaceutical group
reported better than expected 1992 results and the B shares lost SKr19 to
SKr675 in high turnover. Mr Peter Tron, senior manager at Unibank in London,
commented that some investors may have taken account of the significantly
large contribution that foreign exchange gains made to the figures, while
others may have been disappointed at the absence of a scrip issue and
ignored the 60 per cent rise in earnings per share.
The Affarsvarlden general index was up 3.50 to 996.00 at the close but, in
post-close trading in London, further selling of Astra left the Swedish
component of the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 down 21.48 at 943.60.
ZURICH was also undermined by some heavy selling of pharmaceutical stocks,
particularly by US investors. The SMI index dipped 11.5 to 2,095.8.
Registered shares in Ciba-Geigy, SFr16 lower at SFr614, led the downtrend,
followed by Roche certificates, which shed SFr80 to SFr4,010.
Conversely, a firm bond market and a new round of cuts in cash bond rates
gave some support to banks and insurers. CS Holding rose SFr10 to SFr1,140
and UBS bearers added SFr2 to SFr943.
FRANKFURT extended last week's themes as business slowed with the start of
the carnival season. Weakness in carmakers and strength in banks almost
cancelled each other out, and the DAX index rose just 3.35 to 1,680.74 in
turnover down from DM9.4bn to DM5.4bn.
Bearish car registration and production data issued late last week left
Volkswagen DM8 lower at DM270.80, Daimler off DM6.20 at DM604.80 and BMW
down DM9.20 at DM503.30. Banks reflected rising interest rate optimism as
the Bundesbank's average bond yield fell 10 basis points to 6.60 per cent;
Deutsche Bank led with a gain of DM12 to DM697.
PARIS opened the new account broadly positive as last week's hopes of lower
European interest rates, given encouragement by good German economic data on
Friday, spurred further buying. The CAC-40 index closed up 22.00 at
1,959.23, but off the day's high of 1,967.14 in turnover of some FFr2.8bn.
Profit-taking in Rhone-Poulenc, on its first day in the index, left the
shares off FFr2 at FFr564 after a high of FFr578 while Elf and Total saw
respective gains of FFr7.80 and FFr3.90 to FFr369.80 and FFr247.90 following
a meeting between the two companies and the Kuwaiti oil minister last week.
MILAN was dealt an early body blow by news that two Fiat executives had been
arrested as part of Italy's ever-widening political bribery scandal.
The market had begun positively on hopes that Prime Minister Giuliano
Amato's weekend cabinet reshuffle would do something to restore damaged
credibility. But the news of the latest arrests brought another attack of
nerves before some bargain hunting later in the day restored a firmer trend
to other sectors. The Comit index ended 1.67 lower at 501.92.
Fiat shares fixed L30 lower at L5,350 and fell back to L5,200 in after-hours
trading. Other shares in the group were similarly hard hit, with Toro
Assicurazioni down L340 lire to L26,000. The financial holding company, Ifi,
firmed L5 to fix at L11,205 before dipping to L10,850 after hours.
AMSTERDAM, which sees results from Unilever today followed by Akzo and Royal
Dutch later in the week, remained resilient with a 0.4 gain in the CBS
Tendency index to 100.1.
Borsumij Wehry, the trading group, picked up Fl 5.00 to Fl 63.50 following
1992 results much exceeded some analysts expectations. Financials were
strong with ING up Fl 1.80 at Fl 64.40.
OSLO moved ahead to close near an eight-month high, helped by weaker
interest rates. The all-share index rose 5.17 to 406.92 in turnover of
NKr445.6m.
Norsk Hydro fell NKr0.5 to NKr163.5 as it cut the 1992 dividend and
attributed sharply higher 1992 net income to a change in its accounting
practices.
COPENHAGEN liked the central bank's one-point cut in discount and key
deposit rates, and the KFX index rose 0.37 to 84.25. Bikuben, the country's
third biggest bank, moved against the trend with a drop of DKr2 to DKr199 on
a DKr1.2bn net loss for 1992.
VIENNA expressed its enthusiasm for interest rate prospects as the ATX index
climbed 19.1, or 2.3 per cent to 837.12. Interest rate-sensitive, insurance
companies and banks have been a strong influence over the past four weeks
but, yesterday, building stocks led the market with Universale up Sch50 to
Sch910 and Strabag - one of the best performers this year - Sch70 better at
Sch1,370.
ISTANBUL put on 4.7 per cent, the market index ending 266.59 higher at
5,922.35 with demand boosted mainly by new deposit rate reductions by state
and private banks.

FT  23 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: US and German influences in conflict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO main elements influenced the direction of the world's senior equity
markets last week: President Bill Clinton's plans for the US economy, and
surprisingly good money supply data from Germany. In aggregate, they
produced a decline in the FT-Actuaries World index in local currency terms;
but if one excludes the US, the index shows a modest rise.
US equity markets tumbled on Tuesday, after Mr Clinton's television
appearance the night before in which he revealed his proposals to increase
taxes, with a loss of more than 80 points in the Dow, leaving it some 4 per
cent below an all-time high seen just two weeks before.
It is uncertain how much of the economic and budgetary proposals will get
through debate in Congress. However, Mr Richard Davidson, European equity
strategist at Morgan Stanley, comments that the current proposals favour
European bonds rather than equities, owing to the broadly negative effect
the Clinton plan will have on economic growth.
This theory was supported last week by rising prices in the US bond market,
which the president himself, as a politician rather than an economist,
interpreted as a positive sign for his planned tax increases.
Germany continued to power ahead last week, although some of the reasons
suggested for this rally began to indicate misguided optimism rather than
sound investment strategy. The general consensus among European analysts is
that the rise in the DAX has been driven by technical factors with little,
if any, thought given to fundamentals. At the beginning of the year, they
say, many fund managers, facing an underweight position in German equities,
started to buy the liquid blue chips such as Daimler, Siemens and Allianz.
But, as some analysts warn, price strength in, for instance, Daimler is not
borne out by earnings prospects for 1993 or, indeed, 1994.

<TEXT>
A SURGE in the yen triggered fears over lower profits at leading exporters
and, as the dollar fell to an all-time low, the Nikkei average lost ground
on selling of export-oriented stocks, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei closed down 189.42 at the day's low of 16,820.61. The index
peaked at 17,058.59 on index-linked buying during the morning session, but
subsided as the dollar fell below Y117.
Volume fell to 200m shares against 221m. Losers led gainers by 687 to 236
with 200 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks lost 10.15
to 1,283.91 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.56 to 1,204.90.
The dollar finally closed at Y116.85 against the yen, Y2.38 down since last
Friday. Comments by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, that a
higher yen was desirable added fuel to buying of the yen, which has been
active during the past two weeks on speculation that the Group of Seven
finance ministers will agree on a concerted move to revalue the Japanese
currency.
Mr Robert Feldman, an economist at Salomon Brothers, said that the yen's
rise would have a neutral effect on the economy, and predicted that it would
move to the Y115 level.
Among leading exporters, Toshiba fell Y15 to Y560 and NEC Y22 to Y610.
Toyota Motor lost Y30 to Y1,340 and Honda Motor Y20 to Y1,270.
However, electric utilities, beneficiaries of a higher yen due to their
dependency on oil imports, gained ground. Tokyo Electric Power advanced Y20
to Y2,590 and Chubu Electric Power rose Y60 to Y2,490.
Showa Shell Sekiyu, an affiliate of Royal Dutch Shell, came under heavy
selling after its announcement of a Y125bn loss stemming from a failure in
foreign exchange.
The issue failed to trade due to the lack of buyers and closed at an offered
price of Y1,200, down by its daily limit of Y300.
Foreign and domestic investors bought Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which
rose Y10,000 to Y619,000 on hopes that the company will put its rates up.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 92.25 to 18,293.29 in volume of 70.3m shares.
Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y300 to Y10,100 on fears of lower
profits due to the higher yen.
Roundup
POLITICAL considerations held the key to trading in a number of Pacific Rim
markets.
HONG KONG benefited from reports of progress towards new Sino-British talks
on the colony's plans for political reform and the Hang Seng index rose
61.79 to 6,231.88. Turnover, however, was only HKDollars 2.9bn, well below
last week's robust daily average of nearly HKDollars 4bn.
Trading was dominated by the debut of the so-called 'China-concept' share
Denway Investment. Denway, issued at HKDollars 1.22, rose to HKDollars 2.70
in early trade before slipping back to close at HKDollars 2.20, well below
market expectations.
Jardine Matheson, a laggard since a thinly veiled attack on the company by
China's official media in December, continued a week-long rally to finish up
HKDollars 1.75 at HKDollars 51.
AUSTRALIAN shares closed near their highs as the futures market inspired
solid gains. The All Ordinaries index closed 10.2 higher at 1,604.9 in
turnover of ADollars 306.36m.
Encouraging results and growing signs that the coalition will win the
federal election helped lift the mood.
Pancontinental Mining was heavily traded as Degussa, the German chemical
group, sold its stake for ADollars 21.1m. The shares finished 2 cents lower
at 95 cents.
SINGAPORE was mostly firm ahead of this Friday's national budget with trade
driven by Malaysian speculative issues.
The Straits Times Industrial index was 0.83 ahead at 1,639.87 in volume of
139.52m shares.
KUALA LUMPUR closed higher on strong speculative buying that took the
composite index 6.16 higher to 635.59.
Dunlop Estates rose 95 cents to MDollars 7.80, Magnum added 70 cents to
MDollars 10.40 and Multi-Purpose gained 26 cents to MDollars 2.44.
TAIWAN saw sharp advances among financials shares amid expectations that the
big three banks would issue big stock dividends next fiscal year.
The weighted index finished 42.79 ahead at a six-month high of 4,098.44.
Turnover rose to TDollars 61.5bn, the heaviest since last June.
SEOUL got active institutional support ahead of Thursday's presidential
inauguration and the composite index rose 22.64 to 674.71.
BANGKOK fell in thin trade, worried about the outlook for finance companies
after First City Investment told the government last week it had run out of
cash to repay debts, and was being investigated by authorities. The SET
index dropped 17.18 to 945.62.
BOMBAY trod water ahead of Saturday's national budget but there was
selective buying, and the BSE index closed 36.97 higher at 2,708.34.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Money Markets: French futures falter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENEWED tension within the European exchange rate mechanism prompted a sharp
fall in French franc futures yesterday as dealers struggled to maintain
D-Mark parity, writes Peter John.
In the Matif, the Pibor contract for March delivery plunged 22 points from
the open to end the day at 88.49 on heavy turnover of nearly 14,600
contracts. The fall indicated a quarter-point rise in three month money to
11.5 per cent ahead of the country's general election on March 17.
There was an element of correction after firmness last week but there was
also a new wave of ERM jitters prompted by the Bank of Spain's intervention
to support the peseta.
Nevertheless, the market is convinced that Paris will cut rates following
the election and the June contract remained steady yesterday, easing only
two basis points to 91.08 on turnover of 20,650 contracts.
Euromark futures traded within a tight range with the March contract
settling slightly easier at 91.93 and June marginally firmer at 91.97.
Away from the ERM uncertainty, short sterling was firm with March nudging
ahead by 3 basis points to 94.05 and June adding four points at 94.65.
There was also relief among UK interbank dealers as concerns that the
liquidity shortage would be around Pounds 1bn proved unfounded and the Bank
of England began the day with a forecast shortage of only Pounds 450m.
Among the main factors affecting the position were the take-up of Treasury
bills and paper maturing in official hands which was set to remove Pounds
347m from the system. Bills for repurchase by the market were expected to
take out Pounds 1.343bn and bankers' balances below target Pounds 35m.
Partly offsetting this, exchequer transactions were set to add Pounds 535m
and a fall in note circulation Pounds 745m.
The Bank of England did not offer early assistance but provided Pounds 280m
at midday, buying band one bank bills at the established 5 7/8 per cent
rate.
By the afternoon, the forecast shortage was revised to around Pounds 550m
and the Bank bought a further Pounds 270m of bills.
The Bank also announced a weekly rollover rate of 6 1/8 per cent on a
temporary facility it first made available last September to aid liquidity
after currency upheavals.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen hits new high against Dollars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN reached a new high against the US dollar yesterday as investors
continued to be heavy buyers of the Japanese currency, writes Peter John.
The rise highlights the dilemma facing the Japanese finance ministry. It
needs to cut the country's trade surplus but fears that the high value of
the yen will hit Japan's export market and domestic economy in the middle of
a recession.
Dealers said the yen reached Y116.10 in early London trading, fell back
slightly as profit-takers moved in and then rose again as the New York
market continued to buy it.
The gains are being fuelled by a belief that the Group of Seven meeting of
finance ministers and central bank governors on Saturday will endorse a
stronger yen as a means to reducing Japan's trade surplus.
Publicly, Japanese finance officials have expressed concern at the speed of
the yen's rise but there was a feeling in the foreign exchange markets that
the comments are principally a sop to hard-pressed exporters.
Mr Rob Loewy, the head of foreign exchange trading at Midland Global
Markets, argued that Japan might be happy to see the Yen trading between
Y115 and Y118 against the dollar.
Mr Neil MacKinnon of Citibank said he could see the dollar falling even
further to reach Y105-Y110 but, he added: 'Previously when there has been
this sort of discussion (among Japanese officials) the ball-park figure was
Y110-Y115.
'I suspect that the squeeze on profit margins plus the downturn in Japan's
export markets might mean that the acceptable pain barrier would be Y115
 Y120 and possibly as low as Y125.'
The yen closed in London at Y116.35 against Y119.0. Its strength added to
pressures on some European currencies.
The arrest of two Fiat executives yesterday in connection with Italy's
political bribery scandal and following hard on the heels of two government
resignations saw the lira sold down to 967.1 against the D-Mark from 959.2.
In spite of efforts by Spain's central bank to prop up the peseta, it
tumbled to Pta73.0 against the D-Mark from Pta71.7.
The fall revived fears that Spain might have to devalue or quit the ERM.
Observers said the country was likely to raise interest rates first but
there was scepticism about Spain's ability to sustain high rates.
The Bank of Portugal also intervened to support its currency but the escudo
buying failed to prevent it sliding some 50 basis points in sympathy with
the peseta to close 92.13 against the D-Mark.
The franc fell to Ffr3.392 from FFr3.385, with some talk of intervention.
However, the country's currency reserves rose by FFr13.09bn in January to
FFr101.05bn leaving the currency more secure against any speculative
attacks.
Away from the ERM, sterling was steady, firming to Dollars 1.4550 from
Dollars 1.4530 but easing to DM2.3700 from DM2.3775.

CUBA, RECOGNISING that competition between 'frontier' oil regions for new
investment is fierce, has staged presentations before 30 oil explorers and
producers this month in Calgary and London offering 11 blocks - seven
onshore, three offshore and one offshore/onshore.
Major oil companies present included Statoil, Shell, OMV (Austria) Elf,
Total, Nippon Oil and Lasmo; middle-ranking companies such as Ranger Oil and
Bow Valley (a British Gas subsidiary), and a large number of small
entrepreneurial explorers such as Edinburgh-based Cairn Energy and Sweden's
Taurus Petroleum. Three international US oil companies were represented by
their UK affiliates.
Other companies said by Cuban officials to be 'seriously interested' include
PanCanadian Petroleum and New Zealand's Fletcher Challenge.
Total, Braspetro, Taurus Petroleum, and Canada Northwest Energy, have
already obtained blocks during previous bilateral negotiations.
The presence of a representative from the DTI's offshore supplies division
at the presentation indicates UK government recognition that Britain could
eventually obtain some of this business.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Palladium and platinum prices
suffer 'body blow'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE SPECULATORS, whose buying recently sent the price of palladium
soaring to its highest level for 32 months changed their minds yesterday and
their panicky attempts to sell sent the metal's price plummeting.
Palladium, one of the platinum group metals and used mainly in consumer
electrical goods and as a dental alloy, fell in London by Dollars 7.90 to
close last night at Dollars 101.10 a troy ounce.
Speculators had driven the price from Dollars 85 to Dollars 119 an ounce on
fears of production difficulties in Russia, which supplies about half the
world's palladium. Yesterday's panic selling was triggered partly by
carefully-timed statements from some big Japanese car companies last week.
They told the Reuter news agency that, because their production was falling,
not only did they not need Russian platinum group metals, they might even
sell some of their present surplus.
The car companies are more interested in platinum than palladium - only 12
per cent of palladium sales are used for anti-pollution car catalysts
whereas 40 per cent of platinum is used this way - so the platinum price has
also been falling fast - by Dollars 8.50 an ounce last week. Yesterday it
closed in London at Dollars 348.50, down Dollars 10.75 from Friday's close .
The palladium price had been weakening on the Reuters' report but the
trickle became a flood yesterday after the yen strengthened against the US
dollar, the currency in which palladium is traded internationally.
'When the yen price started to fall because of the dollar's weakness,
speculators tried to sell. But there is no physical demand for palladium so
the price fell even faster,' said one trader.
Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland, pointed out that
the Russians had consistently maintained that their exports recently were
delayed by administrative tangles and bureaucracy. Palladium was a
by-product of Russia's nickel production and the country had little use for
it. 'So we must assume they have ample stocks and their explanation is
credible.' He said the car companies' statements came as 'a body blow to
bullishness'.
Mr Smith said the palladium price was still indicating that supplies were
tight. There was a premium for metal for immediate delivery and the cost of
leasing palladium was very high at 10 per cent. 'There is a mysterious
squeeze on the market,' he said.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia-Ukraine gas row boils
over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RISING tension between Russia and Ukraine, by far the largest of the
former Soviet states, has been further exacerbated by a bitter row over the
payment for and supply of gas .
The Russian state gas corporation Gasprom has alleged lack of payment of
Rbs165bn (as of Feb 18) for gas supplied since last year - a non-payment
which, according to Mr Rem Vyakhirev, Gasprom's chairman, has left the
company without sufficient funds to meet staff wages.
It has threatened to cut off supplies, which would be serious not just for
Ukraine but for the European countries - especially Germany - that are
highly dependent on Soviet gas. Mr Vyakhirev, quoted by the Interfax news
agency, said over the weekend that the gas exports to other countries would
continue - though the gas pipeline through Ukraine is highly vulnerable and
Ukraine has in the past taken the gas it has needed from it while it was in
transit to third countries.
More than 90 per cent of gas exported outside the former Soviet borders
passes through Ukraine.
The two sides have been talking about a new price for gas, but have been
unable to agree. Russia has said it wants to switch immediately to world
market levels (about Dollars 65 per 1,000 cu metres) but Ukraine has pleaded
inability to pay. It has also retaliated by saying that it will charge world
level transit fees for the gas crossing its territory.
The battle between the two former Soviet states is shaping up to be more
serious than that which drove them apart last year - since both are now
suffering from increasingly harsh economic climates and have little room to
compromise.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Clinton's tax plan will sap
energy of aluminium sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT CLINTON'S proposed energy tax is bound to hit US aluminium
producers, but the effect will be gradual and not severe enough to shut down
capacity analysts say.
Mr Clinton's proposal for a broad-based energy tax immediately drew
attention to the aluminium industry, which is North America's largest
industrial user of electricity. A Prudential Securities analysis puts energy
at 28 per cent of the average US aluminium production cost.
However, North America's aluminium producers are diversified both
geographically and in terms of their energy sources, so the impact of the
energy tax will vary from company to company. The president has proposed to
tax energy on the basis of heat content, measured in British Thermal Units.
The tax would be phased in gradually over three years.
Coal, the most widely used fuel in US aluminium smelters, would face the
same levy as natural gas, at 25.7 cents per million BTUs, and crude oil
would be taxed at a rate of 59.9 cents per million BTUs. Hydroelectric
power, the energy source of choice in most western US smelters, would not be
subject to the new tax.
The structure of the tax has left securities analysts puzzling over the
proposal's effect on metals companies' earnings. Reynolds metals, for
example, operates its smelters mainly on hydro power. Alcoa, the largest US
aluminium producer, smelted 600,000 tonnes of last year's 1.3m tonne US
production using coal. However, that coal was taken from Alcoa's own mines
and used in its own power generators, an arrangement that is likely to avoid
the tax. The balance of Alcoa's production was fired by hydropower.
Amax, another large US producer, has a less diversified energy mix, and is
expected to be hit harder.
Mr Vahid Fathi, metals analyst with Kemper Securities, said that while the
energy tax on average could raise aluminium production costs by 2 per cent
by 1996, US-produced aluminium would still be cheaper than its European
counterparts.
'The spread will still be in favour of North America. Even with the energy
tax, European costs are significantly higher,' Mr Fathi said.
Canada and South America would continue to be the world's lowest-cost
aluminium producers and the present state of global aluminium overcapacity
would make it difficult for US producers to pass on the new energy costs.
While Mr Clinton's energy tax is included in a wide-ranging plan to cut the
US deficit and stimulate economic growth, it is not certain that a rise in
the US growth rate would boost aluminium demand. Aluminium prices are set
internationally and world demand for the metal grew by less than 2 per cent
last year. Recessions in Japan and in parts of Europe are expected to limit
demand growth this year.
Mr J. Clarence Morrison, metals analyst at Prudential Securities, says the
global supply-demand situation for aluminium is so dismal that the energy
tax will have little or no impact on the worldwide industry, and only
selective impact on individual aluminium producers.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Thais to cut Middle East
dependence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THAILAND YESTERDAY outlined long-term plans to reduce its dependence on oil
shipments from the Middle East, both by buying surplus energy from its
neighbours and by building oil storage tanks and refineries in the south of
the country.
Mr Savit Bhotiwihok, the minister responsible for energy policy, told a
meeting of the Petroleum Institute of Thailand that the government would
focus on developing domestic and regional energy supplies to meet
electricity demand which is growing by an annual 10 to 15 per cent - or by
roughly 1,000 megawatts a year.
He said he expected to sign a memorandum of understanding next month with
the government of Laos on the purchase of between 1,000 Mw and 1,500 Mw of
electricity from proposed hydro-electric and coal-fired power stations in
that country.
By the end of this year, he added, Thailand and Malaysia could have
completed negotiations on the sale of Malaysian gas to feed a power station
with a capacity of about 1,800 Mw on or near their common border. A pipeline
to the frontier area is already under construction on the Malaysian side.
He said other possible sources of energy for Thailand included the offshore
exploration zone shared by Malaysia and Thailand, the hydro-electric
potential of the Mekong river, Burmese gas, and hydrocarbons from Cambodia
and Vietnam.
Mr Savit acknowledged that Thailand would continue to import oil from the
Middle East but he raised the possibility of a European-style regional gas
network and said: 'A lot of our effort nowadays is spent on studying the
integration with our neighbouring countries'.
The Thai government would vigorously support exploration and development of
oil and gas fields in Thailand, and study the possibility of establishing a
nuclear power industry. Development of lignite resources would also probably
continue, but the government was unlikely to proceed with building new dams
solely for the purpose of generating electricity.
Mr Savit said that the Petroleum Authority of Thailand would be assigned to
explore the possibility of building export refineries and establishing a
'huge' oil storage capacity in southern Thailand to 'stabilise' the regional
oil market.

SILVER set a life-of-contract low at 355 cents a troy ounce on Comex in
early trading after speculative selling by commodity funds. Comex warehouse
silver stocks were up 2m ounces at 272m ounces. Further support was pegged
at 350 and then 340 cents. 'Silver's actually looking quite interesting now,
it's quite healthy to have a shake-out now and again and should encourage
the buyers to emerge at these lower levels,' one London dealer said. New
York arabica COFFEE futures were bolstered in early trading by low delivery
notices against the March contract. London COCOA futures edged higher as
international cocoa agreement talks got under way in Geneva (see above). The
market could be poised to make another attempt to breach key resistance
around Pounds 745 for the May contract. Trading in LME BASE METALS was dull,
with light downside pressure in all markets barring ZINC. There is little in
the way of news to fan interest in the market at present, while physical
activity remains fairly low key.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa pact compromise proposed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE FOURTH and final round of United Nations-sponsored talks on a new
international cocoa agreement kicked off yesterday with a compromise
proposal from the chairman, Mr Peter Lai of Malaysia, on the price range to
be defended and the pact's financing. The 45 or so producing and consuming
nations represented have until March 5 to agree on a successor to the 1986
accord, which expires at the end of September.
The compromise envisages a price range of SDR1,040-1,560 a tonne, with a
median price of SDR1,300 (Dollars 1,780). At the end of negotiations last
November, producers were demanding a price range of SDR1,180-1,770 while
consumers offered SDR840-1,260. Cocoa is at present trading near historic
lows in real terms of about SDR730 a tonne.
On the sensitive issue of financing, Mr Lai has suggested that producers and
consumers share the cost of the proposed withholding scheme for stabilising
cocoa prices, with contributions equivalent to Dollars 8 a tonne on imports
or exports. However, governments would be free to decide how to finance
their contribution.
Consumers have rejected producer calls for a trade levy, insisting instead
that the new pact be financed in the first place by payment of the Dollars
137m owed by producers to the International Cocoa Organisation. Mr Lai's
compromise would require producer countries in arrears to pay their own
costs of storage and rotation for withheld stocks, enabling them to part-pay
their debts in local currency and save on scarce foreign exchange.
A separate proposal came yesterday for a 350,000 tonne limit on the amount
of cocoa that could be withheld from the market to bolster prices. Last
November, producers were demanding 380,000 tonnes, consumers 330,000.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia to 'welcome' foreign oil
cash - Local funding is insufficient to revive the sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I WELCOME foreign investment,' says Mr Vaguit Alekperov, appointed head of
Rosneft, the Russian state oil company now being created to manage the
industry. His direct endorsement of overseas investment will be good news
for the increasingly sceptical and discouraged foreign oil majors who have
found getting more than a toe-hold in the Russian oil sector arduous and
time consuming.
Mr Alekperov, still head of Lukoil, one of the new vertically-integrated oil
companies, sees the new state corporation as 'a central agency permitting
effective management of the industry' during the next three years, when the
industry will be transformed into a series of joint stock companies the bulk
of the shares in which will be held by the state, through Rosneft. The new
corporation will replace Rosneftigaz, widely seen as an ineffective
voluntary agency grouping the oil production associations, but constantly
undermined by the energy ministry and other state bodies.
'We will be a managerial body responsible for the enterprises' performance.
Our job is to create a series of vertically integrated companies, and we
will be present on the boards of every one of them' - except for Lukoil,
which will remain independent.
The new state boss knows the condition of the industry he is trying to
revive - its production plunging; its easily recoverable reserves mostly
exhausted; its technological capacity and funds insufficient to sustain the
vast investment programme needed to revive its fortunes. Hence his welcome
for foreign companies. He even - cautiously - says that Rosneft may act as a
guarantor for their investments 'at some time in the future' - a role the
state itself now refuses to take.
He believes, however, 'that we are past the worst point. The shock came in
1990 and 1991, when investments dropped sharply and when the debt to the
enterprises rose to Rbs400bn (about Pounds 600m at the present free market
exchange rate). But now people are learning to reorganise and live with the
new conditions'.
The legacy, however, has been a broken chain of production and supply, with
producers unable to find refiners, refiners unable to obtain crude and
garages closing for lack of supply. 'The chain has to be re-established:
there is a lack of responsibility now at all levels. Our aim is to create a
structure which will be responsible for the final result - gasoline at the
filling station.'
The contest for exploitation rights in the autonomous district of
Khanty-Mansinsk, in the Tyumen region of Western Siberia, - where deposits
are estimated at some 7bn tonnes - provides an example of how Mr Alekperov
expects Rosneft to operate. The State Geology Committee, with the
Khanty-Mansinsk authorities, have opened the tender to foreign companies:
Rosneft will not be involved at this stage, but may come in later as a
bidder for exploitation rights. Local rule seems, for the moment, strong.
Western oil companies, which include most of the majors who have been to the
region say that the first offer was for a 30 per cent stake in the field -
an unattractive offer to most, especially when the basic petroleum law has
yet to be adopted.
Asked if he feared the interference of the state - a fate which befell
Rosneftigaz - he said that 'the energy ministry is concerned with
legislation and regulation of all the energy industry. We are the managers,
there should be no confusion'. A bold word from a Russian manager.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: Spanish prices tumble as investor
confidence wanes

<DATELINE>

SPANISH government bond prices fell sharply yesterday, as the peseta's slide
undermined confidence among international investors.
Although the bond market opened quite strongly, prices dropped when the
Spanish central bank failed to intervene to support the currency at Pta72
against the D-Mark. However, most analysts still expect the Spanish
government to stay within the exchange rate mechanism, despite pressing
economic problems, particularly unemployment.
There was some speculation yesterday that the authorities might try to cut
rates and allow the peseta to drift to the bottom of its band. But such a
move could prompt greater pressure on the currency.
THE Italian bond market also performed poorly yesterday, shedding  1/4
point, as fears over the political situation persisted. Dealers were
concerned that the cabinet shuffle over the weekend had not addressed some
of the deeper problems.
Expectations of a vote of confidence in the next few weeks are expected to
continue to depress prices.
THE bund market again benefited from a flight to quality, continuing its
rally, although further interest rate cuts have already been discounted.
Bund contracts on both the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options
Exchange and the Deutsche Terminborse broke through resistance levels. But
dealers said the latest improvement was sparked more by switching than by
outright buying.
INVESTORS in Spanish and Italian bonds were seen switching into Dutch,
French and Danish paper, as well as bunds, partly based on expectations of
interest rate cuts.
The Danish bond market was the strongest performer of the day, gaining a
full point. Dutch bonds also closed sharply higher, supported by strong
domestic buying. The 10-year bond broke through a resistance level at 6 3/4
per cent as the market's rally persisted.
UK gilt prices ended virtually unchanged in lacklustre trading yesterday.
Slightly stronger than expected GDP data failed to impress traders, who were
disappointed that last week's gilts tap totalling Pounds 1.2bn was still not
fully sold.
LONGER-dated US Treasury prices turned sharply higher yesterday afternoon
pushing the 30-year bond's yield to a record low.
The benchmark 30-year government bond had a yield of 6.931 per cent in late
trading, its lowest level since the issue was first sold to the public in
1997. The long bond was quoted  7/8 higher at 102 5/16 . Movement was less
dramatic at the short end of the market, where the two-year note firmed
1/32 to yield 3.927 per cent.
In the absence of important economic news yesterday, the market remained
focused on President Bill Clinton's deficit reduction package. Some players
remain enthusiastic about his willingness to tackle the federal deficit,
along with measures which should slow the rate of economic growth in 1994,
But others were concerned that spending cuts might not be sufficient to keep
inflation in check.
The Federal Reserve entered the open market to arrange Dollars 2.5bn of
customer repurchase agreements when Fed funds were trading at 3 per cent.
There was also some positioning ahead of today's Dollars 15.25bn two-year
note auction and tomorrow's Dollars 11bn five-year note auction.

FT  23 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Toyota Motor's Dollars 1.5bn placing
off to a smooth start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE placing of Toyota Motor Corporation's Dollars 1.5bn five-year offering
proceeded smoothly yesterday, reflecting the car company's high credit
rating and the scarcity of highly-liquid corporate issues.
Meanwhile, syndicate managers expect the European Community to award a
mandate today for a Euromark offering of between DM2.5bn and DM3bn. An EC
spokesman in Luxembourg had no comment.
The market expected the deal to have a seven-year maturity and to be priced
to yield between 7 and 10 basis points above the 7 1/4 per cent bund due
January 2000, which closed at 104.33 yesterday to yield 6.43 per cent.
This area of the yield curve is viewed as relatively attractive to issuers,
but a syndicate manager close to the transaction said that the maturity also
suited the EC's funding needs.
Turning back to the Toyota offering, officials at the joint lead
underwriters, Nomura and Merrill Lynch, reported good demand for the bonds,
reaping the benefit of several days of pre-marketing the deal.
They therefore expect the bonds to be priced to yield the lower end of the
indicated range of 38 to 40 basis points above the when-issued five-year US
Treasuries, which were yielding 5.32 per cent late yesterday.
The bonds are expected to be priced this afternoon. A substantial part of
the proceeds of the deal, which is the largest ever corporate issue in the
international bond market, is expected to be swapped into yen.
The indicated pricing of the bonds was viewed as attractive when compared
with the recent dollar offering from the Kingdom of Denmark which was
yielding 22 basis points over comparable US Treasuries.
However, syndicate managers also pointed out that the indicated yield on the
new bonds was about 10 basis points below that on Toyota's outstanding bonds
due June 1997, which have lost some of their attraction to investors because
they were now trading at a substantial premium to par.
The lion's share, or 60 per cent, of the Toyota offering is expected to be
placed in Europe, followed by Japan with 20 per cent.
A further 10 per cent is expected to be placed elsewhere in Asia, 5 per cent
in the Middle East and 5 per cent in offshore US funds.
Elsewhere, the stream of Canadian dollar offerings continued, as Mobil Oil
Canada raised CDollars 125m in a five-year deal priced to yield 70 basis
points above the 6 1/4 per cent Canadian government bonds due 1998 which
were yielding 6.92 per cent late yesterday. The bonds kept to that spread
when they were freed to trade in the afternoon.
An official at the lead manager, ScotiaMcLeod, said that the yield spread on
the bonds was wider than that on recent issues but reported good demand for
the bonds from continental Europe, especially Switzerland.
General Electric Capital Corporation of the US also tapped the Canadian
dollar market with a three-year CDollars 100m offering priced at 99.73 to
yield 7.22 per cent.
When the bonds were freed to trade in the late afternoon, they traded close
to their launch level.
Aga, the Swedish industrial gas group, has announced a DM500m commercial
paper programme for general financing and the financing of its German
activities, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm.
The CP programme has been arranged by Dresdner Bank which will also act as a
dealer alongside Deutsche Bank and Citibank.
Aga already has a Dollars 500m CP programme on the Euro market, a FFr1bn
programme on the French market and a Dollars 100m programme on the UK
market.

FT  23 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Compliance is expensive for
Japanese banks - A look at the rising number of floating rate note issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE search by Japanese banks for regulatory capital that will push them
comfortably ahead of minimum international levels is becoming increasingly
expensive, as floating rate note issues by two leading banks yesterday
demonstrated.
Tokai Bank and Sanwa Bank both launched issues of perpetual floating rate
notes in the international bond markets, adding to a growing wave of such
paper in recent months.
In what is believed to be the first yen issue by a Japanese city bank (or
commercial bank) other than the Bank of Tokyo, Tokai raised Y40bn (Dollars
330m), while Sanwa raised Dollars 200m to add to a similar Dollars 300m
issue of last week.
Access by Japanese banks to the yen bond markets has until now been
restricted to a restricted list including the country's long-term credit
banks, the Bank of Tokyo and Norinchukin Bank. It is a privilege which has
long been expected to crumble as long-term credit banks such as the
Industrial Bank of Japan have themselves extended into areas like
securities.
Both of yesterday's note issues carry what are widely seen as high margins
over market interest rates, reflecting the shrinking band of investors
prepared to buy subordinated debt issued by Japanese banks. The notes were
reported to have been sold mainly to domestic investors.
They also have a step-up interest rate structure, making them increasingly
expensive to finance after the first five years. A call option after five
years allows the issuers to redeem them at that stage, making them
effectively five-year bonds - although for regulatory reasons they are
treated as perpetuals, making them eligible as tier two capital under Bank
for International Settlements rules.
Tokai's notes pay a yield 10 basis points below the Japanese long-term prime
rate - at present 5.2 per cent, but widely rumoured to be about to fall to
4.9 per cent. After five years, the rate jumps to 10 basis points over
long-term prime, and after 10 years to 60 basis points. The Sanwa paper
carries a margin of 75 basis points over three-month Libor, jumping to 125
and then 175 basis points.
The search for tier two capital reflects a concern by the banks that Tokyo
share prices may not hold at current levels. With the Nikkei stock index
held up at around 17,000 by government support operations, most of the
country's banks are likely to clear the 8 per cent minimum capital to risk
assets ratio required by the BIS.
However the banks say they need greater certainty that their capital levels
meet these rules, which come into effect formally at the end of March.
Both Tokai and Sanwa were comfortably above the 8 per cent level at the end
of last September (8.7 per cent and 8.81 per cent respectively, according to
Ibca, the specialist bank credit rating agency.)
Perpetual debt has a further advantage. Other forms of tier two debt do not
count towards regulatory capital once they exceed the level of tier one
capital (paid-up equity and retained earnings). This limitation does not
apply to perpetual loans or securities.
Sanwa raised Dollars 800m through similar issues last year, and has raised
Dollars 500m so far this year. At those levels, the bank says, it should
have no difficulty in refinancing the notes after five years (or in the case
of one issue, seven years) - although if the level of borrowing rises, the
refinancing burden may be greater. Given their need for capital, however,
this will not be the first consideration of the banks.

FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: TNT loss rises to ADollars 74m
in first six months

TNT, the Australian transport group, yesterday announced an equity-accounted
net loss of ADollars 74.5m (USDollars 50.6m) for the six months to the end
of December, compared with a loss of ADollars 51m in the corresponding
period of the previous year.
TNT warned that trading conditions in the third quarter would be difficult
because of seasonal factors, and ruled out a resumption of dividend
payments, cancelled last year.
The group reported equity-accounted operating profit of ADollars 38.3m,
compared with a loss of ADollars 17.5m in the previous first half. Sales
revenue was down 38 per cent to ADollars 1.5bn, reflecting the disposal of
non-core businesses.
The biggest improvement was recorded by Ansett Transport Industries, the
airline group owned by TNT and News Corporation. It contributed a profit of
ADollars 18.7m, against a loss of ADollars 35.5m.
The return to profit at the operating level was in line with directors'
forecasts at the end of last year, when the group reported a net loss of
more than ADollars 200m.
But net profit was cut by abnormal losses of ADollars 80.8m due to foreign
exchange losses and the start-up costs of the GD Express Worldwide joint
venture with a group of European and North American post offices.
Mr David Mortimer, managing director, said TNT still had 'a long way to go'.
But he was 'reasonably optimistic' that the group would report a net profit
in the first six months of next year.
Mr Mortimer said several expressions of interest had been received from
potential investors in Ansett following indications from both joint
venturers that their shares were for sale.
TNT shares closed 1 cent lower at 78 cents on the Australian Stock Exchange.
McIlwraith McEacharn, the Australian mining and shipping group, said 'a
number of overseas companies' were considering the purchase of a 46 per cent
stake in the company owned by TNT.
Australian coal mining companies have shown little interest in the shares,
which would give the buyer access to McIlwraith's 41 per cent stake in
Oakbridge, the New South Wales coal producer.

BRAMALEA, the troubled Edper-Hees property group, is expected to emerge from
bankruptcy protection next month and complete a debt restructuring programme
with a big sale of assets.
This follows favourable votes by the last two of six creditor groups for the
restructuring of the Canadian company. The group plans to sell CDollars 2bn
(USDollars 1.6bn) worth of commercial property in Canada and the US to
reduce its debt by almost half.
Control of the company will shift to the creditors.
Trizec, another Edper-Hees property company, will retain about 20 per cent.

FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: Tremors follow Showa Shell's
futures shock - The problem was that companies could defer settlement of
contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE calm that pervades the offices of Showa Shell Sekiyu, the Japanese oil
refiner and distributer 50 per cent owned by Royal Dutch/Shell, belies the
shock that ran through Japanese industry on hearing at the weekend that it
had incurred an estimated Y125bn (Dollars 1.05bn) in losses on foreign
exchange futures contracts.
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry responded with
criticism of Showa Shell's currency dealings and by asking other Japanese
oil companies whether they were involved in similar transactions.
Mr Yuji Tanahashi, vice-minister of trade, said it was regrettable that a
leading Japanese company had posted a huge latent loss by engaging in
foreign currency speculation without the knowledge of top management.
Shares in Showa Shell fell Y300 yesterday, the maximum daily fall allowed
under Japanese rules, as investors calculated the long-term consequences.
Depending on how far the yen appreciates, its losses could rise to Y160bn.
What has shocked the Japanese, apart from the scale of the losses, was how
they were accumulated over four years without the knowledge of anyone
outside the small group of staff involved in Showa Shell's foreign currency
dealings.
Mr Takeshi Henmi, the company's president, explained at the weekend that a
small group of staff at the company's treasury department, who were
responsible for foreign exchange trading, began placing forward contracts to
buy the US dollar in 1989 on speculation that it would rise against the yen.
However, the dollar failed to rise. Rather than settle the contracts at a
loss, the group rolled over the contracts in the hope that eventually the
dollar would move in its favour, or at least limit its losses.
The average exchange rate at which the group placed buy orders was Y145 a
dollar, while the yen rose to about Y125 at the end of last year. Since
then, it has appreciated further to Y116.85 at yesterday's close in Tokyo.
What made it easy for the group to keep knowledge of the dealings from the
company's management was its ability to roll over, or postpone, the futures
contracts indefinitely. That is, instead of paying for the dollars they
agreed to buy, the group continued to postpone settlement of its contracts
over several years.
Another factor which helped conceal the accumulated losses was the fact
that, under Japanese accounting rules, companies are not required to
disclose unrealised losses in their annual figures. Since the losses at
Showa Shell have not actually been incurred, they have not been reported in
any of its accounts.
On those occasions over the four years when the dollar came close to Y145
the group at Showa Shell was able to reduce its losses to some extent.
In the event, however, the yen's rise against the dollar proved too large to
combat. With latent accumulated losses amounting to about 82 per cent of the
company's capital of Y153bn, the group was left with little choice but to go
public.
The company is conducting an internal investigation. But it has made clear
that the group of staff involved was in breach of internal company rules on
foreign currency dealings and would be disciplined.
The ministries of both trade and finance would like to portray the
development as an isolated case. But the extent of the losses, together with
the fact that they did not surface for so long, raises questions about the
wisdom of allowing companies to roll over currency futures contracts for an
indefinite period.
Last July, in an attempt to bring Japanese foreign exchange dealing
practices more into line with those in the rest of the world, Japan's
Federation of Bankers Associations agreed that banks should not allow
companies to roll over futures contracts without specific business reasons
for doing so.
The Finance Ministry takes the view that the risks of foreign currency
transactions are a matter for individual banks and companies to deal with
and are not a matter for the ministry to meddle in. Nonetheless, it is said
to have warned Japanese banks of the risks involved in allowing companies to
postpone settlement of their futures contracts - widespread practice until
recently, according to industry sources.
Showa Shell expects to cover its losses over a period of 2 1/2 to three
years by selling assets, including stocks and property.
The company has emphasised that it will not cut the Y8 annual dividend, but
the scale of the losses is expected to keep it under considerable strain for
some time to come.

LIPPO, one of Indonesia's largest property and financial services companies,
has withdrawn a corporate restructuring plan announced last year.
Under the plan, holdings in six subsidiaries were to be transferred to Lippo
Pacific Finance (LPF), a quoted company, in a move expected to cost Rp250bn
(Dollars 121m).
Lippo says changes in Indonesian tax laws last September have made the cost
of the restructuring prohibitive. 'The process was too bureaucratic and the
potential tax liabilities much higher than planned,' one executive noted.
Under the restructuring, LPF was to acquire up to 51 per cent of Lippobank,
Lippolife, Lippoland, Lippo Industries and Multipolar - all quoted companies
in which Mr Mochtar Riady, the group's founder, is a leading shareholder.
LPF was also to acquire 100 per cent of Lippo Merchants, a privately-owned
finance company.
Brokers say consolidating the group under LPF could have solved the
illiquidity which has plagued trading in some subsidiaries' shares. The
price of Lippo Industries' shares last moved in November, while Lippo Life's
share price has remained stagnant since September.
But Lippo executives are bullish about the group. Its assets in Indonesia
are split between the banking sector (Dollars 2.25bn) and non-banking,
mainly property, sectors (Dollars 900m). It also has assets of about Dollars
1.5bn outside Indonesia, mainly in Hong Kong.
The group's Indonesian businesses should grow at 20 to 30 per cent a year in
the medium term, executives forecast. Such growth is 'not necessarily
spectacular' given Indonesia's risks as a developing country, an official
explained.

POLITICAL instability and recession caused earnings to fall by 9 per cent in
the six months to December at Kersaf Investments, the South African leisure
and entertainment group in the Safren group.
Turnover rose 9 per cent to R1.1bn (Dollars 352m). But tight margins saw
operating profit fall 3 per cent to R252.6m.
Attributable earnings fell by 6 per cent to R81m, with earnings per share
down by 9 per cent to 105 cents. The interim dividend was maintained at 66
cents a share.
Mr Buddy Hawton, executive chairman, said the political instability had
depressed spending on leisure. Gaming profits at Sun International - with
interests in local, regional and offshore hotels - had been affected by the
proliferation of unregulated casinos. Occupancies by 4 percentage points to
62 per cent.

products

<TEXT>
PREMIER Group, one of South Africa's largest food companies, is to acquire a
foothold in the country's dairy industry by paying about R150m (Dollars 48m)
for a strategic stake in Bonnita Holdings, the Cape-based milk products
group.
Mr Peter Wrighton, Premier chairman, said it had been attracted by the
quality of Bonnita's management, products and facilities. Dairy products was
also an area of the food market where Premier was not represented.
Bonnita processes approximately 25 per cent of South Africa's total milk
production, operates the largest milk powder and cheese factories in
southern Africa, and is responsible for one-third of the country's total
gouda and cheddar cheese production.
Bonnita Holdings is controlled by Cape Dairy Co-operative. It was formed in
June 1992 to hold the entire share capital of Bonnita, the operating
company, which is an amalgamation of a number of long-established dairy
co-operatives in the eastern, southern and western Cape.
The purpose of the restructuring was to provide a means of raising capital
from outside the agricultural sector. Bonnita has experienced rapid growth
in recent years that would have been curtailed without new finance.
Negotiations have been concluded for Premier to inject R100m in new capital
into Bonnita, thereby acquiring a 28.6 per cent stake. After a cash offer to
existing members, Premier estimates it will hold 35 to 40 per cent of the
restructured company, at a cost of about R150m.
Premier intends to raise its stake in Bonnita, with a listing on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange planned within the next three years.
Bonnita's annual sales are about R650m, while Premier's annual turnover is
about R11bn.

TNT said Ansett Transport Industries contributed an after-tax underlying
profit of ADollars 8.8m (USDollars 5.9m) to its results in the six-month
period. That compares with a loss of ADollars 17.3m the previous year.
However, after accounting for abnormal, or unusual, items, Ansett Transport
Industries contributed a ADollars 28.8m loss to TNT's result, widening from
a loss of ADollars 25.5m a year earlier.
The abnormal loss at Ansett was due to unrealised foreign exchange losses.

SAPPORO Breweries, a leading Japanese food and beverage company, yesterday
reported a rise in profits for the year to December on firm beer sales and
aggressive cost-cutting.
The company posted an 18.2 per cent rise in non-consolidated pre-tax profits
to Y10.7bn (Dollars 90m) on a 3.5 per cent increase in sales to Y551.7bn.
The company's operating profits surged 96.4 per cent to Y12.6bn.
Sapporo said it cut costs by Y6.1bn in marketing and other areas. It also
gained Y11.3bn in its sale of securities holdings and recorded evaluation
losses on its securities portfolio of Y5.5bn.
However, the company's after-tax profits fell 9.4 per cent to Y3.6bn due to
a rise in extraordinary losses caused by the liquidation of its
can-manufacturing subsidiary.

specialising in anti-cancer drugs, yesterday reported a 38.5 per cent
increase in unconsolidated pre-tax profits to Y14.65bn (Dollars 122m) in the
year to the end of December.
The sharp rise in profits was produced by a mixture of cost-cutting and
strong sales of prescription drugs. Chugai's sales rose by 7.5 per cent to
Y143.21bn, buoyed by strong sales of prescription drugs.
Net profits rose by 27 per cent to Y5.25bn despite extraordinary losses from
investment in an overseas subsidiary. The company has dissolved a joint
venture with Upjohn, the US pharmaceuticals group.
The dividend is being maintained at Y7.5.

FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: Ameritech unveils restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERITECH, the Chicago-based 'Baby Bell' telephone company, yesterday
announced a sweeping internal reorganisation and unveiled a radical plan for
introducing competition into the US local telecommunications market.
Its initiative is an important contribution to the growing US debate over
the future of the nation's local telecommunications industry in general, and
the seven regional 'Baby Bell' companies in particular.
The local telecommunications market remains monopolistic, divided up between
the 'Baby Bells' and independent service companies, such as GTE. However,
these monopolies are coming under increasing threat, due to regulatory and
technological change, and the regional companies have been looking for new
strategies to respond to the competition posed by wholesale
telecommunications companies, cellular companies and cable television
businesses with telephone ambitions.
Ameritech's plan for local competition is believed to be the first such
proposal by a 'Baby Bell' company, although New York's independent Rochester
Telephone also unveiled a ground-breaking scheme this month.
The move by Ameritech, which provides telecommunications services to 12m
customers in the mid-west, has two distinct parts. First, it intends to
create 12 new market-focused business units, each bearing the holding
company's name, rather than organising itself around Bell operating
companies in each of the states where it operates.
Eleven of the units will be organised around a specific type of service to
the customer - for example, small business services or pay phone services.
The 12th will run the telecommunications network.
Mr William Weiss, Ameritech's chairman, said it was 'dramatically
simplifying' the way customers dealt with the company by putting its
marketing initiatives and services under a single brand name. He also
stressed the restructuring was not a 'resizing process' - a euphemism for
job cuts.
The second part of the initiative is more dramatic in scope, but less likely
to materialise in the near term, as it would entail wholesale changes to the
US telecommunications industry framework, involving a multiplicity of
federal and local regulatory agencies.
Ameritech says it will file next month with the Federal Communications
Commission, the government agency which regulates the communications
industry, a plan to open up its local telephone network to competition by
separating its transport services from switching services, which direct
telephone calls.
It says this would provide US consumers with the same kind of options in
picking local telephone services which they have today in choosing their
long-distance service carrier. The long-distance market has been fully
competitive since the 1984 anti-trust break-up of American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, which left the rump AT&amp;T in the long-distance market and created
the seven 'Baby Bell' local monopolies. Other service providers in the
mid-west would be able to buy components of Ameritech's network to repackage
with their own services for resale.
However, in return for this, Ameritech said it would be seeking some drastic
changes in its operating environment, including the ability to provide
long-distance services.
At present, all the 'Baby Bells' are prohibited from entering the
long-distance market, under the terms of the 1984 anti-trust settlement,
though all are demanding to be allowed into this field as their monopolies
erode.
Ameritech wants the current regulation of its earnings by state commissions
to be replaced by a regime of price regulation, and it is asking for
flexibility in the pricing of new and competitive services.

The plan, filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday,

injection into Citicorp, the largest US commercial bank.
Before the capital injection, Prince Alwaleed had accumulated a significant
stake via market share purchases.
He is likely to show a healthy profit on his investment, since Citicorp's
share price has more than doubled since the injection.

<TEXT>
NORDSTROM, the Seattle-based retailer, yesterday reported after-tax profits
of Dollars 49.96m in the final three months to end-January.
The results were scored on a 9.3 per cent improvement in sales, at Dollars
1.07bn, and compared with a net profit of Dollars 40.86m in the
corresponding period of 1991-92.
The 1992-93 results would have been slightly higher, had it not been for a
Dollars 4m charge related to the payment of certain plaintiffs' legal fees
in Nordstrom's recent settlement of a labour class action lawsuit.
Nordstrom's shares, listed on the over-the-counter market, rallied Dollars 1
7/8 on the news, to Dollars 38 3/4 .
As with most retailers, the fourth 'holiday' quarter is the most crucial
within the trading year.
In the case of Nordstrom - a family-run, upmarket fashion retailer which
grew rapidly in the late 1980s but where progress has stalled recently - the
final quarter's figures take the full-year profits total to Dollars 136.6m
after tax.
In the previous year, the company recorded profits of Dollars 135.8m. Annual
sales were Dollars 3.42bn, compared with Dollars 3.18bn in 1991-2.

FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: Sears, Roebuck reaps Dollars
800m from offering of finance arm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES OF Dean Witter, Discover were priced at Dollars 27 yesterday, netting
its parent, Sears, Roebuck about Dollars 800m.
The initial public offering of Sears' brokerage and credit card units is the
first of a series of planned spin-offs for the Chicago-based retailing
giant. Dean Witter, Discover shares will begin trading publicly today.
Dean Witter, Discover sold 29.5m shares, or about 20 per cent of its stock
in the initial offering, with about 15 per cent of those shares reserved for
purchase by employees.
The remainder of the firm will be spun off to Sears shareholders by the end
of this year. Sears will receive a Dollars 560m special dividend from Dean
Witter, Discover when the spin-off is completed.
The price of the offering was up substantially from the Dollars 20 to
Dollars 22 per share projected in the preliminary prospectus was released in
December.
The favourable reception to the offering boosted Sears stock on Friday by
Dollars 2.75 per share to Dollars 54 - its highest level in 12 months. In
New York yesterday, Sears shares closed Dollars  3/8 higher at Dollars 53
7/8 .
The Dean Witter, Discover sale is part of Sears' strategy to return to its
core business of retailing. Sears also plans to sell portions of its
Allstate insurance and Coldwell Banker property businesses.
Analysts said that Dean Witter is the most attractive of Sears' planned
offerings, with solid earnings and steady cash flow from its large mutual
fund and managed money operations.
Dean Witter, Discover had 1992 earnings of Dollars 439.1m, including a
one-time gain of Dollars 32.1m, up from Dollars 344.6m in 1991.
Profits were distributed nearly evenly between credit card and securities
broking operations. Despite the Dean Witter profits, Sears Roebuck lost a
record Dollars 3.9bn in 1992.

TWO French banks, Credit Lyonnais and Societe Generale, have invested
CDollars 13m (USDollars 10.4m) in Dia-Met Minerals, a British Columbia
company which is at the centre of a stampede for diamonds in Canada's
Northwest Territories.
The banks have bought 350,000 Dia-Met shares, equal to 3.5 per cent of the
total outstanding, in a private placement priced at CDollars 39 a share.
The deal was put together by First Marathon Securities of Toronto. Dia-Met's
share price has soared in the past year from less than CDollars 5 to a peak
of CDollars 60 in the wake of its discovery of diamonds in the Lac de Gras
area, 350km north-east of Yellowknife.
The company said last May that a sample of 160 tonnes of ore had yielded at
least 90 carats of diamonds, of which about a quarter appeared to be of gem
quality. BHP, the Australian mining group, has rights to a majority interest
in the Dia-Met property. De Beers and Kennecott, the North American
subsidiary of Britain's RTZ, are among numerous other companies which have
joined the diamond stampede, in which a total of about 23m acres has been
staked.
Mr John Lydall, First Marathon's mining analyst, said in a report that
exploration was still at an early stage and 'a huge amount' of work remained
to be done. He said 'this entire exploration play remains an opportunity for
prudent speculation'.

TURKEY hopes to raise Dollars 218m by selling five state-owned cement
companies in the latest stage of an ambitious plan to sell TL25,000bn
(Dollars 2.7bn) of state shares in 1993.
For the second time, the Public Participation Administration, the state
agency handling privatisation, yesterday issued an offer for the block sale
of the Adiyaman, Askale, Bartin, Ladik and Sanliurfa factories, setting a
minimum price above which negotiations will start. Bids have to be submitted
by March 29.
Cement has proved to be the most attractive investment sector for foreign
investment in Turkey. The market, with sales of around 26,000 tonnes in
1991, equals those of France and Spain, and is growing by some 5 per cent a
year.
Ciments Francais, now owned 86 per cent owned by Italcementi, already has
seven plants, having invested around Dollars 350m. Lafarge Coppee and Vicat
of France have also bought Turkish factories.
Industry officials expect further foreign interest in the latest offer.
Lafarge, the world's largest concrete and aggregates producer, is expected
to make a bid for Askale, which the PPA has valued at Dollars 30m.
Holderbank of Switzerland is also understood to be interested in acquiring
Turkish operations.
In November, the PPA raised Dollars 281m through the sale of six cement
companies but, despite foreign interest, all were sold to local concerns.
The PPA yesterday announced plans to sell by public offering its outstanding
20 per cent stake in Netas the local subsidiary of Northern Telecom of
Canada.
The timing was probably influenced by the sharp upturn in the Istanbul stock
market, with the index reaching an all-time high on Thursday, following
government moves to bring down bank interest rates.
Earlier this month, the PPA concluded the block sale of 20 per cent to
Northern Telecom, raising Dollars 215m and making the Canadian company
Netas's majority partner.
The PPA also raised Dollars 115m this month by selling two state-owned power
utilities to the local Uzan group. Uzan's Rumeli Holding also bought two
state cement factories.

<TEXT>
THE ORTHODOX Church of Russia is setting up a bank in Moscow, with backing
from Greek and Cypriot investors.
The bank, to be called Orthodox Bank, will be managed by Egnatia Bank, a
private Greek concern, under an agreement with the Church's education and
training department. It is due to start operating this autumn.
The bank's start-up capital will amount to Dollars 10m, to be covered by
Greek businessmen based in Greece, the US and Cyprus, rising to Dollars 30m
within five years.
The church will not contribute to the bank's equity but will provide
premises for its offices in Moscow and later in other Russian cities. The
Orthodox Church is gradually regaining control of assets which were
confiscated under communism.
Mr Andreas Boumis, chairman of Egnatia Bank, said the new bank would
initially offer wholesale services, catering for the increasing number of
Greek companies setting up joint ventures in Russia.
'But we would want to get into retail banking in the rouble market once the
currency situation becomes more stable,' he added.
Egnatia Bank, established two years ago by a group of northern Greek
businessmen, has undertaken to set up a computer system for the new bank and
to train its staff.

Outokumpu nickel stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN MINING Corp (WMC), the Australian resources group, has agreed to buy
a 50 per cent share in the Mount Keith nickel deposit in Western Australia
from Outokumpu, the Finnish metals group.
The deal will give WMC 100 per cent ownership of Mount Keith, which is
expected to start producing about 28,000 tonnes a year of nickel concentrate
in early 1995. However, the group will have to fund development costs
estimated at ADollars 450m (USDollars 306m). WMC said it had signed an
agreement giving Outokumpu the right to buy 50 per cent of Mount Keith
production for 10 years.
Analysts said the deal suggested that WMC would not exercise its right to
purchase a 49 per cent share in the Olympic Dam copper/gold/silver/uranium
mine in South Australia from BP, its joint venture partner. BP said in
November that it would sell the stake for USDollars 456m to Minorco, the
overseas investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation-De Beers group of
South Africa, unless WMC exercised its right to buy the stake at the same
price. Acquisition of the BP shares would make WMC solely responsible for
funding proposed expansion costing around ADollars 1bn at Olympic Dam.
The group is also committed to investing ADollars 105m at its Kambalda
nickel operations in Western Australia provided the state government moves
to allow continuous mining.
WMC acquired its half-share in Mount Keith in 1991 following a
bitterly-contested joint takeover with the Normandy Poseidon group of
Australian Consolidated Minerals (AMC). AMC's defence against the bid
centred on an attempt to tie up control of Mount Keith by selling a
half-share to Outokumpu. But the move backfired when Outokumpu agreed to
develop the mine jointly with WMC.

FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: Promodes to buy Discol chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROMODES, one of France's largest hypermarket groups, is expanding its
wholesale interests by buying the Discol chain of food wholesalers from the
Pinault-Printemps retail group.
The acquisition, which is believed to be worth between FFr150m (Dollars
26.7m) and FFr200m, will turn Promodes into the largest food wholesaler in
France, ahead of Metro, the German company.
Promodes, based in Normandy, is already a leading player in wholesaling with
its Prodirest subsidiary, which made overall sales of FFr1.5bn last year.
Discol, which also provides food to restaurants and caterers, mustered total
turnover of FFr2.6bn in 1992.
The hypermarket sector is one of the most dynamic areas of French retailing,
which is generally under strain because of the slowdown in consumer
spending. But ambitious groups, notably Promodes and Carrefour, have
expanded aggressively by acquisition in recent years and intensified
pressure on other retailers.
For Pinault, the sale of Discol forms part of an ongoing disposal programme.
The group is trying to reduce the FFr19bn of net debt it incurred after the
acquisition of the Au Printemps department store group in late 1991 which
turned it into one of France's most powerful retail concerns.
Pinault is also reported to be in negotiations with Galeries Lafayettes, one
of Au Printemps' chief competitors, over the sale of the Prisunic chain of
mixed merchandise stores.

WESSANEN, the Dutch foods company, and Bols, the liqueurs and beverages
group, posted gains of more than 10 per cent in 1992 profits, in line with
forecasts made in January just before they announced plans for a merger.
Wessanen's net profit before extraordinary items rose by 12.7 per cent to Fl
123.9m (Dollars 67m). Turnover fell to Fl 3.7bn from Fl 3.9bn, reflecting
the sale of the grain products division in mid-1992.
Bols' net profit rose by 10.1 per cent to Fl 116m from Fl 105.4m on turnover
of Fl 1.29bn against Fl 1.33bn. Improved cost controls helped lift operating
profit by 3.9 per cent to Fl 149.9m.
Both companies increased their dividends, Wessanen's pay-out rising by 5.9
per cent to Fl 2.84 a share and Bols' by 11.8 per cent to Fl 1.52.

<TEXT>
CODAN, the Danish insurance group controlled by the UK's Sun Alliance, has
made a bid for Hafnia Insurance and Hafnia Bank. However, it is not
interested in acquiring the Hafnia group's strategic shareholdings in its
Danish competitor, Baltica, and Sweden's Skandia.
A second Danish insurance group, Alm. Brand, also said that it had made a
bid for Hafnia's insurance and banking operations.
Hafnia suspended payments to its creditors last August after sustaining
heavy investment losses on its its holdings in Baltica and Skandia.
Hafnia holds 33.6 per cent of the shares in Baltica and 13.8 per cent in
Skandia.
Potential bidders had until last Friday to submit bids for Hafnia. Mr Klaus
Moe of Hafnia yesterday confirmed that 'we have received a number of
offers', including that made by Codan and Am Brand. Hafnia would not specify
who the other bidders were. Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, Skandia of
Sweden, Tryg Forsikring of Denmark and Germany's Allianz, have been linked
with Hafnia in the past.
In a possible complication, Codan said it had submitted its bid to Den
Danske Bank, Denmark's biggest bank and Hafnia's biggest creditor, rather
than to Morgan Stanley, the US securities house which is handling the sale
of Hafnia assets.
Codan said its bid would not be submitted to Hafnia Holding 'for as long as
that company continues to negotiate the sale of Hafnia Holding 1992 (the
company which holds both insurance and banking subsidiaries)'.
Codan also said it was making its bid conditional on Hafnia negotiating with
a 'single party . . . after examining the bids received', a procedure
originally proposed by Hafnia in November 1992.
Sun Alliance would not comment on reports that it might be prepared to
reduce its stake from 71.5 per cent to 51 per cent if Codan opted to fund
its bid for Hafnia through a share offer.

FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: Accounting changes help Norsk
Hydro back to black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORSK HYDRO, Norway's biggest stock-listed company, said yesterday that a
change in accounting principles enabled the group to return to a net profit
of NKr1.76bn (Dollars 253.6m) in 1992 from a loss of NKr498m a year earlier.
Last year's figures reflect a NKr2.09bn positive cumulative affect of
changes in accounting to GAAP standards in the US.
The new principles also resulted in a NKr131m charge in 1992 for estimated
costs of future health and social benefits. Before the effect of accounting
changes, Hydro suffered a net loss of NKr195m in 1992 compared with a loss
of NKr498m in 1991, when accounts were charged with NKr2.9bn for
restructuring compared with a charge of NKr160m last year.
Hydro proposed to cut its dividend to NKr3 a share - the lowest in five
years - from NKr3.50 in 1991.
Group operating revenue fell by NKr2.55bn to NKr58.1bn due to a weak world
economy and sharply lower prices for main products, the company explained.
Weaker sales were, however, partially offset by sharply lower operating
costs which fell by NKr2bn to NKr49.6bn in 1992. Hydro said the effect of
higher petroleum production, which rose by 16 per cent to 8.3m tonnes of oil
equivalent in 1992, was counteracted by weak oil prices which fell, on
average, by Dollars 1 a barrel to Dollars 19 in 1992.
Group operating profit rose sharply to NKr2.88bn from NKr925m in 1991, but
net financial expenses increased to NKr2.62bn from NKr1.21bn because of a
NKr1.39bn foreign currency loss in 1992, compared with a NKr19m gain in
1991.
'The turmoil in currency markets and the rise in the exchange rate for the
dollar at the end of the year had a strong impact on Hydro's 1992 result,'
the company said, adding that a large part of financial expenses comprised
unrealised foreign exchange losses associated with dollar-denominated loans.
For individual operations, agriculture saw sales fall by NKr813m to
NKr25.45bn as operating losses narrowed to NKr237m from NKr649m in 1991.
Hydro said restructuring costs of the division had been NKr160m higher than
expected but that reductions in fixed costs had reached an estimated annual
rate of NKr900m in the fourth quarter.
Oil and gas boosted sales by NKr622m to NKr12.68bn as operating profit rose
by NKr154m to NKr2.64bn.
Light metals suffered a NKr2.03bn plunge in sales to NKr15.6bn but returned
to an operating profit of NKr540m from a NKr1.18bn loss in 1991.
Aluminium prices were lower last year while magnesium suffered weak demand
and poor margins as extrusion operations weakened.

BIKUBEN, Denmark's third-largest bank, halved the dividend to DKr6 per share
after reporting a net loss last year of DKr1.2bn (Dollars 191.7m) compared
with a loss in 1991 of DKr48m.
Mr Borge Munk Ebbesen, chief executive, said the result 'is obviously
unsatisfactory and is a reflection of the general economic crisis.'
He made no forecast for 1993, but said a positive vote in the country's
second referendum on the Maastricht treaty on May 18 and lower domestic and
international interest rates would be crucial to improving the bank's
performance.
Loss provisions last year increased to DKr1.75bn from DKr1.46bn. Last year's
provisions included DKr300m against loans to Hafnia, the troubled insurance
group which went into payments suspension last August.
The value adjustment for securities gave a loss of DKr293m compared with a
profit of DKr396m in 1991. The bank's balance sheet was strengthened by new
subordinated loan capital - tier 2 capital - last year and despite the large
net loss the capital adequacy ratio improved slightly from DKr11.45 per cent
to 11.90 per cent. The legal minimum ratio last year was 10 per cent.

<TEXT>
ASTRA, Sweden's leading pharmaceuticals group, saw 1992 pre-tax profits rise
50 per cent to SKr5.12bn (Dollars 678m) from SKr3.41bn, driven by strong
sales growth and one-off currency gains.
The strong performance led the group to raise its dividend by 54 per cent to
SKr5 a share from SKr3.25, on a 60 per cent increase in earnings per share
to SKr28.80.
Sales rose 25 per cent to SKr15.6bn, which the group stressed was entirely
due to higher volumes rather than increased prices.
Growth is expected to continue in 1993, with earnings rising in line with
sales. However, the group did not give a specific forecast because of
turbulent currency conditions.
Operating earnings after depreciation rose 29 per cent last year to
SKr3.96bn from SKr3.06bn. But the group also benefited from a 62 per cent
rise in net interest income to SKr580m and a SKr470m one-off currency
translation gain as a result of the weakening of the krona. Operating income
and licensing income were only marginally affected by exchange rate changes
as the krona only fell sharply at the end of the year.
Astra's sales rose sharply in a number of important markets, including the
UK, Germany and Sweden.
Sales of Losec, its top-selling anti-peptic ulcer drug, climbed 43 per cent
to SKr4.35bn from SKr3.03bn. If the drug's sales through licensees is
included, sales rose to SKr7.2bn from SKr4.85bn.
Pulmicort, the anti-asthma agent, saw a 55 per cent growth in sales to
SKr1.91bn to make it the group's second most important drug. Plendil, the
anti-hypertensive agent, increased sales by 69 per cent to SKr569m.
'This is a good underlying performance and shows that Astra has probably the
best portfolio of new drugs of any of the world's major pharmaceutical
companies,' said Mr Andrew Tivanen, pharmaceutical analyst at James Capel in
London. The group is also one of the least exposed to threatened US
healthcare reforms.
The latest performance extends an impressive run which has seen Astra's
profits growth outstrip sales growth for the past 15 years. In both 1990 and
1991, the group pushed its pre-tax profits up by 36 per cent a year.
The group's A shares fell SKr22 to SKr685, largely because the figures
disappointed some of the expectations which built up last week. Astra is
also proposing a five-for-one share split.

FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: UAP share sale fuels Adidas
controversy

<TEXT>
UNION des Assurances de Paris, the largest French insurance group, has
fuelled the political controversy over last week's sale of Adidas by
announcing that it plans to sell its shares in the German sporting goods
group.
UAP last week joined forces with two other French state-controlled financial
groups in a consortium that bought the controlling stake in Adidas for
DM615m (Dollars 370.4m) from Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial businessman
recently reappointed to the French cabinet as minister of towns. The
involvement of three state companies in the deal has already provoked a
political row in France.
Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman of UAP, told yesterday's edition of Les Echos,
the French financial newspaper, that he had instructed Banque Worms, the UAP
subsidiary responsible for the transaction, to withdraw from Adidas 'in the
near future, as soon as the financial climate is right'.
Banque Worms, which originally held a 2 per cent holding in BTF, the German
holding company that controls Adidas, raised its stake to 5 per cent under
the terms of last week's deal.
Mr Peyrelevade's statement comes only a few days after the French government
issued an official denial through the finance ministry that it had exerted
any influence over the companies involved with the Adidas transaction.
President Francois Mitterrand on Friday claimed on French television that
all three groups had decided to buy shares from Mr Tapie on an independent
basis.
Adidas has just emerged from a turbulent period since Mr Tapie took over in
summer 1990 when its financial performance deteriorated and its workforce
has been racked by protests against rationalisation plans. It saw net
profits fall from DM52m in 1990 to DM15m on static sales of DM3.35bn in 1991
and is believed to have gone into the red last year.

FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Eurotherm accounts inconsistent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROTHERM, the control equipment group, has admitted to an inconsistency
between its 1990 and 1991 accounts following discussions with the Financial
Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounting watchdog.
In a note to its latest accounts circulated yesterday, the company has
restated restructuring provisions which it treated as extraordinary charges
in 1990 but partly wrote-back as exceptional profits in 1991.
The 1991 accounts were not qualified by Arthur Andersen, the company's
auditor.
The restated figures treat the provision as an exceptional item, which has
the effect of reducing 1990 earnings per share from 19.6p to 12.3p. It makes
no difference to the 1991 and 1992 results.
In an announcement yesterday coinciding with publication of the accounts,
the Review Panel said it welcomed the company's restatement and it had
concluded its examination of the accounts.
Mr Sydney Treadgold, secretary to the Review Panel, said: 'We feel that
honour has been satisfied.' He said that in general such treatments 'were
not right in terms of correctness and consistency.'
But Mr Robert Biddle, Eurotherm's finance director, called the Review Panel
'a kangaroo court' which had made the assumption that the company was
'guilty until proven innocent.' He said: 'I'm just amazed. I would have
thought the panel had bigger fish to fry.'
He said that restating items in prior years was 'comparing apples with
oranges' and argued that the company had tried to comply as quickly as
possible with the new accounting standards.
He said the differing treatment was the result of the company adopting by
the 1991 accounts the second pronouncement from the urgent issues task force
of the Accounting Standards Board, which requires fundamental restructurings
to be treated as exceptional items.
Mr Treadgold said: 'The panel makes every effort to explain its procedures
and gives companies every opportunity to explain its accounting treatment.
It is anxious to come to a voluntary agreement whenever possible.'
Eurotherm made a Pounds 2.3m extraordinary charge for a fundamental
restructuring of its manufacturing activities in the year to October 31
1990, which had no effect on pre-tax profits.
In the following year, however, it wrote back as an exceptional gain Pounds
513,000 for which it had over-provided in 1990, which increased pre-tax
profits by 8 per cent to Pounds 7.2m.

FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Contracting out behind Capita's advance to
Pounds 4.41m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITA GROUP, a provider of services to the public sector, yesterday
reported a greater than expected increase in profits and earnings per share
as it continued to enjoy the fruits of government contracting out.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 3.45m to Pounds 4.41m on sales up 34 per
cent at Pounds 33.1m (Pounds 24.7m).
Earnings per share rose 23 per cent to 19.3p (15.7p) and, as forecast at the
interim stage, the total dividend is raised 17 per cent to 6.3p with a
proposed final of 4.2p. A 2-for-1 scrip issue is also proposed.
'We are currently looking at a significant volume of new business
opportunities,' said Mr Rod Aldridge, chairman and chief executive. 'The
organic opportunities are enormous.'
Most of the growth came from the outsourcing division, launched in 1989,
where sales expanded 59 per cent to Pounds 17.8m, although pre-tax profits
rose only 25 per cent to Pounds 2.45m.
Sales in the advisory business, the original Capita activity, grew by 13 per
cent but profits were up 31 per cent at Pounds 1.95m.
Mr Aldridge said that the most significant growth would come from the
outsourcing of contracts from the 540 local authorities, less than 10 per
cent of which were currently contracting out.
At the end of the year, Capita had cash balances of Pounds 9.6m and no net
borrowings, which, Mr Aldridge said, was a benefit when marketing to local
authorities.
The group had invested heavily during the year on the computer services
division which resulted in the group spending Pounds 500,000 more than
budgeted on sales and marketing.
This had helped win additional contracts, the cost of which had been taken
during the year but the benefit from which had hardly contributed to 1992
profits.
COMMENT
With the government determined to farm out large amounts of white collar
work to the private sector, Capita is successfully mining a seam that a few
years ago was almost non-existent. Without too much hyperbole, the potential
markets can be measured in many billions of pounds, leaving Capita with the
enviable problem of choosing where to deploy its growing but still limited
resources. What is more, Capita's ability to generate sales from new
products, like the collection of local taxes, should not be under-estimated.
That said, much of this promise is already in the price after a strong run.
Forecasts for this year of pre-tax profits of about Pounds 5.5m, or earnings
of 23.5p, anticipate contracts about to be announced and put the group on a
prospective earnings multiple of 19. That is demanding but fair.

COVENTRY Building Society disclosed a 16 per cent rise in pre-tax profits,
from Pounds 21.3m to Pounds 24.7m, despite a rise in provisions for possible
bad debts to Pounds 13.7m, against Pounds 9.9m.
Operating profit rose by 23 per cent to Pounds 38.3m (Pounds 31.2m). Net
interest income rose 18 per cent to Pounds 54.8m (Pounds 46.6m), helped by a
14 per cent growth in total assets to Pounds 2.69bn (Pounds 2.37bn).
Mr Martin Ritchley, chief executive, said he was pleased with the society's
performance in all areas of business against a background of recession and a
depressed housing market.
Despite the increase in total assets, mortgage lending fell by 8 per cent to
Pounds 485.1m (Pounds 526m) - of this total, Pounds 160.5m was lent to
first-time buyers.
The ratio of management costs to mean assets fell from 1.08 per cent to 1.04
per cent, while the cost to income ratio fell from 43.2 to 40.7 per cent.

FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Amberley chairman to resign from board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMBERLEY GROUP, the USM-quoted building services company, is poised for
expansion following the conditional sale of most of his holding by Mr Dennis
Buckley, chairman, and his departure from the board.
Hemery Nominees is buying 965,400 shares (14.99 per cent) at 27p leaving Mr
Buckley with a 2.98 per cent holding. The shares gained 3p to close at 23p.
Mr Brian Meddings, who was with BPB and Mr Robert Healey, who was with
Hawley, are joining the board in an executive capacity. It is not yet known
who will replace Mr Buckley as chairman.
Mr Philip Kanas, a non-executive director of Amberley, said it was proposed
to double or triple in size through acquisitions paid for by paper. The
areas for growth would probably be away from the present building
preservation services but still within building services.
Amberley fell into Pounds 79,000 losses (Pounds 75,000 profits) on turnover
of Pounds 1.62m (Pounds 1.59m) in the six months to September 30.

FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Interest fall helps Ashtead rise 7%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN WHAT Mr Peter Lewis, chairman of Ashtead Group, described as a period of
'relentless recession', the equipment rental company raised pre-tax profits
from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 1.61m in the six months to October 31.
The 7 per cent profits rise was struck on turnover up Pounds 860,000 at
Pounds 16.8m. Operating profits slipped to Pounds 2.03m (Pounds 2.15m) but
interest charges fell to Pounds 423,000 (Pounds 644,000) on lower rates.
Some two thirds of the group's profits accrue in the first half.
Mr Lewis said that the oversupply in the non-operated plant hire market
which has pertained since 1990 was showing signs of declining as competitors
withdrew from the market. This would benefit the group, he said. He was
pleased with the continued strength of the balance sheet and the neutrality
of the group's cash flow during the period, in spite of a Pounds 2m increase
in capital expenditure to Pounds 5.3m. The group bought only new equipment,
whereas competitors had either bought second hand or hardly at all. Ashtead
also increased its payroll numbers.
With the group's level of operational gearing, a 10 per cent rise in its UK
prices would double its profits, though a rise of that size should not be
assumed, he added.
In spite of the survey and inspection side making operating profits of
Pounds 489,000 (Pounds 452,000) on turnover of Pounds 2.37m (Pounds 2.03m)
and the US plant hire side making Pounds 74,000 (Pounds 164,000) on turnover
of Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 980,000), the management was concentrating on the UK
plant hire market. The group now relies for less than half of its turnover
on the construction and civil engineering industries, with local
authorities, public and private utilities and specialist companies making up
the balance.
Earnings grew to 5.2p (4.6p) per share and the interim dividend is lifted 3
per cent to 1.133p.

FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Low &amp; Bonar hit by restructuring costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOW &amp; BONAR, the Dundee-based packaging and plastics company, yesterday
announced a sharp fall in profits mainly because of Pounds 14.1m of
exceptional restructuring costs.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 21.6m to Pounds 8.1m in the year to
November 30. The prior year figure was adjusted down from Pounds 24.3m to
comply with FRS 3. At the interim stage, profits rose 4.9 per cent to Pounds
11.8m.
Mr Jim Leng, who became chief executive last year, said European profits
improved, especially in the UK. Restructuring costs, which covered the
closure of its UK non-wovens business and the reorganisation of North
American operations, would lead to further margin improvements this year, he
said.
Turnover was almost unchanged at Pounds 307.4m (Pounds 307.7m), helped by
Pounds 10.1m of sales from acquisitions. Operating profits increased 0.4 per
cent to Pounds 25.3m, but profits on continuing operations fell slightly,
mainly due to falling profits in Canada and heavier losses in the US.
The Pounds 11.1m acquisition of Royal Tufton, the floor coverings company,
and other purchases increased net borrowings to Pounds 36.5m (Pounds 13.2m).
Interest costs increased more than Pounds 1m to Pounds 3.46m. Higher
borrowings, and a slight fall in shareholders' funds, lifted gearing from 10
per cent to 30 per cent.
Earnings fell to 3.35p (17.04p) per share. The company said that earnings
before exceptional items would have totalled 17.4p.
A proposed final dividend of 6.4p makes an unchanged total of 9.1p.
COMMENT
These results - and the exceptional charges - were well flagged and the
shares gained 5p to 303p yesterday, mainly on optimism about the UK and US.
After attacking the US losses and replacing management, the division should
finally recover this year, while Canada is already benefiting from a
stronger US dollar exchange rate. And, after weathering recession, UK
packaging and specialist materials should do well with recovery. The worry
is the Continent, which provided 36 per cent of operating profits, and where
only Germany has so far shown signs of downturn. If the rest of the
Continent follows, Low &amp; Bonar's long awaited 'annus mirabilis' - when
nothing goes wrong - may take 12 months longer. Profit forecasts are for
Pounds 26m, putting the shares on 15 times. After outperforming their sector
in the first six months of last year, the shares have now come back in line.
Without further news on Europe, they are likely to stay there.

FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Management buy-out talks at Caithness Glass
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGERS of Caithness Glass, the Scottish ornamental glass maker, are
negotiating to buy the company from Drambuie, the liqueur company which
acquired it in early 1991.
That Drambuie, owned by the McKinnon family which founded it, is prepared to
shed Caithness is a reversal of its previous, widely publicised strategy of
diversifying away from dependence on the after-dinner liqueur.
The Caithness acquisition was said at the time to be the first in a series
of purchases of Scottish companies making quality products. But no further
acquisitions were made and Mr Peter Shakeshaft, the finance and development
director who spearheaded the new policy, left in February 1992.
Yesterday Mr Alastair Mair, managing director of Caithness Glass, confirmed
that an MBO was being negotiated. He did not say who would be backing it.
Caithness employs 250 people at factories in Perth, Oban and Wick. Last year
it closed its plant at Kings Lynn, Norfolk. It has shed 120 jobs because of
recession.

Channel Holdings, formerly Channel Tunnel Investments, reported a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 191,000 for the six months to end-December.
The result included a maiden contribution from Carflow Products (UK) for the
period from its acquisition in August.
Basic earnings per share were 1.3p. For the 12 months to December 1992 there
was a profit of Pounds 172,000 and earnings of 2p.
Mr Philip Ling, chairman, said that since its acquisition Carflow had
continued to perform satisfactorily.
The company continued to improve its market penetration in the UK and
overseas; Mr Ling anticipated that Carflow's sales and profits would
continue to increase during 1993.
He expected that a dividend would be recommended in respect of the 15 months
to March 31 1993.

Olicom in the US.
Income from the portfolio remained strong and the proposed dividend is 0.44p
 -last year's payment was 0.4p and there was also a special 0.2p.
Total revenue was little changed at Pounds 2.67m (Pounds 2.71m), but the
after-tax figure was lower at Pounds 426,000 (Pounds 905,000) giving
earnings per share of 0.45p (0.96p).

FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: FII rides recession with Pounds 3.5m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE 'sustained recessionary pressure' on trading conditions and margins,
FII Group, the footwear and scientific equipment company, lifted interim
profits from Pounds 3.2m to Pounds 3.48m pre-tax.
Mr Monty Sumray, chairman, said the group's priority was to 'stem margin
erosion'.
Measures could involve site changes and some redundancies, exceptional costs
of which would occur in the second half. Lower interest rates 'will
exacerbate margin pressure and reduce investment income,' he said.
The footwear division turned in unchanged profits before interest of Pounds
2.9m on turnover of Pounds 35.4m (Pounds 34.6m). The maintained result
masked increased costs of imported materials and components and resistence
to higher selling prices, Mr Sumray said.
The scientific and technical side returned a profit of Pounds 200,000 on
turnover of Pounds 6m (Pounds 5.6m). Exports rose 43 per cent to Pounds 3m
(Pounds 2.1m).
Earnings per share emerged at 15.8p (15.7p); the interim dividend is raised
from 5.5p to 6p.

FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Upwardly mobile in healthcare supplies - A
look at the growing vision of the optician who is expanding Intercare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN OPTICIAN'S vision of increasing commercial opportunities in healthcare
lies behind the rapid growth of Intercare, a Stockport - based company which
has made a string of acquisitions in the last three years.
Mr Peter Cowan, 47, acquired control of a loss - making shell, Pennine
Optical, in 1989, strengthened the renamed group's optical business and
moved into dental and other health products, most significantly, mobility
scooters for the elderly and disabled.
Mr Cowan trained as an optician at Manchester University and joined his
father's business, building one shop into a chain of 19 outlets. They
reversed into a small public company, Prestwich, which built the chain to 45
shops before selling it to Cooper Vision for Pounds 10m in 1986.
Mr Cowan moved with the business. Within 18 months the chain had grown to
110 shops, third nationally behind Boots and Dolland &amp; Aitchison. When
Cooper Vision sold the business in 1987, he tried to stage a buy-out, but
was outbid by Dolland &amp; Aitchison, part of Gallaher, the UK subsidiary of
American Brands, the tobacco group.
However, he was determined to build a business which could exploit changes
in the National Health Service, moves towards more care in the community and
an ageing population.
'I could see a lot of changes would be taking place, both here and
internationally, and that there would be lots of opportunities for
professionals to buy services and products.'
He bought into Pennine, an optical distributor quoted on the Third Market,
in 1989 and returned it to profitability by combining it with Sovereign
Optical, which was acquired for Pounds 417,000 the following month.
In November of that year Intercare paid Pounds 1.5m for A-Z Dental Holdings,
a Bolton - based business which has the UK's largest dental laboratory,
making dentures, crowns and bridges. A - Z is now moving towards higher -
margin cosmetic techniques, such as ultra-thin porcelain sheathing.
The company is also trying to develop its non - laboratory distribution
side, and is agent for an oral video camera which dentists can use to
illustrate cosmetic treatment options.
It also has European distribution rights for Cedeta, a new electronic
anaesthetic system which is controlled by the patient.
A - Z is in Intercare's medical products division along with acquisitions
such as Nationwide Ostomy, which distributes incontinence products, and
Impharm, which supplies retail chemists with pharmaceuticals. Last year the
group paid Pounds 2.6m for SAFA, one of the leading suppliers of first aid
and healthcare products to large corporate customers.
Intercare also strengthened its optical division last year by paying Pounds
4.33m for Birmingham Optical Group, a large prescription laboratory which
also makes instruments and equipment for opticians. Birmingham is agent for
the latest computer-controlled US and Japanese equipment, which allows
opticians to finish lenses and put them into frames on their premises.
However, Intercare's star performer is undoubtedly Booster Electric
Vehicles, a Huddersfield - based company which was bought for Pounds 2.37m
in the spring of 1991. A few months later the group paid Pounds 3.16m for a
75 per cent stake in Montis, a Dutch distributor of healthcare products,
including the electric vehicles assembled by Booster.
Started by Mr Allan Baker, a lecturer in mechanical engineering at Bradford
University, and his son, Peter, Booster makes battery - powered scooters and
four - wheeled vehicles to aid mobility. Last year the combined sales of
Booster and Montis leapt from Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 8.7m with pre-tax
profits advancing from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 2.1m, accounting for nearly 60
per cent of group profits.
An important factor behind Booster's rapid growth is that one of its
vehicles is the leading scooter recommended by the Dutch health authorities,
which offer free mobility vehicles to registered disabled under 65. However,
UK sales also grew by 43 per cent last year and the group sees strong growth
potential in oversees markets such as the US and Japan.
Intercare is particularly interested in establishing Booster dealerships in
modern, welcoming premises, which diminish the disabled stigma attached to
mobility vehicles and makes them attractive to the potentially much bigger
group of customers who are less able or elderly.
Booster's products are not available on the NHS, although people can put
their mobility allowance towards the cost of the vehicles, which range from
Pounds 1,600 to more than Pounds 2,000. Mr Cowan had expected Booster's
customer base would be middle class, but found this was not the case. 'If
people need a vehicle, often the family will subsidise it to improve the
individual's quality of life.'
Intercare's pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.6m last year on sales of Pounds
29.1m were boosted by contributions from acquisitions, but the businesses
owned for the full year grew by 25 per cent.
Mr Cowan sees limited scope for growth on the dental laboratory side, apart
from cosmetic work, but believes there will be increasing synergies to be
obtained in the pharmaceutical distribution businesses. The addition of
sunglasses and an agency for contact lenses would also complete the group's
optical businesses.
Intercare will continue to make acquisitions, but must also decide how
quickly to expand Booster. Mr Cowan does not want to run just a mobility
company, but admits: 'Mobility has to be the priority, because there we have
an international opportunity.'

FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Welsh Water pays Pounds 56m for engineer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELSH WATER yesterday became the sixth water company to make a significant
acquisition this year when it paid up to Pounds 56.1m for Acer Group, the
consultant engineer.
Welsh has been rethinking its diversification policy since it sold a
controversial 14.9 per cent stake in South Wales Electricity last December.
Analysts said the decision to concentrate on engineering made sense and gave
Welsh a meaningful non-core business.
Mr John Elfred Jones, chairman, said the acquisition would allow Welsh to
grow its non-core profits. 'We see ourselves as an infrastructure services
company, so Acer is exactly the step we were looking for,' he said.
However, the deal was attacked by Mr Rhodri Morgan, MP for Cardiff West and
Labour spokesman on the water industry. He said Welsh's previous
diversifications, which include a loss-making hotel arm, had been
'disastrous'.
Acer was formed in 1987 through the merger of Freeman Fox, which had a
reputation as a bridge designer, and John Taylor and Sons, which had
expertise in water-related projects.
In the year to April 30, the company made pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.4m on
turnover of Pounds 85.5m. About 60 per cent of profits come from Europe,
with the rest spread throughout the world. European sales are split between
the transport and water sectors.
Mr Graham Hawker, Welsh's group managing director, said the companies had
been in discussions since last July. Acer's shareholders decided to sell
because some partners had retired and ICF of the US, which owned 30 per
cent, no longer wanted to acquire the company. 'Those still in the business
realised their balance sheet could no longer support growth,' he said.
Welsh is paying Pounds 21m in cash and assuming Acer's Pounds 27m of debt. A
total of 36 senior managers have signed two year service contracts which
include incentive payments if Acer's profits in the 35 months to April 1995
exceed Pounds 19.4m. The maximum payable under the scheme is Pounds 8.1m.
Welsh will fund the purchase through cash held outside the core business.
Welsh raised Pounds 75m though a bond issue in 1991 and made a Pounds 17m
profit on the disposal of the electricity stake. The pro-forma exit p/e
ratio is 7.8. Acer had net assets at the year end of Pounds 8.8m and
goodwill of Pounds 5m.
Acer has a small joint venture with Severn Trent.

FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Peugeot tumbles to Pounds 10.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEUGEOT TALBOT, the UK subsidiary of PSA Peugeot Citroen, the French car
maker, suffered an 80 per cent fall in pre-tax profits last year to Pounds
10.2m.
The fall from Pounds 50.8m in 1991 came despite turnover increased to Pounds
1.53bn (Pounds 1.44bn).
Mr Geoffrey Whalen, managing director, warned yesterday that trading
conditions would remain difficult and margins would continue to be
'depressed' in 1993.
Peugeot Talbot's pre-tax profits have dropped steeply during the prolonged
UK recession from Pounds 135m in 1989 and Pounds 109m in 1990.
After-tax profits fell last year by 82 per cent to Pounds 6.8m, from Pounds
36.3m in 1991.
The company is being forced to halt production for three days this week from
Wednesday to Friday at its Ryton, Coventry assembly plant in the face of
weak sales in particular in export markets. About 3,500 hourly paid
production workers will be laid off with the loss of 5 shifts.
The announcement of the sharp deterioration in the company's profitability
was accelerated in the face of the continuing threat of industrial action at
the Ryton plant.
The workforce is due to ballot again on Monday about a two-year pay deal,
after abandoning a previous strike threat last Friday.
Peugeot Talbot car exports from the UK dropped last year by 13.6 per cent,
from 61,384 to 53,019, reflecting lower demand in some continental European
markets, said Mr Whalen.
In the UK, the Peugeot marque increased its market share to 7.8 per cent
(7.3 per cent) helped by a 7.3 per cent jump in sales volume to 124,019
(115,557).
Mr Whalen said that profit margins had been squeezed by difficult market
conditions both in the UK and in continental Europe, by the impact of the
devaluation of the pound, and by increasing demands to meet tougher
environmental requirements and higher vehicle safety and security standards.
Car output at the Ryton assembly plant fell by 2.5 per cent last year to
85,728, against 87,965 in 1991. The company started production last month of
a second car range at Ryton, the Peugeot 306, which will be launched in the
UK in April.

FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Baldwin shows advance of 8% to Pounds 2.47m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX PROFITS at Baldwin, the holidays, printing and properties group,
rose 8.2 per cent from Pounds 2.28m to Pounds 2.47m in the year to
end-October 1992.
The group also took a Pounds 1.1m extraordinary provision against Baldwin's
legal battle over the value of a 6 per cent stake in London Clubs
International.
The company is suing other shareholders in London Clubs, who acquired
Baldwin's 6 per cent investment, for substantial damages. They acquired the
stake for Pounds 54,000 after the Gaming Board objected to the renewal of
the casino company's gaming licence in 1991. In 1989 Baldwin paid some
Pounds 900,000 for the holding.
Any damages awarded would be recorded as an exceptional gain and included in
pre-tax profits once the new accounting standard on exceptional and
extraordinary items comes into force.
When the 1993 results are reported, Baldwin will be obliged to restate its
1992 figures consistent with the new standard, including the provision in
pre-tax profits.
Group turnover increased 8 per cent to Pounds 29m (Pounds 27m), and
operating profits rose by a quarter from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 2.3m. But net
interest receivable dropped from Pounds 449,000 to Pounds 180,000.
Tour operating activities increased profits by 50 per cent, from Pounds
1.49m to Pounds 2.23m. Profits from print fell from Pounds 271,000 to Pounds
123,000 and property profits fell from Pounds 218,000 to Pounds 76,000.
Earnings per share rose 18 per cent to 9.8p (8.3p), and a dividend of 3p is
proposed, an increase of 0.2p on the total for 1991 of 2.8p. No interim
dividend was paid because of the 'unclear' position surrounding the
investment in London Clubs.

FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Airtours bid on hold awaiting probe move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRTOURS AND Owners Abroad, the rival travel group it is bidding for,
continued to trade shots as the Takeover Panel put the timetable of the
Pounds 225m bid on ice pending a decision on whether it should be referred
to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Owners Abroad accused Airtours of continuing to deny its shareholders the
information they will need to make a decision on whether to accept the paper
offer that is accompanied by only a partial cash alternative.
An Airtours adviser said that Owners Abroad's annual report, published last
week, was the first financial information that Airtours had received.
'It has some pot holes, not to say black holes,' which needed to be taken
into account when, and if, Airtours was considering whether to raise its
offer, he said.
Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, called for the protagonists to get
back to the 'real issues' of 'track record and what is good for
shareholders' once the trade and industry secretary has decided whether to
refer the bid.
Answering questions posed by Owners Abroad last week, Airtours said that
having a financial year-end of September 30, rather than at the end of
October, after the end of the holiday season, had no material effect on its
profits.
Deferring the cost of 'empty legs' to the next year in this way has the
effect of increasing profits by less than 2 per cent of profits, Airtours
said.
The bidder also said that while the figures were not directly comparable,
Airtours provided more than double the amount for maintenance costs for its
aircraft by comparison with the amount Owners Abroad provided for its 17
aircraft.
Airtours repeated that it believed Owners Abroad did not have in place
adequate forward foreign exchange cover.
While Owners Abroad had Pounds 173m, or an amount equal to about 22 per cent
of sales, Airtours had Pounds 195m or about 48 per cent of sales, according
to Mr Harry Coe, Airtours finance director.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, is expected to announce whether
he is referring the bid within the next few days.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MCLEOD RUSSEL Holdings, the paints producer and distributor which is
offering Pounds 13.3m for Wheway, yesterday increased its stake in the
struggling engineering group to 7 per cent.
McLeod purchased 4 per cent of Wheway at just under 10p a share. It came as
Wheway learnt that it had lost the potential support of Senior Engineering
Group, the tubing, boilers and ductwork group.
The two groups had held talks as part of Wheway's strategy of trying to find
another third party interested in a merger. However, after looking at
Wheway's businesses, Senior has decided against making an offer.
Mr Hugh Ashton, Wheway's chairman, said he would continue to talk to other
companies to see if he could get a better deal for shareholders.
McLeod and Wheway were also recently in talks about a possible merger.
However, McLeod decided to go hostile after failing to reach agreement on
price.
Mr Nigel Openshaw, McLeod's chairman, said: 'The fact that we were able to
pick up shares so easily shows that Wheway's shareholders are voting with
their feet. It is time Wheway's board recommended this offer.'
Wheway shareholders are being offered one McLeod share for every 10.

<TEXT>
HARMONY LEISURE, the loss-making pubs and restaurants group, yesterday
announced sweeping board changes and proposals for a rights issue following
an evaluation of its poor trading performance by Guinness Mahon, the
merchant bank.
Mr Bob Dawson, chairman, and Mr John Lever, a director, have resigned from
the board. Mr Stanley Lever is to relinquish his position as managing
director, although he will remain in a non-executive capacity.
Mr John Main, a director at Southend Property Holdings, was named yesterday
as chairman and chief executive. He has been joined on the board by Mr
Martin Marcus, joint managing director of Queens Moat Houses.
Southend Property and Queens Moat together control almost 20 per cent of
Harmony's share capital.
Mr Marcus said the new board was preparing a rights issue in a bid to
restore Harmony's capital base which has been depleted by accumulated losses
of Pounds 6.9m over the past three years.
'The management of Harmony was unsatisfactory and the company needs extra
equity by way of assets and cash,' he said yesterday.
The proposed rights issue, which has yet to be approved by shareholders, is
likely to involve issuing new ordinary shares of 5p; it was not clear last
night what the ratio would be for existing shares.
Mr John Main said the full terms would be announced shortly. Such a rights
issue would help Harmony build a new vehicle for asset investment, he added.
'The whole company is very tired and needs to be rejuvenated,' he said.
The appointment of Mr Main follows mounting concern at the group's
performance, which escalated last year after Harmony announced interim
pre-tax losses of Pounds 344,000 in the six months to September 27.
Yesterday the company also announced a profits warning for the six months to
the end of March this year and said there would be a 'significant pre-tax
loss' for the full year.
The Harmony board has been under increasing pressure since rebel
shareholders launched a campaign for the appointment of new non-executive
directors last October.

FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Bitter dispute comes to a head - Licensees
claim new leases are onerous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IT WAS my dream to have my own pub. Now it's turned into a living
nightmare,' said Mrs June Varty, licensee at the Gardeners Arms, at
Droylsden, near Manchester.
Today, Mrs Varty will join other licensees of pubs owned by Inntrepreneur
Estates, the Grand Metropolitan/Courage joint venture, in picketing
GrandMet's annual meeting in London. They are protesting against 'excessive
rents and onerous leases' which, they claim, are forcing hundreds of
Inntrepreneur landlords towards bankruptcy.
GrandMet insisted yesterday that less than 100 leaseholders were involved in
the protests. Long-term leases had been agreed with 4,700 of IEL's 6,850 pub
licensees. Since IEL was established nearly two years ago, between 7 per
cent and 8 per cent of licensees have gone out of business compared with 15
to 20 per cent a year under the old tenancy system.
'The leases, and the rental, which takes into account turnover, the pub
location and other factors such as the likely cost of repairs, are freely
negotiated,' the company said.
But Mrs Varty added that a show of hands at a meeting of 110 Inntrepreneur
leaseholders in north-west England earlier this month showed that many of
them had been visited by bailiffs.
'I have had three visits,' said Mrs Varty, 53, 'but I am not going without a
fight.'
'Inntrepreneur want Pounds 1,500 a week from me in rent and arrears but my
weekly takings are only Pounds 1,000.'
Mrs Trisha Boyce, who runs the Britannia Inn, at Alcombe in Somerset,
founded the National Association of Inntrepreneur Lessees (Nail) five months
ago to contest, including through court action, the terms of the company's
leases.
She said the lessees would ask the courts, and if necessary the European
Court, to declare the leases null and void.
Mrs Boyce acquired her lease for Pounds 52,000 in 1991. Her annual rent is
Pounds 18,500 - four years earlier when the pub was owned by Ushers, the
rent was Pounds 4,250 a year,' she said.
Charges, such as insurance, and the cost of repairs to the 300-year-old pub,
added to the burden. 'Trade is hit by recession and growth will always be
limited. This is a village pub without a car park.'
On legal advice, she told GrandMet last year that she did not want to be
freed from tied beer supplies. 'If I wasn't freed, they could not increase
my rent.'
Mr Martin Moore, licensee of The Bridge, at Uckfield, East Sussex, signed
the 20-year lease for his pub in 1991. The rent was Pounds 18,000 a year. 'I
knew that would be tough to find in a recession,' he said. 'But I spent my
Pounds 35,000 savings in refurbishing . . . and I managed to keep my head
just above water.'
Last October, when the pub was freed, under the government's beer orders,
from its beer supply tie with Courage, the rent was increased to Pounds
29,100 a year.
'Courage offered me discounts of Pounds 3,000 a year to continue supplying
my beer - but there is no way now that the business can be viable, and the
lease is unsaleable.'
He added: 'At the start of these leases two to three years ago, the annual
rent would be 5 to 7 per cent of the freehold value. Today, it is 18 to 25
per cent.' His only recourse to the rent increases, he said, was 'to attempt
to assign an unsaleable lease or slide inexorably into bankruptcy'.
'To afford this lease, I would need to make the pub perform better than it
ever did in the boom years, let alone during the deepest recession the trade
has ever encountered. In the present economic climate, the sensible action
would be to reduce the rent to a level the business can afford.'
GrandMet said yesterday 'the leases are popular' and the rents were freely
negotiated with the licensees having recourse to arbitration.
'Every single rental agreement made by Inntrepreneur has been agreed through
negotiation by both parties. The only exceptions have been in cases where
leases have been assigned by the original leaseholder.' The company added
that sitting tenants had 'a pretty good idea' of a pub's performance. New
entrants could take independent advice about trading prospects.

FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Andersen Consulting UK fee income rises by
25%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANDERSEN Consulting yesterday reported fee income up 25 per cent to Pounds
215m in the year to December 31 1992.
Revenues worldwide rose to Pounds 1.7bn in the same period.
In common with other accountancy firms and consultants, Andersen refused to
provide details of its profits.
Mr Keith Burgess, UK managing partner, said: 'The industry average (of
profits) is 10-12 per cent. We are at the high end, but margins are under
pressure.'
He said that about four fifths of revenues came from professional billings.
Most of the remainder - with slightly lower margins - came from outsourcing,
by which the firm takes over the direct running of clients' computer
systems.
Aside from outsourcing, the firm said other fast-growing divisions were
financial services and utilities.
He admitted that the revenues included any hardware or other goods and
services bought-in on behalf of clients he said this only amounted to about
4 per cent of revenues.
'We think we're doing remarkably well in difficult circumstances,' said Mr
Burgess.
Andersen's professional staff rose from 1.790 in 1991 to 2,125 last year.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Shell shares slip on news of Pounds 131m charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Shell Transport, the UK arm of the Royal Dutch/Shell group,
slipped 6p yesterday to 575p following disclosures at the weekend that Shell
would take a Pounds 131m charge against its fourth quarter results to cover
huge currency losses at a Japanese associate company.
Some City investors were concerned that the currency losses come at a time
when Shell's core businesses in chemicals and European oil refining are also
under pressure from recession, low oil prices and over-capacity.
Shell is still expected on Thursday to announce a slight increase in profits
for last year with most analysts estimating income of about Pounds 3bn
compared with Pounds 2.9bn in 1991.
The currency loss of Dollars 1.05bn incurred by Showa Shell Sekiyu, a
Japanese refining subsidiary which is 50 per cent owned by Shell, was made
in breach of company rules that forbid speculation on the money markets. An
investigation into the currency dealings is underway and Shell said the
necessary disciplinary procedures would be taken.
Mr Fergus MacLeod, oil analyst at NatWest Securities, said: 'This is the
flip side of the company's decentralised management structure which enables
it to react much more quickly to opportunities but which also makes it
difficult to maintain management control.'
Shell said the net charge of Pounds 131m to its full-year results will be
offset by a credit of Pounds 149m which comes from consolidating Showa Shell
into group results. But investors say three-quarters of this credit has
already been accounted for.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Cordero deal confirms RTZ US expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY FOUR days after revealing a strategic thrust into the US coal mining
business, RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining company, is adding to
its interests there with the acquisition of Cordero Mining from Sun Company,
the US oil and gas group, for Dollars 120.5m (Pounds 85m).
Cordero operates a low-cost, open pit mine in the Powder River Basin near
the three mines which RTZ is to acquire from Nerco, the floundering US
natural resources company for which it has made a Dollars 470m agreed offer.
Mr Bob Wilson, RTZ's chief executive, said at the time of the Nerco purchase
last week that RTZ hoped to buy more Powder River coal, particularly as some
of the oil and gas companies represented there seemed to want to quit the
business.
He said yesterday the Cordero purchase positions RTZ as a substantial coal
producer with about 16 per cent of the Powder River coal production: 'RTZ
has now established a coal business in the US producing 29m tonnes a year,
all from high-quality, long-life mines. We have put together a substantial
new business unit, capable of both organic and acquisitive growth.' No
further US acquisitions were now in the pipeline.
RTZ intends to sell some of the Nerco assets but initially its gearing (debt
as a percentage of shareholders' funds) is expected to rise to 63 per cent
after the two deals.
Mr Wilson said both the big US credit rating agencies had reaffirmed RTZ's
'double A' rating since the Nerco announcement and 'the ratings are not
expected to require further review as a result of this deal'.
The Cordero coal mine, the seventh-largest in the US, opened in 1976, is 25
miles south of Gillette in Wyoming. It produces 12.1m tonnes of low sulphur
coal a year and 63 per cent of production is sold under long-term contracts
to mid-western and Texan utilities.
At the present production rate, the mine has a 28-year life. Mr Wilson said
there is potential to expand annual output at little extra cost to 15.4m
tonnes.
Cordero is being acquired free of debt and RTZ expects it to make 'a modest
positive' contribution to 1993 earnings.
As with the Nerco acquisition, the Cordero deal is subject to US government
approval. RTZ expects it to be completed in about 30 days.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Halifax chief executive named
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HALIFAX Building Society has completed an eight-month search for a new chief
executive by appointing Mr Mike Blackburn (right), chief executive of the
Leeds Permanent Building Society, to take over in August.
Mr Blackburn, chief executive of the Leeds for the past five years, has
attracted controversy by criticising aspects of government policy. He will
take over at the Halifax when Mr Jim Birrell, the current chief executive,
retires at 60.
The appointment of a new chief executive of Halifax has been the subject of
much speculation as it is the largest society with assets of Pounds 59bn and
it appointed a firm of headhunters last June to aid its search.
Mr Jon Foulds, Halifax chairman, was thought to have been seeking an
outsider to ensure innovation. Mr Blackburn is respected for having improved
Leeds' performance since he joined it from the Access Joint Credit Card
Company.
Mr Foulds said yesterday that Mr Blackburn was 'ideally placed to build on
the culture and values' of the Halifax. He said Mr Blackburn would be
'working with an excellent management team and going forward from an
enviable base'.
Mr Blackburn is to leave the Leeds, the fifth biggest society with assets of
Pounds 16.2bn, at the end of this week and will probably join the Halifax
this summer.
Leeds announced that Mr Roger Boyes, finance director, would take over as
acting chief executive from March 1. The board is expected to consider
whether to make the appointment permanent after that.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Landlords to picket GrandMet AGM over 'excessive' pub rents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LICENSEES of pubs owned by Inntrepreneur Estates, the Grand
Metropolitan/Courage joint venture company, will picket GrandMet's annual
meeting in London today to protest against 'excessive' rents charged on
their long-term leases.
Some of the landlords have acquired GrandMet shares so they can carry their
protest into the meeting with questions to Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and
chief executive, of the food, drinks and retailing group.
Mr Martin Moore, landlord of The Bridge in Uckfield, East Sussex, said
yesterday: 'Hundreds of licensees are being pushed towards bankruptcy
because of rents and other charges which are just too high for pubs to bear
in a recession.'
Mrs Trisha Boyce, of Alcombe, Somerset, organised the National Association
of Inntrepreneur Licensees to fight the terms of the leases. It is seeking,
for example, to challenge some provisions of the agreements in court.
She said that her association, formed five months ago, now had more than 800
members.
Inntrepreneur, established two years ago in the Pounds 2.36bn
pub-for-breweries deal between GrandMet and Courage, owns about 6,850 pubs.
The estate is managed by GrandMet and most of its beer is supplied by
Courage.
GrandMet's policy has been to convert the tenanted pubs in the estate to
long-term assignable leases. The group said that 4,700 pubs, about 65 per
cent, were now leased. 'The leases are popular,' it said. 'Last year, during
some of the worst trading conditions ever, 1,372 were signed.'
Government orders required 1,900 pubs to be freed from the exclusive supply
contract with Courage last November. This triggered rent reviews. Higher
rents were charged to reflect the licensee's freedom to obtain beer supplies
from any brewer.
But rents were freely negotiated and where disputes arose they could be
settled by arbitration, GrandMet said. Those protesting were a very small
minority of leaseholders - 'probably less than a hundred'.
Inntrepreneur achieved a trading profit of Pounds 162m in 1992, but after
interest charges recorded an loss of Pounds 28m.
GrandMet said yesterday that Inntrepreneur was trading well and its
operations were in line with forecasts.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Takeover flood as UK water spreads out: Groups are
diversifying ahead of tighter regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's financial advisers should drink a toast to the UK water sector.
Since privatisation in 1989, the water companies have blazed an acquisitions
trail while other takeover activity has been muted by recession.
So far this year, six of the 10 companies have made sizeable acquisitions.
Yesterday, Welsh Water paid up to Pounds 56.1m for engineering consultant
Acer Group, which is mainly involved in the transport and water sectors. Mr
John Elfed Jones, chairman, said the purchase allowed Welsh to move into
overseas markets.
But the rush to build up unregulated businesses has so far seen few
successes, raising fears companies are paying too much for underperforming
assets. Critics say some managements, freed from public sector control, have
been too eager to acquire new businesses and lack experience in evaluating
takeover targets. Meanwhile, companies have often found themselves bidding
against each other and driving up prices.
According to one merchant banker advising vendors, the water companies are a
'slightly soft sell' because of their strong balance sheets, inherited from
privatisation, and a regulatory regime which guarantees price rises above
inflation. 'They've got the cash and diversification makes good sense,
although you sense some are simply keeping up with their peers,' he said.
Companies are diversifying mainly because regulation is likely to become
tougher after 1995, when Ofwat concludes its interim review of pricing.
Companies which can generate non-regulated profits will be able to use them
to maintain dividend growth in case profits from regulated activities are
flat.
For some smaller companies, perhaps only Wessex and Northumbrian,
unregulated profits could contribute perhaps a third of total profits by the
end of the decade. But for most of the companies, earnings from core water
services will continue to overshadow unregulated businesses, which will
contribute 10-20 per cent of profits at best.
All the 10 water companies have now established non-core divisions through
acquisition or joint venture, usually in process engineering or waste
management. So far this year, they have spent more than Pounds 250m on
purchases. In the largest, Wessex Waste Management (WWM), the joint venture
between Wessex Water and Waste Management International of the US, bought
NFC's waste arm for Pounds 113m.
Other deals are expected. Tarmac's Econowaste is up for sale and some
companies may be interested in Biwater, the privately-owned water
engineering company. Further overseas expansion is also likely and Merck,
the US pharmaceutical group, has put its Calgon Water Management subsidiary
up for sale.
But most of the acquisitions since privatisation are performing poorly.
Biffa, the waste management company bought for Pounds 212m by Severn Trent
in 1991, remains loss-making after interest costs. Thames Water, which has
spent about Pounds 120m building up a process engineering division,
generated a pre-tax profit margin of less than 3 per cent from the division
last year, and is not expected to improve greatly before 1995. North West
Water's process and environmental engineering businesses, built up at a cost
of about Pounds 110m, is earning similar returns.
The water companies claim, with justification, that it is too early to judge
the success or otherwise of acquisitions. Most have been affected by
recession and most, like Biffa, were bought as long-term businesses. Mr
David Luffrum, group finance director at Thames, said water utilities can
afford to think long term. 'It's less important for (the unregulated
businesses) to be profitable at the moment than with a company struggling
for liquidity,' he said.
Nevertheless, water companies have been paying very handsome prices,
especially if the assets acquired are not expected to perform in the short
term. In January, South West Water paid English China Clays Pounds 27.5m for
Haul-Waste, at an historic price/earnings ratio of 32 times. This month WWM
bought NFC's waste division at more than 30 times historic earnings.
Both companies believe they paid a fair price because of potential growth in
the waste management industry, and forecast improvement in margins. WWM also
hopes for about Pounds 3m of efficiency savings.
But in several deals, the price paid seems to have been bid up by other
water companies. Anglian Water, which paid Pounds 36m for Nordic Water
earlier this month, is understood to have outbid North West Water. North
West is also thought to have been interested in Simon Hartley, which Thames
eventually bought for Pounds 20.2m in January. In the best example of
competitive bidding, Severn Trent won Biffa from the jaws of at least two
other companies, Yorkshire and Anglian.
Companies can afford inflated prices partly because their balance sheets are
so strong. At privatisation, the government wrote off all debts, and several
companies retain net cash in spite of heavy capital spending.
Most of the larger acquisitions have involved significant goodwill
write-offs. For example, WWM's Pounds 106.5m purchase of Wimpey Waste
Management in October 1991 led to goodwill write-offs of nearly Pounds 100m
after fair value adjustments. '(Companies) are typically writing down fixed
assets, which means less depreciation, thereby boosting the profits stream,'
according to Mr Robert Miller-Bakewell, analyst at NatWest Securities.
Water companies claim their diversification into new and related areas has
been logical. For example, companies already had experience of process
engineering through their work with sewage treatment. Both Thames and North
West Water have been able to use their expanded engineering and water
management experience to bid for overseas contracts.
The move into waste management is less clear cut. Companies do have
experience of liquid waste disposal, and of working with environmental
standards. Several companies, such as Yorkshire Water, have made small
acquisitions to expand existing liquid waste disposal businesses. But large
acquisitions of solid waste collection and disposal companies, such as Biffa
and Haul-Waste, are open to criticism, especially as some companies have
underestimated the effects of recession on waste management.
Some observers argue that water companies are ill suited to manage assets
such as dustcarts or landfill sites. Moving into waste management is
therefore a risky diversification from the water business, rather than an
extension of it.
Mr Roderick Paul, chief executive of Severn Trent, agreed that moving into
waste management was a diversification, but said all companies' acquisition
strategies were reactions to the larger risk of tighter regulation. 'We
asked, 'Is there something else which is at least a sensible thing for you
to do, with at least some overlap?',' he said.
Some analysts are not so sure. 'If the companies are right, they will make a
lot of money. If they are wrong, it's going to be expensive,' said one.

FT  23 FEB 93 / UK recession enters 10th quarter: GDP figures better than
expected; Long-term jobless figure tops 1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FALLING OUTPUT in manufacturing and services dragged Brit- ain into its
tenth quarter of recession at the end of last year, making this the longest
period of economic decline since the second world war.
Increased oil and gas production led to a slight increase in gross domestic
product during the second half of last year, but the Treasury yesterday
declined to say the recession had ended.
An official pointed to the continuing decline in onshore activity which
affects the overwhelming majority of the British people and said figures
from the Central Statistical Office showed 'that the economy had been
broadly flat since the end of 1991'.
The CSO said seasonally ad- justed GDP, the broadest measure of economic
activity, was 0.2 per cent higher in the last three months of 1992 than the
previous quarter, but 0.1 per cent lower than in the final quarter of 1991.
Without oil and gas, output showed a small decline. In October, November and
December it fell by 0.1 per cent against the previous quarter and by 0.2 per
cent against the same period in 1991. The latest quarter was the ninth
consecutive quarter in which onshore GDP recorded a fall compared with the
previous year. Compared with the previous quarter, GDP excluding oil and gas
has fallen in nine out of the past 10 quarters.
Output during 1992 as a whole was 0.5 per cent lower than 1991. Excluding
oil and gas, GDP was 0.7 per cent below the previous year's level, the CSO
said.
From its cyclical peak in the second quarter of 1990 to its trough at the
middle of last year, overall GDP fell by 4 per cent. GDP excluding oil and
gas has fallen by 3.9 per cent in the period to the end of last year. This
is still short of the 6.2 per cent drop in non-oil GDP recorded in the
1979-81 recession.
Yesterday's GDP figures were slightly better than expected in the City.
Nevertheless, Mr Robert Lind, an economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said he
expected 'a further decline in onshore GDP in the first quarter of 1993'.
For the whole of this year independent economists predict growth of about 1
per cent, led by manufacturing.
However, a report published yesterday by Business Strategies, a consultancy,
warned that manufacturing would provide only a modest lift and that high
unemployment would be a 'huge burden' into the late 1990s.
The employment department is due to reveal today that the number of people
out of work for longer than a year has risen over the past nine quarters.
The figure for the final quarter of 1992 is expected to top 1m, against
956,000 in the previous quarter.
The long-term unemployment total was last over 1m in the summer of 1988.
The sharpest output decline in the latest quarter is believed to have
occurred in the construction sector. Precise figures are not yet available,
but the CSO estimates it fell by about 1 per cent over the previous quarter.
Service sector output fell 0.1 per cent compared with the third quarter, and
manufacturing dropped 0.2 per cent. This drop was balanced by a 6.3 per cent
quarterly growth in oil and gas. Activity in transport and communications,
public administration and other energy sectors also rose slightly over the
period.
Hotel and catering, education and health sector output remained largely
flat.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Paris urges EC to curb imports of cheap fish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government yesterday called on the European Community to curb the
surge of cheap fish imports which has caused a rising tide of complaints and
protests in Brittany, the country's main fishing region.
As several small Breton ports were closed yesterday afternoon in sympathy
with their fishermen, Mr Charles Josselin, the French secretary of state for
maritime affairs, pressed the case for EC import restrictions with Mr
Jacques Delors, the European Commission president.
France wants the Commission to invoke a Gatt safeguard clause and block fish
imports temporarily, or to set a minimum price for such imports. Cheap fish
imports have depressed French prices by up to 30 per cent.
After meeting industry representatives, the EC looked set yesterday to fix
minimum import prices on white fish coming into the EC. Fisheries officials
said such emergency measures would be in line with the EC fisheries regime
and compatible with international trade rules.
The Commission was also in contact with envoys from Russia, Poland, Iceland
and Norway - the main sources of the cheap fish - to underline the
'sensitivity' of the issue.
A final decision on import prices is expected tomorrow.
Earlier yesterday, Mr Josselin met fishermen's representatives in Rennes to
explain his plan to give them FFr272m (Pounds 33.8m) in subsidised loans and
emergency aid. The national aid scheme was 'well received', claimed Mr
Josselin's spokesman. But a fishing industry representative in Concarneau
criticised Mr Josselin for not going far enough in giving fishermen six
months to pay social security charges. If there was no pick-up in the
market, industry officials said they would not be 'able to pay the charges
in six months' time'.
Concarneau joined the ports of Douarnenez and Le Guilvinec in a concerted
shutdown yesterday. Its shops and public facilities closed in sympathy with
the fishermen who number 2,500 of its 19,000 population. Half France's total
fishing fleet, comprising 18,000 men on some 4,000 boats, are based in
Brittany.
The targets of Breton displeasure also lie inside the Community. Over the
weekend, Breton fishermen in Roscoff ransacked a warehouse of imported fish
and frightened British drivers of refrigerated trucks on a ferry into
landing their fish elsewhere in France.
The recent depreciation of sterling and the peseta against the franc has
exposed French fishermen to sharp competition from the UK and Spain. In
contrast to farm products, there is no EC scheme to insulate the Community
fish market from fluctuations in national currencies.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Branson gives BA 24 hours to settle over 'dirty tricks'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD Branson, the head of Virgin Atlantic, yesterday gave British
Airways 24 hours to settle their 'dirty tricks' battle.
Mr Branson wants BA to agree compensation for the damage inflicted on his
airline by BA's campaign or face the threat of renewed legal action.
Meanwhile, BA said last night that it would look into allegations made on
ITN that airline employees in Los Angeles had continued to try to poach
Virgin passengers after the airline had pledged not to do so again.
Virgin has previously set deadlines as part of its tactics to reach an early
settlement with BA, following last month's Pounds 610,000 libel victory
against its competitor. But on each occasion it has been prepared to let
talks continue after the expiry of the deadline in the hope of a
breakthrough.
The smaller airline, however, last night appeared poised to break off talks
and carry out its threat to pursue its claims of anti-competitive activities
against BA through the courts.
Speaking at Heathrow airport at the opening of a new departure lounge for
Virgin passengers, Mr Branson said that, without progress towards an
agreement over the next 24 hours, 'there is no point in carrying on'.
He added: 'We lost a great deal of money because of their tactics and need
compensation. We don't want to see things dragged on indefinitely but they
are repeatedly delaying a solution to the problem.'
Last night, BA said it had agreed to make no comment on the talks and that
it did not intend to respond to Mr Branson's remarks.
Talks began three weeks ago in an atmosphere of optimism, involving Mr Sid
Pennington, managing director of Virgin Atlantic, Mr Trevor Abbott,
financial adviser to Mr Branson and Mr Robert Ayling, BA's newly-appointed
group managing director.
But relations between the two sides deteriorated a week ago, following the
disclosure of a letter from BA to Virgin setting out proposals to settle the
dispute. Virgin said the terms - which included a Pounds 3m payment - were
not acceptable.
Virgin has said throughout that it will consider mounting anti-competitive
cases against BA in the US and Europe unless compensation can be agreed.
The allegations that BA is continuing to try to poach Virgin passengers
centred on statements from a Los Angeles-based travel agent that BA staff,
under the mistaken impression that he was a Virgin passenger, had attempted
to persuade him to switch flights to BA.

FT  23 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Queens Moat Houses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Queens Moat's agreement to convert another eight hotels into Holiday Inn
franchises is a sensible, if modest, step in its quest to improve room usage
rates with the barest possible capital outlay. By tapping into Holiday Inn's
international reservations network, Queens Moat aims to increase its
occupancy rates from 65 per cent to more than 70 per cent. Its experience of
running 19 Holiday Inn hotels in mainland Europe shows this to be feasible.
Queens Moat shareholders would doubtless be pleased if their company could
extend the arrangement, as suggested in yesterday's announcement. Investors
in Bass, though, may balk at too great an entanglement, given Queens Moat's
stretched balance sheet. The market was certainly relieved that Bass did not
buy an equity stake, as had been rumoured.
The far bigger challenge facing Queens Moat, however, is to drive down its
borrowings, which may have escalated to close to Pounds 1bn by the year-end.
The company cannot rely on trading income alone to make much of a dent in
its debt. A rights issue seems impractical, given Queen Moat's profligacy
with paper in the past. Asset disposals will remain tricky until the
property market perks up.
An additional worry is Queens Moat's heavy exposure to mainland Europe.
Although this helped protect the company during the UK downturn, it may act
as a drag on the share price just as recovery starts in its domestic market.

FT  23 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Gold shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold bullion may still look a pretty dull investment but, curiously, shares
in gold mining stocks have glittered in recent months. The FT Gold Mines
Index has climbed by 46 per cent since the start of the year, largely
reflecting a 28 per cent appreciation in the South African stock exchange's
gold sector.
South African shares have been buoyed by overseas buying, particularly from
the US and, latterly, Europe. Worries about South Africa's political
instability have eased while ethical restrictions on investment have
loosened. The South African gold sector was looking distinctly oversold and
the yields of good quality stocks attractive. Even now, many stocks still
yield in excess of 10 per cent, compared with the 1-3 per cent available
from comparable US companies.
Foreign investors also benefit from buying shares with restricted financial
rands but receiving dividends in commonly-traded commercial rands. The
discount between the two, which effectively acts as a barometer of
foreigners' perceptions of investment risk, has recently narrowed to 30 per
cent. But it still strongly accentuates investment returns.
Gold stocks may run ahead for a while yet as yields continue to entice
investors. But for the rise to be sustained much longer will either require
a rise in gold bullion prices or increased buying from South African
institutions. The trouble is that several countries' central banks are
running down their gold reserves. South African investors may also try to
exploit the spike in gold shares by reducing overweight holdings.

FT  23 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Shell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
However lawyers and accountants try to inflate the importance of compliance
bureaucracy, the security of dealing rooms will always be dependent on the
honesty of the people who work there. A sufficiently determined individual
can subvert almost any system. So it is hard to go along with the standard
denunciation of Shell's Japanese debacle.
It is more interesting to trace the reasons for the failure. Shell has a
decentralised management structure which, while much admired, may well have
contributed to the problem. It also has only a 50 per cent stake in Showa
Shell Sekiyu - limiting its control. Japanese political sensitivities may
have meant that the refiner was run even more at arm's length than usual
with such ventures. The large volumes of low margin transactions which such
refining and marketing operations handle as a matter of course may also have
made it easier to hide the unauthorised deals.
Even so, the scale of the operation is breathtaking, and it is no tribute to
Japanese accounting standards that the irregularities seem to have gone
undetected for several years. Shell may now correct specific errors and take
a firmer grip on its subsidiaries. Yet the episode only highlights the
increasing dependence of large oil companies on sophisticated treasury
operations. Even when the trading is authorised, it carries risks which few
investors bother to contemplate. Fortunately in this case the company can
afford the hit.

FT  23 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Japan's hard choices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The foreign exchange markets seem to have decided that the forthcoming G7
meeting will push for a further appreciation of the yen. In part, that
follows from weekend comments by the US treasury secretary, Lloyd Bentsen.
But it also seems to fit with wider concerns about the size of Japan's trade
surplus. Most G7 members - including apparently the Japanese - think a
higher yen is the best way naturally to curb Japanese exports and promote
imports.
It is by no means certain, however, that G7 members are really prepared to
take the necessary action to force the yen higher. It is inconceivable, for
example, that the Bank of Japan will increase official interest rates so
soon after lowering them. Further fiscal packages to stimulate the economy
are more likely, but their timing and size are unclear. Fear of higher
budget deficits within the Ministry of Finance may limit the scope of tax
cuts and even a substantial fiscal loosening may not be enough to stop
scared Japanese salarymen squirreling money away.
On the other side, the Bundesbank, having resisted French calls for lower
rates for so long, is unlikely to give in to Japanese blandishments. Mr Alan
Greenspan also has his own domestic agenda which may not include lower
interest rates in the near term. Besides, it is far from clear that the
Japanese economy is in any fit state to take the pain which its exporting
manufacturers would suffer. With the hole in balance sheets large and
earnings already low, the stock market would look even more vulnerable.
Given that the likely alternative is the threat of trade sanctions, the
Japanese financial system is in a tough spot.

Scisne Latine? While the answer is 'probably not' these days, surviving
students of the Roman tongue will be glad to know that Glasgow University
has decided to retain the use of Latin in official ceremonies.
But to help those unblessed by a classical education, one of the staff has
produced the following glossary of certain key phrases:
Quod erat demonstrandum - The students were protesting.
Ex gratia - Service-charge not included.
Cogito ergo sum - I think you've added it up wrongly.
Ad infinitum - Extra-long commercial.
Et in arcadia ego - I lunched in the shopping mall.
The staff member responsible, by the way, is not from Glasgow's classics
department. He is John Espiner, of Barclays Bank, working on secondment in
the university's planning office.

It is more than four years since European Community president Jacques Delors
made his rousing speech at Britain's Trades Union Congress in support of a
social Europe which so upset Mrs Thatcher.
Hence, it is rather surprising to learn that the TUC has only just agreed to
follow some of its more go-ahead members and open an office in Brussels. But
at least there shouldn't be any lack of contenders to run the new outpost,
given that the TUC's domestic career opportunities look so bleak.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Observer: Halifax's top gun
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If the Halifax were going to recruit a new chief executive from within the
ranks of the building society movement, then Mike Blackburn seems as good a
choice as any.
He has knocked the Leeds Permanent Building society into shape during his
five years at the helm and he has proved far more rebellious than the
average building society boss when it comes to questioning government
policies.
However, the Halifax is a good three times bigger than the Leeds Permanent
and it will be interesting to see whether its board allows Blackburn such
freedom of expression, especially if it is wanting government help to smooth
its passage to the stock market at some stage.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Who are the latest victims of Japan's downturn? Its organised crime gangs,
whose decline has been charted with not just typical precision, but apparent
orderliness.
A survey of police stations around the country shows there are 39,000 gangs,
many of them officially registered under the so-called 'anti-gang' law
introduced last year. Taken together, they currently have 80,000 employees -
5,000 down on March 1992. What's more, about 132 of the employers have gone
out of business.
In the meantime, 281 instructions have been issued forbidding gangs to
undertake illegal activities such as extortion or preventing their members
from quitting.
Even so, as the newspaper Yomiuri Shimbum reports in shocked tones, in six
cases second warnings had to be given before the gangs took any real notice.
Fortunately, many other gangsters gave up like good Japanese citizens,
sending the police no fewer than 219 guns. Four in Nara prefecture went
further. Such was their depression at their loss of income that they
committed suicide.

If seven members of BTR's 13-strong board have 'executive responsibilities',
does it mean that the other six are non-executive directors?
The question is raised by a curious press release from BTR yesterday which
seemed to throw into some doubt BTR chairman Sir Owen Green's long-held view
that there was no such thing as a non-executive director of BTR.
Sir Owen, who is due to bow out after this year's annual general meeting,
was suitably elliptical on the subject and said that, just because some of
his fellow directors did not have executive responsibilities at BTR, it did
not make them non-executives.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Observer: Military efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's cabinet office efficiency unit should soon be showing military
precision in its attack on Whitehall's cobwebs. From March its new head is
to be John Oughton, redeployed from the defence ministry to succeed Don
Brereton, who's being posted back to the social security department.
Even before the change the defence contingent was well entrenched in the
cabinet office. Sir Peter Levene - the prime minister's efficiency adviser,
no less - is a former chief of defence procurement. As Oughton was once his
private secretary, he should have no trouble in keeping the new recruit in
step.
Moreover Oughton will be rejoining another of his former commandants in
Richard Mottram, now top mandarin in the office of public service and
science, who also served in the defence ministry. One of his jobs there was
to head the 'options for change' exercise to reshape defence policy after
the cold war, with Oughton under him in charge of naval aspects.
Finally, there's Sir James Blyth, the businessman who chairs the cabinet
office's Citizen's Charter advisory panel. He was once head of defence sales
at a time when, oddly enough, a promising young civil servant called John
Oughton conducted an efficiency scrutiny of the organisation.
Besides making such good connections, Oughton has been responsible for the
defence ministry's relations with its private-sector contractors. So he
should be well armed to advance the market-testing programme in Whitehall,
so dashingly launched by the departing Brereton.

FT  23 FEB 93 / The dangers that lurk in delay: Late payments are behind a
growing number of corporate casualties in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Baroness Denton of Wakefield, the UK minister for small businesses, has some
handy hints for companies at their wits' end over the late payment of bills.
They include nocturnal telephone calls to the offending company's chairman
and sending scruffy teenagers to squat in reception.
The minister may be half-joking, but the problem of late payment, now
enveloping companies of every type and size, is no laughing matter. She
says: 'There are real, moral issues here which must be addressed if we are
to stop companies from needlessly going bust.'
It is already too late for Mr Harry Aitchison, whose Manchester-based
carpentry business has just joined the 20 UK companies expiring daily. 'My
customers killed me,' he says 'The bank pulled the plug for Pounds 22,000
when I had Pounds 60,000 overdue.'
A time lag in paying suppliers provides a legitimate form of inter-company
credit, and gives customers the chance to check the quality of goods and
services. But when the practice is abused, suppliers' cash positions
deteriorate and interest charges and production costs escalate. Creditor
companies then delay paying their own debts to avoid more costly sources of
finance.
Recession-hit companies now speak of a crisis within a business community
unable or unwilling to break free from a vicious circle of overdue debt.
The disease, however, is not peculiarly British. The European Commission has
just launched an investigation into late payment, which is 'spreading
contagiously' throughout the Community.
Some member states are so alarmed they are considering using competition law
to impose financial penalties on offending companies.
The Association of British Factors and Discounters, whose members provide
cash against unpaid invoices, warns that hopes for higher UK sales in Europe
following last September's sterling devaluation are threatened because
spreading recession is lengthening payment delays. It claims the time taken
for European companies to pay increased on average by a third in 1992. Even
in Germany, where payment practices are held to be exemplary, payment
periods have stretched from 30 to 50 days.
In the UK, a survey this month from Trade Indemnity, the credit insurer,
underlines the problem. It shows that, in December, only 3 per cent of
nearly 600 companies contacted were being paid on time.
Businesses report they are having to wait, on average, nearly one month
beyond the agreed date of payment - itself often 30 days after delivery. The
average value of debt per company at least 30 days outstanding was more than
Pounds 120,000, with engineering, construction, steel and paper sectors
suffering most from large, overdue debt.
The government and the private sector are promoting a number of voluntary
initiatives to try to combat the damaging drift of indebtedness. But there
are doubts about their effectiveness.
Only one piece of legislation is planned so far. By the end of 1993, large
companies are likely to be required to state in notes to their accounts the
average time taken to pay their bills. In a consultative document, published
last month, the Department of Trade and Industry defines 'large' as any
company which satisfies at least two of the following conditions: a turnover
of more than Pounds 11.2m, a balance sheet total exceeding Pounds 3.9m, or
more than 250 employees.
Critics say the measure has no teeth - the only penalty for poor performance
will be the wrath of suppliers - and that companies will be able to
manipulate their record by behaving impeccably while they monitor their
payment performance.
Mr Martin Simons, former head of competitor analysis at Imperial Chemical
Industries, says the proposals are open to abuse and wants an industry-wide,
standard payment term of about 35 days following the date of invoice.
'Funds would flow more steadily and there would be more effective credit
control. Debt would be half the level experienced under the present, archaic
free-for-all.
'It would eliminate the common practice of ordering a small consignment at
the end of a month, which attracts agreed credit of 20 or 30 days, followed
by placing a bigger order at the start of the next month, attracting up to
60 days' credit,' Mr Simons adds.
Ministers accept that the public sector must lead by example: all government
departments claim they insist their main contractors ordinarily pay their
own suppliers within 30 days. However, the Property Services Agency, which
manages the government's property estate, has just admitted making
contractors wait months for payment, until it has been paid by other
government departments.
The Confederation of British Industry, which has said that late payment
threatens the survival of one in five companies, has a 'prompt payers' code.
It calls for a 'clear, consistent' payment policy and a system of dealing
quickly with complaints.
Only 400 businesses from its 25,000-strong membership have so far signed up,
but they include some of Britain's largest companies, such as Esso, Boots,
British Airways and Glaxo.
Dr Ian Peters, a CBI deputy director, says: 'It's a question of business
culture. No one wants to pay up until they are forced to.
'If there is any hope of winning the battle, the big companies have to show
the way. Some of them have terrible payment records and exploit a smaller
supplier's reluctance to cause a fuss.'
Mr David Frost, chief executive of Walsall Chamber of Commerce, which is
running an experimental, government-funded hotline for company debt
problems, agrees: 'The biggest fear is upsetting customers. If you push too
hard, they will think you are going broke or tell you to get lost because
other companies are hungry for work.'
Beyond the present initiatives, a majority of small and medium-sized
businesses now appears to support the introduction of a legal right to
interest on outstanding debts - in force in all EC member states except the
UK and Ireland. Ministers concede there are powerful arguments for a
statutory right of interest, but stress companies must be free to agree the
contract terms. They do not exclude more legislation to enforce better
behaviour.
Some British companies already include in contracts interest penalties for
late payment, but few take the uncertain path of seeking compensation
through the courts.
Nor is there much evidence from Europe that a right to interest means prompt
payment. The Commission acknowledges that penalties are rarely demanded or
paid, while debt recovery in most European countries still invariably
entails court proceedings.
Mr Tim Devlin, Conservative MP for Stockton South, is more enthusiastic:
'The mere threat of punitive interest penalties would make many companies
pay up and help bring about the culture change we desperately need.'
Though less convinced about the role of legislation, organisations such as
the CBI and the Federation of Small Businesses agree that streamlined court
procedures for debt recovery must accompany any moves to improve corporate
payment behaviour.
The government has pledged to speed up and simplify cumbersome and costly
commercial debt recovery procedures, though business is sceptical it will
achieve real improvements. The Lord Chancellor has already rejected a CBI
plan for an independent debt tribunal which would hear disputed payment
cases.
But companies are also accused of not helping themselves. According to Ms
Barbara Bennett, a spokeswoman for Trade Indemnity: 'The root of the problem
is that credit control is regarded as a Cinderella activity, handed down to
someone with low status on poor pay. Business must get to grips with credit
management if things are to improve.'
Up to a third of companies do not even have written payment terms. Mr Allen
Page, a director of Marlborough Management, a Buckinghamshire-based business
consultancy, says too many businesses are sales-driven and ignore vital
financial disciplines.
'You can add legislation on late payment for ever and a day, with little
effect. Companies have to end their damaging ambiguities on credit policy,
sharpen up control procedures and get tougher.'
Mr Page makes another point: 'A lot of companies don't get paid on time
because they have provided a shoddy, unsatisfactory service.
'Too often, holding back payment is the only weapon available. Whatever the
motive, it is a ruinous, cat-and-mouse game which no one can win.'

FT  23 FEB 93 / Personal View: Getting the benefit out of a job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DENNIS J SNOWER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most people greatly prefer to work for pay rather than receive government
support for remaining idle. Nevertheless, the present UK government - like
many of its predecessors and others elsewhere - discourages people from
working, by paying them when they are unemployed and then removing these
benefits and imposing taxes when they become employed again.
The most straightforward way out of this unemployment trap is to introduce a
policy that encourages employment. My proposal, the benefit transfer
programme (BTP), is designed to do just that. It would give the unemployed
the option of transferring all the funds that finance their benefits -
unemployment benefit, income support, and the associated rebates and
provisions in kind - to provide wage subsidies to the companies which hire
them. The size of the subsidy would depend on the length of each worker's
latest unemployment spell. Companies could qualify only if they increased
their workforces or provided the newly hired workers with training at least
equal in value to the subsidy. Thus, companies would have an incentive to
expand employment, rather than replace employees with subsidised ones.
Since the BTP would be voluntary, unemployed workers would transfer their
benefits only when the resulting wages would make them significantly better
off. Companies would hire these workers only when this raised profitability.
Since the total amount spent on the wage subsidies is equal to the amount
that would have been spent on unemployment support, all this could be
achieved at no extra cost to the government.
The programme would give the government an instrument for tackling head-on
the problem of long-term unemployment. When people fall into the
unemployment trap, their skills erode, they lose their motivation to find
jobs, and employers become wary of hiring them. The current unemployment
benefit system provides little countervailing incentive for the long-term
unemployed to find work. To give workers with different unemployment
histories a level playing field, the BTP provides progressively larger
incentives for companies to hire workers with longer unemployment spells.
People who have been unemployed for two years or longer would be entitled to
the maximum subsidy upon finding jobs. As their period of employment
proceeds, their subsidy would gradually fall, reaching zero after two years
of continuous employment. Those unemployed for a shorter period would
receive a correspondingly smaller subsidy over a shorter time span. Since
the long-term unemployment rate has no significant effect on wage growth,
reducing the number of long-term unemployed would not be inflationary.
The BTP is unlikely to affect real wages markedly: although a tightening of
the labour market would improve employees' negotiating positions, the
subsidies would improve companies' positions as well. The programme may,
however, be expected to have a substantial impact on unemployment. The
average unemployment benefit package amounts to about 40 per cent of the
average UK wage, corresponding to a 40 per cent wage subsidy, on average, in
the BTP. Assuming half the funds financing the current unemployment benefit
package were used to finance the wage subsidies, the average subsidy would
be 20 per cent.
Given that the subsidies would have no pronounced effect on the real wages
received by workers, standard estimates of UK employment equations lead us
to expect that a 20 per cent reduction in the real wages paid by companies
would increase employment by about 6-8 per cent, thereby reducing
unemployment to about a half or even a quarter of its present level.
This would still leave half of the funds financing the current unemployment
benefit package to cover a variety of possible slippages: subsidies claimed,
say, by unemployed who would have found jobs anyway.
Needless to say, the BTP would be no panacea. But it provides a mechanism
for unemployed workers to find work voluntarily at the prevailing wages and
for companies to reduce labour costs and increase profitability - all
without stimulating inflation or raising government spending.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIONS HASTILY conceived in circumstances of national outcry are often
later regretted or simply turn out to have been nugatory. The effectiveness
of the English criminal justice system has been seriously weakened by
miscarriages of justice perpetrated at times of public outrage after
horrible terrorist bombings. A series of vicious attacks by dogs two years
ago produced the Dangerous Dogs Act which has failed to rid Britain of
killer dogs but provided lawyers with work defining breeds.
There is a similar peril in the present moral panic over the killing on
Merseyside of a two-year-old boy, apparently by older children. The intense
media coverage has led many to suppose that the UK has become engulfed in a
tide of violent crime. Several recent news stories have been cheaply and
misleadingly linked to suggest that children are at the forefront of the
crimewave.
Recorded crime rates have certainly risen, as in almost every other advanced
economy. But fear of crime has risen much faster. And there is, sadly,
nothing new about children killing other children - as those with memories
long enough to remember the case of Mary Bell will know.
Such considerations count for little, however, when politicians scent an
issue of popular concern. The parties vie to demonstrate their commitment to
ever-stronger measures, with little consideration of their efficacy. The
prime minister is right to call for greater condemnation of violent crime.
But his corollary of less effort to understand the criminal is exactly what
is not needed. Much more work is required to examine the many factors which
lie behind increased crime rates.
These include unemployment, which has left pockets of deprivation in many
large cities where crime is seen as the only way of acquiring material
wealth. There is the failure of schools which send 40 per cent of students
to further education colleges with inadequate numeracy and literacy skills,
along with vocational training system still very much in the throes of
uncertain reform. There is the erosion of the nuclear family, which provided
two adults to share the burden of parenthood. And there is the question of
violence in the media, which may create an impression that violence is the
norm.
There is also the easy availability of drugs, trafficking in which offers
financial rewards way beyond those possible through hard work. Those
attractions are enhanced at a time of few job opportunities for young people
with no qualifications.
There will be disagreements over the weight to be assigned to each of these
and to many other relevant factors. But anyone who hopes to contribute to
solutions must recognise that dealing with this complex issue needs
multifaceted policies managed with skill and determination over long
periods. That is the note the government needs to strike in the coming days.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Paying for roads
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH BRITAIN'S railways facing privatisation, there is symmetry in the idea
of putting the roads on a commercial basis too. Why, after all, should they
be exempt from a process that has touched every other part of the nation's
transport infrastructure?
Up until now, the lack of any income stream from the roads has rendered the
notion futile. But that could change: a green paper in April will explore
the possibility of introducing tolls on trunk roads and motorways to help
finance new roadbuilding, while in the longer term, the government is
talking of introducing electronic road pricing in urban areas to tackle
traffic congestion.
Political risks apart, the notion of road charging must be attractive to any
government: it offers the opportunity of opening up a very substantial
source of revenue while simultaneously being seen as encouraging an
environmentally friendly switch of passenger and goods traffic to public
transport. Even so, it raises some awkward questions.
In the case of trunk roads and motorways, one argument for tolls is that
they would help fund the construction of new capacity. But Britain's trunk
roads and motorways were not built as toll roads, so a toll system could
prove appallingly expensive to instal and might also be costly to run. If
so, the equivalent sums could be raised more cost-effectively through the
existing system of fuel and vehicle taxes.
The other main argument for tolls is that they are necessary to provide a
framework in which the private sector will go into business building and
operating roads at a profit. But the private sector already builds roads on
the government's behalf. If the government wants the private sector to fund
them, too, it is not clear what is wrong with asking it to go on doing so as
it already does: through the gilts market.
Much stronger arguments exist for road pricing in urban areas. Here, where
more roadbuilding is usually impractical, high user charges on busy routes
would be a much more efficient way of rationing available space than
congestion, and the proceeds could be ploughed into better public transport.
Yet this idea has taken a back seat to the toll roads plan.
The government is in danger of getting itself into a muddle over road user
charges. Already, suspicions are aroused. Will the proceeds from tolls
really be applied to building better roads, or will they simply represent a
new source of taxation? Is there really an environmentally friendly angle to
the plan, or is it more to do with the government's determination to keep
the privatisation show running? Why press ahead with toll roads at a time
when urban road pricing looks a much higher priority?
The green paper will need to produce some convincing answers to questions
like these if it is to convince a sceptical motoring public that the
benefits of toll roads will outweigh the costs.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Leading Article: When Brussels lacks steel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LITTLE BY little, the rationalisation of the European steel industry seems
to be slipping into the dateless future. This Thursday's meeting of EC
industry ministers was supposed to be making concrete decisions on capacity
cuts, aid and imports. Instead, it is to pass a resolution broadly
supporting an outline plan yet to be drawn up by the EC Commission. If this
sounds wishy-washy, it is probably meant to be. Killing off steel plants is
a politically hazardous business. If the trigger must be pulled, no one
wants their prints on the gun.
It is possible to feel a twinge of sympathy. Even the more extreme ideas
emanating from the Commission are too half-hearted to be worth taking risks
for. The ideal result would be a European steel industry which is not just
smaller than now, but is concentrated on the most efficient plants. No
mechanism has even been suggested for bringing this about. If agreement were
reached on taking out capacity, it would be left to the steel companies
themselves to thrash out who should close what. This cartel approach
certainly has the virtue of simplicity. Whether the result would approximate
to a market-based solution, or indeed serve the interests of consumers, is
another matter.
It might be argued that no such immediate solution was on the cards.
Politics is inherent in European steel, if only as a matter of history.
Perhaps all Brussels can hope to do is to hand out central cash to persuade
member states to spend less on individual subsidies. That way, the
disciplines of the market may be allowed to work more effectively in the
long run. The alternative would be for the EC to specify which plants should
be closed. Not only would that further step be politically impossible: it is
far from clear that the EC is equipped to take it.
The one matter which is wholly within the jurisdiction of Brussels is that
of steel imports from eastern Europe. Here the EC faces a genuine dilemma.
It is doubtless true that, at the margin, imports from the east are
disruptive. If obsolete plants are run for cash with no thought of
replacement, a business run as a going concern cannot hope to compete on
price. Thus, to allow free access to eastern steel risks adding to the ranks
of jobless EC steelworkers. The snag is that the alternative might be
playing host to jobless Polish and Czech steelworkers instead.
In such a situation, the only answer is compromise. But in debating how much
subsidy and protection to allow, Brussels should remind itself of a simple
fact. In the face of small-scale, flexible methods of steel production,
Europe's huge integrated steel mills may be industrial dinosaurs anyway. The
longer they are propped up, the more the EC risks ending up without a steel
industry in the long run. In terms of comparative advantage, that need not
necessarily be a bad thing. But in social as well as economic terms, it
points an obvious moral. Rather than keep workers unproductively employed,
the trick is to find them something better to do.

FT  23 FEB 93 / No need to lose our heads

<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY

<TEXT>
There is no need to panic. Britain is not in the grip of the spirit of evil,
although a casual visitor, picking up a paper at the airport, might be
forgiven for thinking so. Law and order has not broken down, although the
prime minister and the home secretary are beginning to speak as if it has.
In most places, most of the time, the streets are safe, although anecdotal
evidence suggests that they are not. We are in no danger of being torn to
pieces by marauding gangs of child criminals, led by new Lords of the Flies,
although that is what is intimated by some of the responses to last week's
tragic murder in Bootle, Liverpool, of two-year-old James Bulger and the
subsequent, shocking arrests of two 10-year-old boys charged with the crime.
As to the latter case, much is surmised, but little is known. A prosecutor's
account of what happened may not be available before March 3, when the boys
are next due to be brought before the court. Meanwhile, there is no
indication that the horrific abduction and murder of which they have been
accused is part of a general pattern. To say or imply, as many have, that
this dreadful event is symptomatic of what is wrong with British society is
cheap and easy, but almost certainly wrong.
Television pictures of two boys leading their tiny victim out of a shopping
precinct have aroused strong emotions in most of us. They have also given a
new, and unfortunate, impetus to the knee-jerk Right in its approach to all
juvenile crime. To be sure, whoever killed baby James should be locked up
and the key thrown away, but that has nothing to tell us about the
generality of young offenders, most of whom steal from cars or houses.
Putting a 15-year-old car thief into an old-fashioned (and currently
obsolete) approved school would guarantee that the Artful Dodger would
quickly become Bill Sikes.
No, I have not fallen into the hands of Hampstead do-gooders or, worse,
social workers. As the two larger political parties are now agreed,
persistent young offenders should be incarcerated, if only to protect their
potential victims. That, however, is the easy part. The far more difficult
task is to isolate the causes of crime, and to encourage local police
forces, teachers, parents, employers - everyone - to take whatever steps
seem likely to prevent this or that youngster from going wrong in the first
place. For that you need social workers.
Mr John Major appears to find this difficult to grasp. According to an
account in the Mail on Sunday, the prime minister told his interviewer that
'society needs to condemn a little more and understand a little less'. This
must rank as one of the more unfortunate pronouncements that Mr Major has
made, in tune with Lady Thatcher's 'there is no such thing as society'.
Disapproval of criminal behaviour is certainly necessary. We should condemn
wrongdoing before breakfast, lunch and dinner. But wilfully understand less?
The prime minister no doubt meant the excessive understanding that implies
forgiveness of all misdemeanours, as in the song, Gee, Officer Krupke, by
the 'distoibed' young Jets in West Side Story. If so, he should have made
himself clear.
Mr Kenneth Clarke is equally Delphic. He is selling bits of his soul for a
few right-wing credentials, using phrases such as - did I hear him right? -
'nasty little pieces of work'. Like Mr Major, the home secretary has been
jolted into such language by the appearance on the government's right flank
of Mr Tony Blair, Mr Blair is making a simple, but potentially devastating
political point. The Conservatives have been in office since 1979. Between
1980 and 1991 the number of notifiable offences recorded by the police
doubled. The Tories may have captured the market for rhetoric about being
tough on crime, but their methods have not worked. Mr Blair therefore offers
a new chant: Labour is tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime.
There is a certain amount of hokum in this. The statistics for recorded
crime are notoriously unreliable. Surveys suggest that three or four times
as many offences are committed as are put in the book by the police. The
propensity for victims to report and the police to record particular crimes
varies from place to place and year to year. We do not know, although many
of us feel, that the crime rate has increased sharply. Our politicians
correctly sense an upsurge of public disquiet about wrongdoing in general
and, for the moment, juvenile offenders in particular.
Mr Blair has responded to this with greater ingenuity than either the prime
minister or the home secretary. He has attempted to neutralise the argument
that Labour is 'soft on criminals' by attacking the government for not
providing enough 'secure places' for young offenders. At the same time,
Labour says, 'it is clear that drugs, drink, glue sniffing and truancy
increase the size and seriousness of the crime problem'.
In a thoughtful paper the party suggests practical improvements in the
present arrangements for handling young criminals. Many similar ideas are,
or soon will be, in Mr Clarke's mind. Labour says its first purpose is to
'stop youngsters getting into trouble', its second to divert first offenders
from a life of crime.
The theme has been taken up by another Labour politician, Mr David Blunkett,
the shadow secretary for health. He argues for 'full-time community service
for, say, a nine-month period for every young person between the ages of 16
and 21'. Such a domestic peace corps would certainly reduce crime, since
most of it is committed by teenage boys. It is an idea all parties should
work on, with some urgency.
Mr Blunkett's paper for Labour's commission on social justice contains
several suggestions as to how young people might be propelled into work.
'Those committed to a new 21st century welfare state,' he says, 'have to
cease what has been seen as paternalistic and well-meaning indulgence of the
sub-culture of thuggery, noise and nuisance, and anti-social behaviour,
often linked with drug abuse.'
Labour has correctly perceived that victims must be protected from
criminals. Everything that might prevent young people from turning to crime
must be tried, but there will be failures, persistent recidivists. They have
to be locked up, although there will be a price to pay. Meanwhile, there is
no need to lose our heads.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Letter: Fuel tax no answer to road congestion, and tolls may
need a sweetener
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GILES KEATING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Following my article, 'Absence of road pricing takes its toll'
(Personal View, February 11), Patrick Barr and B W Barton (Letters, February
15 and 17) suggested that higher fuel duties would be better than tolls.
Fuel duties are a reasonably good levy on pollution, but they bear little
relation to congestion and are unfair to country drivers. I could use 50
litres of petrol driving on empty rural roads in Scotland and cause no
congestion at all, while just 10 litres used in the rush hour in London or
on the M25 motorway would add to the tailbacks.
With electronic tolls, peak-hour drivers would pay a surcharge over normal
rates, and there would be discounts at night. That would cut congestion, so
bus companies and delivery companies would need fewer vehicles. Benefits
like that offset the costs to the economy of collecting tolls.
Christopher Raymond (Letters, February 16) argues that these benefits must
be balanced against people's dislike of paying tolls. Maybe a sweetener is
needed: every household could be given Pounds 1,000 worth of shares in the
road companies.
There would still be some Pounds 50bn of privatisation left for the
government.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Letter: US must plug the sinking ship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ERIK N DUNLEAVY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The US and its perennial budget deficits can be likened to an
overloaded ship with a hole in the bottom. President Clinton's tax increase
amounts to starting up another bilge pump, but his temporary stimulus means
it is running backwards and pumping more water into the ship. Unfortunately,
his spending cuts only reduce the hole from 500 cm to 300 cm. This isn't
going to save the ship. For those who look hopefully to the small pick-up in
the economy, I would point out that even a sinking ship occasionally rides a
wave; however, it frequently founders in the next trough.
We, the people, must insist on fixing the hole permanently with the balanced
budget amendment and the line item veto. There is no time to lose; the
foreign crew who have been fueling the pumps with their loans may take to
the lifeboats.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Letter: Example of Bophuthatswana should not be ignored in S
Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANTHONY MCCALL-JUDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial ('Buthelezi's role', February 15) welcomes the agreement
in outline that has now been reached in South Africa, but it should have
drawn attention not only to the importance of Chief Buthelezi but to the
role of Bophuthatswana. The way to unlock the potential of South Africa's
complex multi-ethnic and linguistic society will be via a federal structure.
We say such a federation must ensure strong regional freedoms, simply to
survive, with power flowing from the bottom up, not from the top down.
Bophuthatswana will play a key role. Your Johannesburg correspondent, Patti
Waldmeir, gave a useful summary (February 2) of Bophuthatswana's prospects
in the 'new South Africa'. Waldmeir points out that economic growth 'has
exceeded that in almost every other independent African country', adding,
'on a continent which scarcely distinguishes itself by the quality of
economic management, Bophuthatswana clearly excels'. Our inward investors
like Pilkington, ICI, BMW, Siemens and a large active community of skilled
foreigners speaks for itself. Standard and Poor's on Wall Street has given
us its top three-star credit rating - a rare achievement in the developing
world. Government revenues have doubled every six years, no less, with rates
of taxation coming down.
On the political front, President Mangope's elected government has insisted
on the right of individuals to decide their own future at the ballot box and
not to be coerced by intimidation into supporting ANC 'liberation' politics.
The Tswanas have a lot to lose from reincorporation into South Africa, not
only in material terms, as your correspondent observed, but quite possibly
in political terms too. To them, 'freedom for the people' rhetoric has a
hollow ring, since they've lived in their own non-racial democracy for over
15 years. Like their Tswana relatives in Botswana, this is one of the few
true democratic societies in Africa.
The ANC's none-too-subtle political agenda in Bophuthatswana has been
equally clear: to destabilise all official institutions by means of
intimidation, violence and arson. The objective: to bring the authorities
'to their knees' (in their words).

FT  23 FEB 93 / Letter: Chancellor should not ignore damage done by ACT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HOWARD DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Budget for the supply side' (February 19), argues that
the chancellor should not take action to relieve the double taxation of
profits which arises from the operation of the ACT system, because the
current arrangements lower the incentive for corporations to invest abroad.
Fortunately, as he made clear in his 1992 Budget speech, Norman Lamont does
not share your view that the current system is satisfactory.
It is true that a company paying surplus ACT is encouraged to increase its
taxable profit in the UK. But profit can be increased in the short term more
quickly by reducing costs than by investment. So companies with surplus ACT
will find tax advantages in moving administrative functions and research and
development facilities outside the UK, reducing employment (and associated
tax revenue) and eroding our manufacturing base.
That is now happening. It is why the chancellor should not ignore the
problem of 'surplus ACT' and should address it in his forthcoming Budget,
before more damage is done.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ELIZABETH BALSOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your account of the financial restructuring at Mrs Fields (UK company
news, February 17) omits one crucial point: why did an American company,
which, to the best of my recollection, at the time of its stock market debut
had no UK outlets, choose to list on London's USM rather than in New York,
with all the complications stemming from a share price in pence and a
balance sheet and income statement in dollars?
The obvious answer would seem to be that the USM's disclosure requirements
were less onerous, making life easier for companies, but more difficult for
investors. If shareholders had stopped to ask that simple question, they
might not have got involved. Institutions should have known better.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Reform club's new member: Privatisation in Ukraine has begun
at last
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS and CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As he brought down the hammer to open the first privatisation auctions in
Ukraine, Volodymyr Pylypchuk, chairman of the parliamentary commission on
economic reform, joked that his historic wooden mallet could eventually be
worth more than any of the small businesses on sale.
Yet last Saturday's modest auction of 17 restaurants and shops in the
western Ukrainian city of Lviv - out of a total 4,000 small state businesses
in the city - was the most concrete sign yet of the government's intentions.
It showed it is serious about transforming one of the most conservative of
the former Soviet republics into a market economy.
If market reforms succeed, Ukraine could form a stable and prosperous buffer
state between eastern Europe and Russia. But if they fail, the region could
be destabilised as nationalist forces in Ukraine and Russia, both of which
possess nuclear weapons, stoke up simmering territorial and military
disputes to distract the public's attention from economic collapse.
Ukraine's economy certainly needs radical change. The most populous republic
after Russia, it has a budget deficit equal to 36 per cent of gross domestic
product and an accelerating inflation rate of more than 50 per cent a month
(13,000 per cent a year), which have undermined its fledgling new currency,
the coupon.
Last November, parliament granted Ukraine's new government the authority to
rule the crumbling economy by decree. The cabinet has responded with a
stream of reforms to liberalise prices and cut the budget deficit. Food
prices tripled at the end of December as subsidies were cut, and the number
of people entitled to social welfare payments has been reduced from 20m to
2m.
These tough measures have convinced sceptics that the prime minister, Leonid
Kuchma, believes in economic reform. But Ukraine's task is even more
difficult than that of Russia, where reforms appear to have stalled, because
Ukraine faces obstacles to economic change from outside as well as within
the state.
Ukraine remains heavily dependent on oil from Russia and trade with the
other former Soviet republics, which together accounted for more than 80 per
cent of Ukraine's trade and more than a third of total industrial production
before the collapse of the former Soviet Union. But economic relations with
Russia have deteriorated.
The breakdown of rouble-financed trade, once Russia stopped accepting
non-Russian roubles last summer, has left Ukrainian enterprises with
Rbs426bn in unpaid bills from Russian concerns, and no convertible currency
in which to conduct trade. Industrial output fell by 20 per cent last year.
Meanwhile, the price of Russian oil has increased by 3,000 per cent over the
past year, while consumer prices rose by 2,500 per cent.
Even at these higher prices, Kuchma says that Ukraine will not be able to
obtain enough oil this year. Last week the Russian prime minister, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, announced that Ukraine would get only 15m tonnes of oil in
1993, less than half last year's level. In addition, Russia has raised
prices for natural gas and threatened to cut off supply if Ukraine does not
pay up.
The government also faces powerful domestic obstacles to progress. In recent
years the economy has been hijacked by Ukraine's industrial elite. Factory
managers have sold off company assets for personal profit. Last year, for
example, they illegally re-exported 8m tonnes of state-supplied oil. They
also managed to get Rbs1,325 billion of unbacked monetary credits in order
to pay wages, a rise of 800 per cent in the stock of outstanding domestic
bank credit compared with 1991, driving Ukraine into hyperinflation.
'Opposition to commercialisation comes from officials who have very specific
economic interests which they are protecting,' says Viktor Pynzenyk,
minister of the economy and architect of the reforms.
Yet Ukraine hopes for one compensation from its sluggish embrace of the
market. By beginning reforms a year later, it believes it can learn from
Russia's failure to control inflation and stimulate output.
The Ukrainian government argues that Russia put too much faith in
stabilisation and the promise of western aid, without confronting the more
reactionary ex-Communist forces in the state bureaucracy who still control
the economy.
Ukraine's reformers, working closely with World Bank officials in Kiev,
believe that the key to success is liberalisation and small-scale
privatisation in order to bypass the bureaucrats. Without these measures,
the government says it will be unable to meet its target of bringing
inflation down to between 3 and 4 per cent a month by the end of this year.
Agriculture is to be privatised first: 13m Ukrainians are already landowners
and produce 25 per cent of total food consumed in Ukraine. Reform-minded
regions will be encouraged to pursue rapid privatisation of state property,
following Lviv's example.
To enforce reform outside Kiev, the government is preparing a package of
decrees that will bypass the local councils dominated by ex-communists, by
bringing regional governments directly under the control of the cabinet. The
directors of Ukraine's 6,000 large state enterprises, at present answerable
only to workers' collectives, will have to sign employment contracts with
the state in the first quarter of this year.
Yet even if Kuchma, himself a former factory director, can control
conservative regional officials and industrialists, his reforms are unlikely
to succeed if trade fails to revive and Ukraine cannot secure a reliable,
affordable energy supply.
Kuchma says restoring trade links with former Soviet republics is now a
priority and supports moves to establish a new payments union for
inter-republican trade. But Ukraine's leaders believe that Russia's motives
in raising energy prices and restricting oil supplies reflect not only
economic self-interest but also a political desire to bring Ukraine to heel.
Ukraine's oil quota this year is 1m tonnes less than Russia has promised
Belarus, which is one fifth Ukraine's size but has acceded to all of
Russia's political and military demands. Russia's deputy prime minister
Viktor Shokhin said last week that Russia will tie the continued supply of
fuel to military and political conditions, including stationing Russian
military bases in Ukraine.
'I cannot understand the Russian position,' Kuchma said last week. 'It can
only be seen as pressure on Ukraine, motivated by something beyond economic
considerations. This is a conflict in which there can be no victors.'

   From R C MITCHELL-HEGGE

<TEXT>
Sir, Your article ('Sharing out the available work may top the political
agenda', February 18) should provoke a wider debate. Why does the UK allow
such wastage of managerial talent, particularly in the field of export
financing, at a time when the country is desperate to improve its trade
imbalance? As a formerly redundant banker, I will testify for the great
numbers of bilingual, marketing-experienced bankers who would leap at the
opportunity to provide their services part time within a DTI-sponsored
scheme.
This could be structured specifically to help small businesses coping with
trade financing and other difficulties. R C Mitchell-Hegge,

FT  23 FEB 93 / Arts: 'Elektra' according to Ezra Pound - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Translation flowed near Ezra Pound's heart. For more than 50 years it
occupied him, and enriched his other work. It floods through his Cantos; his
versions of Greek, Latin, French, German, Italian, Anglo-Saxon, Provencal
and Chinese poetry amount to a large part of his output. And his 1954
rendition of Sophocles's tragedy Women of Trachis, as has long been
recognised, is in the vanguard of radical translation, with its modern
colloquial energy, its freedom from conventional grammar, and its patches of
speech printed in upper-case. (See, for example, Herakles's last words:
'Come at it that way, my boy, what/ SPLENDOUR, IT ALL COHERES.')
Pound had already tackled another Sophocles play, the Elektra, in 1949,
while first recovering from nervous breakdown and mental instability in St
Elizabeths Hospital, Washington DC He undertook it with enthusiasm. But he
put the translation under the name of his assistant Rudd Fleming, an
American professor and novelist, for his pro-fascist war record had left him
in a legal situation then so precarious that he did not wish to be known as
sane enough to be able to translate Sophocles. Only in 1989 was it published
as Pound's version - and in 1990 in the UK (Faber &amp; Faber).
Last week, the Guildhall School of Music and Drama gave this Elektra its
first British staging. Regrettably, the production, directed by Chattie
Salaman, went overboard in trying to reveal the Pound in the play. The
setting is St Elizabeths; Pound and other pyjama-clad inmates turn into the
main Greek characters, with white-clad medics doubling as chorus. Before the
play starts, the inmates softly keep asking Pound (as he types) 'What part
ob yu iz deh poEM?' (a line he put into Canto 104). Salaman took this
concept from Richard Reid's scholarly introduction to the Faber edition, and
then added yet further complexities.
The characters, though usually donning Greek-style attire and make-up, spoke
in accents from the American South. This helps, for those are the main
accents of Pound's text. How else could you deliver such lines as 'This is
what we're agoin' to do,/ listen sharp and check up if/ I miss any
bullseyes.'? (Also, to us, this makes a connection to O'Neill's Southern
Mourning Becomes Electra.)
But why did Salaman sometimes dress Orestes &amp; Co. like folk from The Good,
the Bad and the Ugly, with theme music to match? And why split the role of
Elektra in two - one actress black, dressed in white, one white dressed in
black? No interesting dichotomy in the role is revealed.
The members of the young cast managed their American accents, and their
extensive amount of singing and chanting, pretty well. They could not always
make Pound's colloquialisms sound serious; it would take a mature actor to
bring off the sober irony of Orestes's 'You won't have any more trouble with
Mother' after his matricide. But, in most respects, they revealed the
difficult text to advantage. Pound's metres made their full impact: for
which Salaman and the composer, Alessandro Timossi, (working in a wide range
of styles) deserve praise.
Pound's Elektra, though it remains highly eccentric, brings out the neurotic
urgency in Sophocles's drama. (Electra: 'I'm not dead yet, it's a dirty
life/ but my own./ It annoys 'em. That honours the dead,/if the dead get any
joy out of that.' And 'Slave-driver more than a mother I'd call you/ and a
rotten life I have with you and your fellow-feeder/ put all the low jobs
onto me'). If only the production had tried to add fewer layers of meaning,
and to tell us less about Pound and more about Elektra, it would have been
truer to both Pound and Sophocles.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Arts: 'Killing Him': a bit of a twitcher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first voice is that of Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer,
sounding remarkably resonant about the British government's determination to
defend the value of sterling within the exchange rate mechanism of the
European monetary system. The only seating place on stage is on top of a
large bundle of apparently unread copies of the Financial Times: what is
known in the trade as returns.
The chancellor was speaking before September 16 last year, a date generally
though not universally regarded as Black Wednesday. In the play, the
characters call it White Wednesday, not because they have an alternative
economic policy based on a floating pound, but because they did well out of
the speculation. Between them they picked up about Pounds 90m.
Killing Him is written and directed by Crispin Whittel, co-founder of a
relatively new company called Cambridge Nights. The striking fact is not so
much the quality of the play as the subject. Can it really be true that you
fill a pub theatre in Camden Town on a Saturday night with jokes about the
Bundesbank?
The answer is yes. Actually, the best part of the play has nothing to do
with currency dealing. It is based on a serious bird-watcher or 'twitcher'
called Kevin (played by Will Keen) who takes a more long-term view of the
world than the speculators. Remember, however, that Norman Lamont is also a
bit of a twitcher; there may be some deeper meaning here, maybe not.
This is not the only obscurity. It is not obvious, without being told, that
the girl in the play (Nicola Walker) used to work as a spy for the old East
German regime. That is why she sleeps with bankers and knows the secret
wishes of the Bundesbank.
Some of the basic techniques of story-telling still have to be learned, but
here at least is a piece that enters new territory. So far as I can make out
the attitude to currency speculation is morally neutral.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Arts: Minimal into the invisible - Robert Ryman at the Tate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Robert Ryman retrospective, jointly organised by New York's Museum of
Modern Art and the Tate Gallery, which opens its international tour with its
showing at the Tate, is as important as it is timely. It is sure to puzzle
quite as many as it will irritate, and as many again both at once, but it
also comes at a moment when the serious questioning of the received wisdom
and prejudices of the avant garde has risen to the surface, to be aired on
all sides.
We can safely disregard the nine-days'-wonder school of journalistic
response, with its instinctive anti-modernism which amounts to a profoundly
anti-art philistinism - all art was modern in its day. But what seems to
have happened is that a number of the more serious commentators have come
quite independently to a broadly similar conclusion. For all the creative
energy and excitement generated by the modern movement, in all its forms,
over the past century and more, for all the profound truths of human
experience it has realised, and for all the very real creative achievements
that have marked its course, we have come at last to recognise that when the
avant-garde becomes academic, it is more than time to take stock. It should
be the stuff of serious and constructive debate.
What must be challenged is the assumption that whatever may be identified as
avant-garde is of itself important and significant: from which it follows
that the common curatorial and international dealing view that all too
patently finds interest, so far as contemporary art is concerned, only in
art of such a kind, is dangerously narrow, partial and unfair. The real
usefulness of this Ryman exhibition is that it is both wonderfully
even-handed and particular, offering both sides of the question, the radical
and the academic, in the clearest terms. Such considerations were doubtless
far from the Tate's mind when arranging it, seeing the show simply as the
celebration of an established and respected modern painter. But it is
exactly what it should be doing, presenting the work at issue, holding the
ring.
The justification for a great deal of modernist activity has always been not
so much the actual production of great art, or of art at all, but rather as
the necessary experiment and investigation into what Art is, or might be,
and into the mechanics, actual or potential, of its achievement. What has
always bedevilled the debate has been the mindless subsequent acceptance
that the fruits of such activity, whatever else they are, are also, without
question, works of art. Art is what artists do, or propose, and so it
follows that a walk in a field, a bare canvas, a beer can, a proposal, a
mere idea, may itself be elevated to the status of Art. It is a seductive
heresy, but heresy still.
In Robert Ryman we have an artist who was actively engaged with what was, in
the 1960s, one of the central issues of painting. Following upon the more
intuitive indulgences of abstract expressionism, the tougher questions were
addressed, of what a painting was, and how to make it more itself. If an
image is but an illusion, leave it out. If a painting is but a coat of paint
upon a surface, leave it at that. And if variations of colour or
surface-texture begin to seem arbitrary and unnecessary embellishments, then
reduce the variation to uniformity, and drain the colour away until only
white is left.
The most fascinating part of the show is indeed that given to this earliest
phase in Ryman's progress - he is now 62 - when he was wrestling with these
problems, simplifying and recomplicating his surfaces and, in the process,
achieving results that were highly personal, inimitable, and often, in the
sensuality of the paint itself, very beautiful. But just how reductive, how
simple, could he afford to be? The deceptive aesthetic of simplicity too
soon seduced him, and he has been playing the game of elegant,
pseudo-radical simplicity ever since, sustained it must be said (and good
luck to him) by the enthusiasm of the museums and the market place.
Successive stripes of paint cross the canvas, leaves inevitably a record of
every insensible variation of touch and pressure. Every painter who ever
primed a canvas knows the wonderful thrill of that first loaded brush, and
has played the game of leaving it that, or just one more, and just another -
but it is only a game. We all know that to put anything, anything at all, on
a bare white wall is to invest it for the moment with an aura of cosmic
significance. A blank sheet of paper, four pins to describe a square, a
length of aluminium beading - to go through the later rooms of this
retrospective is to see the radical minimalist become but an aesthete
working his endless decorative variations, and wondering to himself:
whatever next? A sad business.
*****
The Lisson Gallery's Out of Sight: Out of Mind is another salutary and
entirely justifiable historical exercise, but again the fundamental issue is
inescapeable. It is an ambitious group show which deals rather more
comprehensively with the graphic, photographic and cerebral manifestations
of 1960s and early 1970s conceptual art than Gravity &amp; Grace, at the
Hayward, has lately done for sculpture of the time.
From Carl Andre and Art &amp; Language to Bob Law and Bill Woodrow, it offers a
stimulating and enjoyable trawl through the fashionable and technical
preoccupations of the time, a ferment of ideas and possibilities. But as
Art? Bruce Maclean at his most ironical, with photographs of his evaporated
puddle, and of himself as Henry Moore's 'Fallen Warrior', says it all.
Robert Ryman: Tate Gallery, Millbank SW1, until April 25, then on to Madrid,
New York, San Francisco and Mineapolis; sponsored by the Horace W. Goldsmith
Foundation and the Patrons of New Art. 'Out of Sight: Out of Mind': Lisson
Gallery, 67 Lisson Street NW1, until April 3

FT  23 FEB 93 / Arts: Eric Clapton - Rock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scarcely had one of rock's living legends shambled out of town for the next
stop on his endless tour than another of the great and the good started his
annual residency at the Albert Hall; this is the seventh successive year
that Eric Clapton has held court there before his ageing admirers.
As usual the show is effortlessly professional and wonderfully executed;
Clapton takes no chances. He has surrounded himself with an outstanding band
 -a five-piece outfit, with three brass drafted in for the last lap - which
includes Andy Fairweather Low, ex-Little Feat drummer Richie Hayward, and
Joe Cocker's pianist Chris Stainton.
This year there is only one programme for all 14 concerts; 'rhythm and
blues' is what the tickets promise, and that is precisely what the punters
get, with rather more of the latter than the former. If at least 50 per cent
of the audience was waiting him to launch into 'Layla' or 'Wonderful
Tonight' what they got instead was a spin through the history of the blues
from the 1920s to the present day. It begins with Clapton alone playing
acoustic guitar against Stainton's piano and ends two hours later with his
peerless electric sound cutting through the full band like a surgeon's
knife.
Nevertheless it took a while for the temperature to begin to rise. The first
dozen songs, as Clapton moved through Robert Johnson, Big Bill Broonzy,
Muddy Waters and Jimmy Rogers seemed respectful rather than engaged, and it
was only Fairweather Low, seizing his one solo opportunity on Elmore James's
'Coming Home', who really took hold of the material and squeezed hard.
Clapton then took the hint; a Howling Wolf group full of heavy dark guitar
work, began the revival and numbers by Bobby Bland and Freddie King finally
received the full treatment.
The audience seemed to go home happy enough, though the irony of this
immaculately turned-out white musician in his designer suit singing Bessie
Smith and Robert Johnson should have hit a raw note somewhere in the hall.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Arts: The African Company presents Richard III - Theatre in
Washington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the three theatres of Washington's adventurous Arena Stage complex,
the fan-shaped, 500-seat Kreeger is currently drawing capacity audiences
with a new play by Carlyle Brown entitled The African Company Presents
Richard III.
This is a lively and moving drama based on a historical situation: the
existence in New York, around 1821, of a troupe of black players led by a
retired steward named William Henry Brown.
First in a tea garden, behind Brown's house, and then in a larger site, this
company played before large, chiefly black audiences and one of the staples
of the African Company's repertory was Shakespeare. But in the autumn of
1821, the eminent English tragedion Junius Brutus Booth paid a visit to the
prestigious 'white' Park Theatre, - and both houses simultaneously announced
new productions of Richard III, in direct if somewhat unequal competition.
The Park was operated by the canny, unscrupulous impresario Stephen Price
(known to actors, because of his avarice, as 'Half Price'). Determined to
destroy his black rivals, the manager used his political influence to have
their theatre closed and their company arrested. The company, however,
survived this setback and, a few years later, produced a new play called The
Drama of King Shotaway based on the story of the black Carib chieftain
Chatoyer, killed in an insurrection.
In reconstructing these events Carlyle Brown first did considerable
scholarship; but, inevitably, since black history in America is full of
tantalising gaps, he rightly made effective use of his own poetic
imagination. The actors of the African Company - waiters or domestics by day
 -had their private stories, which Brown reinvents with insight and wit. But
their stories fit also into the larger history of the US and of racial
conflict there.
The chief black actor of the 19th century company was a waiter named James
Hewlett (movingly played by Leon Addison Brown), whom the playwright makes a
mercurial, moody, mordant victim. In an early scene, Hewlett says 'Coloured
people act all the time.' Their submission, their obedience, the persona
they offer their white masters is all a performance. Later, the same Hewlett
does an ironic imitation of the white man's cliche black man, dancing and
singing with searing pain.
Carlyle Brown is fortunate in his cast and in his director, Tazewell
Thompson, who has carefully gauged the behaviour of the characters according
to whether they are alone, among themselves, or in a racial confrontation.
In addition to Leon Addison Brown, the young actor Jonathan Earl Peck
provides a full length, three-dimensional portrait of the black impresario
William Henry Brown; mettlesome, resourceful, human.
And, dominating the stage at his every appearance, Wendell Wright offers a
generous, irresistible Papa Shakespeare, a Falstaffian figure still close to
his African roots, a man wise in ancient lore and sharp in his witty,
compassionate guile. It is a part that could easily have lapsed into the
quaint, into clownerie. Instead, it has an impressive nobility.
Gail Grate is totally convincing, both as the alert maidservant Ann and, in
her other costume, as Richard III's queen. David Marks is a sinister yet
entertaining Constable-Man (a clever touch of the director to give him an
Irish accent, indicating the complex ethnic mixture of 19th century New
York).
A simple wooden construction by Douglas Stein suggests a port warehouse or
the backstage of a theatre, with the hint of a garden beyond; Paul
Tazewell's costumes - whether for Carlyle Brown's characters or for
Shakespeare's - are convincing: simple, deliberately uncolourful
streetclothes and makeshift velvet, beplumed regality. The lighting devised
by Allen Lee Hughes is subtle and, particularly in the final, gaol scene,
poetic.
Concurrently with The African Company, in its smaller theatre in the round,
Arena Stage is presenting a new production (and new translation) of
Pirandello's Cosi e (se vi pare), now called It's the Truth (If you think it
is) staged by the Romanian Livlu Ciulei.
It is a confidant, competent staging, though the acting is uneven. Following
the Italian dramatist's clues, Ciulei sees all the characters except the
three principals as grotesques, a chorus representing public opinion,
received ideas, and he has some delightful accomplices in Halo Wines (as
Amalia) and Trazana Beverley (Signora Sirelli). Richard Bauer plays
Pirandello's alter ego Lamberto Laudisi with the proper cynicism end
detachment, but there is a sameness in his drawling delivery that becomes
finally tiresome.
In the crucial 'mad' roles, Tana Hicken (Signora Frola) and Henry Strozier
(her son-in-law Ponza) strike just the right note of reasoning desperation.
In the small role of the butler, Teagle F Bougere invents a brief comic turn
that affords on amusing variation on Pirandello's theme of appearances
versus subjectivity.

Starting unfortunately early at 6.00, BBC2 shows the best Robin Hood movie
ever made, the 1938 Warner version with Errol Flynn: The Adventures Of Robin
Hood. Shot in early Technicolor, with superior music by Erich Korngold and
memorable performances from Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains as the baddies,
it is a classic example of Hollywood at its most entertaining.
Assignment (7.45 BBC2) reports on the re-emergence of malaria as a major

'Red Dwarf' series (8.30).
Without Walls (9.00 C4) tries to establish whether the use of drugs by

FT  23 FEB 93 / People: BTR board becomes increasingly cosmopolitan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As the next generation of BTR high-fliers gets promoted into the top jobs,
the main board of Britain's ninth biggest company becomes increasingly
international in its composition. The latest recruit is Roberto Quarta,
44-year-old chief executive of BTR's sealing and control systems group.
Quarta, a US citizen, joined Worcester Controls in 1973 and first made his
mark in BTR's valve group in the US and UK.
In 1989 he took on his present job. BTR says that he has, through
acquisition, rationalisation and innovation, achieved good growth in the
automotive and associated industries.
Quarta's promotion to the main BTR board comes less than three months after
the appointment of Graeme Pearson, the 53-year-old Australian managing
director of BTR Nylex, and reinforces the international complexion of BTR's
executive team. Out of the seven executive directors, two are Australian,
two are Americans, and Bob Faircloth, the chief operating officer, is a
Canadian who has taken US nationality.
The latest promotion to the board has done nothing to stem the growing
speculation about who will take over from Sir Owen Green. BTR's chairman
confirmed again yesterday that he intends to retire this year and said that
there would be an 'election' to find his successor. He said that he would
have no say in the choice of that successor.
The latest appointment increases the size of the BTR board to 12 directors
and a chairman. The average age of the seven executive directors is 51; on
average they have been with BTR for 18 years. The average age of the other
five directors is 62.

FT  23 FEB 93 / People: Central Stockbroking asks Edgecombe to step in
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Edward Edgecombe has taken over as chairman and joint managing director of
Central Stockbroking Services after the founder of the two-year-old
Manchester-based operation Brian de Vecchis was barred by the Securities and
Futures Authority.
Edgecombe, 57, who had been a shareholder but not a director of Central, was
brought in after de Vecchis took Pounds 40,000 from the building society
account of a 70-year-old widow who was a discretionary client of the firm,
in order to meet capital adequacy requirements.
De Vecchis, 51, whom Edgecombe has known for 20 years, had had a 70 per cent
share in Central. The embryonic broking firm has subsequently severed all
connections with de Vecchis, and Edgecombe is now a 40 per cent shareholder
of the recapitalised operation.
'After the first quarter, to the end of December 1992, we are most
encouraged; we are in profit, representing a considerable turnaround from
the loss for the previous full year which was in excess of Pounds 50,000'
says Edgecombe explaining that the 'big mistake' that had been made was that
'after the first year, when they could see the cash flow rising, they
started to spend it.' Edgecombe says he has begun to cut aggressively into
the overheads, achieving cuts of around Pounds 5,000 a month.
The new chairman, who points out that his new challenge of developing
Central will mean he will be far too busy to retire at 60, has spent his
career in the mutual fund industry. He left Royal Life Investment
Management, where he had been a manager, to rescue Central. Previously he
had been at Guinness Mahon Investment Management and earlier had spells with
Capel Cure Myers, Thornton Management and GT Management.
While de Vecchis was known for his centralised style of management,
Edgecombe has promoted Thomas Hatton to the position of joint managing
director and secretary, and made Albert Kobierzynski finance director.

FT  23 FEB 93 / People: Raingold goes for Pounds 40m in LSE fund-raising
campaign
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The London School of Economics has set up its own Foundation in a move to
formalise fund-raising activities ahead of the so-called 'Second Century'
campaign, and hired Howard Raingold, who made his mark as Lincoln College,
Oxford's fund-raiser, as its first director.
In his four years at Lincoln, Raingold raised around Pounds 6m, from Old
Members as well as from companies including Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham and
Elf UK. 'The college is small, with an Old Member population in the UK of
just 3,000,' he points out. 'It recruits from minor public and grammar
schools; we didn't have the Sainsburys and Rothschilds in our repertoire.'
Raingold, who claims that learning to fund-raise is easier - and a lot more
fun - than learning to drive, says the secret is 'education, not begging.
People want to belong.'
He identified the third of Lincoln's Old Members who were on a salary over
Pounds 30,000, and, by dint of a series of face-to-face meetings, persuaded
around 70 per cent to give an average of Pounds 2,500 each. The campaign
funded additional undergraduate accommodation - work on which has just
started - as well as a series of junior research fellowships.
Raingold hopes to be able to do the same 'with an additional nought on
everything' for the LSE, which celebrates its centenary in 1995. The
provisional target is to raise Pounds 40m over five years, but Raingold says
much is to be decided before the official launch of the campaign, probably
some time next year. With its bid for County Hall turned down, the LSE will
now concentrate on improving the present Houghton Street site, as well as
creating new research fellowships.
Raingold, 52, went to Cambridge as a mature student in the late 1970's and
took a history degree. After three years as deputy director of Shelter, he
spent a year studying international history at the LSE, and then taught at
two schools before applying for the Lincoln job.
Lester May, 41, who worked for eight months in the public relations office
of the Corporation of London on the campaign for the European Central Bank,
but has otherwise been unemployed since leaving the Royal Navy in 1989,
becomes deputy director. 'The best thing about it is that I can stop job
hunting for the first time in four years,' he says.

European Law
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Regional social security offices dealing with sickness maternity and old-age
benefits are not 'undertakings' covered by the Rome Treaty competition
rules, the European Court of Justice ruled last week.
In a reference from a French court, in a case brought by two people who felt
they had the right under EC law to go to any private insurance company in
the EC in order to pay their social security contributions, the Court ruled
that Community law did not impinge on the authority of member states to
administer their own social security systems.
The Court also said that the relevant social security schemes had an
exclusively social rather than economic aim. Given that EC competition rules
only apply to undertakings which are engaged in an economic activity, the
Court said the social security offices in question were not covered by the
rules.

Belgian redundancy rules unlawful
Belgian rules, which exclude women over the age of 60 from supplementary
redundancy payments, are contrary to European Community sex discrimination
rules and unlawful, the European Court of Justice ruled last week.
The Belgian rules applied to people made redundant when aged 60 or above,
entitling them to supplementary payments in addition to unemployment
benefit. Under Belgian law, unemployment benefit is payable to men until 65
but to women only until 60. The effect of the redundancy rules was therefore
of clear benefit to men.
The Court had to decide whether the redundancy payments came within the
scope of Rome Treaty equal-pay rules. Relying on its decision in the Barber
pensions case, it said that, simply because certain benefits were made after
employment had been terminated, this did not necessarily mean that they
could not be deemed to come within the scope of EC equal pay rules.
The Court did point out, however, that benefits such as state pensions,
applicable to general categories of workers, which had no connection with an
individual's place of work, would not come within the scope of the equal pay
rules.
C-173/91: Commission v Belgium, ECJ FC, February 17 1993
Migrant workers' benefits
On a preliminary reference from a Belgian court, the ECJ held that EC rules
regulating the granting of social security benefits to migrant workers took
precedence over relevant national rules, even where the amount of the
particular benefit in question was the same under both sets of rules.
The case concerned a migrant Italian worker who had worked both in Italy and
Belgium before becoming ill. Both countries recognised his right to claim
sickness benefit. The Italian benefit was calculated on the basis of the
relevant EC rules. The Belgian benefit was calculated on national rules. The
benefit was the same, whichever basis of calculation was used.
However, under the EC rules the benefit could only be re-evaluated if there
had been a change relating either to the establishment of the person
concerned or to the rules used to calculate the benefit. Under the Belgian
rules the benefit could be re-evaluated to take into account changes in the
benefit granted by another member state, particularly in relation to the
fluctuations in the exchange rates. In this case the applicant's benefit was
re-evaluated to his detriment by the Belgian authorities on the basis of
exchange-rate fluctuations.
The Court held first that, where a worker was subject to the legislation of
two or more EC countries, that worker was entitled to the most favourable
benefits available - either under the national rules or the EC rules.
However, the Community rules had to apply when the national rules were less
favourable. The Court said this meant that, even where the national rules
were chosen, the amount of benefit conformed with the EC rules. Given this,
any re-evaluation should be determined on the basis of Community, rather
than national, rules.

TWO NEW pilot schemes designed to speed up the vetting or 'taxation' of
legal bills are to be introduced by the English High Court after Easter. The
schemes should lead to the successful parties in litigation receiving their
costs from the losers more quickly.
Under the first scheme parties will be responsible for identifying the items
in a bill which are in dispute, allowing taxation hearings to be confined to
those issues.
The second scheme, known as 'quick-form taxation', requires the consent of
both parties but enables them to ask for costs to be taxed without providing
a bill itemising costs and disbursements.

briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS by US manufacturers to block the importation of 'grey market' goods
 -goods made under licence abroad and re-imported - received a boost
recently following a ruling by the District of Columbia Federal Appeals
Court.
The court upheld a US Customs ban on two 'grey' Lever Brothers soaps, Shield
and Sunlight, on the grounds that although made under a valid licence in
Britain by a Lever Bros affiliate, they violated US trademark legislation
because they differed physically from the same brand of goods manufactured
in the US under a US trademark.
The Court found that the US version of Shield 'lathers more' than the UK
version and that British Sunlight 'produces less suds'. The Lever case has
already been cited by the First US Circuit Court of Appeals in a case
involving the import of 'grey' Perugina chocolates.
The First Circuit court said that the imported chocolates produced outside
the US under a valid licence infringed the US trademark because differences
between the imports and the US products were likely to confuse consumers.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Business and the Law: Cross border manoeuvres - Revised EC
rules for vetting joint ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CELIA HAMPTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business can today cross European Community borders with unprecedented
freedom. Succeeding in a new market is never easy, given different national
consumer preferences; nor is it seldom cheap or risk-free.
Companies that do business across EC borders have a compelling interest in
the 'obstruction' - Euro red-tape - posed by the European Commission, as the
EC competition authority. Though much reduced today, Euro red-tape can still
prove a huge stumbling block for business.
Industry views the Commission as the flag-carrier for cross-border mergers
and acquisitions: as a champion of the adventurous foreign company against
local protectionism. But companies also tend to resent the Commission's
powers over their commercial dealings, especially in view of the delays
involved, and accuse it of unnecessary legalism.
Cross-border joint ventures often bring out industry's ambivalent attitude
towards the Commission. The treatment of joint ventures also illustrates the
Commission's seemingly contradictory function of encouraging cross-border
mergers while at the same time stopping companies banding together in
anti-competitive ways.
The Commission defines a joint venture an 'institutionally fixed' form of
co-operation between independent enterprises. The venture need not be
separately incorporated, but it must be active as an entity and owned by the
enterprises which set it up.
There are two main ways in which the actions of companies can reduce
competition:
cartels, which are 'behavioural' and, in principle, undesirable;
and mergers, which are 'structural' but which can invigorate competition.
This theoretical distinction becomes extremely fuzzy when applied to joint
ventures, which contain elements of both. The EC Merger Regulation, the
Community's vehicle for vetting mergers affecting the European market, has
also made matters worse by offering companies a strong incentive to draft
their cross-border joint ventures as 'mergers'.
A joint venture which is categorised as 'concentrative' (ie, as a merger),
falls under the Merger Regulation and because of the regulation's strict
procedural time limits may be cleared and up and running within a few
months; hence the attraction to companies of ensuring their joint ventures
are drafted as mergers.
A deal drafted as a 'co-operative' joint venture, however, is beyond the
ambit of the Merger Regulation and may fall by the wayside while awaiting
approval under EC competition rules; even then, permission is not
necessarily final and is often of limited duration.
A 'concentrative' joint venture involves a permanent structural change in
the market-place, such as the arrival of a new player in a sector. The
parent companies of the joint venture enjoy the normal shareholder
relationship with a 'concentrative' joint venture; but the venture will not
be treated as such unless it is also designed to perform as an autonomous
and permanent economic entity. Most important, the venture must not 'give
rise to co-ordination of competitive behaviour' - or anti-competitive
practices - among the parents or between them and the joint venture.
However, difficulties arise with the word 'co-ordination'. If the parents
and the joint venture itself operate in the same market, it is likely that
the joint venture will be treated as a springboard for developing a common
strategy and will therefore be treated as 'co-operative.' If the joint
venture is intended to operate in a related market, for example,
distributing two manufacturers' products, the Commission may also come to
the same conclusion.
The Commission is mindful of the divergent treatment of 'concentrative' and
'co-operative' joint ventures, and is now trying to reduce its significance
in practice. Until the end of last year, most joint ventures needed
individual exemption from EC competition rules before they could proceed.
Now the Commission has restated its earlier practice of presuming
'co-operative' joint ventures to be eligible for exemption. It has also
extended the general exemptions for certain types of agreement, such as
patent and know-how licensing, to joint ventures.
The Commission has already issued guidance on the distinction between
'concentrative' and 'co-operative' ventures. Last week a further notice was
published defining 'co-operative' ventures and explaining Commission
practice in assessing them.
The guidance provides some insight, for example, by summarising the
questions the Commission will ask companies when judging whether competition
between the parent companies is likely to be affected.
The differences, even in terms of competition policy, between the two types
of joint ventures are hardly sufficient to justify big differences in
treatment. Accordingly, the Commission has proposed improving the position
of 'co-operative' ventures through an 'internal organisation of procedure'.
Since last month, 'structural' deals - including 'co-operative' joint
ventures - have been processed more speedily under the Rome Treaty's article
85 exemption or 'negative clearance procedures'.
The Commission has promised to give either a 'comfort letter' or a 'warning
letter to companies within two months of being notified of a prospective
joint venture. A comfort letter means the Commission does not object to the
deal or that it intends to grant negative clearance or an exemption; a
'warning letter' would tell the companies that the Commission has serious
doubts about the deal (see chart).
If the Commission does not issue a comfort letter it will open a second
stage inquiry - for which there is no time limit. A swifter timetable has
been promised for other cases after April 1.
But the new internal procedure may not go far enough. Full information
similar to that required for mergers must still be supplied. Even companies
which have already given exhaustive information on an unsuccessful
application for merger clearance may be asked for further details, and the
two-month period may then start afresh.
The concept of a 'warning' letter is new and although potentially useful
where only minor adjustments are needed in the deal to make it acceptable to
the Commission, the letter may have legal effect.
Normally companies can proceed with a joint venture while awaiting the
Commission's decision, but this carries the risk that the Commission may
subsequently block the venture. It is possible that a warning letter will
have the same effect as a decision blocking the deal. This would make the
joint venture's further implementation unlawful.
Finally, it is difficult to understand why there should be no time limit on
the second stage of the inquiry, given the amount of information that the
Commission will have by then.

Newsletters.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Technology: Setting standards for telecoms - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The diverse interests which comprise European telecommunications meet in
Nice next month in an attempt to resolve an issue which threatens to split
the industry and damage the standards-setting process.
The issue concerns telecoms standards, intellectual property and the extent
to which a company's rights to a proprietary technology can be overridden in
the public interest. The Gatt trade talks and the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) are both likely to be affected
by the outcome of the Nice meeting.
ETSI was established by the European Commission to handle the highly
technical but commercially vital subject of telecoms standardisation. It is
made up of telecoms operators (PTTs), national governments, telecoms
equipment manufacturers, information technology companies and consultants.
When it comes to voting, national governments and the PTTs are in the
majority.
ETSI plays a crucial role in the standards-setting process and, therefore,
in the development of the single market where inter-connectivity and
inter-operability of electronics equipment is essential. Brief acquaintance
with Europe's motley collection of telecoms systems is enough to convince
anyone of the importance of ETSI's work. All the greater shame that it is in
danger of being disrupted by the current squabble.
Standards are essentially concerned with operational rules. Inevitably, they
involve products and processes that are the intellectual property of
companies which may have invested many millions of dollars in their
development.
For most standards-setting bodies - the International Standards
Organisation, for example - international property rights licensing is
voluntary; the IPR owner agrees to the incorporation of its technology in
the standard. If it refuses, the standards body is forced to find a way of
setting the standard without impinging on the IPR.
ETSI is taking a different tack. It has written a draft proposal which would
allow 90 days from a particular date during which a company may withhold a
particular IPR from a standard; if it fails to do so, the technology becomes
available for licensing to members and non-members.
Governments and the PTTs, which spend comparatively little on research and
development and own few IPRs, seem content with the proposal. IT companies,
which sow billions of dollars a year in research and harvest IPRs like
wheat, are outraged. Led by International Business Machines, Digital
Equipment, Motorola and Philips, they are lobbying for a modified proposal
involving voluntary licencing.
The essential problem is the difficulty for any large company of knowing
precisely which IPRs or potential IPRs it holds at any one time and which
ones may be involved in the standards the multiplicity of ETSI committees
are working on. They fear losing their IPRs by default. Ownership of an IPR
which becomes a standard is one of the key technological differentiators for
IT companies today.
There are arguments that it is a technological problem which could be solved
by technology - a computer database, for example, which would match ETSI's
work with its members' IPR records. This would be hard to implement in
globally spread companies where research is carried out at a multiplicity of
sites.
There are other considerations. The IT companies complain the proposal may
breach Gatt regulations. EC importers of licensed products manufactured in
third countries would be at a disadvantage because the terms available to
them would be less good than those available to ETSI members.
Some computer companies are so concerned by the proposal they are prepared
to withdraw from ETSI rather than risk their intellectual treasures. The
commission wrote to ETSI last year encouraging it to opt for a voluntary
licensing system, based on 'tried and proven principles'. It is hard to
disagree with its sentiments.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Technology: Reshaping the trading floor - The role of
broker-dealer may be transformed with the launch of order-driven systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is share trading in London on the brink of its next technological
revolution?
The first came with the Big Bang reforms of 1986, when the stock market
shifted from the floor of the Stock Exchange to the telephone. The next
possible step is electronic trading, with computers bringing together buyers
and sellers and, in some cases, fixing the prices of trades as well. If that
happens, the role of the Stock Exchange and broker-dealers could be
transformed.
The latest attack on the current market structure comes from Tradepoint
Financial Networks, a start-up venture which aims to compete with the
renamed London Stock Exchange on a capital base of only Dollars 11m (Pounds
7.7m). Tradepoint, due to be launched in October, is an order-driven system:
anyone who wants to buy or sell shares posts an order on a screen, then
waits to see if anyone comes forward to trade against that order
electronically.
That makes it an alternative to the dealer-driven (or quote-driven)
telephone market, which is based on prices advertised by marketmakers.
Buyers or sellers use the telephone to trade, often negotiating a better
price than the one advertised (something that happens in 55 per cent of
share trades in London of more than Pounds 100,000, according to the London
Stock Exchange).
Constructing an order-driven or auction market is cheap and technically easy
to do. Tradepoint reckons it needs to win only 1.5 per cent of London's
stock market business to break even.
Off-the-shelf software has helped to cut the cost. Tradepoint studied stock
market systems offered by Transvik (whose cross-border market in
Scandinavian shares, Nordex, recently closed) and OM (the Swedish futures
and options market) before picking VCT. This system, developed by the
Vancouver Stock Exchange, has been installed in Mexico and Caracas.
The market will be run on a Stratus fault-tolerant computer, under a
facilities management arrangement with Extel Financial. The communications
software comes from Ericsson and the screens use Microsoft Windows.
Tradepoint is being launched as Instinet, the Reuters-owned electronic
dealing system, is renewing its efforts to break into the London markets.
Instinet, created in 1969 and bought by Reuters in 1987, has 200 terminals
in use in Europe, double the number of a year ago, and claims the level of
business it is handling has risen six-fold over the same period - though it
declines to give absolute trading levels.
Instinet has adopted a lower-risk approach than Tradepoint, prefering to
depict itself as an alternative broker rather than an alternative stock
market. The only difference with other brokers, it says, is that its users
have full access to all the buy or sell orders it has received. With its
established base of users in the US, around 90 per cent of trades currently
done in London bring together US institutions on the one hand and UK brokers
on the other.
Electronic trading systems have been tried before and failed. Markets are
fine-tuned mechanisms: they must bring together different groups of users,
each with a different interest and a different level of information, in a
way that leaves each feeling they have a fair deal. Using technology to
replicate an existing market, or to create a new one, poses challenges which
go beyond the technological.
A decade ago, attempts were made to launch similar order-driven markets in
London for both equities (known as Ariel) and bonds (Eurex). Ariel was
created by a group of institutional investors looking for a way to avoid the
high minimum commissions on the London Stock Exchange. When the fixed
commission structure disappeared, the impetus behind the system withered.
Eurex did not get off the drawing board: marketmakers saw it as a threat to
their existence and opposed its creation, according to Stanley Ross, a
former head of Deutsche Bank Capital Markets in London, who is is now
president of Tradepoint.
The real reason telephone trading has survived could be more simple.
Investors prefer to deal by phone because it enables them to negotiate over
price and because the relationships between institutional investors and
equity and bond salespeople makes human intermediation an important part of
the way markets operate in London.
Why should electronic trading succeed this time round? Two factors have
changed since the early 1980s, and both point towards a greater use of
technology.
The first is cost. Both broker-dealers and investment managers are under
greater pressure, due to overcapacity in the securities markets. As the cost
of computing power has fallen, the cost of human dealers has risen.
Order-driven systems hold out the promise of cutting out dealers altogether.
However, there is little immediate sign of change. When asked, most
investors say they are getting good value out of the London markets. They
can generally trade in large volumes instantly, rather than having to wait
for another investor to provide the other side of their order.
They also say the liquidity provided to the markets by broker-dealers is
relatively cheap.
Members of the London Stock Exchange made a return on capital of less than 1
per cent between them in the first nine months of last year. Since the
mid-1980s, their best performance was the 15 per cent return in 1989 - a
poor return given the big losses they have shouldered in other years.
Cost considerations have already brought a degree of automation to the
existing market. Trade, an automated system run by Barclays de Zoete Wedd,
the investment banking arm of Barclays bank, claims around 10 per cent of
the total number of bargains passing through the stock market. Orders are
submitted to the system by independent brokers around the UK, and are
executed automatically at the 'yellow strip' price - the best price quoted
by any marketmaker in the particular stock at the time.
According to BZW, around 15 per cent of deals received by marketmakers over
the telephone are subsequently disputed in some way, involving expensive
human intervention after the trade. The error rate on automated trades, by
comparison, is 'a fraction of 1 per cent'.
The second reason electronic trading systems may finally have come of age is
that the nature of investment has changed, with computers becoming more
involved in decisions to buy or sell stocks.
Index-tracking funds, which seek not to outperform a stock market index but
to match it, now account for an estimated 15 per cent of funds under
management in London. The newest wave of funds use so-called quantitative
investment methods - they analyse stocks for pre-selected properties to try
to identify under-valued shares.
'All this money is crucial to us - it's managed by computers,' says Mike
Sanderson, president of Instinet. As this trend increases, the human
intervention of a broker's sales staff becomes less important. Also,
computer investment strategies such as index-linking are intended to provide
low-cost entry to a stock market, making order-driven trading systems, which
cut out the marketmaker in the middle, theoretically attractive.
Instinet has been reshaped to appeal to the new age of computer-based
investors - though its commission rates, which are the same as those charged
by conventional brokers, may deter some indexed funds.
There is one other overriding challenge the electronic markets face. A
natural gravitational force draws investors and traders to markets which are
already actively used. Why should they abandon an existing, bustling
marketplace for a new, deserted one, whatever the theoretical advantages?
The new trading screens will gather dust if they cannot generate their own
activity quickly. Peter Cox, a former Stock Exchange executive who recently
joined OM (London), says: 'The most important thing is liquidity - and a
system, no matter how good, won't get it for you on its own.'

FT  23 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): The temptation to jump

independence?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Berghaus is the sort of company on which Britain's economic recovery should
be built. From its base on Tyneside in north-east England the company has
established itself as a market leader in the field of outdoor clothing and
equipment.
Founded in 1966 by two outdoor enthusiasts, Peter Lockey and Gordon Davison,
Berghaus has grown to a turnover of Pounds 20m (nearly half overseas),
pre-tax profits heading towards Pounds 750,000 and a workforce of 450
people.
Despite two difficult years Berghaus has emerged as one of those elusive
winners for which venture capitalists, bankers and academics search so hard.
Then, suddenly, last Wednesday, weeks of speculation ended with an
announcement that Berghaus's two founders were selling out to Pentland, a
cash-rich sporting and consumer goods company, for Pounds 7m.
By coincidence, Derwent Valley Foods, manufacturer of the Phileas Fogg snack
foods and, in common with Berghaus, based in the north-east, may also be on
the point of selling out. The Medomsley Road, Consett company has grown in
11 years to profits of Pounds 2m and sales of Pounds 24m, It has a workforce
of 270.
Roger McKechnie, chairman and managing director, says he has talked to many
companies over the past few months in a search for a partner to help the
company expand more rapidly overseas. There has been widespread speculation
that United Biscuits, a large foods group, might buy Derwent Valley.
McKechnie says nothing is excluded.
Berghaus and Derwent Valley are not alone in selling out or considering a
sale. British companies are so willing to give up their independence that
there is a growing concern at the country's failure to create a core of
independent, medium-sized businesses, what the Germans call their
Mittelstand.
A 1990 study, Overcoming Barriers to Growth in Small Firms, by the Advisory
Council on Science and Technology (Acost), highlighted the rapid increase in
the number of small businesses (employing fewer than 100 people) and a sharp
decline in the number of medium-sized companies (employing between 100 and
499 people).
A belated recognition by government and policymakers that Britain was poor
at growing more substantial businesses has forced a refocusing of business
support initiatives. The government's planned network of business advice
centres or 'one-stop shops' is to concentrate on the established small and
medium-sized businesses.
Why cannot these medium-sized companies make it on their own? Their US and
German counterparts, by all accounts, grow far larger without compromising
their independence. The reasons are many but several main strands emerge:
Finance. British companies are over-dependent on short-term bank loans and
often reluctant to sell equity. This acts as a constraint on growth. When
venture or development capital is used, it too, has its limitations.
The venture capitalist may be unwilling to increase his exposure to a
particular company or business sector. Venture funds make most of their
profits by 'exiting' from their successful investments, not by continually
putting in fresh funds. Venture funds with a 10-year life, the most common
form of venture capital organisation in the UK, come under pressure to
realise investments as they approach their deadline for winding up, notes
David Cooksey, chairman of Advent, a venture fund.
Berghaus had been looking for additional finance for about 18 months to
finance further expansion overseas. 'We were being held back from pursuing
some markets,' says Lockey.
Management skills. The challenges posed by expansion often demand more than
the founders can give. 'Growth creates major management and organisational
problems,' say the authors of the Acost report. They point out the need for
a balanced managerial team combining marketing, financial and technical
skills. 'Different skills are needed to take a business to the second
stage,' comments Malcolm Hay, corporate finance partner at accountants Ernst
&amp; Young.
Sometimes the inability of the founding entrepreneur to delegate becomes a
barrier to growth while, even if the founder accepts the need to expand his
management team, incorporating new managers can be a significant drain on
the time of existing staff, Acost notes.
'It is not just finance we need,' says Derwent Valley's McKechnie. 'If we
went naively into Europe we would be ripped off.' Linking up with a larger
company would provide finance and expertise, he says.
The founders' ambitions. Most people who set up in business have no
intention of growing to any size. They are content if their business
provides them with a comfortable living. 'Sixty per cent of people who start
businesses do not want to grow,' comments Barrow.
Lockey denies running out of energy to run Berghaus but he and Davison are
retaining the shop where the company started. The LD Mountain Centre has a
turnover of Pounds 1m and employs 14 people but Lockey says he has plans to
expand.
Selling out is not the only option open to the founder manager wondering
whether he can manage the next stage in his business's growth, though it is
the most common route. He could decide to stay on and pace the growth. This
can pose problems, too.
One business owner rejected an offer of venture capital only to find his
managers became frustrated with the slow rate of progress, recalls Colin
Barrow, head of the enterprise group at Cranfield School of Management. A
year or so later the managers resigned, raised their own venture capital and
set up in competition with their former employer. 'Managers want to work for
companies which grow quickly. It looks better on their CVs.'
Founder managers must also make sure that they do not miss the opportunity
to get out at the most favourable time. Technology develops so rapidly that
a company's competitive advantage can be lost if it does not move quickly
while competitors will be quick to exploit gaps in a market.
The volatility of the UK economy also provides an incentive for
entrepreneurs to get out while the going is good, says Graham Bannock, a
small firms consultant. 'The situation is so unstable that they give in to
the temptation to accept an offer. They might never get another because the
economy may have gone into recession again.'
Flotation is another option though the illiquidity of small company shares
has made this less attractive over the past five years. The London Stock
Exchange's plans to close the Unlisted Securities Market in 1995 will
further narrow options. The result could be that more companies succumb to
an offer from a trade buyer.
But does it matter that medium-sized companies lose their independence as
long as the purchaser manages them well and gives them the funds they need?
Yes it does, according to Acost and other studies. Smaller, independent
businesses are better than large ones at developing new technologies. They
can respond more flexibly to changing market demands and can bring new
products to market more quickly and cheaply than large firms. They also
ensure a greater range of choice and make for healthy competition.
There are also implications for regional policy. Areas such as the
north-east, which have attempted to rebuild their economy by supporting
indigenous businesses, are concerned at the loss of local control.
'Independent companies are a vital part of the market system,' says Cooksey.
'But they are not sacrosanct and takeovers are a means of industrial
renewal. There is nothing wrong with large companies taking over
medium-sized ones provided other small companies come along to take their
place.'

bear fruit - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A European programme to provide seed capital finance has exceeded
expectations and led to the creation of 126 new businesses providing more
than 1,200 jobs, the European Venture Capital Association says.
Nearly 70 per cent of the businesses formed have a strong technology
orientation with a particular emphasis on software, healthcare and
biotechnology. The three-year-old programme is expected to create more than
340 new companies employing more than 4,000 people when European Commission
backing ends in 1995. A further 30 businesses are expected to fail.
The European Seed Capital Fund Network consists of 23 new seed capital funds
set up with European Commission backing and a further 18 established seed
funds which also joined the network.

rates - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Business rates have risen by 28 per cent over the past three years compared
with an increase of just 20 per cent in the retail price index, according to
the latest NatWest/Small Business Research Trust small business survey.
Rates account for an average 2.3 per cent of the sales of small businesses;
but for the very smallest businesses, with sales of less than Pounds 20,000,
they account for 5.1 per cent of turnover.
Unlike corporation and income tax, rates must be paid whether or not the
business makes a profit, the survey noted.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Keeping tight hold of
your title - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Many companies write a 'retention of title' clause into their terms of trade
to allow them to retain ownership of goods even after they have been
delivered. The aim is to increase their chance of getting their goods or
money back if a customer goes bust. But do these clauses work when the goods
are exported to another country?
Baker &amp; McKenzie, a firm of solicitors, has produced a guide to the
effectiveness of retention of title throughout Europe. Retention of Title in
Sales Contracts within Europe explains that in some countries the clause
must be registered to be valid while others place restrictions on the goods
which can be covered.

elusive investors - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Raising finance in the present economic climate is a task most venture
capitalists would not wish upon their worst enemy. But against the trend a
handful of funds have succeeded in finding investors.
Phoenix Fund Managers this month completed the raising of its first fund, of
just over Pounds 50m, while European Acquisition Capital, part of the
Swedish Enskilda banking group, has raised a Pounds 65m private equity fund
to back buy-outs and buy-ins.
This followed a Pounds 14m fund-raising by Trinity Capital Partners by the
first closing of a European Environmental Fund on behalf of the US
investment bank Alex Brown &amp; Sons. Meanwhile, Alta Berkeley Associates
raised Dollars 21m towards a planned Dollars 50m for its fourth fund, Alta
Berkeley III.

payments - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Would the creation of a prompt payment standard or kitemark persuade British
companies to improve their poor payments performance? The Institute of
Credit Management has approached both the British Standards Institution and
the government to sound out their ideas.
The institute's original plan was for a 'prompt payment' clause to be added
to BS5750, a quality management standard which has won widespread
acceptance. But this was rejected by BSI because many companies had signed
up for BS5750 without such a clause.
The institute now hopes to create a separate 'kitemark' which would commit
companies to paying their bills by the date stipulated in the agreed terms.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Digital likely to save Irish computer plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Irish government has apparently averted the total closure of a Digital
Equipment Corporation manufacturing plant in the west of Ireland.
The US computer manufacturer is poised between concentrating production of
its new personal computer range at either the Galway plant or a similar one
at Ayr in south-west Scotland as part of its retrenchment plans in Europe.
About 1,000 jobs are at stake at each plant and the UK and Irish governments
have been intensively lobbying Digital in the past few weeks to sway the
decision in their favour.
A high-level Irish government delegation that met in Boston, Massachusetts,
yesterday with top Digital executives has apparently succeeded in its
attempt to save the Galway plant.
A final decision on the future of the plants, which make mini-computers and
personal computers, is expected in the next day or two. Mr Rauiri Quinn, the
Irish minister for employment and enterprise, who led the Irish delegation
to Digital's headquarters in Boston, said the meeting was 'productive and
satisfactory'. He added: 'We now expect the Galway plant to stay open in
some shape or form.'
Mr Quinn presented Mr Robert Palmer, Digital's chief executive, with new
proposals, which according to the Industrial Development Authority in Dublin
included a plan to locate Digital's European headquarters at Galway.
According to a Irish government spokesman, Mr Quinn emphasised that if
Digital decides in favour of Ayr, the growing Euro-scepticism in the UK 'and
within the Tory party in particular, might create problems for Digital in
European terms'. Mr Quinn also delivered a warning that any attempt to win
the computer company's favour by breaking EC competition rules would be
taken up in Brussels.
Before leaving for Boston Mr Quinn said: 'Stories to that effect have been
conveyed to us from different sources although we have received no absolute
confirmation of them . . . The authorities in the Republic of Ireland and
our representatives in the European parliament and commission will ensure
that no unfair advantage of any particular kind that is in breach of
competition rules will be used by any other government within the EC.'
About 25 per cent of Digital's Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.75bn) European annual
sales are in the UK market, and of this it is estimated that Dollars 400m
comprises UK government contracts.
If a reorganisation of manufacturing production between Ayr and Galway now
goes ahead instead of plant closure, it is thought likely that Galway would
retain its software, marketing, and research and development activities
which employ about 350 people.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Minister defends ECGD sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT minister insisted yesterday that privatisation of part of the
Export Credits Guarantee Department of the Department of Trade and Industry
had not disadvantaged UK exporters.
Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, confirmed in the Commons that
transitional support from the ECGD for the privatised successor to its
insurance services group would continue to be available up to December 1994.
This arrangement was designed to ensure that the new company had time to
arrange to source its full re-insurance requirements from the private
market.
Mr Needham said the newly-privatised company sourced over 90 per cent of its
reinsurance needs, for both commercial and political risk worldwide, from
the private sector.
His response came after a concerted Labour attack on the government's export
insurance regime, which has been given fresh impetus by ministers' renewed
emphasis on exports as an important element in the UK's economic recovery.
Mr Needham explained that under a separate arrangement the ECGD provided the
new company with 100 per cent reinsurance of the risks - largely political -
arising on certain high risk markets for which no capacity was available in
the private market.
'This facility is not time-limited and, subject to satisfactory financial
performance, it will continue for as long as the government considers it
essential to meet the reasonable needs of UK exporters,' Mr Needham said.
He also said that, according to 'early indications', the orderly rundown of
ECGD's staff numbers over the next 12 months would be achieved by wholly
voluntary means.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Personal touch under threat from holiday giants: A takeover
may squeeze out small agencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MANAGING director of the the Gorton Travel Bureau in Greenwich, south
London, was last week asked by a customer to book him into a certain Turkish
hotel. Mr Ken Goddard, the director of the agency, replied that he had
visited the hotel and would not recommend it.
Mr Goddard believes the UK's 5,000 independent travel agents will survive
only if they can offer travellers that sort of local knowledge and service.
Some small companies fear that the proposed takeover of the tour operator
Owners Abroad by Airtours, its rival, will drive many independent travel
agents out of business. Others argue they will have to adopt new survival
strategies even if the bid is blocked.
Mr Andreas Kanaris, managing director of the Delta Travel Agency in
Manchester, says: 'For better or worse, we're in a marketplace and we should
be able to make good ourselves.'
If the takeover goes ahead, Airtours and Thomson, the UK's biggest travel
company, will control about 60 per cent of the tour market. They will also
own the two largest travel agency chains, Pickfords Travel and Lunn Poly.
The Office of Fair Trading has sent its recommendation to Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who is expected to make an
announcement shortly.
The Association of Independent Tour Operators, which opposes the takeover,
says the five largest chains - Lunn Poly, Pickfords, Thomas Cook, Hogg
Robinson and AT Mays - already handle more than half the holidays sold by
travel agents, in spite of having only 26 per cent of shops.
If the bid is referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, it will
have to consider whether the links between large tour operators and travel
agents allows them to squeeze smaller organisations out.
Even without such links, however, the growing size of the large chains makes
it difficult for small agents to compete because the large chains are able
to offer price cuts that are often as big as the independent outlets'
commissions.
Miss Janet Poole, a director of CK Travel in Birmingham, says a client
recently told her one large chain had offered him a Pounds 175 discount on a
Mediterranean cruise and had also offered to upgrade his cabin at a further
saving of Pounds 250.
Miss Poole says: 'I could match the discount but not the cabin upgrade. The
large agencies have got the volume to strike commercial agreements and we
can't compete with that.'
Mr Kanaris says Delta's strategy is not to confront the large agencies
head-on by offering the same holidays. His agency specialises in offering
late bookings which often sell at reduced prices. The tour operator, he
says, usually offers the discount and the agent's profit margin is not
unduly affected. Mr Kanaris employs an airline specialist to search out
fares and deals that the large chains do not offer.
It is not to regulation but to entrepreneurship that independents need to
look.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government seeks summer approval
for Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Political Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is determined to secure ratification of the Maastricht treaty
by the summer, despite the emergence last night of fresh confusion over the
possible consequences of new amendments relating to the social chapter.
Senior ministers believe the legislation can receive parliamentary approval
before the summer recess and would be prepared to see parliament sitting
into August to hasten ratification. Normally both the Commons and the Lords
would break up for the summer in late July, returning in October to tie up
loose ends.
Yesterday, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned that at least 10 European
countries would go ahead with their unity plans if either Britain or Denmark
failed to endorse the Maastricht treaty within six months.
Mr Kohl's statement reiterated a position he outlined at the European
Community summit in Edinburgh last December and officials in both Bonn and
Downing Street sought to play down the impact of Mr Kohl's words.
But the Maastricht bill hit a further snag yesterday as hours of debate were
lost in a renewed row over the government's U-turn last week on the legal
effect of passing an opposition amendment on the social chapter.
And in seeking to explain the government's position to a noisy and crowded
Commons, Sir Nicholas Lyell, attorney-general, appeared to admit the
possibility of more disruption as a result of fresh social chapter-related
amendments.
Labour will now turn its attention to an amendment which would exclude the
social protocol from the part of the bill giving the European parliament
more powers.
Though Sir Nicholas seemed to suggest that if such an amendment were passed
it could wreck the ratification process, that has not ruled it out so far as
the Labour front bench is concerned.
The opposition has time to decide on tactics. But such an amendment offers
the most likely prospect of an effective alliance between the opposition and
Tory Euro-rebels against the government.
Yesterday's hiccup came as Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said the
government would have the authority to meet the administrative costs of the
social chapter for which Britain could be liable.
In a letter to Sir Teddy Taylor, MP for Southend East and a leading Tory
Euro-sceptic, Mr Hurd said parliament's assent to the Maastricht bill at the
third reading would enable the government to ratify the treaty. 'That
includes the social protocol and Britain's obligation to pay its share of
associated administrative costs.'
In the Commons, Sir Nicholas underlined the government's insistence that
defeat on the original Labour amendment would not wreck the treaty, arguing
there was 'no constitutional impropriety' in proceeding with ratification
under such circumstances.
'Parliament cannot pick and choose which treaty obligations to accept,' he
said. 'But it can prevent ratification of the entire treaty by refusing to
enact the bill.'
He declined requests for his advice on the legal effect of passing the
amendment to be published, saying he was not aware of any precedent.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Number of long-term jobless set to exceed 1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of people out of work for longer than one year is expected to
cross the 1m mark today.
The total of 956,000 long-term unemployed in October is expected to increase
for the ninth consecutive quarter when the figures for the three months to
January are published by the Department of Employment.
The long-term unemployment total was last over 1m in the summer of 1988. The
new figures will be released less than a week after the jobless total went
over 3m for the first time in almost six years.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, said yesterday: 'Anyone losing
their job is a victim of unemployment, but those out of work for longer than
a year are the super-victims. It is an insult to them to talk about forcing
them to work. Most of them want nothing more in life than the opportunity of
a job, but that opportunity is being denied them.'
Long-term unemployment will continue to rise after unemployment has peaked.
Forecasts for the timing of the peak vary from the end of this year to early
1996.
The government, which is considering new initiatives for the jobless, is
particularly concerned to address the needs of the long-term unemployed.
Official figures show that there is a sharp drop in employment opportunities
for people registered as unemployed for more than six months.
Around a fifth of the long-term unemployed at present are aged between 18
and 24, many of whom have never worked. It is understood that the government
would like to target this group for some form of compulsory temporary work
or training. It believes that many such individuals could be lost
permanently from the labour market.
Several models are being considered by the government including one
submitted by the Employment Policy Institute, an independent think tank, for
a temporary job scheme offering part-time work with a wage for up to 200,000
18-to-24-year-olds.
The scheme would involve the private, public and voluntary sectors in
organising temporary work for an age group the government sees as a priority
for action to bring them back into the world of work. The net cost would be
Pounds 257bn, said the institute.
The government is considering how best to provide further help to the
unemployed. It is likely that temporary work schemes offering benefit plus
Pounds 10 a week will be expanded.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Clarke pushed to tackle juvenile
crime
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CLARKE indicated last night that he will respond to strong pressure from
Tory MPs and set out within the next two weeks details of plans for tackling
crimes by young people - almost certainly including new privately operated
institutions for persistent offenders.
The home secretary's comments came after he faced calls at a meeting with
Conservative backbench MPs for swift legislative action. Mr Clarke will
avoid delays by not producing a 'white paper' but his decisions are still
unlikely to be implemented for at least a year.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Pay for top jobs shows small rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOP JOB vacancies handled by headhunters last year paid just 1 per cent more
than equivalent vacancies in 1991, according to an analysis of more than
2,000 unadvertised posts.
Executive vacancies in London and the south-east continued to command the
highest salaries in spite of reductions in job opportunities throughout the
region.
London and south-east pay averaged Pounds 51,800 compared with salaries
offered to senior managers in central southern England (Pounds 46,800) and
the north (Pounds 46,300). At the bottom of the league were East Anglia
(Pounds 44,900) and the south-west and Wales (Pounds 44,300).
There was a drop of 7 per cent in executive vacancies in the Pounds 30,000
to Pounds 50,000 pay band last year according to InterExec, the outplacement
consultancy that conducted the survey. At the same time, there was a 5 per
cent rise in opportunities for those earning Pounds 50,000 to Pounds
100,000, indicating that companies were still willing to pay for top
performers.
Executives overwhelmingly chose cash over a company car when changing jobs,
said Mr Nick Hawkins, InterExec's chairman. 'While salaries remain static,
the car as a status symbol - known as the 'driveway syndrome' - is likely to
become even more pronounced,' he said.
Overall, there would be an excess of middle and senior managers for the next
five years, which meant that most executives were likely to see their pay
frozen for some time, said Mr Hawkins. The figures 'appear to support the
view of many major employers that by 1995 the annual salary review will be
the exception rather than the norm', he said.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Crime grates on the electorate's
raw nerve - Signs of a limited consensus seen between the two main parties
on law and order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH unbridled chutzpah Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary, wrote last
night to the Home Office suggesting that his document, Getting to Grips with
Youth Crime, could form the basis of government policy.
It would be churlish of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, to throw it
straight in the bin.
Labour and the Tories are at one on several points. They agree that tackling
juvenile crime has to be a priority, the government has to take a lead in
ensuring the community distinguishes between 'right' and 'wrong', and that
offenders beyond redemption should be locked away.
But to state that much is far from spotting an outbreak of consensus. The
political noises and the apparent sparks of originality on crime policy -
intensified by last week's murder of a two-year-old in Liverpool - reflect
more a shift in the centre of gravity in the debate on law and order.
Mr Blair, a very able frontbencher appointed to his present post last
summer, has taken a policy area in which Labour is traditionally weak.
Extending the work of his predecessor, Mr Roy Hattersley, he has put a
greater emphasis on part of the party's message that matches the convictions
of Labour's target voters - the middle classes and aspiring working classes:
that crime is bad, criminals are nasty and something has to be done.
Although a connection is denied, Mr Blair has echoed President Bill Clinton
to the extent that he is enunciating what a majority of the population - and
the electorate - believes. The message is two-pronged, however, for Labour
has not abandoned its long-held belief that addressing causes is as
important as condemning criminals. 'We need to tackle this problem in a
concerted way; tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime,' Mr Blair said
at the launch of the policy document.
So while Mr Blair backed more secure accommodation for teenage offenders and
agreed there may be a gap in the law that prevents persistent young
offenders being imprisoned, he also wanted measures to cut drug abuse and
improve education.
He opposed the setting up of private-sector-operated special institutions
for young offenders, preferring instead an expansion of the secure homes run
by local authorities under the health department's budget. Similarly, Mr
Blair used a speech last Friday to emphasise the importance of morality, but
stressed that 'the breakdown in order is intimately linked to the break-up
of community.'
He is adept at exploiting Tory weaknesses. After 14 years in power, the
debate among Conservatives is becoming more fluid. The rightwing 'hanging
and flogging' MPs remain, pressing Mr Clarke last night to take strong
action soon. Some now openly call for the castration of rapists. Many
support corporal punishment.
But Mr Clarke recognises the need for the government to 'lead society' and
of giving youngsters a sense of purpose.
Concepts of 'society' and 'community' are returning to ministers' speeches.
Mr Brian Mawhinney, the health minister, will tomorrow urge churches to take
more of a role in educating people in social issues such as Aids.
There is a sense of failure. Initiatives have been and gone, but the crime
rate has risen inexorably. 'Beware of politicians who speak loudly on crime.
They promise a lot and do little,' said Sir John Wheeler, former Tory
chairman of the Commons home affairs committee. Many of the Tory
backbenchers fear the party is in danger of losing still more political
ground over law-and-order issues to Labour.
Amid this maelstrom, Mr Clarke is trying to agree details of his juvenile
crime initiative and respond to pressure for action from Tory ranks. A
crackdown against persistent teenage offenders was announced at last
October's Conservative conference. Promises of tougher penalties for
offences committed on bail were in the Tory election manifesto last April.
But parliamentary time for the necessary legislation unlikely until the
autumn, has still to be agreed.
If Mr Clarke does not fill the vacuum, Mr Blair will not be afraid of trying
himself.

NO SIGNIFICANT structural or constitutional changes should be made to the

authority members said yesterday.
About 200 representatives from county councils and metropolitan authorities
met at the House of Commons to discuss reform proposals.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, has indicated he is considering
radical changes that could include reducing the number of forces in England
and Wales from 43 to about 25, centralising funding and replacing locally
elected councillors on police authorities with nominees.
But Mr John Smith, vice-president of the Association of Chief Police
Officers, said elected members should remain a 'significant' proportion of
authorities.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEGAL attempt to oust West Belfast MP Dr Joe Hendron failed yesterday
after judges at a special election court in the city ruled that he had made
inaccurate election returns but was not guilty of corrupt practice.
At the general election last April, Dr Hendron captured the seat for the
nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party by 589 votes from Mr Gerry
Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. Mr Adams had held
the seat since 1983.
After the election, Dr Hendron estimated that he was helped by about 1,500
Protestants in unionist enclaves of the constituency who had voted
tactically to remove Mr Adams.
In the legal challenge resolved yesterday, a West Belfast constituent had
alleged that Dr Hendron's campaign had overspent on the legal limit of
Pounds 6,375.
If the court had found that either Dr Hendron or his election agent had
acted illegally or corruptly, the Speaker of the Commons would have been
recommended to disqualify Dr Hendron for up to 10 years and a by-election
would have been required.
After the ruling, Dr Hendron said he felt as if he had 'won the election all
over again', and that he and his agent had been 'totally and absolutely
vindicated by the court'.
But they now face a Pounds 40,000 legal bill after the judges made a special
ruling ordering that the parties in the case pay their own costs.
In making the order the judges also said: 'We consider that there were
matters to be properly investigated in this election court and the party
(who took the action) was fully justified in making this petition, and we
think it proper that this should be recognised.'

FT  23 FEB 93 / An ailing commercial property market starts to stir:
Investors are returning to a sector shunned by institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are tentative signs of increased interest from investors in the UK
commercial property market after three years of a ferocious downturn which
has destroyed property values, bankrupted developers and left scores of
unoccupied developments in the hands of bankers.
Most institutions and large property companies are still shunning the
market. But private buyers and foreign investors are increasing their role,
encouraged by the devaluation of sterling, the decline of interest rates and
the possibility of investing close to the bottom of the market.
There has been a surge in foreign investment in central London offices. It
has been encouraged by the fall in sterling and the high, secure income
offered by UK property. Last year more than Pounds 1bn was invested by
overseas buyers, over half of them German, largely after sterling's exit
from the European exchange rate mechanism in September.
Private investors have been encouraged to put money into property by the
reductions in interest rates. The auction rooms which deal with very small
properties say there has been a strong increase in interest since the final
quarter of last year.
One of the largest private investors is Mr Jack Walker, a former steel
magnate and vice-president of Blackburn Rovers football club, who is
investing Pounds 150m in property using Pounds 100m of bank borrowings.
Antler Investments, Mr Walker's Jersey-based property investment vehicle,
last year bought a Pounds 22m portfolio of industrial properties from
property group British Land; a Pounds 5m retail portfolio from Royal Life,
the life assurance subsidiary of Royal Insurance; a Pounds 15.4m Bristol
office building, a Pounds 6.15m Cheltenham office building and a Pounds 16m
office building at the Haymarket in Edinburgh.
Institutions appear to be reluctant to resume their traditional role as
mainstay of the market. Annual net investment in the last couple of years
has been around Pounds 700m, a third of the 1989 level. A recent Gallup
survey found increased buying interest from insurance companies, but waning
interest from pension funds.
In the UK corporate sector, buyers are outweighed by would-be sellers. The
large quoted property companies have generally been selling in the downturn
as their balance sheets have come under increasing pressure. A notable
exception is British Land, which has spent more than Pounds 900m on property
since 1989.
Otherwise, the most active corporate buyers have been a handful of
entrepreneurial companies that have emerged over the past two years.
For example, Eskmuir Properties, the investment company set up by the Laing
family in 1990, has spent Pounds 80m and is looking to spend a further
Pounds 50m this year on high-yielding and securely let property. Argent, run
by Mr Peter Freeman and Mr Michael Freeman, both former lawyers, has
invested more than Pounds 130m in the past 18 months and says it could spend
the same again. 'We are buying at the bottom of one of the worst-ever
markets in property,' says Mr Michael Freeman.
Pillar, set up by Arlington Securities, General Electric Pension Fund and
Electra, the UK fund, spent Pounds 70m last year and has a further Pounds
120m to spend. Rotch Property Group, owned by the Iranian Tchenguiz family,
has also invested throughout the recession.
The pattern of recent deals shows that investors have an appetite for every
type of property in every part of the country, although overseas investors
show a clear preference for central London offices. 'London is the only
international city in the UK,' says Mr Klaus Hohmann, a director of DEGI, a
large German fund that has bought three London buildings.
There is particular interest in retail property, especially warehouses,
while out-of-town offices and business parks are largely out of favour.
Surveys also suggest that investors are showing increasing interest in the
east Midlands and the north of England.
While they display a catholic approach to location and type of property,
investors are making stringent demands about the quality and security of
income from buildings.
Virtually all transactions over the past two years have featured high
investment yields, good-quality covenants - reflecting tenants' ability to
pay the rent - and long leases. 'The law of property used to be 'location,
location, location'. It is now 'location, quality, covenant' - and not
necessarily in that order,' says Mr Iain Ramsay of Antler.
The rigid criteria imposed by investors - coupled with similar restrictions
imposed by banks' lending policies - has limited demand to, at most, 15 per
cent of available property.
The result is a highly fragmented investment market. Unlet new developments
and buildings with leases of less than 10 years are virtually unsellable. At
the same time, there is growing competition for the few properties that are
in demand; many potential investors are experiencing severe difficulties in
spending the money they have earmarked for property.
'There is a shortage of product at the right price,' says Mr Andrew Strang,
managing director of Allied Dunbar's property funds, which spent Pounds 100m
on property last year.
Potential investors are increasingly frustrated. Even the fall in interest
rates, which enhances the attractions of property, has made investment more
difficult as sellers are much more reluctant to dispose of their property.
Although the upturn of interest in parts of the market has been welcomed,
the industry is sceptical about its chances of being converted into a large
surge of investment.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Code for junk mail is agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Direct Marketing Assoc-iation moved yesterday to give greater
credibility to the direct marketing business - worth an estimated Pounds 9bn
last year - by announcing the industry's first code of practice aimed at
self-regulation.
Association members will be required before sending unsolicited material to
consult a register of those who do not wish to receive any. At present there
is no such requirement, and it is left to recipients of junk mail to stem
the flow.
The move was welcomed by the Mailing Preference Service, the independent
body which keeps the register. The service is supported by Royal Mail,
direct marketing trade associations and the Consumers' Association as a
lobby against junk mail.
The association has about 500 members including advertisers, advertising
agencies and database practitioners.
There are many companies outside the association - the precise number is
unknown - involved in direct marketing, and their activities will not be
regulated by the code.
The code deals with a wide range of promotional techniques including
incentives, gifts, prize draws and competitions.
The code, to be introduced on March 31, sets out standards of conduct and
best practice to be used in any complaints from the public or in disputes
between association members.
Code available from Direct Marketing Association, Haymarket House, 1 Oxenden
Street, London SW1Y 4EE. Pounds 5 to non-members.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Senior GMTV executive resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MS LIS HOWELL, director of programmes at GMTV, yesterday became a casualty
of the commercial breakfast company's disappointing performance in the
ratings.
Her resignation comes less than two months after GMTV took over the
franchise from TV-am. It follows the appointment of Mr Greg Dyke, former
chief executive of London Weekend Television, as non-executive chairman.
Ms Howell will be replaced by Mr Peter McHugh, a former head of current
affairs at Tyne Tees television.
The latest ratings show that GMTV is not very far ahead of its two rivals,
BBC Breakfast News, and Channel 4's The Big Breakfast.
GMTV has been getting a weekday peak audience of 1.7m with a 1.1m average,
15 per cent below its expected audience. The BBC, which has a harder news
format, has a peak of 1.3m viewers and an average of 850,000.
The big surprise has been the low-budget success of The Big Breakfast which
has been winning a peak audience of 1.2m and an average figure of 650,000.
The Big Breakfast has an annual budget of about Pounds 8m compared with
annual programme costs of around Pounds 30m at GMTV.
On Friday Mr Dyke emphasised there was no crisis comparable with the early
days of TV-am.
Mr Christopher Stoddart, managing director, said then that there was
'plentiful demand for advertising'. GMTV, jointly owned by Carlton
Communications, LWT (Holdings), Scottish TV, Walt Disney and The Guardian
and Manchester Evening News, took or booked more than Pounds 50m in
advertising revenue before it went on air on January 1.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Devaluation 'will boost output'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURING output is likely to grow by more than the local economy in all
but one UK region this year as sterling's devaluation increases
competitiveness, according to a report published yesterday.
Business Strategies, a consultancy group, says the 15 per cent drop in the
pound's value since mid-September together with recently introduced higher
investment allowances should particularly help engineering, a sector badly
hit by the recession.
Better prospects for manufacturing will provide only a modest lift to
overall wealth creation and employment, it adds. With growth in consumer
spending likely to be muted, and fears about unemployment depressing
confidence, the small size of the manufacturing sector 'mitigates against
its ability to drive the entire UK economy forward'.
In an analysis of the economic consequences of the coal mine closures,
Business Strategies says the programme could reduce UK gross domestic
product by up to 0.4 per cent. There will be a significant impact on the
economies of northern England, the east Midlands and the Yorkshire and
Humberside area. In these three regions, the shutdowns are likely to reduce
regional gross domestic product by up to 1.8 per cent, 1.6 per cent and 1.1
per cent respectively.
Of the 11 regions, only northern England is likely this year to see
manufacturing grow by a smaller amount than the regional economy. For the UK
as a whole, manufacturing is expected to expand by 2.4 per cent, in contrast
to the lower growth for total gross domestic product of 1.5 per cent.
The report says the east Midlands, Northern Ireland, Wales, the south-west
and the Yorkshire area will be the main beneficiaries of the better
prospects for manufacturing, with output from this sector increasing for
each region by at least 3 per cent this year.
Unemployment is likely to rise to a monthly average of 3.24m this year,
3.28m next year, and fall after that, though it will stay above 3m until
1997. Such a level of unemployment 'may have profound effects' through
limiting growth. It 'will certainly pose a huge burden on the economy' at
the time of the next cyclical downturn which, the report predicts, will take
place in four years after an upturn.
According to Business Strategies, engineering production including
manufacture of metal goods and vehicles will increase by a relatively
healthy 2.6 per cent this year after falls of 7.4 per cent and 2.5 per cent
in 1991 and 1992 respectively. Much of this extra production will be due to
rising exports, expected to rise by 4.8 per cent for the UK as a whole.
Metals, minerals and chemicals will see a rise in output of 2.7 per cent
this year while the star of the manufacturing firmament could turn out to be
the footwear and clothing industry, with an expected rise in output of 4.7
per cent.
Sales volume growth in services generally is likely to be depressed, with
output from hotels, distribution and catering expected to rise by just 1.4
per cent this year.

FT  23 FEB 93 / TUC campaigning skills 'inadequate'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Trades Union Congress should take drastic action to change the image of
trade unionism as 'a vested interest with no concern for the general
welfare', an internal report says.
The TUC should appoint an independent public affairs consultancy to advise
it on campaigning, and should use its 125th anniversary this year to launch
a campaign presenting 'the case for modern trade unionism', the document
adds.
The highly critical report says: 'Far too many people see the unions as part
of the industrial problem which Britain faces rather than part of the
solution.'
It was written by Mr Charles Clarke, who was chief adviser to Mr Neil
Kinnock when he was Labour leader, and was discussed at yesterday's meeting
of the TUC finance and general purposes committee. Mr Clarke, who recently
started a public affairs consultancy, was appointed by the TUC in September
to examine ways of modernising its public relations and communications.
He argues that the TUC has failed in recent years to be 'effective' in
taking up public issues. The report suggests that the TUC's 'style is still
primarily oriented to former ways of persuading government' by presenting
ministers with 'well-presented argument'.
Mr Clarke claims the reaction to October's pit closures announcement and the
narrowing of the Conservative parliamentary majority after last year's
general election indicate that 'further possibilities' have opened up for
the TUC for 'successful action across the political spectrum'.
The report says: 'For those reasons the whole style of presentation and
public affairs has to be modernised if trade unions are to influence British
government decisions in the modern era.' It recommends that the TUC should:
Appoint an official to take charge of its public affairs activities.
Create 'co-ordinated contact with leading employers'.
Improve technology to reduce costs.
Decentralise managerial decision-making.
Develop a 'directory of all its network of contacts' on a computer database.
Revamp the press department.
Mr Clarke wants the TUC to take 'a more active initiating role' in
campaigning. He believes co-ordination with affiliate unions is 'patchy'. He
adds: 'A large number of informal networks exist, some on an almost
secretive basis.'

FT  23 FEB 93 / Labour targets Welsh valleys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday launched an initiative aimed at reviving the south Wales
valleys.
Mr Ron Davies, shadow Welsh secretary, backed by 12 Welsh Labour MPs, called
for a strategy to improve workforce skills, introduce more technology and
lift wages. He said: 'A twin-track programme is needed: immediate action to
halt the economic decline and a longer-term, more strategic programme geared
to permanent recovery.'
Labour believes the government's valleys programme has failed to produce
lasting economic improvements. Mr Davies said the scheme had 'upgraded the
property and environment of the valleys. They are greener, but no
foundations have been built for durable local economies.'
The initiative is an attempt to steal thunder from the government, which is
on the point of introducing plans for the valleys, once dubbed 'Wales's only
area with inner-city-type problems'.
Lord Walker, when he was Welsh secretary, brought in the first valleys
programme in 1988. The initiative was continued by his successor Mr David
Hunt, who has promised to announce new measures before the present programme
expires at the end of March.
Labour believes the valleys should be feeder areas for the growing
industrial base being created along the M4 motorway corridor running
east-west across south Wales.

BEACHES and coasts are dirtier than they were last year, according to a
survey by Norwich Union Coastwatch.
Almost half the 2,185km of coastline - 15 per cent of Britain's total -
surveyed by more than 6,000 volunteers showed evidence of litter and
pollution in an 'alarming decline' of cleanliness.
Ms Kathy Pond of Coastwatch said parts of the Scottish coastlines were among
the worst affected by sewage.

FT  23 FEB 93 / City 'loses Pounds 5m' on owners' vandalism
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Corporation of London will lose Pounds 5m of revenue this financial year
as a result of 'constructive vandalism', the damage inflicted on buildings
by their owners to avoid paying rates, according to property advisers DTZ
Debenham Thorpe.
The practice of stripping out buildings is a response to the poor letting
prospects in the City. Rates on empty properties are levied at half the
charge of occupied property but no rates are payable on unusable property.
In the City of London, where 17 per cent of offices are empty, the rates
bill for empty property is expected to be Pounds 60m this financial year.
Across the UK, about Pounds 600m is paid in rates on empty buildings.
The property industry has been lobbying the government to reduce the burden
of empty rates, which it claims encourages forced sales of property and
reduces tenants' willingness to move premises.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Demand for life policies shifts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES OF single-premium life assurance and pension products grew sharply in
the fourth quarter of last year while annual-premium business shrank, the
latest figures from the Association of British Insurers show, Norma Cohen
writes.
Over the year single-premium business - in which policyholders make a
one-off lump-sum investment - rose 29 per cent to Pounds 13.4bn while
annual-premium business fell 4 per cent to Pounds 2.97bn. In the fourth
quarter single premiums rose 16 per cent while annual premiums fell 13 per
cent.
Mr Mike Jones, chief executive of the association, said single-premium
business had received a strong boost from policyholders investing redundancy
money as well as from building society depositors switching to life policies
as interest rates fell.
He added: 'I don't think we will see growth in annual commitments for some
time. It's not just the slowdown in the housing market but the fact that we
need a pick-up in consumer confidence,' he said.
Annual premiums have suffered because of fears about employment prospects.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Auditing guidance on Cadbury planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUDITING Practices Board is to produce guidelines for auditors on
scrutinising big companies' statements about their compliance with the code
of corporate governance recommended by the Cadbury committee. Such
statements will be included in quoted companies' annual reports after June
30 this year.
The guidelines are designed to support the recommendations in the Cadbury
committee last December for auditors to comment on a company's compliance
with the code.
The board also plans to improve the consultation it carries out on auditing
issues, according to its first annual review published yesterday.
Mr Bill Morrison, chairman, said the board would establish new standards,
but also called for other organisations to make changes to help widen the
scope of auditing.
His comments come after the board launched an ambitious examination of the
future development of auditing.
The board's work programme commits it to producing by the end of the third
quarter a final draft of a technical standard on auditors giving a second
opinion on another professional's work.
It will also develop guidelines on reporting to regulators.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Lloyd's weighs pollution options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London is expected to rule out the possibility of ordering all
the insurance market's syndicates to leave open their accounts for 1990, its
most recent underwriting year, when its newly established market board meets
today.
Instead the board is expected to examine a series of less radical measures
aimed at improving the management of Lloyd's exposure to pollution and
asbestosis. The board consists of a group of senior market professionals and
leading outside businessmen who are developing a 'business plan' for the
market.
Claims from asbestosis and pollution have been one of the market's thorniest
problems in recent years. Reserves against claims on US policies, many
underwritten more than 30 years ago, amount to more than Pounds 2bn.
Ordering the 401 syndicates that did business in 1990 to leave their
accounts open would in effect trap insurance liabilities from all previous
years and make the insurance market more attractive for the new Names and
corporate investors it is seeking to attract.
The idea has found favour among a number of agents worried by the decline in
the market's capital base. However, it would be unpopular among existing
Names - the individuals whose assets support the market. They are unable to
leave Lloyd's if they are members of 'open-year' syndicates.
'It is not an idea that will find favour among Names; it's profoundly
unattractive,' said Mr Christopher Stockwell, the chairman of the Lloyd's
Names Associations Working Party, which groups together several thousand
loss-making Names.
Mr Stockwell served on a seven-man panel, set up by Mr Peter Middleton,
Lloyd's chief executive, to look into the problem of open years.
An executive summary of the panel's report will be studied by the market
board today. The panel is expected to complete its final report within the
next few weeks.
Mr Stockwell suggested the that the emphasis would be on a wider role for
two vehicles owned by the Corporation of Lloyd's. These are Centrewrite, a
reinsurer, and Syndicate Underwriting Management, which manages run-off
syndicates - those that no longer underwrite new business.
'We have to centralise the problems of 'old years' as much as possible,'
said Mr Stockwell. 'There are no magic wands.'

FT  23 FEB 93 / Jubilee talks at critical phase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Jubilee Line Underground extension to London's Docklands will be built
only if a banking consortium which has made loans to the troubled Canary
Wharf development can persuade the European Investment Bank to make a
contribution to the UK government of up to Pounds 98m.
The 11 banks, led by Lloyds and including Barclays, have been negotiating
for almost a year on how to meet the government's demand they contribute
Pounds 400m to the Jubilee's costs, including an immediate payment of Pounds
98m.
Negotiations have reached a critical phase, bankers said yesterday. Bank
executives have agreed to a framework for making the Jubilee payment, but
this must be agreed by each bank's board.
'We should know at the end of next week whether approval has been given,'
one banker said. 'It could go either way.'
Even if the banks give formal agreement, there will need to be another set
of negotiations with the European Investment Bank. The banks want the EIB -
controlled by the European Community - to make the Pounds 98m initial
payment.
Bankers close to the negotiations said that the EIB had made no commitment
to provide the funds. It would set tough conditions before lending the
Pounds 98m to a company in control of Canary Wharf, which would then give
the money to the government. The EIB's main condition would be that the 11
banks transfer considerable collateral to it.
The boards of the 11 banks are also being asked for sufficient finance to
allow the first stage of the Canary Wharf property development to be
completed, and for it to come out of administration under UK insolvency
procedures.
The banks have set a deadline of the end of March for final agreement to be
reached on the funding of the Jubilee Line and the completion of Canary
Wharf. Related agreements must also be reached by then with London Regional
Transport for it to build the line and rent office space at Canary Wharf. A
banker warned: 'If agreement with any party is not reached, the whole deal
collapses.'
The EIB already has a Pounds 100m loan to Canary Wharf, but its security is
inferior to the Pounds 600m provided by the 11 commercial banks. As a
result, the EIB faces bigger losses than the other banks.

range. Nissan denies such an agreement ever existed. The case is expected to
last almost two weeks.
Mr Botnar lives in Switzerland and has refused to return to Britain since
police issued a warrant for his arrest concerning the tax affairs of Nissan
UK. The trial of Mr Michael Hunt, a Nissan UK director charged with

and home furnishings. But fewer expect to buy most types of white goods and
personal pensions.
A survey by Mintel International, the market research group, also finds that
more consumers are fulfilling spending plans, and that many have bought more
products and services since August than they planned to at the start of the
period. In the same period a year earlier, many spending intentions were not
matched by actual purchases.
Mintel says these changes, coupled with slower growth in savings, suggest a
recovery in consumer confidence may be under way which could lead to
increased spending this year.
It also cautions that the number of people who say they plan to make
purchases has fallen since 1991, and that some recent spending increases may
reflect consumers' inability to delay essential expenditures, such as
repairs, any longer.
The survey holds out little hope of increased activity in the housing
market, finding that fewer people than six months ago plan to move home in
the next three years, while the number with no plans to move has risen
slightly to more than 60 per cent.
Mintel forecasts that the fastest-growing areas of spending in the next five
years will be educational fees, convenience food, house insurance, soft
drinks, domestic and gardening help, and fruit and vegetables. It expects
these areas to grow by between 25 per cent and 49 per cent by 1997.
The main areas where spending is expected to fall are cigars, cigarettes and
tobacco, cleaning and laundry, coal and coke, shoe, clothes and furniture
repair, and meat and fish.
Overall, the survey expects consumer attitudes to be 'cautious and wary' in
the next few years.

FT  23 FEB 93 / London Motor Conference: Threat to parts makers identified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTOR component makers were warned yesterday that Germany could soon start
to close a unique 'window of opportunity' for them to lead Europe in quality
and productivity. The opportunity had been created by the presence in
Britain of three Japanese car plants.
The Nissan, Toyota and Honda plants had already created a quality and
productivity 'revolution' in the UK industry, Professor Daniel Jones of
Cardiff Business School told the Financial Times London Motor Conference.
The three plants are expected to be producing a combined total of at least
600,000 cars a year by the late 1990s.
But German vehicle and parts makers, facing a collapsing domestic market and
soaring costs, had begun rapidly to adopt Japanese methods of 'lean'
manufacturing and to attain 'world-class' quality and productivity
standards.
He said: 'The Germans have lapped up the message with alacrity, but the
effects have yet to be become visible. The UK has a head start which has got
to be used.'
Prof Jones is a member of a team that recently studied Japanese and UK
component suppliers. It concluded that the best Japanese component plants
had twice the productivity and 100-times-better quality than other mainly UK
suppliers that it examined.
German component companies 'are already slashing domestic prices
dramatically in order to protect their market', Prof Garel Rhys, who holds
the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders chair of motor industry
economics, told the conference. The Germans were seeking to respond to what
Prof Rhys calculated was a price advantage for a revitalised UK component
industry of up to 30 per cent helped by sterling's devaluation last year.
Prof Rhys warned that European car prices were set to be driven down in real
terms by Japanese carmakers on their way to a possible 30 per cent share of
the European market .
An average employee needed to work 15 weeks to buy an average saloon in
Japan, 21 weeks in the US, but 27 weeks in Europe. As a result 'the next
decade will see a degree of competition in Europe the like of which has not
been seen since the late 1920s and early 1930s'.
This would lead to further restructuring of the European industry in which
UK-based carmakers would have a significant role as a result of Japanese
plants in Britain and increased efficiency.
UK car output by the year 2000 could be as high as 2.8m, he predicted,
compared with 1.3m last year.

FT  23 FEB 93 / London Motor Conference: Ford to chase after-sales business
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD is encouraging its dealers to set up mobile units to service customers'
cars at homes or offices as part of a strategy to regain more than Pounds
600m of after-sales and service business. The company calculates that this
amount of business on Ford vehicles goes to rivals outside its dealer
network.
In some after-sales sectors, such as replacement tyres and exhausts, Ford
outlets have 3 per cent or less of the business available, Mr Philip Cazaly,
director of parts and service operations, told the conference. Ford, the UK
car market leader, is setting up a national network of 'fast-fit' outlets to
challenge independents such as Mr Tom Farmer's Kwik-Fit organisation. Mr
Cazaly said its dealers would have 200 such outlets, trading under the name
of Rapid Fit, in the UK by the end of this year.

FT  23 FEB 93 / NHS chief in Scotland will head Oftel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE eight-month search for a new director-general for Oftel, the
telecommunications industry watchdog, ended yesterday with the appointment
of Mr Don Cruickshank, chief executive of the National Health Service in
Scotland.
The long-delayed appointment reflects the determination of Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to find a candidate with broad
business experience rather than a civil servant or academic. The post was
originally advertised at a salary of about Pounds 90,000 a year.
Confirming Mr Cruickshank's appointment from April 1, Mr Heseltine said
yesterday that the telecoms industry had changed significantly since
privatisation of British Telecommunications in 1984. The 1991 duopoly review
had triggered further liberalisation, and an increasing number of operators
had entered the market. He therefore wished to appoint someone 'who had
direct experience of competition as a businessman'.
Mr Cruickshank, a 50-year-old chartered accountant, became chief executive
of the NHS in Scotland in 1989. Before that, he was managing director of Mr
Richard Branson's Virgin group for five years. His career also includes a
period as commercial director of Times Newspapers, general manager of The
Sunday Times and a director of the information and entertainment division of
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times.
At the end of last year, there were suggestions that Mr Heseltine had
rejected all the names drawn up on a shortlist put to him and had ordered a
fresh search.
Mr Cruickshank will take over from Mr Bill Wigglesworth, who was made acting
director-general of Oftel following the departure last year of Sir Brian
Carsberg to head the Office of Fair Trading. Mr Wigglesworth will resume his
position as Oftel's deputy director-general.
Mr Cruickshank will arrive at Oftel after a period in which some important
decisions affecting the telecommunications industry have been taken,
particularly the duopoly review and the BT pricing formula which is set
until 1997.
Oftel is, however, charged with regulating the licences granted to the new
generation of competitors beginning to enter the telecommunications market.
Earlier this month, Ionica, a privately owned company and the first direct
competitor to BT and Mercury, was granted a licence which it hopes will give
it 5 per cent of the household and small-business market within 10 years. Up
to 30 more licence applications are being considered by the Department of
Trade and Industry.
Oftel is also awaiting a report on the future operation of the 999 emergency
services and is discussing with BT proposals for changes to its internal
accounting procedures.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Panel tackles UN funds crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN international panel of 'wise men' has recommended reforms aimed at
resolving the United Nations' almost permanent financial crisis, which is
due largely to member states' failure to pay their contributions on time.
The panel, under Sir Brian Urquhart, former UN under-secretary general, says
the UN must be assured of the timely availability of funds to meet the
growing obligations placed on it by member states.
The panel suggests that in future if any of the 180-member states fail to
pay dues on time they should face financial penalties. This year, only 1 per
cent of the membership met the January 31 deadline.
To make it easier for poorer nations, a quarterly instalment system should
replace the current lump sum arrangement, the report suggests. However, it
opposed a proposal made by former Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar
that the UN be allowed to make outside borrowings.
The report also calls for the establishment of a Dollars 400m (Pounds
281.6m) revolving fund for peacekeeping, financed by three annual
assessments on member states, to assure reliable financing in the start-up
phase of peacekeeping. Because the initial phase is usually the most costly
and dangerous, financing delays can be crippling, it warns.
To streamline the existing process, the report also suggests that the UN
consider creating a unified peacekeeping budget, financed by a single annual
assessment, in addition to the revolving fund.
The report, being released in New York today by the Ford Foundation, notes
that while the UN had only some 15,000 peacekeepers deployed two years ago,
there are nearly 55,000 today.
A doubling of the UN's Dollars 100m Working Capital Fund is recommended.
Last increased in 1982, the fund was depleted to offset arrears in member
states' dues. The minimal size of the reserve is too small to protect
against fluctuations in receipts and expenditures, the panel says.
Mr Paul Volcker, former chairman of the US Federal Reserve, and Mr Shijuro
Ogata, retired deputy governor of the Japan Development Bank, served as
co-chairmen of the panel.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Major treads softly in special new relationship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major, the British prime minister, will tomorrow warn President Bill
Clinton that any attempt by the US administration to re-open last year's
US-EC farm trade accord would wreck hopes of a successful conclusion to the
Gatt trade talks.
As Mr Major prepared for his first meeting with President Clinton, senior
British officials said that he regarded a commitment not to unpick the
so-called Blair House accords on agricultural subsidies as an absolute
pre-condition for an eventual agreement to wind up the Uruguay Round.
Mr Major hopes in tomorrow's White House talks to present himself as an
honest broker in resolving the latest range of trade disputes between
Brussels and Washington.
In that capacity he will warn that several EC states - most notably France -
would seize on any fresh US doubts about Blair House to unravel the farm
trade deal and wipe out prospects of a global trade agreement. The prime
minister will make much of the damaging impact that would have on
international economic growth prospects, particularly in the developing
world.
The stalled Gatt talks - and the separate US-EC disputes over European steel
exports and public procurement policies - will take up much of the scheduled
six hours of talks between the two leaders. Britain has welcomed President
Clinton's decision to seek an extension from Congress of fast-track
authority for the trade talks. Mr Major will emphasise that he believes a
deal is still possible this year.
Foreign policy issues may prove less contentious at this week's meeting than
previously feared. Mr Clinton's position on Bosnia has shifted since he took
office in the direction favoured by the UK, although he is understood to
remain anxious to do more to reverse ethnic cleansing.
One such action might be the plan Mr Clinton floated over the weekend to
parachute food and medical supplies into areas of Bosnia that have been cut
off from relief by road.
But Mr Clinton is not expected to press ahead with this proposal, which is
not viewed favourably by United Nations forces in the region, until he has
met with Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, today.
Despite the narrowing of Anglo-American differences over Bosnia and a
striking unity of purpose in the two countries' approach to Iraq, Mr Major's
officials continued to display considerable nervousness ahead of their first
meeting.
Amid fears that Mr Clinton might undermine Britain's claim to its
much-prized special relationship, the officials took the unusual step of
distancing Mr Major from help offered by the Conservative party to former
President Bush's election campaign.
The officials said that the despatch last year by Conservative Central
Office of advisers to help the Bush campaign was approved by Sir Norman
Fowler, the party chairman, without the knowledge of Mr Major.
In a Washington still preoccupied with the economic plan that Mr Clinton
presented to Congress last week, Mr Major's imminent arrival has yet to
cause more than the faintest of blips on the political radar.
While a congressional group led by Congressman Thomas Manton of New York is
seeking signatures for a letter urging Mr Clinton to make Northern Ireland a
top priority in US-UK relations, the president's campaign pledge to appoint
a special envoy has so far elicited only a distant echo.
The suggestion that Mr Thomas Foley, the Speaker of the House, might be that
envoy has been discounted by Mr Foley's office, which notes that the Speaker
will have quite enough work getting Mr Clinton's economic programme through
Congress.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CUBANS will vote tomorrow for national and provincial legislators for the
first time since President Fidel Castro took power in 1959. The vote,
described by the government as a step towards electoral reform, is unlikely
to mollify Mr Castro's critics, who have been advocating multi-party
elections.
There will be only one candidate, officially approved by the Cuban Communist
party, for each of the 589 seats in the National Assembly and 1,190
delegates to the provincial assemblies.
The Cuban leader, however, has been using the event to deflect attention
from the country's parlous economic condition. In several campaign speeches
over the past fortnight he has described the election as an opportunity for
Cubans to send a message of defiance to the US - to 'send a firm message to
the enemies of the revolution, to the imperialists, that this is a united
and strong people'.
Although no candidates from dissident groups will be allowed to stand, the
government is reported to be concerned at the possibility of a protest vote
through a high number of blank ballots.
Candidates receiving less than 50 per cent of the votes cast will be
eliminated and new elections held for the post.
Government officials say the vote is part of a programme of electoral reform
which started in December with local government elections. All candidates
then were also approved by the Communist party.
President Castro has predicted that tomorrow's election will underline 'the
triumph of the revolution'. He has said that Cuba's electoral system
combines 'all the virtues of democracy without all the vices and
corruption'.
Cuba's economy has been under pressure since the break-up of the Soviet
Union, once the island's main benefactor. A shortage of fuel has affected
public transport and power generation, while the country has not been able
to import sufficient food, medicines or agricultural chemicals.
In recent months Cuban officials have repeatedly blamed the 32-year-old US
economic embargo for the island's problems.

FT  23 FEB 93 / US links human rights to help for Peru
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and SALLY BOWEN

   NEW YORK, LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLINTON administration is delaying approval of a multinational financial
support package for Peru because of its dissatisfaction with the human
rights record of President Alberto Fujimori's government.
It is an early indication that the new US government intends to link its
foreign aid policy explicitly with human rights and democracy in recipient
countries. Officials at Washington's international financial institutions
confirmed that recent comments by US officials indicated that policy would
link development aid with democratic government and human rights conditions.
A State Department official said yesterday that US agreement on financial
support has been delayed until the Fujimori government 'complies with
certain conditions relating to human rights'.
Some of the conditions had already been met, although the spokesman declined
to be specific about what the conditions were.
However, US officials sought to underline that the linkage is likely to be
made less explicitly than it was under the previous Democratic
administration of President Jimmy Carter.
Mr Jorge Camet, Peru's finance minister, was due to discuss the delay in
Washington yesterday with Mr Bernard Aronson, assistant secretary for Latin
American affairs in the State Department, and Mr Richard Feinberg, his
counterpart on the National Security Council.
The financial support package from friendly governments led by the US and
Japan was meant to help clear Peru's arrears with the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank - thereby allowing them to resume lending  - and to
provide some finance to cover the country's balance of payments shortfall.
Since Mr Fujimori's suspension of the constitution last April, concern has
been growing about his autocratic style of government. He had been forced by
the Bush administration and the Organisation of American States to hold
congressional and local elections last year to guarantee a resumption of aid
flows.
The human rights conditions are likely to include those relating to
reasonable conditions for, and outside access to, prisoners. Last week a
furore blew up in Peru about the leak of a tape recording of a supposedly
confidential meeting between the International Red Cross and Mr Abimael
Guzman, jailed leader of the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla group. Mr
Fujimori also guided ambassadors, including the US ambassador, on a tour of
three prisons last week.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Health reform may trigger further tax rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CLINTON administration officials are bracing themselves to ask for a second
round of tax increases to pay for short-term costs of the healthcare reforms
they expect to propose in May.
While healthcare reform is seen as essential to any long-term effort to
bring government spending under control, it is expected to cost a
considerable amount in the short term, before these savings start to accrue,
because of President Bill Clinton's pledge that the reforms will include
universal access to healthcare.
About 34m people are excluded from the healthcare net. Most of these are
employed but do not receive health insurance from employers, and are not
poor enough to qualify for the government-funded Medicaid system.
The General Accounting Office estimates the cost of extending coverage to
these people at Dollars 12bn-Dollars 27bn (Pounds 7.8bn-Pounds 17.5bn) a
year, but the Washington Post reports that a study prepared for Mr Clinton
before he took office puts the cost at Dollars 175bn over the four years,
before savings start to come in.
But without reform, Mr Clinton warned when presenting his economic plan last
week, healthcare, mostly on the Medicaid and Medicare programmes, will
absorb 25 per cent of federal government spending by 1998.
In addition, universal coverage is not merely a social goal but an element
of a cost containment strategy; one of the problems in the US system is
shifting treatment costs of those who cannot pay on to those who can.
Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, said last week that he expected some
'sin taxes' on items such as alcohol, tobacco and firearms to be increased
to pay for the healthcare reform. An alternative would be to reduce the tax
deductibility of employer-paid health insurance premiums.
Other cabinet members have been less explicit, saying that tax increases are
an option.

FT  23 FEB 93 / CBI fears US tax increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS of large tax increases on British companies operating in the US are to
be voiced by a senior delegation from the Confederation of British Industry
in meetings with US government officials this week, writes Tim Burt.
Sir Michael Angus, CBI president, and Mr Howard Davies, director general,
are flying to Washington today to seek clarification from the Clinton
administration about how corporate tax changes unveiled in last week's State
of the Union address could affect UK companies. With investments totalling
Dollars 106bn (Pounds 74.6bn), UK companies are the largest overseas
investors in the US.
Initial fears that President Bill Clinton was aiming to raise Dollars 45bn
in additional taxes over four years eased when the figure was revised down
to Dollars 3.8bn over six years.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Hong Kong inflation tops 10 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The annual rate of consumer price inflation edged above 10 per cent in Hong
Kong last month, the first time in almost a year, Simon Holberton writes.
But the Hong Kong government sought to play down January's rise, at an
annual rate of 10.1 per cent, in the CPI(A), the broadest measure of the
colony's price movements. It attributed the rise to seasonal factors,
notably the timing of this year's Lunar New Year holiday, at the end of the
month.
Hong Kong has suffered a chronic inflation problem for the past few years
which is mainly attributable, economists and government officials say, to
the structural changes taking place in the colony's economy.
In yesterday's inflation data, the Census and Statistics Department said
prices for housing were rising at an annual rate of 15.5 per cent in January
and services prices were up 12.4 per cent. Alcoholic drinks and tobacco
prices rose 14.2 per cent in January compared with a year ago. Rising prices
for services are underpinning wage demands. Per capita earnings rose last
year by over 15 per cent.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Yen soars to new highs on Bentsen comments: Tokyo stance on
currency linked to concern about rising trade surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO and KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN surged to a new high against the dollar of Y116.85 in Tokyo
yesterday as the Japanese financial authorities showed little sign of
planning a concerted intervention to check its rise.
The sharp rise was mainly due to comments on Friday by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US
treasury secretary, that he favoured a stronger yen, apparently to help
choke off the mounting Japanese trade surplus.
In New York, the dollar continued to react to Mr Bentsen's comments by
dropping below Friday's record low levels of Y118.20. Rumours that the
Japanese would intervene, despite their apparent lack of concern, reined in
the yen's rise and in late trading it was quoted at about Y116.30.
Early today Finance Minister Yoshiro Hayashi said Japan would act
appropriately to help stabilise the yen in the foreign exchange market, as
currency instability was bad for the global economy. The yen's rise would be
discussed at the Group of Seven finance ministers' and central bank
governors' meeting in London.
Economic Planning Agency Minister Hajime Funada also said he expected
Japan's monetary authorities to take 'appropriate steps'.
'I am concerned about the latest high yen trend which has been rather too
rapid,' Mr Funada said. 'I want to stress that it is desirable (for the yen)
to move gradually.'
Compared with the New York close the yen eased in morning trading in Tokyo
to about Y116.57.
The yen has risen by 6 per cent against the dollar in two weeks. While Tokyo
foreign exchange traders have scrambled to buy it, Japan's authorities have
engaged in a concerted display of calm over its ascent.
Foreign exchange traders were surprised at the government's low-profile
approach yesterday. In previous periods when the yen has appreciated
rapidly, most recently last autumn during the turmoil in European currency
markets, government officials maintained a daily commentary on the state of
the foreign exchange markets.
Yesterday, officials were still adopting a relaxed approach. Mr Hayashi said
there had been no specific steps against the yen's appreciation but he would
watch the exchange market closely.
Mr Yuji Tanahashi, vice international trade and industry minister, expressed
concern over the rapid rise, but said a dollar-yen rate of Y117 would be
acceptable.
Tokyo's willingness to see the yen appreciate is probably closely related to
its concern that its mounting trade surplus, which rose 34.9 per cent to
Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.73bn) last month, might sour relations with the
Clinton administration.
Japan's leaders welcomed Mr Clinton's plans outlined last week to reduce the
US federal deficit. Japan has insisted that this has been one of the main
causes of the trade surplus.
By allowing the yen to rise, Japanese leaders are showing their willingness
to reciprocate with a macro-economic approach to reducing the trade surplus.
Japan wants to avoid a more segmented industry-by-industry approach.
Yet the surge may be short-lived, even though Tokyo economists belief the
yen could rise to Y115. The currency's rise has been prompted partly by
Japanese companies repatriating funds to improve their profits before they
close their books at the end of March. After that the demand for the yen
might tail off.
In the longer run, much will depend on the performance of the US economy.
While the Japanese economy is expected to remain sluggish until the autumn
at least, a sustained recovery in the US would strengthen the dollar.
Mr Geoffrey Barker, economist at Barings Securities in Tokyo, believes that
the yen could weaken to Y135 in the medium run.
The Bank of Japan yesterday played down the negative effects of the yen's
rise, saying the appreciation of the Japanese currency was not a pressing
economic concern as long as it was not rapid.
However, a stronger yen will hurt export-oriented motor and electronics
industries, already being battered by a plunge in domestic demand. Toyota
Motor says profits would be eroded by Y6bn (Pounds 36m) on a Y1 fall of the
dollar. Japanese life assurance companies, heavy investors in the US dollar
bond market, will also face losses on their portfolios.
The yen's appreciation, however, will help the country's banks, which need
to clear the capital-to-assets ratio set by the Bank for International
Settlements at the end of March, as the value of the banks' overseas assets
will fall relative to their yen capital base.
Other beneficiaries should include industries reliant on imports of raw
materials, such as paper and pulp companies and power utilities.
If the impact on Japanese industry is uncertain, the likely effect on
Japanese economic policy-making at home is easier to predict.
Manufacturing industry is already deeply depressed. Further pressure on
manufacturers' export margins would be extremely unwelcome.

US President Bill Clinton yesterday singled out Japan for criticism over its

to foreign goods, George Graham writes from Washington.
'It is the only nation with which we have a persistent and unchanging
structural deficit,' Mr Clinton said in San Jose, California. 'What we have
to do is to to try to continue to help more companies to figure out how to
do business there and keep pushing them to open their markets. I don't want

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Shankar Dayal Sharma, India's president, yesterday condemned attempts to
exploit inter-religious tensions for political ends and appealed for a
campaign to promote national calm and unity.
'The most important task before us today is to restore confidence and
communal amity shaken by the tragic events of December 6 last year (when the
Ayodhya mosque was destroyed) and what followed thereafter,' the president
said on the opening day of a new parliament.
He spoke amid rising tension over plans by the radical Hindu Bharatiya
Janata party for a rally in New Delhi on Thursday, defying a government ban.
The BJP, whose supporters set off nationwide inter-religious violence by
sacking the Ayodhya mosque, yesterday boycotted parliament over the arrest
of some of the thousands of demonstrators en route to the capital.
The police have reinforced checkpoints at New Delhi's borders and have
orders to stop demonstrators. The BJP has meanwhile told supporters to hold
gatherings in their home towns and urging others to breach the cordons and
attend the rally in New Delhi.
BJP MPs yesterday demonstrated outside parliament against the government
ban, which Mr LK Advani, the party leader, condemned as harking back to the
emergency rule imposed in the 1970s by Mrs Indira Gandhi.
The row over the planned rally has overshadowed the 1993-94 budget, to be
presented by Mr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, on Saturday. It will give
the government a chance to try to put economic reform back at the centre of
its agenda. But the likelihood of immediate success is small, given the
passions aroused by the religious conflict.

FT  23 FEB 93 / HK airport project hits turbulence again: But new chief
executive is confident of government support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ATTEMPT to build a new airport for Hong Kong claimed its second victim
last week when Mr Richard Allen, the Provisional Airport Authority's chief
executive, was replaced by Mr Hank Townsend, a senior executive with Bechtel
International, the US construction company.
The airport was high on the list of reasons which led Mr John Major,
Britain's prime minister, to announce at the end of 1991 that Lord Wilson,
the colony's governor, would be replaced. Mr Chris Patten was appointed last
April.
But the project, which in different ways came to obsess Lord Wilson and Mr
Allen, remains what it has always been: the safeguard of Hong Kong's future
as southern China's premier port. Together with its related infrastructure
projects - land reclamations, a railway, and roads - it is one of the
biggest single projects of its kind in the world.
In spite of the benefits to both China and Hong Kong, the airport has been
one of the casualties of the present row between Britain and China about the
colony's political development.
The apparent thaw in Sino-British relations, which is expected to result in
the resumption of negotiations about Hong Kong's political structure, may
end with China stamping its seal on the overall financing of the project. If
agreement can be reached the general expectation is that the dispute about
financing can be settled very quickly.
But in the absence of an agreement, the project exists in a curious twilight
world where, in spite of the diplomatic impasse, work proceeds on projects
that do not need China's agreement. The Hong Kong government has let
HKDollars 21bn (Pounds 1.92bn) of these contracts, covering bridge
construction, land reclamation and roads. According to officials they are on
time and about Dollars 2bn under budgeted estimates.
Although all are important pieces in an integrated infrastructure
development plan encompassing nine 'core' projects, the two most important
ones - the airport itself and its connecting railway - are faring less well.
The airport proper is like a patient on limited life support. Funding for
the PAA's headquarters will run out at the end of June. If Britain and China
cannot agree terms and the Legislative Council, the local law-making body,
refuses to vote it more money - which it came very close to doing last
November - then the PAA may not be able to pay salaries and may have to lay
off staff.
Mr Townsend, who moved into the chief executive's office at the PAA last
Friday, does not like to talk about such an eventuality. He simply states:
'The government is committed to the project.'
As if to underline the increasingly surreal nature of the PAA's position,
construction of the airport platform on Chek Lap Kok, a small island to the
north of Lantau, proceeds apace.
The HKDollars 9bn contract, which was awarded to an Anglo-Chinese consortium
at the end of last November, is now three months into the 41 months
allocated for the preparation of the site. It is fully protected financially
and will proceed even in the absence of further funds for the PAA.
Mr Townsend says that in spite of a three-month delay in awarding the
contract, the PAA and the contractor have been able to keep to 'critical
turnover days' ensuring that areas of the site will be ready on time for
facilities to be erected. Detailed design work on Sir Norman Foster's vision
of the terminal complex is also proceeding - an effort designed to make the
terminal as 'passenger-friendly' as possible ensuring the smoothest
procession from aircraft, through immigration and baggage collection to
customs.
The uncertain political outlook has, however, led the PAA to hasten slowly
in holding final tenders for large-scale airport services, such as cargo
handling and aircraft maintenance. These franchises need Beijing's agreement
before the contracts can be awarded.
Similarly the airport railway. Some preliminary design work is being done
and staff are being recruited but until China approves financing, the Mass
Transit Railway is treading water.
With Beijing's response uppermost in mind, the government has still to
decide whether to call tenders for the Central and Wanchai reclamation, part
of which will be used for the airport railway's terminus on Hong Kong
island.
Another important project is also stalled. The Hong Kong government is still
in negotiations with Wharf and CITIC Hong Kong, one of Beijing's biggest
companies in the colony, about the construction of the Western Harbour
Crossing, a tunnel linking Hong Kong with a reclaimed site in west Kowloon.
This contract involves awarding an operating franchise to the companies,
which will need China's approval. CITIC is keeping its head low with no
inclination to settle until there is an improvement in Sino-British ties.
Since 1989, when Lord Wilson announced the government plans to build an
airport, China has been the critical factor in ensuring its success. More
than three years on that remains the case.

THE United Nations sent a convoy of trucks carrying 16 tonnes of medicines
and blankets for the thousands of wounded to the shell-shattered Afghan
capital Kabul yesterday despite the lack of a permanent ceasefire, Reuter
reports from Islamabad.
Mr Sotirios Mousouris, UN special envoy, said he had decided not to wait for
a formal ceasefire from the two main warring factions of President
Burhanuddin Rabbani and arch rival Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, chief of the
dissident hardline Hezb-i-Islami party.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and 6,000 wounded in a month of
rocket and artillery bombardments between the two sides.
Both the main warring parties have agreed to a UN request for a 72-hour
ceasefire in Kabul to allow evacuation of badly wounded civilians and a
shipment of medical supplies but have still to set a date and time.
The UN convoy left the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar on the 280 km
journey to the Afghan capital early yesterday.

THE US secretary of state, Mr Warren Christopher, acknowledged Lebanon's
improved political stability yesterday by including Beirut in his week-long
tour of the Middle East. It was the first visit by a US secretary of state
to Beirut for nearly a decade.
Lebanon is part of the Middle East peace process launched in October 1991,
and its refusal in December to accept 415 Palestinians deported by Israel
underlined its new assertiveness. Mr Christopher may have been looking for
Lebanese help in solving the problem of the deportees, and an assurance from
Beirut that it is committed to a quick return to the negotiating table in
the US.
The secretary of state was welcomed by Mr Faris Bouez, the foreign minister,
who accompanied him into the Ministry of Defence for talks with President
Elias Hrawi and Mr Rafik al-Hariri, prime minister.
Mr Christopher had flown from Cyprus to Beirut and was scheduled to complete
his visit to the region with two days of talks in Jerusalem with Israelis
and Palestinians.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, said yesterday that Mr
Christopher could agree a date for the resumption of peace negotiations
during those talks. However, the Palestinians have said they will not attend
while the fate of the deportees is unresolved.

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR HWANG IN-SUNG, a former general, cabinet minister and corporate
executive, was appointed South Korean prime minister by the country's
president-elect yesterday.
The choice of Mr Hwang indicates the sort of balancing act Mr Kim Young-sam,
who will be inaugurated as president this week, is performing in his
political appointments.
While Mr Kim has named political and economic reformers as his presidential
advisers, he is expected to appoint mainly conservative politicians from the
ruling Democratic Liberal Party to fill cabinet positions.
Mr Hwang is a senior DLP official responsible for policy, with emphasis on
the economy. He favours stimulative measures to revive the ailing economy
and has criticised present tight monetary policy. He opposes the opening of
the country's rice market to foreign competition.
Mr Hwang's views on the economy conflict with some of those held by Mr Kim's
reform-minded economic advisers. That could indicate a possible struggle
between the Blue House, the executive mansion, and the cabinet.
The selection of Mr Hwang was somewhat surprising since Mr Kim, the
country's first civilian leader in 32 years, had been expected to appoint
someone without a military background to stress the new government's
democratic character. But Mr Kim has to appease the majority faction of the
DLP affiliated with Mr Roh Tae-woo, the current president and a former
general. Mr Kim comes from a minority group within the party.
Mr Hwang spent most of his military career in financial administration
before serving in the cabinets of Presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh during
the 1980s.
His appointment will promote harmony within the DLP, and is meant to reduce
regional rivalry in the country. Mr Hwang is a native of Cholla region, the
most underdeveloped area in South Korea and the stronghold of the opposition
Democratic Party.
Mr Hwang was a former provincial governor in Cholla and is one of only two
ruling party MPs from that area, which normally gives 90 per cent of its
vote to the Democratic Party.
He became the first president of Asiana Airlines, South Korea's second
biggest air carrier, in 1988 before returning to parliament.

THE Canadian government has given notice it plans to table draft legislation

Trade Agreement (Nafta), writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. The agreement,
which was signed by the US, Mexico and Canada last year, is due to be
implemented on January 1 1994.
Passage of the bill through parliament is likely to take several months, and
should be strenuously resisted by both opposition parties. Government
officials said yesterday, however, that they expected the bill to be passed
in time to meet the implementation date.
US, Canadian and Mexican officials are due to start talks next month on
parallel agreements covering environmental and labour issues.

FT  23 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Clinton firm on Airbus subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday said he would seek 'tough new discipline'
on European subsidies to Airbus, while 'closely monitoring' an agreement
made last year by the Bush administration under which the Airbus governments
agreed to limit their 'aid' to the consortium.
In a speech to Boeing aircraft workers in Seattle, he expressed scepticism
about trade agreements. 'I've seen people promise us they'll do this, that
or the other thing, and then nothing ever happens.' It was the president's
second assault in two days on the hard-won Airbus pact, signed last summer.
In California, he complained that for the last several years, the US 'stood
by while Europe spent Dollars 26bn (Pounds 18.3bn) to develop Airbus to push
Americans out of work'.
Boeing's recent announcement that it would 28,000 workers redundant is only
partly due to defence cuts, he added. 'Boeing makes a lot of other planes,
too,' he said.
The president, in company with Vice-President Al Gore, also used the trip to
the west coast to announce the administration's technology programme and to
underscore his assertion that US trade policy must play an integral part in
economic policy.
Boeing has been making known its 'continued frustration' with Airbus and its
'competitive practices.' That President Clinton received the message was
evident in his statement two weeks ago at a televised 'town meeting'. He set
off alarms in Europe when he said he would not 'roll over and play dead'
over Airbus subsidies. It was not clear at the time if he knew that the
issue had been settled by his predecessor.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, last week said the Airbus
deal would be reviewed as part of a larger administration evaluation of
trade issues.
This exercise may well produce a clear departure from current policies, he
said.
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday said he was prepared to discuss the
issue with President Clinton, Reuter reports from New Delhi. 'What about
subsidies they give their arms industry, among others?' he said at the end
of a four-day visit to India.

FT  23 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Japanese raise car prices in US

SEVERAL Japanese carmakers have unexpectedly raised prices in the US in an
apparent effort to head off protectionist pressure building up against them.
The recent increases by Toyota, Nissan, Honda and Mazda were in addition to
the normal price rises made when models are changed.
An executive at a leading carmaker said: 'These increases were mainly
political. We are better able to head off protectionism if we can point to
recent price increases.' He added that the surge in the yen might force
further action but that the first round was not due to currency movement.
The Big Three US carmakers - Ford, General Motors and Chrysler - recently
shelved plans to file an anti-dumping complaint against their Japanese
competitors.
Nissan increased the US price of its Infiniti luxury car range by 1.2 per
cent in January, and most of the rest of its range by 1.1 per cent. The
price of the Altima car went up by 1.5 per cent this month.
It said the increases were designed to offset the yen's appreciation against
the dollar and to improve the profitability of its US operations.
Honda, which lifted prices by just under 1 per cent in January, admitted the
increases were not normal. Prices normally rise in September when models
change; last September its prices in the US rose by between 2.5 per cent and
2.7 per cent.
It said the recent price move had been caused by sales and manufacturing
cost pressures.
Honda said it would consider further price increases if the yen continued to
rise. However, it expects the yen's climb over the past 10 days to be
temporary.
Toyota increased car prices of its Lexus luxury brand and other models by
1.2 per cent this month, on top of its normal price increases in October. It
blamed the move on rising costs and the yen's strength.
Mazda, which generally raises its prices in August or September, increased
the price of its multi-purpose vehicles sold in the US by a further Dollars
500 in December.

FT  23 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Russian traders beat a path to China's
door - Rapid growth in business seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VALERA, the fast-talking Russian trader, had no doubt he was on to a good
thing as he supervised the packing of colourful children's pullovers for
shipment to Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania.
'This is a hard business, but it's a good business,' he declared. 'Believe
me, I've been everywhere - Turkey, eastern Europe, Pakistan - but China is
the best.'
Valera is typical of thousands of east European traders who are streaming to
China to buy inexpensive garments to sell in the markets of Moscow and
Warsaw, and other former east bloc cities where there is a shortage of
affordable clothing.
Figures for this informal trade - dubbed as the new Silk Road - do not show
up in official Sino-Russian trade statistics but its value is estimated to
run into tens of millions of dollars annually.
The rapid growth of this relatively small scale trade - entrepreneurs buy as
little as a few thousand dollars worth of items - coincides with an
explosion in more formal two-way business between China and the Russian
Federation, much of it concentrated in the border regions.
According to Chinese and Russian customs statistics, border trade grew from
Dollars 88m in 1987, the year that most restrictions were lifted on
cross-boundary commerce, to Dollars 2bn in 1992.
Total Sino-Russian trade last year reached Dollars 6bn with the balance
slightly in favour of the Russian side, due in part to arms transfers worth
about Dollars 1.5bn.
A Russian official in Beijing said that the flow of goods across Russia's
7,400-long border with China's Heilongjiang province in the east, and the
Xinjiang region in the west was fast becoming the most important component
of trade between the two countries.
Border trade doubled last year to Dollars 2bn compared with the year before,
and it shows little sign of slackening. Much of the trade is conducted by
barter and is denominated in Swiss francs. It includes minerals, buildings
materials and machinery from the Russian side, in exchange for Chinese food,
clothes and electronics.
Joint ventures involving Russian and Chinese entrepreneurs are also becoming
a feature of commerce on the frontier. At last count, some 200 Sino-Russian
ventures had been initiated, most of them small enterprises such as hotels
and restaurants.
Another sign of burgeoning trade links, especially in the border areas, lay
in the surge in visitors passing back and forth. In 1992, 700,000 passed
through the 20 frontier posts, gates, including the seven established last
year.
While a number of these visitors were tourists, most had come to do
business. In all, about 1m Russians - including the hundreds of Russian
garment traders flying into Beijing each week on Aeroflot charters - visited
China last year, an increase of approximately 50 per cent on the year
before.
Barriers to even brisker activity on the Sino-Russian frontier include
extremely poor communications - telephone calls are still routed through
Beijing and Moscow - and the paucity of railway lines in one of the world's
most inhospitable regions.
The absence of bridges across the Amur river, which delineates the
Sino-Russian border in the east, also hinders transportation.
Booming Sino-Russian trade is, as might be expected, causing security
problems for the two sides. Chinese border police reported 3,000 arrests
along the frontier in 1992, most for smuggling offences. There are also
indications that the Russian 'mafia' may have begun to collaborate with
organised crime in China.
Formal links between the Russians and Chinese have flourished since the
lifting of a two-decade freeze in the 1960s and 1970s. Apart from 40 or so
representative offices of state organisations perhaps several dozen private
companies have recently opened their doors.
But it is on the streets of the capital that the Russians are most visible,
especially in the street market that runs along the western flank of Ritan
park, near the city's diplomatic quarter.
There, mainly Russian guoji dao ye, a slightly derogatory Chinese reference
to 'international pedlars', spend their days haggling over women's angora
sweaters, padded jackets and other textile items. Business is conducted
strictly in dollars.
Despite the rapid growth in contacts and business dealings, both sides
appear as untrusting and suspicious of each other's activities as their
predecessors were during the heyday centuries ago of the Silk Road between
China and Europe.

<TEXT>
SEAT, Volkswagen's Spanish subsidiary, yesterday officially opened a
Pta244bn (Pounds 1.4bn) manufacturing plant with a capacity of 1,500 units a
day, writes Tom Burns in Madrid.
Mr Clive Griffiths, the plant manager and a former executive of Nissan's
plant in Sunderland, England, believes the factory at Martorell, near
Barcelona, could be the last large car plant to be built in western Europe.
It is the key element in Seat's 10-year, Pta800bn capital-spending plan.
Full production will begin later this year making a bigger version of the
Ibiza model to be unveiled at May's Barcelona motor show.
Seat sales fell 43 per cent last month. Short-time working is in force at
its plants in Barcelona and Pamplona with the aim of reducing stocks from
113,000 units at the end of last year to 82,000.
Citroen Hispania, Spanish subsidiary of the French car group, is investing
Pta30bn in its plant in Vigo, north-west Spain, to produce a new model in
1996.

FT  23 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Brussels defies oilseeds threat
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE agreement settling the EC-US row over oilseeds subsidies will stay on
the EC foreign ministers' agenda for March 8 despite a French threat to veto
it, the European Commission said yesterday.
The French government, facing defeat at parliamentary elections next month,
warned the Commission and Denmark - currently EC president - on Friday that
it would try to veto the deal if it went to a vote.
The five-year oilseeds dispute with the US was resolved in principle last
November on terms much more favourable to the Community than had been
expected, together with long-running subsidised food export rows holding up
the Uruguay Round world trade reform talks.
'We're concerned that the longer (the draft accord) is left open, the more
likely it is that the US will want to renegotiate it,' said an aide to Mr
Rene Steichen, EC agriculture commissioner.
The commissioner sees delivering the oilseeds accord as an indication of EC
support for the separate Uruguay Round package, regarded by EC farm
policy-makers as vital to protect the reformed Common Agricultural Policy
from challenge by competitors.
Mr Steichen is taking a hard line in insisting the issue be kept on the
agenda, but this does not mean it will be pushed to a vote. The aide
conceded that a decision could be postponed until April 5, when foreign
ministers meet again, eight days after the second round of the French
elections.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, French prime minister, appeared to be invoking the
'Luxembourg compromise' allowing member states to claim overwhelming
national interest, when he said his government 'will oppose approval of such
an agreement by all means agreed between member states'.

FT  23 FEB 93 / World Trade News: EC attacks US claims over procurement bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC yesterday hit back at 'misleading' US allegations that the Community
is restricting US companies' access to public procurement contracts.
A spokesman for Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, said that new
single market legislation was opening up public procurement in the
Community. He pointed out that since new procurement rules for utilities
came into force on January 1, 163 contracts had been advertised for tender
in the EC's Official Journal.
A document leaked from the office of the US trade representative, now Mr
Mickey Kantor, over the weekend claimed that bidding opportunities worth
Dollars 16.8bn (Pounds 11.8bn) were offered to EC contractors under the Gatt
government procurement code in 1990, compared with Dollars 7.8bn in EC
contracts open to US operators.
The US tactics have escalated the dispute between the US and the EC over
public procurement ahead of the next meeting of trade negotiators in
Brussels, set for March 11. The US has threatened to ban EC companies from
bidding for federal contracts if allegedly discriminatory EC procurement
legislation is not abandoned before March 22.
EC negotiators said yesterday they were 'baffled' by the appearance of the
US document, which they said had not been part of last week's public
procurement negotiations in Washington. 'I can only suspect that the US has
taken our numbers and added some of its own,' said one EC official
yesterday.
The officials admitted that, in absolute terms, the 1990 Gatt figures - the
relevance of which the Community disputes - showed that the US was ahead.
But they pointed out that between 1985 and 1990 the value of EC contracts
open to competition increased by 104 per cent under the code, whereas the
value of US contracts decreased by 30 per cent.
New legislation would continue that trend, they claimed.
The US is complaining that one of the laws - the directive covering the
supply of equipment for utilities - favours EC manufacturers of telecoms and
electrical equipment. The Community in turn has attacked 'Buy America'
legislation which it says gives US manufacturers even more preferential
treatment.
The EC yesterday said the US claim that only Dollars 15bn of public
procurement was covered by the Buy America laws was dubious as the figure
did not include lucrative transport and energy contracts, which gave a 25
per cent price preference to US companies, and demanded local content of
between 50 and 60 per cent.
EC officials also emphasised that many US contracts called for 20 per cent
of the work to go to US companies.

FRENCH farmers yesterday caused chaos after blocking railway lines across
the country in protest against the EC's agricultural reforms and its recent
farm trade agreement with the US, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
The demonstrations, which coincide with a postal dispute and protests by
fishermen, come at a sensitive time for France's Socialist government, which
is heading for a resounding defeat by the conservative coalition at next
month's parliamentary elections.
The farmers' protest, which followed a call for a national day of action by
Co-ordination Rurale, one of the most powerful farm unions, was the most
dramatic and widespread this year.
Militant farmers began blocking railway lines with barricades of tyres,
agricultural produce and old agricultural equipment. Rush-hour train
schedules were severely disrupted.
The worst affected areas were the rail routes around Tours, Chartres,
Orleans and Toulouse. However, farmers also disrupted some of the main lines
in and out of Paris.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Yeltsin warning for Russian forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BORIS YELTSIN, the Russian president, has warned the armed forces against
being dragged into politics by 'foul and irresponsible' groups.
His comments, in the army newspaper which still bears the Soviet name of
Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star), were made just before a demonstration expected
in Moscow today by hardline communists and nationalists protesting against
economic reform.
Today is Defence of the Fatherland day, formerly Soviet Armed Forces Day -
no longer a holiday, but an occasion for military leaders to lay wreaths and
make speeches.
So far, overt criticism of Mr Yeltsin from within the military has been
limited to apparently small groups of hardline officers - one of which, the
officers' union, is expected to take part in today's demonstrations.
However, the military remains disoriented, without a new doctrine and under
pressure to leave former Soviet bases from the Baltics to Central Asia,
without adequate quarters or provision in Russia on which to fall back.
Mr Yeltsin's warning comes as the political scene is again illuminated by
the struggle between himself and Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary
speaker, over the powers wielded by each. The two men and their aides have
exchanged a flow of insults over the past few days while ostensibly engaged
in negotiation aimed at reaching a definition of the division of their
constitutional powers preparatory to working out a new constitution.
Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, promised an 'adequate' response
to the bombing over the weekend of the Georgian-held town of Sukhumi by a
Russian aircraft. The Russians say the bombing was carried out in retaliat
ion for Georgian shelling of a Russian military laboratory.
Georgian forces have held Sukhumi, the capital of the breakaway province of
Abkhazia, for the past few months against attacks by Abkhazian separatists
whom they accuse of being aided by Russia.
Mr Shevardnadze, in a recent interview, said Mr Yeltsin was not personally
responsible for the Russian aid to Abkhazia but blamed reactionary circles
in the military and elsewhere for the supply of men and weapons to the
anti-Georgian forces.

</HEADLINE>

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US has decided to parachute relief supplies to blockaded Moslems in
eastern Bosnia, but President Bill Clinton is consulting with the United
Nations and western leaders before making the announcement, administration
officials said last night.
The officials said the airdrops under protection of US navy aircraft could
begin as early as this week, but no final timetable had been set.
Britain said yesterday it would not take part in an airdrop but was not
opposed to the US doing so.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary general, said last night
that an airdrop must have UN authorisation.
Foreign Office officials in London said the US administration had not been
in touch with Britain on plans to parachute supplies.
'However, we have no problem with an operation of this kind if they want to
go ahead with it,' a spokesman said.
The lack of British enthusiasm for an airdrop is based on the advice of
defence officials that it would be dangerous and was unlikely to be
effective in the mountainous regions of eastern Bosnia.
By contrast, the officials stressed that Britain was taking an active part
in joint planning for a large-scale deployment of ground troops in Bosnia to
enforce a peace settlement, if and when such an agreement is reached.
The UN yesterday resumed its airlift to Sarajevo after city officials agreed
to distribute food throughout the Bosnian capital. The airlift was suspended
on February 12.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Amato shuffles cards to his advantage: The Italian prime
minister's limited cabinet changes may still help his credibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE weekend reshuffle of the Italian cabinet is a classic example of the
time-worn dictum that politics is the art of the possible.
Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, wanted to use the opportunity
presented by the enforced resignation of his health and finance ministers to
carry out a broad reshaping of the government. However, the Socialist prime
minister came up against the firm opposition of the Christian Democrat
leadership, the dominant partners in the four-party coalition, and the
refusal of other parties outside the government to join in.
As a result he was obliged to carry out a lesser game of musical chairs  -
swapping portfolios and bringing in three new faces. Nevertheless, the new
25-person cabinet reflects Mr Amato's desire to press ahead with budgetary
austerity and recover some of the lost momentum in the plans for
privatisation. Meanwhile, the all-important issue of electoral reform and
institutional change remains in the hands of the parliamentary parties.
Mr Amato had sought a cabinet shake-up as early as February 10, when Mr
Claudio Martelli was forced to resign as the Socialist justice minister
because of his alleged involvement in the corruption scandal. Although Mr
Mino Martinazzoli, the Christian Democrat leader, gave the prime minister
his full backing, he insisted on a mere replacement to Mr Martelli. Mr Amato
then showed his independence by choosing a 'technocrat' judge, Mr Giovanni
Conso, instead of turning to the ranks of the Socialist party, who wished to
see their balance of ministers retained.
Following Friday's resignations of the finance and health ministers, Mr
Amato again floated the idea of a broad reshuffle to give new legitimacy to
a cabinet tainted by corruption scandals. This was opposed by elements in
his own Socialist party and by the Christian Democrats, afraid a big
reshuffle would leave him with too much autonomy, allowing him to emerge as
the country's uncontested leader. Mr Amato was seen as a servant of the
party bosses when brought in last June.
But even without such autonomy, the government leader has managed to
strengthen his economic team by switching Mr Franco Reviglio from the Budget
to the Finance Ministry and bringing in Mr Beniamino Andreatta, the most
distinguished economist in the Christian Democrat camp, to the Budget
portfolio.
He has also finessed the refusal of Mr Giuseppe Guarino to leave the
Industry Ministry where he was blocking privatisation, by appointing Mr
Paolo Baratta, a technocrat banker, to a new portfolio specifically dealing
with privatisation. Mr Amato has also done well to place the no-nonsense
Liberal, Mr Raffaele Costa, in the Health Ministry, where his skills will be
needed to sell reforms of the health and pensions systems.
At a broader level the reshuffle has demonstrated that, no matter how much
the Amato government has been weakened by the recent resignations and the
accumulated effects of the corruption scandals sweeping the country, the
political parties can see no immediate alternative. Indeed, this was the
first reshuffle in the post-war era carried out with an eye on the financial
markets. The discussions lasted little more than 24 hours and were complete
by Sunday in order to present the markets with the outcome when they
reopened.
This explicit recognition that government crises have to be resolved within
hours, not the leisurely weeks of previous years, is an important change.
The threat of a plunging lira and its consequent impact on inflation forced
a solution.
The other lesson from the reshuffle centres on the gradual shift of power
away from the party bosses. They have traditionally treated cabinets as
their servants. Mr Amato remains beholden to the Christian Democrats,
Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals who comprise his coalition. But
they also rely upon his credibility, his political skills and the backing he
is being given by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.
The new cabinet now contains 10 people who are either technicians or only
loosely affiliated to parties. No other Italian postwar cabinet has had such
a non-political complexion. At a moment when the ruling parties have lost so
much legitimacy as a result of the corruption scandals, Mr Amato is hoping
this will help his credibility in the difficult days ahead.

FT  23 FEB 93 / UN war crimes court for Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations security council decided yesterday to establish an
international court to try those accused of war crimes since 1991 in former
Yugoslavia.
It would be the first such court since the Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals
judged Nazi and Japanese war criminals at the end of the second world war.
In its resolution, the security council called for a report by Mr Boutros
Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, 'on all aspects of this matter,
including specific proposals and where appropriate options for the effective
and expeditious implementation of the decision'.
There was no mention of how to round up suspects. Nor is it anticipated the
prosecutors will seek the death sentence for those charged, as they did at
Nuremberg and Tokyo.
No war crimes suspects have been officially indicted, although the US has
prepared a list of alleged Balkan war criminals. It names Mr Radovan
Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, who was given a restricted visa
limiting his movements to the UN headquarters neighbourhood while in New
York recently for talks with Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, co-chairmen of
the international conference on former Yugoslavia. They were among the first
to recommend the creation of a special war crimes court.
Last October, the council established a commission to analyse Balkans war
crimes data.
A French committee of jurists recommended in a report to the council earlier
this month that a tribunal comprise 15 judges, along with a separate panel
to name suspects and prosecute them.
In its resolution, the council expressed 'grave alarm' at widespread mass
killings and 'ethnic cleansing' in the former Yugoslavia. Among the data
cited was a recent EC report of mass rapes and other atrocities against
Moslem women in Bosnia Hercegovina.
Declaring the violations of humanitarian law to be a threat to international
peace and security, the council 'determined to put an end to such crimes and
to take effective measures to bring to justice the persons who are
responsible for them'.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Danes cut discount rate

DANSKE BANK, Denmark's central bank, yesterday lowered the official discount
rate by a full point from 11.5 to 10.5 per cent.
The discount rate was raised by two points to 11.5 per cent on February 3 in
order to stop speculation against the krone, which is part of the European
Exchange Rate mechanism.
The central bank said that since the beginning of the month there had been a
substantial return of capital to the country. Mrs Marianne Jelved, the
economy minister, said the bank's decision 'is clear documentation of the
strength of the Danish economy', which has an inflation rate of only 1.4 per
cent and a large surplus on the current balance of payments. In Madrid,
however, pressure on the Spanish peseta raised fears that the Spanish
authorities might today reverse their modest quarter-point interest rate cut
of 10 days ago.
The central banks of Spain and Portugal intervened yesterday and late last
week as the peseta and escudo came under pressure.
The peseta ended yesterday at 73 to the D-Mark, sharply down from 71.7 on
Friday, dragging the escudo along with it. The Portuguese currency fell to
92.05 to the D-Mark from 91.47 on Friday.
Currency dealers in Madrid said the peseta had performed much worse than
they had expected. Some believed speculation against the currency was such
that the government might have to consider a third devaluation or even
pulling the peseta out of the exchange rate mechanism. However, neither step
appears likely at the moment.
The attack on the peseta, triggered by poor unemployment figures and
uncertainty over the outcome of a general election to be held sometime this
year, has left it roughly at the centre of its fluctuation band.
Madrid has made clear it will do its utmost to remain inside the ERM, and
the government is preparing a fiscal package to help revitalise the economy.
Details of this package are likely to be announced this week.
However the Bank of Spain may feel obliged to use its routine auction of
certificates of deposit today to raise its official intervention rate. This
was cut from 13.25 per cent to 13 per cent at the last auction. In the last
few days, however, the central bank has forced overnight rates up to more
than 16 per cent.

<TEXT>
MR PAOLO BARATTA, as minister in charge of privatisation, joins Mr Piero
Barucci, the Treasury minister, as the second professional banker recruited
into the eight-month-old Amato government. While Mr Barucci is considered
sympathetic to the Christian Democrats, Mr Baratta's sympathies have
traditionally leaned towards the Socialist party.
An engineer trained at Milan polytechnic, the 53-year-old Mr Baratta went on
to do a masters at the London School of Economics. He became a banker in
1977, joining the public works credit institute before it was absorbed by
the larger state credit group, Crediop. He became head of Crediop in 1980
and ran it until the latter was transformed into a publicly quoted company
last year. He then moved to manage the prestigious bank San Paolo di Torino.
He has extensive experience of the needs of both the public and private
sector, and Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, originally hoped he would
assume the industry portfolio with a specific brief to speed up
privatisation. When Mr Giuseppe Guarino refused to leave industry, he was
given a newly created portfolio to deal with privatisation.
Although he will now have the full support of the prime minister and the
three economics ministers, he faces a tough task outmanoeuvring Mr Guarino,
who has the backing of many of the old guard in the Christian Democrat and
Socialist parties.
After a break of 13 years, Mr Beniamino (Nino) Andreatta has returned to
Italy's budget portfolio, enhanced since last June with responsibility for
the Mezzogiorno (southern Italy).
This young-looking 65-year-old economics professor is one of the most
outspoken and distinguished economists in Italy.
Although he has stayed aloof from political in-fighting, he has become an
influential figure in trying to give a new identity to the Christian
Democrats under the three-month-old leadership of Mr Mino Martinazzoli.
Born in Trento in northern Italy, he first studied law at Padua, before
going to Cambridge to concentrate on economics. An avowed Keynesian, he held
the economics chair at Bologna University. He became a senator in 1976.
Under the government of Mr Francesco Cossiga in 1979, Mr Andreatta first
took on the budget portfolio then the Treasury.
Since 1983 he was first a Christian Democrat MP, then a senator until he
lost his seat in last year's elections.
With a reputation as someone who does not suffer fools gladly, he once
denounced Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, as a national
socialist bent on nationalisation.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH politician Jean Lecanuet, who forced General Charles de Gaulle into
an embarrassing run-off in France's 1965 presidential elections, died
yesterday after a long illness, Reuter reports from Paris. He was 72.
Mr Lecanuet stood against De Gaulle as a centre-right candidate, opposing
the president's moves to take France out of the military structure of Nato,
and bringing US-style advertising campaign methods to French politics for
the first time. He received 15.6 per cent of the vote, forcing De Gaulle
into a run-off with Mr Francois Mitterrand. Mr Lecanuet later allied himself
to Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who rewarded him with the justice portfolio
when he was elected president in 1974.
Mr Lecanuet remained a pro-European voice in the French senate in which he
served for more than 30 years and was regarded as a particularly successful
mayor of his home city of Rouen.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Birth of a hundred markets: Russian stock exchanges draw on
popular trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S first electronic trading-room opens for business next month in the
headquarters of a former communist news agency in Moscow.
As part of the chaotic birth of a securities market, the central bank and
Finance Ministry will inaugurate trading here with an unprecedented issue of
treasury bills.
Meanwhile, the sale of some 6,500 state-owned enterprises this year as part
of large-scale privatisation will generate a secondary share market.
In anticipation of this, the country already has 106 'stock exchanges' or
stock-trading departments attached to existing commodity exchanges. But
while the commodity exchanges trade everything from cars to sugar, the stock
exchanges have had little to trade apart from shares issued by new
commercial banks and insurance companies.
So far, just over Rbs8bn worth of shares have been made available in the
privatisation process, compared to the total Rbs1,500bn which will be needed
to honour all the privatisation vouchers distributed to Russia's 147m
inhabitants. The vouchers can be exchanged for money or Rbs10,000 worth of
shares at auctions, which started in December.
But the rules for what is going to be a high-risk game are being made up
along the way. Long-awaited securities legislation will emerge only at the
end of the year, after the government and central bank submit a draft law to
a parliament notoriously slow in adopting economic legislation.
In the mean time, overworked officials are already having trouble enforcing
makeshift instructions issued last year by the Finance Ministry.
By opting for quantity over quality in offering companies for sale, the
government is exposing small investors to considerable risks which are not
always underlined in the advertising. Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation
minister, argues that people have little to lose, as they received their
voucher free of charge in the first place.
'The state is not promising people a happy life where they don't have to
work any more. . . What we can guarantee to all is free choice and maximum
information in helping them decide how to use their voucher.'
In an attempt to spread the risks for ordinary people already wary of
capitalism, the government has licensed some 300 investment funds, which
will invest in a selection of enterprises for shareholders.
But despite a ban on the use of vouchers for anything other than privatised
enterprises or licensed investment funds, other types of companies are
already competing for vouchers with ads that have gone unprosecuted. The
first tears were shed in St Petersburg last week, when 350,000 people
discovered they had been defrauded of their vouchers by unlicensed
investment companies, which have since disappeared without a trace.
Another obstacle to popular trust are debts contracted but not honoured by
the country's previous Communist rulers. These include a 1990 cheque scheme
promising peasants imported consumer goods in return for agricultural
deliveries to the state.
Vowing to make good old debts, the government has promised to issue
hard-currency bonds, paying 3 per cent a year, to clients of
Vneshekonombank, the state bank, which in 1991 froze billions of dollars
belonging to Russian and foreign companies.
There are few incentives for foreign investors to join the fray immediately.
The first T-bill issue - described by one central bank official as 'the
first step in the marketisation of the state debt' - will be for Russian
banks only, with foreigners to be allowed in later.
Despite Mr Chubais' desire to attract foreign investment, the purchase of
shares in Russian companies remains virtually impossible for foreigners. He
says this is because the central bank is still trying to introduce a special
exchange rate to prevent foreigners from buying up assets on the cheap,
thanks to a weak rouble. Some westerners complain that while there are legal
ways to get round this requirement, the real problem is a lack of
information on what companies are for sale.
Although there has been only a trickle of foreign capital, there has been a
flood of foreign advice, some of it crucial, some a waste of time and money.
Mr Pyotr Lazarev, the bright 26-year-old who is the Finance Ministry's main
expert on securities, says what is needed is 'concrete assistance for
specific projects' such as that offered by US banking experts for the
treasury bill issue. Training is particularly important, both for officials
to supervise markets, and for dealers to operate on them.
'Unfortunately, we still have experts trying to teach us what stocks and
bonds are when we already have a securities market,' he says. 'It may not be
much by western standards but it is a lot given the cosmic speed at which
things are developing in Russia.'

FT  23 FEB 93 / Van Miert to crack down on state aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Karel Van Miert, the EC competition commissioner, has warned that he will
crack down on selfish state aid schemes aimed at protecting national
industries from the recession.
Mr Van Miert told the European Parliament's economic and monetary committee
on Friday that 'common action at the Community level' was the best way to
deal with member states' economic problems.
His comments, published yesterday, seemed to be aimed at member states
preparing for Thursday's meeting of industry ministers, which will discuss
the Commission's plans to support the EC steel industry.
Mr Van Miert warned in his speech that 'beggar my neighbour' aid schemes
would merely 'export unemployment and push problems on to other member
states', which would then retaliate with their own subsidies.
The Commission has made clear that national and Community steel subsidies
will have to be accompanied by drastic cuts in capacity. But Commission
officials are clearly worried that Spain, which is facing a deep political
crisis if it fails to win EC support for subsidies, Germany and Italy may go
ahead with unilateral aid if a co-operative plan fails.
Mr Van Miert also said he would not favour aggressive use of special
Commission powers to open up national monopolies.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Poles sign enterprise pact: Government tries to boost
faltering support for reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Polish government yesterday signed a tripartite 'enterprise pact' with
trade unions and employers in an attempt to bolster faltering shop-floor
support for the country's free market reforms.
The government wants to speed privatisation while giving workers a say in
management of private companies. The pact signed yesterday for the
government by Mr Jacek Kuron, the labour minister, was first mooted last
autumn.
It is also designed to ease tax burdens on state-owned enterprises and
introduces the principle that macro-economic indicators are to be agreed in
a national tripartite council composed of government officials, trade
unionists and employers' representatives.
Mr Kuron said after signing the pact with Mr Marian Krzaklewski, head of the
Solidarity trade union, and Mr Andrzej Machalski, head of an employers'
group, that 'the transformation of the economy without compromises' could
end dangerously but that the signing of the pact meant that there would be
'a major acceleration' of reforms.
Mr Kuron later signed the pact with the OPZZ trade unions representing the
former pro-communist movement. The radical Solidarity 80 union was
conspicuous by its absence.
Under the pact, which will be turned into legislation, workers are to be
given six months to decide on the form of privatisation for their factory.
If they fail to do so the Privatisation Ministry will be free to take the
decision.
Workers are also to be given 10 per cent of the shares in their factories at
privatisation, and financial conditions are to be eased in cases where
employees take over a factory and lease the machinery and buildings from the
state.
Workers are also to be represented on non-executive boards of directors and
both private and state-sector plants employing more than 2,500 are to have
at least one worker in top management to represent their interests. The pact
includes the plan to restructure enterprise and bank debts for some 2,000
companies.
The pact also removes the dividend, an outdated profit tax on the state
sector. It is replaced with an arrangement under which one third of company
profits can be spent on wages as long as one third is spent on investment,
and one third paid in corporate tax.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Top Fiat executives held on corruption charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S business community was shaken yesterday by the arrest of two top
Fiat executives on charges of alleged corruption and illegal financing of
political parties.
Those arrested were Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli, chief financial officer of
the Fiat group and Mr Antonio Mosconi, chief executive of the Turin
automotive group's insurance arm, Toro.
Mr Mattioli, aged 52, is a key figure in the new management structure being
devised by Mr Giovanni Agnelli in the run-up to his projected departure from
the chairmanship of the group next year.
A Fiat statement said the group had learnt of the arrests with 'amazement'.
The company offered them its full support and said the two executives had
always carried out their jobs with the utmost rectitude.
Fiat shares, which have been rising strongly in the past two weeks, fell
nearly 1 per cent on the news. The lira also slipped to a new historic low
against the D-Mark of L964. Earlier the lira had begun to recover from
Friday's slide in a favourable response to the Sunday reshuffle of the Amato
cabinet.
The two Fiat executives were arrested at their Turin homes. Carabinieri
police also searched their offices in Fiat's Turin headquarters.
The arrests relate to alleged illegal payments of L1.8bn (Pounds 821,000)
made during the construction of the Milan metro in which Fiat's construction
arm, Cogefar-Impresit, was involved.
Last May, Mr Enzo Papi, the chief executive of Cogefar-Impresit, was
arrested on a similar charge.
Two other Fiat group executives were subsequently arrested on the same
allegations - Mr Giancarlo Cozza, managing director of Fiat-Savigliano and
Mr Luigi Capriotti, manager of Fiat-Iveco.
In one of his roles in the Fiat group, Mr Mosconi was president of
Cogefar-Impresit.
Mr Mattioli has been with Fiat since 1975 and last November, when the
management was split into two broad divisions - industry and industrial
development, and financial control and resource management - he was given
the newly created position of chief financial officer.
Their arrests followed renewed interrogation of Mr Papi and Mr Mauricio
Prada, former head of the Milan Christian Democrat party charged with
alleged illicit collection of party funds.
At least 10 prominent industrial and financial figures are now caught up in
the ever widening investigation into corruption by Milan magistrates.
Yesterday Mr Mariano del Papa, the managing director of the Anas, the state
road building authority, formally resigned following notice that he was
under investigation for alleged corruption in handling contracts.
Yesterday, the small Republican party, which has promoted itself as the
party of clean government, was recovering from the blow of the arrest on
Sunday of Mr Giorgio Medre, a former member of parliament and until recently
head of their political department.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Farmers block a railway line with burning tyres at St Sulpice, south-western
France, during a national day of protest against the European Community's
farm trade agreement with the US.
Yesterday's demonstrations by farmers brought chaos to rail services,
disrupting main lines in and out of Paris and routes around Tours, Chartres
and Toulouse. Meanwhile, several small ports in Brittany were closed in
sympathy with fishermen who have been protesting against a surge of cheap
fish imports into France which have pushed down local prices by 30 per cent.
The French government has urged Brussels to invoke a Gatt safeguard clause
allowing it to block imports temporarily.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Buy-out plan for threatened Daf truck plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, EINDHOVEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MANAGEMENT team at the Leyland Daf truck plant in Lancashire is preparing
a management-led buy-out of the threatened truck assembly operations.
The three-man team is being led by Mr John Gilchrist, managing director, and
is being advised by Coopers and Lybrand, the accountancy firm.
The proposal for the management buy-out is still at an early stage, and Mr
Gilchrist warned yesterday that its eventual success would depend on the
Leyland plant receiving a contract to supply its range of UK-built Daf 45
light trucks to newly-formed Daf Trucks in the Netherlands.
It is understood that separate preliminary talks are also being held by the
administrative receivers for Leyland Daf with Paccar, the US truck maker,
about a possible takeover or acquisition of a stake in the Leyland plant.
Truck production was re-started yesterday at Leyland for the first time
since Leyland Daf went into receivership three weeks ago. The Leyland
workforce has already been reduced to 1,346 from 2,114 before the company
collapsed.
Final negotiations took place in Paris last night between the UK receivers
and Renault over the future of the Birmingham-based Excel van project for
the development of a range to be launched in the mid-1990s. Renault is
expected to announce today that it will press ahead alone with the project
after agreeing a sub-contract arrangement with the UK receivers for the
services of about 190 Leyland Daf engineering staff at the Birmingham van
plant.
Agreement has been reached for Renault to take over all the industrial
property rights for the new van range, which began originally as a joint
development project between Daf and the French vehicle maker in 1990.
Renault will continue its urgent search for a new partner to replace Daf to
share the burden of the development costs of the new range which is due to
replace the Renault Master and part of the Renault Trafic range.
Volkswagen of Germany, which must replace its present LT heavy van range
later in the 1990s, is considered a potential partner, while General Motors
Europe has also held talks with Renault about a possible collaborative van
venture.
In Eindhoven, Daf's Dutch receivers said they had received assurances from
the UK receivers that the new Dutch/Belgian Daf Trucks company could
continue to count on essential parts and components being delivered from
Leyland Daf's British plants.
If Leyland Daf should cease production for any reason, Daf Trucks has
secured an agreement in principle that it may purchase the machinery and
equipment so that it can make the parts itself.
Leyland Daf currently supplies cab pressings from Birmingham, axle
components from Glasgow and crankshafts from Leyland.
The Dutch and Belgian governments have waived their rights to a voting
majority in Daf Trucks NV despite their combined majority stake in the
proposed new company.
Mr Friso Meeter, one of Daf's two Dutch receivers, denied yesterday that the
new Daf could be considered a 'nationalised' company following the weekend
deal whereby the Netherlands and Belgium agreed to provide a combined Fl
270m towards fresh equity of up to Fl 500m.
He disclosed that it was the 'express wish' of the two governments that
their combined control over the company be limited to a minority influence.
Daf Trucks NV is to be established on Friday as the successor company to
Daf, which went into receivership on February 2.
Leyland Daf, Daf's UK subsidiary, is excluded from the deal and its future
depends on the success of the UK receivers' plans for saving the constituent
parts of the business.
Preliminary talks have also been held with Unipart, the UK parts
distribution and engineering group, about the acquisition of the Leyland Daf
spare parts operation at Chorley, Lancashire.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Regulator deals blow to coal lobby: 'Dash for gas' strategy
reaffirmed as report offers little hope for threatened mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFESSOR Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, will today rebut
criticism of his support for a 'dash for gas' policy in a further setback to
the coal lobby.
His second and final report on the controversial issue will be seen as in
effect quashing the argument that the growth of cheap gas-fired power
stations should be reined back to help boost demand for coal and save a
substantial number of the 31 pits threatened with closure.
Prof Littlechild's counterblast follows sustained criticism from the
electricity generators and British Coal that his initial report on the
subject, issued last December, was deeply flawed.
Although the government was already sceptical that it could stem the dash
for gas, Prof Littlechild's conclusions make it even less likely that it
will use legislation to prevent more gas-fired power stations being built.
The growth in gas-fired power is largely responsible for a sharp fall in the
demand for coal.
Prof Littlechild's review comes as the government struggles to complete a
politically sensitive review into the future of coal prompted by uproar over
the decision on October 13 to close 31 pits. A white paper, originally
promised this month, is unlikely before the second week in March.
Some electricity market analysts believe that unless the government tackles
either gas or nuclear power, it may not be able to save enough pits to
satisfy Tory backbenchers.
Prof Littlechild's report concentrates on whether 11 of the 12 regional
electricity companies (Recs), which distribute power in England and Wales,
made the best decision on behalf of consumers when they signed long-term
contracts to buy gas from stations in which they have a stake.
Prof Littlechild serves notice on National Power and PowerGen, the two
largest electricity generators in England and Wales, that he wants to study
their coal contracts. This follows allegations, denied by the companies,
that they are failing to pass coal price cuts fully on to customers.
Prof Littlechild says he wants to address concern that electricity provided
by coal-fired plants may be overpriced.
He asks for further details about the generators' costs and says: 'I shall
be examining the costs and margins of their licensed business generally . .
. I shall monitor the situation particularly carefully.'
However Prof Littlechild says in his report that the Recs have used stakes
in the stations to 'provide protection against the market power of the
generators, rather than to profit from higher prices in contracts'.
He says his information suggests that, in signing the gas contracts, none of
the Recs violated licence requirements to pur-chase electricity
economically.
Prof Littlechild also clears the companies to sign five-year contracts with
the generators to buy coal. He says he will not apply yardstick controls -
affecting the ability of the Recs to pass through costs to the consumer - to
the coal contracts.
In response to allegations that he was using unrealistically high coal
prices in his December analysis, Prof Littlechild says: 'I have re-run the
main scenario using lower prices implied by British Coal. Changing the coal
price assumption does not affect the conclusions.'

FT  23 FEB 93 / Bankers' leader warns 'free' service being put at risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'FREE' BANKING for personal customers who stay in credit is being put at
risk by the efforts of high street banks to end subsidies for loss-making
business, the British Bankers' Association warned yesterday.
Sir Nicholas Goodison, association president, said free banking was 'not
likely to be sustainable' as banks ended such internal subsidies.
'If somebody is providing a service, why shouldn't they charge for it?' he
said.
Although many bankers privately believe 'free' personal banking - introduced
in 1984 and 1985 - is unlikely to last, Sir Nicholas's comment is one of the
first public statements to this effect by a senior banker.
Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds Bank and association
vice-president, added that 'far from being too profitable, you have to
question whether we are sufficiently profitable'.
Banks want to end internal subsidies because they fear undercutting by
competitors in the more profitable parts of their businesses. One bank
estimates that 80 per cent of bank current accounts are now loss-making.
Sir Nicholas, chairman of TSB Group, said at a briefing that individual
banks would choose when and if to bring in charges. He said some politicians
who saw banks as 'public utilities' criticised them unfairly for making
profits.
He also said the association supported in principle a call from foreign
banks for a register of corporate loans to prevent lending to companies with
excessive debts. But it was unclear whether such a register was practical.
The association is considering how complete such a register could be. It
believes there will be difficulties in cataloguing all forms of company
borrowing because London is an international financial centre.
The Foreign Banks and Securities Houses Association has sent a proposal to
the Bank of England and the association which hints that overseas banks may
reduce their commitment to London if a register is not created.
The association also disclosed that complaints made after January 26 this
year from small businesses about bank maladministration could be considered
by Mr Laurence Shurman, the banking ombudsman.

FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: Western Mining acquires
Outokumpu nickel stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN MINING Corp (WMC), the Australian resources group, has agreed to buy
a 50 per cent share in the Mount Keith nickel deposit in Western Australia
from Outokumpu, the Finnish metals group.
The deal will give WMC 100 per cent ownership of Mount Keith, which is
expected to start producing about 28,000 tonnes a year of nickel concentrate
in early 1995. However, the group will have to fund development costs
estimated at ADollars 450m (USDollars 306m). WMC said it had signed an
agreement giving Outokumpu the right to buy 50 per cent of Mount Keith
production for 10 years.
Analysts said the deal suggested that WMC would not exercise its right to
purchase a 49 per cent share in the Olympic Dam copper/gold/silver/uranium
mine in South Australia from BP, its joint venture partner. BP said in
November that it would sell the stake for USDollars 456m to Minorco, the
overseas investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation-De Beers group of
South Africa, unless WMC exercised its right to buy the stake at the same
price. Acquisition of the BP shares would make WMC solely responsible for
funding proposed expansion costing around ADollars 1bn at Olympic Dam.
The group is also committed to investing ADollars 105m at its Kambalda
nickel operations in Western Australia provided the state government moves
to allow continuous mining.
WMC acquired its half-share in Mount Keith in 1991 following a
bitterly-contested joint takeover with the Normandy Poseidon group of
Australian Consolidated Minerals (AMC). AMC's defence against the bid
centred on an attempt to tie up control of Mount Keith by selling a
half-share to Outokumpu. But the move backfired when Outokumpu agreed to
develop the mine jointly with WMC.

FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Eurotherm accounts inconsistent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROTHERM, the control equipment group, has admitted to an inconsistency
between its 1990 and 1991 accounts following discussions with the Financial
Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounting watchdog.
In a note to its latest accounts circulated yesterday, the company has
restated restructuring provisions which it treated as extraordinary charges
in 1990 but partly wrote-back as exceptional profits in 1991.
The 1991 accounts were not qualified by Arthur Andersen, the company's
auditor.
The restated figures treat the provision as an exceptional item, which has
the effect of reducing 1990 earnings per share from 19.6p to 12.3p. It makes
no difference to the 1991 and 1992 results.
In an announcement yesterday coinciding with publication of the accounts,
the Review Panel said it welcomed the company's restatement and it had
concluded its examination of the accounts.
Mr Sydney Treadgold, secretary to the Review Panel, said: 'We feel that
honour has been satisfied.' He said that in general such treatments 'were
not right in terms of correctness and consistency.'
But Mr Robert Biddle, Eurotherm's finance director, called the Review Panel
'a kangaroo court' which had made the assumption that the company was
'guilty until proven innocent.' He said: 'I'm just amazed. I would have
thought the panel had bigger fish to fry.'
He said that restating items in prior years was 'comparing apples with
oranges' and argued that the company had tried to comply as quickly as
possible with the new accounting standards.
He said the differing treatment was the result of the company adopting by
the 1991 accounts the second pronouncement from the urgent issues task force
of the Accounting Standards Board, which requires fundamental restructurings
to be treated as exceptional items.
Mr Treadgold said: 'The panel makes every effort to explain its procedures
and gives companies every opportunity to explain its accounting treatment.
It is anxious to come to a voluntary agreement whenever possible.'
Eurotherm made a Pounds 2.3m extraordinary charge for a fundamental
restructuring of its manufacturing activities in the year to October 31
1990, which had no effect on pre-tax profits.
In the following year, however, it wrote back as an exceptional gain Pounds
513,000 for which it had over-provided in 1990, which increased pre-tax
profits by 8 per cent to Pounds 7.2m.

FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: Sears, Roebuck reaps Dollars
800m from offering of finance arm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES OF Dean Witter, Discover were priced at Dollars 27 yesterday, netting
its parent, Sears, Roebuck about Dollars 800m.
The initial public offering of Sears' brokerage and credit card units is the
first of a series of planned spin-offs for the Chicago-based retailing
giant. Dean Witter, Discover shares will begin trading publicly today.
Dean Witter, Discover sold 29.5m shares, or about 20 per cent of its stock
in the initial offering, with about 15 per cent of those shares reserved for
purchase by employees.
The remainder of the firm will be spun off to Sears shareholders by the end
of this year. Sears will receive a Dollars 560m special dividend from Dean
Witter, Discover when the spin-off is completed.
The price of the offering was up substantially from the Dollars 20 to
Dollars 22 per share projected in the preliminary prospectus was released in
December.
The favourable reception to the offering boosted Sears stock on Friday by
Dollars 2.75 per share to Dollars 54 - its highest level in 12 months. In
New York yesterday, Sears shares closed Dollars  3/8 higher at Dollars 53
7/8 .
The Dean Witter, Discover sale is part of Sears' strategy to return to its
core business of retailing. Sears also plans to sell portions of its
Allstate insurance and Coldwell Banker property businesses.
Analysts said that Dean Witter is the most attractive of Sears' planned
offerings, with solid earnings and steady cash flow from its large mutual
fund and managed money operations.
Dean Witter, Discover had 1992 earnings of Dollars 439.1m, including a
one-time gain of Dollars 32.1m, up from Dollars 344.6m in 1991.
Profits were distributed nearly evenly between credit card and securities
broking operations. Despite the Dean Witter profits, Sears Roebuck lost a
record Dollars 3.9bn in 1992.

FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: Ameritech unveils restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERITECH, the Chicago-based 'Baby Bell' telephone company, yesterday
announced a sweeping internal reorganisation and unveiled a radical plan for
introducing competition into the US local telecommunications market.
Its initiative is an important contribution to the growing US debate over
the future of the nation's local telecommunications industry in general, and
the seven regional 'Baby Bell' companies in particular.
The local telecommunications market remains monopolistic, divided up between
the 'Baby Bells' and independent service companies, such as GTE. However,
these monopolies are coming under increasing threat, due to regulatory and
technological change, and the regional companies have been looking for new
strategies to respond to the competition posed by wholesale
telecommunications companies, cellular companies and cable television
businesses with telephone ambitions.
Ameritech's plan for local competition is believed to be the first such
proposal by a 'Baby Bell' company, although New York's independent Rochester
Telephone also unveiled a ground-breaking scheme this month.
The move by Ameritech, which provides telecommunications services to 12m
customers in the mid-west, has two distinct parts. First, it intends to
create 12 new market-focused business units, each bearing the holding
company's name, rather than organising itself around Bell operating
companies in each of the states where it operates.
Eleven of the units will be organised around a specific type of service to
the customer - for example, small business services or pay phone services.
The 12th will run the telecommunications network.
Mr William Weiss, Ameritech's chairman, said it was 'dramatically
simplifying' the way customers dealt with the company by putting its
marketing initiatives and services under a single brand name. He also
stressed the restructuring was not a 'resizing process' - a euphemism for
job cuts.
The second part of the initiative is more dramatic in scope, but less likely
to materialise in the near term, as it would entail wholesale changes to the
US telecommunications industry framework, involving a multiplicity of
federal and local regulatory agencies.
Ameritech says it will file next month with the Federal Communications
Commission, the government agency which regulates the communications
industry, a plan to open up its local telephone network to competition by
separating its transport services from switching services, which direct
telephone calls.
It says this would provide US consumers with the same kind of options in
picking local telephone services which they have today in choosing their
long-distance service carrier. The long-distance market has been fully
competitive since the 1984 anti-trust break-up of American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, which left the rump AT&amp;T in the long-distance market and created
the seven 'Baby Bell' local monopolies. Other service providers in the
mid-west would be able to buy components of Ameritech's network to repackage
with their own services for resale.
However, in return for this, Ameritech said it would be seeking some drastic
changes in its operating environment, including the ability to provide
long-distance services.
At present, all the 'Baby Bells' are prohibited from entering the
long-distance market, under the terms of the 1984 anti-trust settlement,
though all are demanding to be allowed into this field as their monopolies
erode.
Ameritech wants the current regulation of its earnings by state commissions
to be replaced by a regime of price regulation, and it is asking for
flexibility in the pricing of new and competitive services.

FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: FII rides recession with Pounds 3.5m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE 'sustained recessionary pressure' on trading conditions and margins,
FII Group, the footwear and scientific equipment company, lifted interim
profits from Pounds 3.2m to Pounds 3.48m pre-tax.
Mr Monty Sumray, chairman, said the group's priority was to 'stem margin
erosion'.
Measures could involve site changes and some redundancies, exceptional costs
of which would occur in the second half. Lower interest rates 'will
exacerbate margin pressure and reduce investment income,' he said.
The footwear division turned in unchanged profits before interest of Pounds
2.9m on turnover of Pounds 35.4m (Pounds 34.6m). The maintained result
masked increased costs of imported materials and components and resistence
to higher selling prices, Mr Sumray said.
The scientific and technical side returned a profit of Pounds 200,000 on
turnover of Pounds 6m (Pounds 5.6m). Exports rose 43 per cent to Pounds 3m
(Pounds 2.1m).
Earnings per share emerged at 15.8p (15.7p); the interim dividend is raised
from 5.5p to 6p.

GOODYEAR Tire &amp; Rubber, the US manufacturer, is to buy the common shares of
Goodyear Canada it does not already own for CDollars 65 (USDollars 52) per
share, Reuter reports from Toronto.
Goodyear Canada said there were about 288,000 common shares in public hands
and the total purchase price would be about CDollars 18.72m. On completion
of the deal, Goodyear Canada will become a wholly-owned unit of Goodyear
Tire.
If approved, the deal will let shareholders realise a 38 per cent premium
over the last sale price on the Toronto Stock Exchange of CDollars 47 per
share, the company added.
A special committee of independent Goodyear Canada directors will consider
the proposal and report to the board.
The transaction is subject to the approval of the committee, as well as
shareholders of Goodyear Canada, including those other than Goodyear Tire,
at a meeting due to be held in May.
The deal is also subject to regulatory approval.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Regulator deals blow to coal lobby: 'Dash for gas' strategy
reaffirmed as report offers little hope for threatened mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFESSOR Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, will today rebut
criticism of his support for a 'dash for gas' policy in a further setback to
the coal lobby.
His second and final report on the controversial issue will be seen as in
effect quashing the argument that the growth of cheap gas-fired power
stations should be reined back to help boost demand for coal and save a
substantial number of the 31 pits threatened with closure.
Prof Littlechild's counterblast follows sustained criticism from the
electricity generators and British Coal that his initial report on the
subject, issued last December, was deeply flawed.
Although the government was already sceptical that it could stem the dash
for gas, Prof Littlechild's conclusions make it even less likely that it
will use legislation to prevent more gas-fired power stations being built.
The growth in gas-fired power is largely responsible for a sharp fall in the
demand for coal.
Prof Littlechild's review comes as the government struggles to complete a
politically sensitive review into the future of coal prompted by uproar over
the decision on October 13 to close 31 pits. A white paper, originally
promised this month, is unlikely before the second week in March.
Some electricity market analysts believe that unless the government tackles
either gas or nuclear power, it may not be able to save enough pits to
satisfy Tory backbenchers.
Prof Littlechild's report concentrates on whether 11 of the 12 regional
electricity companies (Recs), which distribute power in England and Wales,
made the best decision on behalf of consumers when they signed long-term
contracts to buy gas from stations in which they have a stake.
Prof Littlechild serves notice on National Power and PowerGen, the two
largest electricity generators in England and Wales, that he wants to study
their coal contracts. This follows allegations, denied by the companies,
that they are failing to pass coal price cuts fully on to customers.
Prof Littlechild says he wants to address concern that electricity provided
by coal-fired plants may be overpriced.
He asks for further details about the generators' costs and says: 'I shall
be examining the costs and margins of their licensed business generally . .
. I shall monitor the situation particularly carefully.'
However Prof Littlechild says in his report that the Recs have used stakes
in the stations to 'provide protection against the market power of the
generators, rather than to profit from higher prices in contracts'.
He says his information suggests that, in signing the gas contracts, none of
the Recs violated licence requirements to pur-chase electricity
economically.
Prof Littlechild also clears the companies to sign five-year contracts with
the generators to buy coal. He says he will not apply yardstick controls -
affecting the ability of the Recs to pass through costs to the consumer - to
the coal contracts.
In response to allegations that he was using unrealistically high coal
prices in his December analysis, Prof Littlechild says: 'I have re-run the
main scenario using lower prices implied by British Coal. Changing the coal
price assumption does not affect the conclusions.'

<TEXT>
AMBERLEY GROUP, the USM-quoted building services company, is poised for
expansion following the conditional sale of most of his holding by Mr Dennis
Buckley, chairman, and his departure from the board.
Hemery Nominees is buying 965,400 shares (14.99 per cent) at 27p leaving Mr
Buckley with a 2.98 per cent holding. The shares gained 3p to close at 23p.
Mr Brian Meddings, who was with BTP and Mr Robert Healey, who was with
Hawley, are joining the board in an executive capacity. It is not yet known
who will replace Mr Buckley as chairman.
Mr Philip Kanas, a non-executive director of Amberley, said it was proposed
to double or triple in size through acquisitions paid for by paper. The
areas for growth would probably be away from the present building
preservation services but still within building services.
Amberley fell into Pounds 79,000 losses (Pounds 75,000 profits) on turnover
of Pounds 1.62m (Pounds 1.59m) in the six months to September 30.

MR OCTAV BOTNAR, chairman of Nissan UK, the former importer of Nissan cars,
yesterday began a High Court action to recover Pounds 6m from the Japanese
carmaker.
Nissan UK claims that the Japanese company has defaulted on an agreement to
pay for sales and marketing support in connection with sales of its Bluebird
range. Nissan denies such an agreement ever existed. The case is expected to
last almost two weeks.
Mr Botnar lives in Switzerland and has refused to return to Britain since
police issued a warrant for his arrest concerning the tax affairs of Nissan
UK. The trial of Mr Michael Hunt, a Nissan UK director charged with
defrauding the Inland Revenue, will start next month.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Banks given assurance by Daily Mirror
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOUR banks which are majority shareholders in Mirror Group Newspapers
received an assurance on Friday afternoon from Mr David Montgomery, MGN's
chief executive, that the Daily Mirror will remain a left-of-centre
newspaper.
'As a result of conversations which took place last week, I have no doubt
that the Daily Mirror's left-of-centre position will continue,' said Mr John
Melbourn, a senior executive director of National Westminster Bank. Mr
Melbourn added that 'left-of-centre' is synonymous with backing the Labour
Party in general elections. The banks believe a rightward shift would damage
MGN as a business.
Separately it also emerged yesterday that MGN's board is likely to issue a
statement this week, reaffirming both the left-of-centre stance of the Daily
Mirror and stating the board's support for Mr Montgomery's management.
NatWest is MGN's biggest shareholder and Mr Melbourn has been playing a
leading role in attempts by the bank to restore stability to MGN, after its
employees and the Labour Party accused Mr Montgomery of attempting to break
the Mirror's traditional Labour allegiance.
Representatives of National Westminster, Midland, Goldman Sachs and Lloyds,
which between them control 54 per cent of MGN's shares as collateral on
loans to the late Mr Robert Maxwell, saw Mr Montgomery on Friday for a
briefing on the performance of the businesses. A banker at the meeting said:
'After all last week's speculation, we asked him for an assurance that the
newspaper would stay left of centre.' Mr Montgomery gave that assurance.
Earlier in the week, Mr Melbourn sought and received a similar commitment on
the Mirror's political stance from Sir Robert Clarke, MGN's chairman. He
also asked Sir Robert to stay on as chairman for another year, but suggested
that the board should be slightly reconstituted so that non-executives make
up 60 per cent of all directors. One or two other non-executives are
therefore likely to be appointed.
A banks' representative also had a meeting last week with Lord Hollick, the
Labour businessman who is a non-executive director of MGN. The banker asked
Lord Hollick whether he had a hidden agenda as a director of MGN, following
reports that he plans to make a bid for MGN. Lord Hollick told the banks
that he had no hidden agenda and that no bid was planned.

FT  22 FEB 93 / CSFB pre-tax profits rise to Dollars 277m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CS FIRST Boston, the New York-based global investment bank, has announced
pre-tax profits of Dollars 277m (Pounds 195m) for last year, up from Dollars
266m in 1991. An unusually heavy tax burden, however, meant net profits for
the year were Dollars 175m, well below the Dollars 215m earned after taxes
in 1991.
The largest contribution to earnings came from fixed-income sales and
trading, where the lowest US interest rates in 30 years and buoyant domestic
government and corporate bond markets created favourable conditions for all
the main investment banking houses.
CSFB said debt and equity underwriting revenues were also strong - a
reflection of the record-breaking amounts of new corporate stock and bonds
sold in the US markets during 1992 as companies took advantage of low
interest rates and heavy demand for equity from investors.
The bank's worldwide privatisation and mergers and acquisitions businesses
also thrived last year. CSFB topped the rankings in 1992 as the busiest
adviser among international investment banks.
Yet, in spite of low interest rates, booming US stock and bond markets, and
extraordinary levels of new debt and equity issuance, earnings growth at
CSFB in 1992 was well below that of other big US-based investment banks and
securities houses, most of which reported record profits last year.
Observers said that the relatively modest growth in CSFB's pre-tax income in
1992 was partly because of its decision to invest large amounts of money in
new business development, technology and people, and partly because of the
firm's small equity base.
CSFB's equity capitalisation last year was Dollars 1.07bn, small by the
standards of big Wall Street investment banks. The equity capitalisation
last year of Morgan Stanley, for example, was almost three times as large as
CSFB's.
The figures confirm that CSFB has recovered from its problems of two years
ago, when its Dollars 1.2bn exposure to troubled corporate 'bridge loans'
forced its parent, the Swiss banking group Credit Suisse, to launch a
financial bail-out of CSFB in 1990. That year CSFB lost Dollars 587m, but
returned to profitability in 1991.

FT  22 FEB 93 / International Company News: Six-month profit at RWE slips as
rights issue looms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NET PROFITS at RWE, one of Germany's largest industrial groups, slipped
fractionally during the six months to December, the first half of the
Essen-based group's current financial year.
Excluding minority interests, net profits fell to DM395m (Dollars 241m) from
DM398m a year earlier, while turnover rose by 2.5 per cent to DM26.7bn from
DM26bn.
RWE is planning to hold its long-awaited rights issue next month. Last year
it won approval for shareholders to increase its share capital by as many as
6.2m new shares. Analysts expect the company to raise between DM1.6bn and
DM1.7bn from the issue.
The group said that despite the downturn in the German economy, it was
confident that in the year to the end of June it would be able at least to
hold sales and profits at the same level as in 1991-1992.
Energy, construction and related businesses continued to do well, RWE said.
Combined with cost-cutting and other rationalisation measures in other
sectors such as printing equipment and oil, the group is hopeful that it
will be able to maintain its dividend at the same level as last year - DM12
per share. This will be payable on the new shares issued in next month's
rights issue.
In energy production, turnover in the first half of the year was stable at
DM9.2bn, while in oil and chemicals turnover dropped 7 per cent to DM10.3bn.
RWE was at the centre of controversy in December when shareholders voted to
retain an antiquated voting rights structure giving local authorities in the
Ruhr area 60 per cent of the votes although they own only 30 per cent of the
shares.
Calpers, the large US investor, said at the meeting that it was naive of RWE
to retain voting rights restrictions while expecting to enjoy continued
access to international markets. Although the vast majority of independent
shareholders voted to remove the special voting rights, the local
authorities blocked the initiative.

However, the bank, which is in the throes of restructuring, did no more than
break even at the net level, after increasing provisions against doubtful

FT  22 FEB 93 / RTZ goes west for a foothold in US coal mines: Nerco
acquisition offers UK group prospects for long-term growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coal mining is unglamorous and to the uninitiated investor seems
environmentally unfriendly. And it does not look like perfect timing to move
into coal mining in the US just after Bill Clinton has been elected
president - with a new energy tax and promises to clamp down more firmly on
environment-damaging operations.
Nevertheless, that is what RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining
group, is doing. It is making a Dollars 1.16bn (Pounds 810m) entry into US
coal mining with the proposed acquisition of Nerco, the floundering natural
resources company.
The stock market was perturbed by this diversification and marked RTZ's
shares down. Mr Euan Worthington, head of the mining team at SG Warburg,
says: 'It looks like a very good deal - if you want that sort of deal. But
should anyone be buying coal anywhere in the world, even reasonably
high-quality coal?'
According to Mr Bob Wilson, RTZ's chief executive, the answer is a
resounding: Yes.
His company has been looking for opportunities for some time and towards the
end of last year offered to buy Nerco's coal business after the US company's
third-quarter results showed it was financially stressed. RTZ was rebuffed
then but now is back with an agreed offer for all of Nerco.
The US company will be split up: RTZ will sell Nerco's oil and gas
operations and probably its gold and silver mines too but will keep the
profitable coal business and merge it with its Kennecott subsidiary in the
US. It hopes to build on that base with more coal acquisitions. 'This is the
first step for establishing a new high-quality business for RTZ in the
States,' says Mr Wilson.
RTZ is not the only UK company to hunt for US coal. In 1989 Hanson, the
Anglo-US conglomerate, took over Consolidated Gold Fields which brought with
it a 49 per cent stake in Newmont Mining, which in turn owned about one
third of Peabody, the second-largest US coal producer.
Hanson was expected to sell that stake but instead spent Dollars 715m to
take full control of Peabody and it became a core business destined for
expansion.
Coal is now Hanson's fastest-growing business and accounts for more than 30
per cent of the group's capital employed.
So what makes US coal so attractive?
According to Mr Wilson, it offers long-term, if modest, growth prospects.
Before Mr Clinton's election the consensus was that electricity consumption
in the US would grow by 1.7 per cent to 2 per cent a year and that would
provide 2 per cent growth for coal used by the utilities.
Mr Wilson suggests there will also be important changes within coal demand
as the US clean air legislation bites deeper during the rest of this decade.
Coal with a high sulphur content from Illinois and the Appalachian Mountains
is expected to be displaced by low-sulphur coal from the Powder River Basin
which straddles Montana and Wyoming. 'So low-sulphur coal demand could grow
at better than 2 per cent a year for a long time to come,' says Mr Wilson.
Nerco gives RTZ two open pit, steam coal mines in the Powder River Basin and
a half share in a third. Nerco's share of production was 16.6m tonnes last
year and its share of reserves is 580m tonnes.
More than 60 per cent of production from these mines is secured by long-term
contracts, 95 per cent of the contracts run into the next century.
Mr Wilson says the mines 'are about the lowest-cost in the world', with coal
typically costing only Dollars 4 a tonne to mine. This is because the
deposits are thick and very little waste has to be removed before it can be
extracted by cheap, open-pit methods.
The snag is that Powder River coal has to be transported by high-cost
railways up to 1,200 miles to reach customers. Also, Powder River coal might
be 'clean' but it usually contains only a moderate amount of energy compared
with Appalachian material.
Nevertheless, the acquisition fits in with RTZ's philosophy of wanting a
portfolio of wholly-owned, world-class, long-life, low-cost mining assets.
Neither is President Clinton's proposed energy tax much of a setback. Mr
Wilson says this came as no surprise to RTZ. According to the group's
analysis, the proposed tax would be less damaging to the coal business than
a carbon tax, will hit oil's competitiveness most of all but favours gas
against coal.
Via its 49 per cent-owned subsidiary, CRA, RTZ has interests in coal in
Australia and Indonesia, 'so the business is familiar to us both technically
and commercially'.
Some time ago RTZ decided to add a wholly-owned coal operation to its core
businesses which already include copper, aluminium, gold, titanium, borax
and iron ore. It started in the US 'because it is the biggest market for
coal'.
Mr Wilson says there might be opportunities to add to its Powder River Basin
reserves because Nerco owns only about 9 per cent of the reserves in the
area and there is no dominant producer.
RTZ might well benefit from this fragmentation, particularly as some of the
reserves are owned by oil companies which seem to want to move out of the
coal. Also, 'market forces are pushing for rationalisation because it is an
over-supplied market'.
Over-capacity is keeping coal prices in the spot market low but Mr Wilson
suggests they are unlikely to go much lower. RTZ will also look for
opportunities to buy into the internationally-traded coal business or add
some value by putting some international coal trading companies together.
Analysts suggest that the Nerco deal seems a good one for RTZ. Mr Geoff
Campbell, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group, says
that, while it is difficult to estimate, RTZ seems to be paying only Dollars
1 a tonne for Nerco's coal.
He says: 'The sector is out of favour at present and not subject to the
inflated values seen in some of the base metals sectors.'

FT  22 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: UK coal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Leaks and threats of legislation are doubtless the stock in trade of
Whitehall negotiations. Still, a large gap clearly remains between the
amount of coal the electricity generators want to take and what the
government is trying to unload. The basic deal, which gives British Coal a
contract for 40m tonnes this year, has been agreed: it will give a
significant boost to the generators' earnings. National Power and PowerGen
are willing to burn an additional 8m tonnes of subsidised coal a year by not
running stocks down rapidly and by displacing imported coal. That total
might be increased somewhat but it is still well short of the 13m tonnes
which Mr Heseltine thinks he needs to head off a government defeat. The
difficulty arises because the government is unwilling to curb gas or nuclear
output, or to sever its electrical French connection. At the same time the
generators are reluctant to stockpile coal which might be in their yards for
10 years, even if the government were to cover the carrying cost.
By running the generators shares up to all-time highs the market is betting
that a deal will be stitched up behind the scenes. Yet if the government
cannot ease a little extra room for coal in the electricity market it faces
a choice between trying to sell parliament a smaller coal industry and an
increasingly public squabble with National Power and PowerGen. As the
government still wants to sell its 40 per cent stakes in both companies, it
has an obvious incentive to find an acceptable solution before the market's
insouciance fades.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Dutch rescue keeps Daf on the road: Government intervention
is unlikely to cause political controversy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
State ownership of industry in the Netherlands has never been widespread. So
this weekend's Fl 195m (Pounds 73.50m) government rescue of Daf, the
troubled Dutch truckmaker that was plunged into receivership three weeks
ago, puts the authorities in the novel position of controlling almost half
of one of the country's best-known companies.
The government's intervention reflects deep concern over the state of
domestic industry. Recently, a string of 'crown jewels' ranging from
Philips, the electronics group, to Fokker, the aircraft maker, have either
fallen on hard times or have had to turn to foreign companies for
assistance.
Unlike Britain, where privatisation has had strong ideological overtones,
the instrument of state intervention is a highly pragmatic one in the
Netherlands; it is designed to provide sufficient breathing space for a
company to put its house back in order.
The government's investment in the new slimmed-down Daf Trucks NV which will
be set up this week, will make it the biggest single shareholder with a
stake of more than 42 per cent in the successor venture. But the government
is a reluctant participant; it does not see itself as a long-term investor.
A similar approach was taken with Fokker in the late-1980s: the state
acquired 32 per cent of the aircraft maker's shares in a bail-out in 1987
but made clear from the outset that the company would eventually have to
find a strong partner if it wanted to develop new generations of aeroplanes.
In drawing up a rescue package for Daf, both the Dutch and the Flemish
region of Belgium - where Daf's axle and cab plant in based - were driven by
a keen sense of pragmatism: both wanted to safeguard only those jobs in
their territories.
The Dutch wanted to preserve 2,750 of the 7,000 jobs at Daf's home base in
Eindhoven, while the Belgians were keen to safeguard 750 of the 1,500 jobs
in Westerlo. The fate of Daf's UK subsidiary, Leyland Daf, which employed
5,500 people until the present crisis arose, is seen as a matter for the UK
government. The British government has refused to inject capital in the same
way as the Dutch and the Belgians.
The links between the Dutch and the UK plants, however, mean that UK
receivers have been able to secure potential supply agreements for the
British factories. This will help the factories to find the market solution
to their problems desired by the UK government.
The reluctance of Mr Michael Heseltine, the UK trade and industry secretary,
to intervene is not just because of the government's espousal of free-market
principles; his reluctance is also attributable to past support by
successive governments (Labour and Tory) for Leyland when it was part of the
wider British Leyland car, bus and truck group. British Leyland still failed
to find its feet despite millions of pounds of state aid, Mr Heseltine said.
No such political controversy is likely to be stirred in the Netherlands
over the Dutch government's financial support for Daf. On the contrary,
public opinion has been skilfully mobilised in support of the company.
Last week, unions and Daf's works council ran a successful campaign under
the motto 'Keep Daf on the road' to persuade more than 70,000 people and
companies to pledge Fl 12.5m towards a special Daf bond. Among the telephone
subscribers to the bonds were the Dutch prime minister, Mr Ruud Lubbers, and
all the members of the PSV football club, which is based in Daf's home town
of Eindhoven.
The government's decisive support of Daf does not, however, mean that it has
entered into an open-ended commitment. The rescue package - the first
undertaken by the government so far in the 1990s - differs from the
interventions of the 1960s and 1970s, when billions of guilders in the form
of state aid, grants and subsidies were poured into the shipbuilding and
textile industries. These state injections were designed to save jobs at all
costs in declining industries. But the policy failed, giving state
intervention a bad name during the late-1980s.
Under Mr Koos Andriessen, the economic affairs minister, the Netherlands has
moved to a policy of promoting high-skilled jobs rather than simply seeking
to preserve employment in declining sectors. Mr Andriessen believes Daf is a
company worth saving - at least in the Netherlands - because of its
high-tech base, its links with Dutch research institutes, and its importance
to smaller local suppliers.
Mr Heseltine has the same belief in the UK Daf operations. But he insists
that if they are to be bailed out then it should be by the market - not the
government.
The new Daf Trucks NV is, in effect, retreating to the heavy and
medium-truck base which characterised its activities before its takeover of
Leyland in 1987. It is for this reason that the new company has indicated
that it may be able to accommodate distribution of the Birmingham-made 45
series light van.
The rescue of Daf, however, is a risky venture that could yet cause
political embarrassment in the Netherlands if the company goes down a second
time, this time with government money. As it is, shareholders who
participated in Daf's flotation in 1989 have lost their investment, and
subscribers to this weekend's 'Save Daf' bond appeal run the risk that their
loan to the company may prove worthless if things go wrong again. In which
case, Mr Lubbers will have lost both the government's money and his own Fl
1,000 contribution to the Daf appeal.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Police to probe alleged Pounds 6m fraud on Salvation Army
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE METROPOLITAN and City Police Company Fraud Squad is expected to launch a
formal investigation this week into the disappearance of Dollars 8.8m
(Pounds 6.19m) from the Salvation Army.
The inquiries come as investigators continue to search for details of
Islamic Pan American Bank, which is named in a writ issued by the charity as
part of its efforts to recover the missing funds.
The July 1992 edition of the Bankers' Almanac, a standard reference book
published in the UK, says the bank is based in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with
nine representative offices around the world. The bank has been under police
investigation since last summer and is on the warning list of the US banking
regulator.
Senior Argentine banking sources said they had never heard of the bank,
which is not registered with the Central Bank of Argentina.
The Bank of England said yesterday that Islamic Pan American Bank does not
have a presence in the UK.
Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, will examine the suggestion in the
almanac that it acts as auditor to the bank. PW says the bank is not a
client of any of its South American member firms.
In a letter to the Financial Times today, the Salvation Army says it has
been advised by its lawyers not to make public any further details of the
circumstances surrounding the alleged fraud.
It has emerged that the officer suspended without pay pending an internal
investigation is Colonel Grenville Burn, a public affairs officer. No
allegations of fraud have been made in connection with him.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Rail union to ballot on series of 24-hour strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAIL USERS could be hit by a series of one-day strikes late next month after
RMT, the main rail union, failed to win assurances from British Rail on
employment connected to the future privatisation of the railways.
RMT, which was seeking the assurances in talks last Friday, said yesterday
it would hold a ballot early next month for a 'rolling programme' of 24-hour
strikes. It must then start the strike within 28 days or reballot its
members.
An official said the union's executive had undertaken thorough consultation
and was confident that a large majority of the 70,000 RMT railworkers, out
of a total 125,000 rail workforce, would support the call.
A decision in favour of strikes could prompt a tough reaction from BR. There
has been a recent spate of strikes or strike calls in other industries, at
Yarrow, Timex and Peugeot. Nevertheless the latest pay data show a rapid
increase in pay freezes in manufacturing which does not indicate a growing
industrial militancy.
Although the rail strike call was originally linked with the related
campaign by the National Union of Mineworkers against the government plan
for extensive pit closures, the RMT says the main reason now is BR's refusal
to rule out compulsory redundancies. RMT believes that, apart from 7,000
redundancies now being completed, BR will seek a further 20,000 in the next
financial year. Other reasons for protest are BR's refusal to stop using
outside contractors and a 'watering down' of the redundancy payment scheme.
The other main rail unions - Aslef, representing train drivers, and TSSA,
white-collar staff - have not said whether they will also back strikes.

FT  22 FEB 93 / International Company News: GM offers salaried staff paid
leave in job cuts plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AS PART of its cost-cutting drive, General Motors, the largest car
manufacturer in the US, is offering salaried employees paid leave of between
six and 15 months if they agree to leave the company once the leave is
completed.
GM hopes that the plan, combined with natural attrition, will reduce its
white-collar workforce by 8,000, or 10 per cent, before the end of the year.
Only salaried employees who have been with the car maker for more than a
year are eligible for the plan.
The company has already had success with its early retirement programmes for
white-collar workers over 50 years old, which have helped reduce the
salaried workforce from 91,000 to 76,000.
Overall, GM is trying to cut 74,000 white and blue-collar jobs.
Toyota, Japan's leading car maker is considering manufacturing pick-up
trucks in the US after the collapse of talks with General Motors over a
joint venture, writes Charles Leadbeater in Tokyo.
Toyota said it would start looking at whether to set up its own production
facilities in the US after GM rejected proposals for a joint venture to make
the Toyota T100 truck. 'Partnership with GM was one of our choices,' it
said.
Toyota started exporting its T100 truck to the US last autumn, but sales
have been restricted by the 25 per cent tariff charged on imports. This led
Toyota to consider manufacturing the truck in the US.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Managers are left behind on way to market: Russian
management is ill-equipped for the move away from a command economy to
capitalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR after the launch of frenetic economic reform, the Russian government
and western aid donors have yet to tackle a desperate need for management
skills to help the state-owned economy switch to a market system.
The problem was officially recognised for the first time by Mr Boris
Fyodorov, the new deputy prime minister for economics, when he said last
month that inefficient managers of state-owned enterprises would have to be
'helped' to change their ways or go.
Until now the government, focusing on price liberalisation and privatisation
plans, has simply hectored managers for not adjusting to new conditions and
attacked the central bank for pumping credits into inefficient enterprises.
Apart from frequently changing the rules of the game on tax and trading, it
has also failed to remove some of the old restrictions which prevent the
Russian manager from acting like a western chief executive.
Only a minority of managers, long used to receiving orders from above, have
tried to learn the ways of their capitalist counterparts. Others, motivated
by ignorance or fear, have contented themselves with lobbying the
authorities for extra 'working capital' and the write-off of their debts to
one another.
'Some officials and industrialists have this idea that indexing working
capital can solve the problems of enterprises. But they are fighting with
the symptoms rather than the cause of the problem - which is bad
management,' says Mr Alexander Rubtsov, head of Ernst &amp; Young's Russian
management and accounting joint venture, Vneshconsult.
As a result, few managers are equipped to make a success of large-scale
privatisation which is due to affect 6,500 enterprises this year.
Dr Zubaidur Rahman, of Deloitte Touche in Moscow, says the biggest problem
is an absence of management accounting - or the process of gathering
information needed to take decisions about present and future business.
After seven decades in which there was no need for western-style management
because decisions were made by central planners and prices were fixed by the
state, he says most managers cannot calculate or monitor their costs
properly (notwithstanding the additional complication of very high inflation
now raging in Russia).
Most enterprises have only a faint idea of the time-value of money. Hence
the loud complaints by managers about annual interest rates of 83 per cent
being far too high despite the fact that inflation last year was about 2,000
per cent. A primitive banking system aggravates cash-flow management
problems.
Another big problem is the lack of sales teams at enterprises and of a
developed distribution system.
But Mr Rubtsov is optimistic that young Russians, 'hungry for work,
risk-taking, and free of prejudices from the past' will provide a new
generation of enterprise managers.
That generation has already been ushered in by older men, like Mr Viktor
Korovin, the 40-year-old manager of heavy engineering giant Uralmash. Other
pioneers include Mr Nikolai Bekh, general director of Kamaz, the truck maker
transformed into a joint-stock company a few years ago as a
government-sponsored experiment in capitalism.
While most of his colleagues asked for more money and fewer changes in
government policy, Mr Bekh told the government last year that directors'
main problem was a 'lack of management accounting'.
Not surprisingly, management consultants in Moscow have a lot of good ideas
around for how foreign technical assistance funds can be deployed.
Dr Rahman, who trained more than 100 Kamaz managers, would like to replicate
a similar training scheme for managers in the oil industry, a proposal which
he has put to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for
possible financing.
But the real problem will be getting assistance for managers who may be open
to change but cannot afford it.
Mr Rubtsov, as head of the Russian management consultants' association, is
trying to enlist European Community funds to 'train the trainers' -
educating hundreds of Russian consultants to provide affordable management
advice for enterprises. All agree that training in Russia is not only
cheaper but more effective. 'If they go abroad, they want to waste time
shopping,' says one.
Recognising in the meantime that political pressures will continue for more
funds, Mr Rubtsov, who is also a member of the government's advisory
industrial council, advocates a carrot-and-stick approach. This would make
limited financial support conditional on changes in management practices,
fitting in well with the government's determination to tie new funds to an
improved performance at enterprises.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (20): Fewer headaches -
Communications Technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR

<TEXT>
IN LESS than a decade the mobile telephone has established itself as an
effective business tool and a worthy addition to the company car. But over
the next few years vehicle fleet managers will face the choice between a
baffling array of new voice and data telecommunications services and
equipment.
In Europe, liberalisation has fuelled the growth of mobile communications.
Since the introduction of cellular radio services in Britain in 1985, the
number of subscribers to the two national networks, Cellnet and Vodafone,
has grown to around 1.4m - or almost a quarter of the total 5.8m users in
Europe.
Most of these subscribers are business users, and an increasing proportion
of them now use hand-portable telephones, most of which can be used in
company cars with the addition of a car adapter kit.
Standard carphones and car adapter kits now come with 'hands-free' operation
and top of the range carphones also include voice-activated dialing,
allowing totally hands-free use.
After the boom in new subscribers in the UK in the late 1980s, the last few
years have seen slower growth. Plans for telepoint services have been
curtailed while other services have so far failed to live up to
expectations.
Nevertheless, the mobile communications market, in the UK and elsewhere in
Europe, is still a fast-moving market with a new services just around the
corner. In particular, across Europe digital cellular systems based on the
pan-European GSM standard are currently being launched.
These premium-priced services are unlikely to replace the older analogue
networks immediately. Indeed, it will be some time before full national
networks are in place. However, for the business traveller in particular,
they will eventually offer some key advantages.
Digital services will provide clearer, more reliable connections, which will
also be much more secure from eavesdropping. In addition by the mid-1990s,
because it is a Europe-wide standard, international travellers will be able
to use their GSM phones anywhere in Europe.
In the UK both network operators have introduced new low-user tariff
structures for their analogue services in the past six months and Hutchison
Telecom has unveiled a one-way Telepoint service called Rabbit. In addition,
customers will soon be able to opt for Mercury Personal Communications'
local digital Personal Communications Network (PCN) service, due to be
launched by the middle of this year alongside Vodafone's rival Micro Cell
Network (MCN).
Already some vehicle fleet operators are inheriting a haphazard collection
of equipment, service contracts and billing systems built up over the years.
Indeed, research shows that many corporate users do not know how many mobile
phones they have, or how they are being used.
To address this problem, Mercury Communications Mobile Services, an
independent service provider, now offers corporate customers a 'free audit
of mobile equipment' and then a 'consolidation service.' MCMS has come
across some customers with more than 300 vehicles using 20 or more different
service providers. 'We can take the headache away,' says Mr Martin
Bartholomew of MCMS.
Managing a consolidated fleet of mobile telephones this way can have other
benefits, such as providing a single point of contact for the customer,
itemised billing and monitored usage.
Aside from the basic cellular mobile services, many corporate customers have
also signed up for the value-added services offered by network operators,
such as Vodata's Recall voice messaging service or Cellnet's direct access
service which provides a link between an office switchboard and the cellular
network.
However, some large customers, including local government and utilities,
have discovered that public access mobile radio, launched in the UK in 1988,
can sometimes offer significant cost advantages over cellular. Customers
share a radio infrastructure built and maintained by a network operator.
Once they have bought or leased their handsets there is a subscription
charge only; they do not pay any call charges.
Mobile data and fax transmission is another area where customer confusion is
rife. There are mobile data services offered by the cellular operators,
dedicated mobile data network operators, and data over private mobile radio
networks.
Transmitting data over an analogue cellular system is far more difficult
than over the 'fixed wire' public telephone system.
One way to overcome the problem is to use a special cellular modem like the
one available from Vodafone's mobile data service which claims several
thousand users and 90 per cent of the UK market. This enables customers to
transmit and receive error-free data over the cellular network which
provides any standards conversion automatically.
The alternative is to use one of the dedicated mobile data services which
were licensed in the UK in 1989. Hutchison Mobile Data and Ram Mobile Data
Services both provide these, as does Paknet, another Vodafone subsidiary.
But an obvious disadvantage of dedicated mobile data services, including
paging services, is that they can only handle data, and according to
research, most corporate customers require both mobile voice and data.
Another problem facing mobile data customers is the lack of a worldwide
standard. But this may soon be overcome in Europe with the digital GSM
standard. These systems will be able handle mobile data traffic from
facsimile machines or portable computers in vehicles at high speed and with
comparative ease.
GSM telephones equipped with small LCD screens will also be able to receive
messages - like pagers - bringing the long promised digital mobile office
one step closer to reality.
Mobile telecommunications can also be used to cut the costs of distribution
while improving customer service, vehicle security and monitoring.
Satellites are also likely to play a significant role in the future of
corporate mobile communications. mIn the UK, Marconi introduced Star-Track
last year to trace the position of vehicles. It can be used to detect and
track stolen vehicles, monitor the state of a load or direct drivers to
their destination.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (19): Risks must fall as
costs rise - How customers are reacting to higher insurance rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIT BY heavy losses after rapid growth in the late 1980s, motor fleet
insurers have increased premium rates and reduced the terms of cover
available in the past two years.
But the rising cost of insurance is prompting many motor fleet managers to
buy less insurance and look to other ways of reducing risks.
The cost of insurance - a Pounds 1m-plus item for many of the biggest fleets
 -is leading to boardroom interest in risk prevention.
'You were in a situation where premiums were simply chasing claims upwards.
It was an expensive funding exercise,' says Mr David Ney, risk management
director at Willis Corroon in London, who says buying insurance for its
motor fleet is one of the biggest 'insurance spends' for many organisations.
While competition among insurers drove premium rates down in the late 1980s,
the increased frequency of accidents and escalating court awards to accident
victims pushed up the cost of claims.
Drivers of company cars are - on average - roughly twice as likely to have
accidents as other drivers.
Accident frequency rates - which measure the number of accidents as a
percentage of insured drivers each year - average between 50 and 70 per
cent, compared with a rate of between 20 and 25 per cent for private
motorists.
Some motor fleets have accident frequency rates as high as 120 per cent,
says Mr Ney, who is critical of many company car drivers.
'It is really about attitude awareness. Everyone thinks it is someone else's
problem,' says Mr Ney.
In line with general trends in the motor insurance market, theft rates have
also increased sharply in recent years.
Motor fleet premiums are much higher than those for private cars because
policyholders do not obtain the benefit of no claims bonus and because cover
is more comprehensive.
The recent deterioration in losses pushed up rates by an average of about 25
per cent in 1992, after more modest rises in 1990 and 1991. Fleets with
particular poor safety records have found themselves paying much steeper
increases.
Standard excesses - the part of any claim paid by the policyholder - have
increased. Two years ago insurers would have charged excesses of Pounds 100
for each accidental damage claim. That amount is now typically Pounds 250,
and is charged against claims for fire and theft, as well as accidental
damage, says Mr Fred Whitworth, commercial motor manager at Eagle Star.
Cover for damage to windscreens is frequently excluded.
Insurers are also more likely to introduce restrictions, refusing to pay for
the loss of personal effects or stipulating that replacements for stolen
stereos must be the manufacturer's model.
In addition, many policyholders are prepared to retain a substantial tranche
of risks on their own books in exchange for lower premiums or simply buy
less cover - fire, third party and theft, for example - for the same
premiums.
Mr Whitworth says that 17 per cent of Eagle Star policyholders renewing in
1992 'traded down' in this way.
At the same time, insurers have become much keener to press policyholders to
manage risks in order to reduce claims.
Because premium rates reflect claims experience over a three-year period,
action taken by policyholders to reduce accidents will eventually results in
lower claims.
According to Mr Chris Palmer, motor underwriting manager with Zurich
Insurance, 'the strategy is to move the debate away from price, towards
better service standards to persuade policyholders to take a long-term
view'.
Increasingly, insurers are pressing motor fleet managers to administer their
fleets more tightly, inspecting driving licences more frequently and
monitoring the condition of cars more regularly, in order to weed out
potential problems.
Most fleets are now restricting the number of family members who can drive a
company car, in order to reduce the access of younger drivers, typically
teenage sons and daughters, who are more prone to have accidents.
Insurers are also beginning to press policyholders to select particular
kinds of vehicles, especially those which are less prone to theft. Several
fleets have stopped buying hot hatches, for example replacing GTI
Volkswagens and Astra GTEs with Vauxhall Cavaliers.
Insurers are also supplying better quality data to policyholders, making it
easier for fleet managers to identify particularly poor or accident prone
drivers. 'You've got to supply ammunition to help the statistical
departments,' says Mr Palmer.
According to Mr David Voss, managing director of Velo, which provides a
insurance management service for motor fleets, good information can allow
fleet managers to pinpoint which regions and drivers are contributing most
to insurance costs and enable them to vary charging within the organisations
accordingly. 'Suddenly the local manager, with one eye on his profit-related
bonus, may take a different tone with his errant drivers,' says Mr Voss.
Although no insurer offers reduced premiums in return for the adoption of
risk management measures, one company, Perth-based General Accident is
prepared to subsidise the cost of driver improvement programmes for
policyholders.
GA pays Pounds 40 of the Pounds 75-a-day fee charged by driving instructors
for what it calls a 'defensive driving' course. Instructors must be on GA's
own approved list.
Opinions about the value of the scheme vary. Mr Ney is convinced of its
value. 'The problem is frequently the 40-year-olds who work 16-hour days
under great stress. You have to knock away the common perceptions. Driver
training is a very good way of targeting the issue.'

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (21): Curbs on noisy
trucks - Impact of environmental legislation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFF DANIELS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTOR VEHICLES have been the focus for environmental legislation since the
early 1970s. But the most significant single event in the process was the
coming into force at the start of this year of European Commission exhaust
emission regulations which in effect make catalytic converters obligatory on
petrol-engined passenger cars (and car-derived light commercial vehicles).
The fitting of a converter implies the use of a fuel injection system rather
than a carburettor, and of unleaded fuel. For larger, purpose-designed,
petrol-engined commercial vehicles such as the Ford Transit, the situation
is still under review, though it is likely that these, too, will be subject
to tighter emission controls before long.
These developments appear not to have forced up car prices as much as might
have been expected, and there may be some unanticipated benefits from the
fleet manager's point of view. Since the car manufacturer has to demonstrate
compliance up to 50,000 miles, not only when the vehicle is new, exhaust
systems which include catalytic converters are engineered to a higher
standard and should last the fleet life of a vehicle without needing any
kind of repair or replacement. Fuel injection systems, invariably now
electronically controlled, maintain their accuracy of operation much better
than carburettors and should need less attention - though when that is
required, it may be expensive.
It remains to be seen what will be the effect of EC emission limits now
being drawn up on heavy vehicles, which are almost without exception
diesel-engined. Indeed, the whole question of limits on diesel-powered
vehicles, and even on passenger cars, is less clear than for those with
petrol engines.
Diesel engines are inherently clean in most respects but anxiety remains
over particulate emissions and the limits which may be imposed on them.
Current EC proposals fall well short of the drastic limits imposed in
California, but any future European move, such as requiring vehicle exhaust
systems to be fitted with particulate traps, could lead to significant
increases in cost.
Apart from direct exhaust emission regulations, there looms the prospect of
legislation to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by encouraging better fuel
economy. In the US the approach has been to impose corporate average fleet
economy regulations with penalties (for both manufacturer and buyer) for
non-compliance. EC discussions have thus far leaned more towards the 'carbon
tax' concept. Either approach would encourage fleet operators, especially of
passenger cars, to move downmarket to smaller, lighter and more economical
models.
With the advent of the single market, many new checks have been added to the
schedule of the annual vehicle inspection - the 'MoT test'. These new
checks, especially on exhaust emissions, are likely to cause many more
elderly and high-mileage vehicles to fail the test, but they will have
little impact on the fleet market because the tests will (as always) only be
required when the vehicle is more than three years old.
One effect may be to set an even more decisive limit to the length of time
for which fleets are prepared to operate vehicles; the effect on after-sales
values of vehicles being sold out of fleets is harder to predict, though a
higher test failure rate could increase demand for well-maintained and
relatively young cars.
A less widely appreciated aspect of environmental legislation is that
concerned with vehicle noise. The setting of limits in this area is complex,
since the test conditions as well as the actual maximum noise level have to
be carefully specified. The current EC limit for cars is 77dB(A) but
significantly stricter limits already exist in some countries - notably
Switzerland, which specifies 74dB(A), in other words half the EC level. As a
result, there has been a need to redesign exhaust systems.
However, the severest effect of anti-noise legislation in the EC is likely
to be on heavy goods vehicles. These have always produced much more noise
than cars, but until recently their commercial importance, relatively small
numbers and above all, the engineering difficulty and cost of achieving
lower noise levels have argued against the imposition of severe limitations.
That situation now seems likely to change, with the authorities requiring
far lower truck noise levels, regardless of technical difficulty and cost.
Likely techniques include the de-rating of engines to reduce peak combustion
pressure levels, and the 'encasement' of power units within
noise-insulators. If the limits are severe, noise-reducing measures in
transmission and tyre design could also be required. Both first and
operating costs may be notably increased in consequence.
There has been far less legislation concerning the more recently fashionable
aspects of vehicle design, including the elimination of harmful materials
and the need for easier and more complete recycling at the end of economic
life. To a large extent, moves by the vehicle manufacturers have outrun the
pace of potential legislation. Thus the latest vehicles have already
completely or largely eliminated asbestos from brake and clutch linings,
cadmium from protective finishes, mercury from certain electrical
components, and of course CFCs from air-conditioning systems. These changes
have been made at small cost to the consumer and often with the bonus of
improved system performance.
Vehicle design for recycling is now being closely studied in engineering
departments worldwide. The signs are that as with emission limits, some
unlooked-for benefits may emerge for the fleet operator. Damage repair costs
may be lower if body design takes ease of ultimate disassembly into account.
Component costs themselves could be lower if, as seems likely, this design
approach forces a switch to simpler panels and smoother shapes. The main
counter-effect of such moves (and one which the vehicle manufacturers are
trying very hard to overcome) is that cars may lose some of their visual
attraction.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (22): Automating the
hassle - Databases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A company where cars are a mere perk, the time and energy spent on them
is hidden in overheads. But when the number of cars rises to 150 or so,
managing a fleet becomes a full-time job for somebody.
This rule of thumb comes from an administration manager who currently runs
73 cars, among a staff of 120 or so. His main problem is to have enough
detailed information not only to keep track of maintenance, but to avoid
ruffling feathers in the dovecot when new cars are assigned out of pecking
order. A database of some sort should be the ideal answer, but it is hardly
worth it for what is, at present, only part of his job.
The 150 mark may also be the one at which a company considers 'outsourcing'
the job and giving it to experts whose accumulated wisdom might prove more
cost-effective in the long run. There comes a point where a computerised
system is worthwhile, through a contractor, in-house, or even using a
combination of both.
Unfortunately, fleet management suffers from the same conundrum as any other
application of information technology. One can know what is needed only when
a system is installed, up and running. By then, it is often too late to
change it or add in the extra 'if only' dimension that would make all the
difference.
Learning how to use the system, and having reliable support for it, are
themselves hidden overheads. The purchase of any solution is an investment,
the beginning of a long-term relationship, so the financial security of the
supplier is as important as the functions of the system itself.
Of an estimated 250 different packages on the market, none does exactly the
same job. The starting point has to be an analysis of who needs what
information. 'Need' is not the same as 'want', but it is often the extras
that prove valuable, so flexibility is important. Make a system too complex,
and no-one will ever want to use it. Hide nuggets of valuable information in
a two-inch thick report, and they will go into the bin with the dross.
In-house promotion of the system - simply telling people what information
is, or might be, available is a must.
The database is a good starting point. General-purpose databases such as
Informix, Oracle and Ingres have spawned specialist packages through
value-added resellers, such as Oracle's Ocella. Generally, because of the
database foundation, such packages are easily tailored and customised.
So-called 'fourth generation languages', 4GLs, take a similar approach, and
products using these software tools should be more tolerant of individual
users' quirks. The Progress language, for example, has been used to create
NCR's Profleet, developed by Kalamazoo, and Towquest Pro-Lease.
According to Mr Dinos Theophanus, a management consultant specialising in
transportation at CMG, the very words 'fleet management' are open to misuse.
'Of the 250 or so packages, few have more than 10 installations.' Even fewer
manage the full range of functions. This makes it difficult for people
trying to choose a solution, especially as changing financial circumstances
might put different requirements to the fore.
'The recession has done two things. Companies have less to invest so they
are hiring rather than buying, and it has increased competition, which has
resulted in the cost of services coming down. It's a buyer's market, and
people are looking for better choice, fancier facilities and value for
money.'
Often, those who contract out fleet management get IT services thrown in as
part of the deal. 'When you outsource, you get rid of the hassle, and part
of that is the IT. Also, with an outsourced service you can police and
control the supplier. A transport manager must define the service and know
the requirements: some things may be luxuries, others necessities, and the
budget will go only so far,' he says.
Mr Theophanus describes a 'pick and pay' approach to the levels of service
available. Users can have monthly paper-based reports, or linked terminals
at the user-company, a regular download of database information, or even EDI
 -electronic data interchange. There can be economies of scale. But while a
company such as BRS can provide a cradle-to-grave service in terms of
repairing a car and keeping it on the road, there are certain sorts of
information a contract supplier cannot provide.
Most packages deal with processes relating to a particular vehicle: few, if
any, keep track of individual users of the car. But in-house systems might
also need to link with personnel, accounting and insurance applications.
The way round this is an in-house 'extra', either a database or a bought-in
package, of which only a limited number of modules are actually used. Mr
Theophanus says the market for large-scale packages is shrinking, becoming
limited to the lease management companies as in-house managers turn to
outsourcing. In-house, people are relying on do-it-yourself efforts to
provide extra information, usually with a small general-purpose database or
other software.
One manager, for example, keeps track of fleet cars due for their MOTs with
a screen he built within Lotus 1-2-3, a spreadsheet software tool he knows
well. But, he admits, it's a clumsy solution of limited value and demands a
lot of manual intervention. He also uses part of a cheap package, the
Company Car Administration Kit from Emmerson Hill of Fareham which, at less
than Pounds 50, provides form letters for maintenance management.
A proper database would bring up an automatic warning, allowing him to keep
track of individual car history. Explanations of how high mileage is
incurred would be valuable for decisions on replacements and on resale
values.
Another manager's comment sums up why the flexibility of database software
is essential. 'Once the information is there, you think of all sorts of
other ways it might prove useful.'

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (18): Steep descent - UK
gloom as Leyland Daf collapses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK car and commercial vehicle markets have begun to show tentative signs
of recovery from the depth of recession, but the recent improvement in
registrations remains weak.
UK new car sales rose year-on-year by 7 per cent in January, while
registrations of new commercial vehicles rose by 4.4 per cent, in both cases
the fourth consecutive month in which registrations had been higher than in
the corresponding period a year earlier.
The collapse into receivership this month of Daf, the beleaguered
Anglo-Dutch truck maker which is also the clear UK truck market leader, has
served as a grim reminder, however, of the strength of the recessionary
pressures.
Tens of thousands of jobs have been lost in the motor industry in Britain in
the past three years, reflecting the steep drop in demand for new vehicles.
From peak sales of 2.3m in 1989 new car sales in the UK have plunged by 31
per cent to only 1.59m in both 1991 and 1992.
During the same period sales of new commercial vehicles dropped by 45.8 per
cent from 371,104 in 1989 to only 201,186 in 1992, while sales of trucks,
the sector worst affected by recession, have more than halved with a 54.6
per cent decline to only 31,398 in 1992 from 69,234 in 1989.
Established vehicle makers in the UK have been forced to reduce drastically
their capacity and implement severe cuts in their workforces.
Last year AWD, the small privately-owned truck maker that had been formed
from the rump of the loss-making Bedford truck operations in the second half
of the 1980s, went into receivership. Renault Vehicules Industriels, the
French commercial vehicle maker, has decided to cease truck assembly at its
plant at Dunstable, while UK operations of Leyland Daf, the leading British
truck maker, are in the balance.
The Daf parent company filed for protection from its creditors earlier this
month, while Leyland Daf, its UK subsidiary, has collapsed into
administrative receivership. Already the receivers have made redundant 30
per cent of Leyland Daf's 5,500-strong workforce. More job cuts appear
inevitable and it is unclear how much of the Leyland Daf operations can be
salvaged.
In the car industry Rover, Jaguar, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars and Ford of
Britain have all been operating with substantial losses.
The Jaguar UK workforce has been sharply reduced to only 6,481 at the end of
1992 from 7,520 a year earlier and 11,661 at the end of 1990.
Ford of Europe is currently cutting another 10,000 jobs across Europe, with
the UK bearing a significant part of the contraction. Ford's UK workforce
had already fallen from a peak of 80,000 in early 1980 to only 33,000 by the
end of 1992.
In the motor dealer sector the Retail Motor Industry Federation said last
month that a further 7 to 8 per cent of the UK's remaining 7,000 franchised
motor dealers would close or be sold off this year. Last year 8 per cent
closed or were sold off following 10 per cent in 1991.
As the recession deepened vehicle makers have been forced to undertake
increasingly desperate measures to try to stimulate sales with an array of
financial incentives and deep discounting, but often the actions have only
served to increase losses.
As retail sales continued to fall last year, it was the fleet sector of the
UK car market that sustained sales, and meant that the market finally
remained unchanged from 1991 at 1.59m. The share of sales to fleets (defined
as operators of 25 vehicles and above) accounted for 41.8 per cent of the UK
new car market last year compared with 39.2 per cent a year earlier.
Opinions now differ as to how well the recovery in demand in recent months
can be maintained.
Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, said that the January sales
figures suggested that 'a sustained recovery' in the market could well be
under way.
The growth in sales in January - in contrast to previous months - was
entirely due to a higher level of purchases by private customers rather than
by company fleets, he said.
Professor Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff
Business School, cautions against optimism based on the January sales
figures, however.
'Last month's car figures were in fact dreadful', he says. 'The previous
January was very poor, being 11.7 per cent down on the 1990 figure. But
since then the 10 per cent special car tax has been abolished. That should
should have lifted last month's market by 12 per cent on its own.
'The extent to which the market is up shows the recession is still there and
that people remain very cautious about buying,' he said.
Sales of Japanese makes in January were 32.9 per cent higher than a year
ago, which boosted their share to 11.2 per cent from 9.0 per cent a year
earlier.
Sales of Japanese cars will be boosted this year by growing output from the
new Toyota and Honda plants in the UK which opened late last year.
The first cars from Toyota's Pounds 700m plant at Burnaston near Derby were
registered in January, and the pattern of the supply of Japanese cars to the
UK is becoming increasingly complex.
Both Toyota and Honda are now shipping cars to the UK from their plants in
the US, while Nissan and Suzuki also supply some vehicles to the UK from
plants in Spain. Nissan, Toyota and Honda all have car assembly and engine
plants in the UK.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (16): Shake-out may be
near end - Contract Hire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DERRICK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a spate of acquisitions, contract hire seems to be absolutely the
flavour of the month. But the reality is rather different.
Those companies that have been expanding through acquisition are doing so
only extremely cautiously and selectively. In the 1980s, when contract hire
took off, the rapid growth of the industry persuaded many newcomers to the
business that this was a source of easy money. And indeed, while there was
constant growth, that regular new business tended to disguise the structural
problems that became all too evident once the recession took firm hold.
Several smaller contract hire companies got into difficulties because they
underestimated maintenance and other costs and overestimated residual
values. Big losses ensued at the end of a three-year contract when vehicles
turned out to be worth hundreds and in some cases thousands of pounds less
than expected. Contract hire companies such as these - with a poor portfolio
of customers - will find it hard to attract a white knight.
Mr Norman Donkin, former managing director of Lease Plan UK who, as director
of AT&amp;T Capital, has a specific brief to develop a European leasing division
for the American corporation, says: 'We looked at a number of contract hire
companies that were for sale. What we wanted were sound management, a good
quality portfolio of customers and good systems.
'Many of the companies for sale did not meet all these criteria. Even more
did not meet our other requirement, which is that the company should be
profitable.
'So what we did is to look at some companies that were not necessarily for
sale and decided that instead of buying a large contract hire company we
would do better to acquire a medium-sized one with an infrastructure in
place that could be built upon.'
It was the combination of a lack of profitability, losses on disposals and
problems with gearing that contributed to the decisions by a number of
groups to try to dispose of their contract hire and leasing businesses, says
Mr Nick Brown, managing director of Trimoco Leasing and chairman of the
British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association's leasing committee.
But he also believes that the recent shake-down in the industry may be
coming to an end. 'After a period of consolidation, the companies that
remain are mostly trading profitably because at the beginning of the
recession they recognised the problems that were coming and so adjusted
their rental rates upwards and their residual value projections downwards.
Those that have survived the last three years will probably grow as the
market expands.'
Most of the current rash of takeovers and acquisitions are due to some
smaller companies getting into difficulties over residuals and costs,
according to Mr Ron Elder, managing director of Avis Lease and Fleet
Management, who says that there will still be room in the marketplace for
the niche players.
'Some companies certainly did misread the market and are now looking for
someone to bail them out. And while it is true that some of these smaller
companies - especially the non-specialist firms which took on contract hire
as an add-on to their core business during the boom period - may now want
out, there will always be a demand for a smaller company offering a local
service and a higher level of personal attention to their customers.
'But I believe we will not see the same number of start-ups and new entrants
to the business once residual values improves and leasing looks a good bet
again. A lesson has been learnt the hard way that contract hire is a
specialist business requiring specialist skills to survive the down periods
as well as thrive during the good times.'
Avis Lease and Fleet Management itself has a new parent company since last
year when General Electric of the US acquired the business. And the recent
period of consolidations and mergers is not wholly over yet, predicts Mr
Elder.
'We have a parent with the capacity to grow the business. So when
opportunities come along, nothing will stop us going after them - we have
plenty of investment funds available for the right acquisitions,' he says.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (17): Too few desirable
models - Used Cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE CROPLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE growing number of canny business motorists who buy their cars 'nearly
new' instead of straight from the showroom - and save thousands on
early-months depreciation - are in for a shock this year. The cars they seek
are likely to be in far shorter supply than they have been for years, and
what stocks there are will be picked over by hard-pressed car dealers before
the end-users get a look in.
At the other end of the scale, the used car market is becoming increasingly
clogged with high mileage three- and four-year-old business cars, which
recession-hit businesses kept for too long in extended leasing deals. These
models, often with more than 100,000 miles 'on the clock' are proving
unattractive to private buyers who, in better times, would be their natural
second owners.
Worst of all, because private buyers of new cars have been in full retreat
for three years, the flow of trade-ins to dealers they provide - the best
used car stock of all - has dwindled alarmingly.
It all adds up to crisis in the used car business. In a nutshell, the
potential buyers can't get enough of the cars they want, and the cars most
readily available are largely unwanted. 'This complex combination of
factors, plus the fact that everyone is short of money, looks like making
things things very tough in used car retailing as the year goes on,' says Mr
David Raeside, editor of the trade newspaper, Motor Trader. 'There will be
some good cars about very early in the year, but quite soon they're going to
be much harder to find.'
The root of the crisis is the rise of a British 'nearly new' car culture in
the second half of the 1980s, following a similar US trend. Volume car
sellers such as Ford, Vauxhall Rover and Peugeot, desperate to increase
market share and keep their factories at capacity, began selling lots of
cars to big daily rental companies.
As the recession has grown in severity the selling - at discounts reputed to
be as high as 40 per cent - has become more and more of a lifeline for the
car companies. For some, discounted sales to fleets and rental outfits have
been accounting for as much as a third of total volume. Laughing all the way
to the bank, the rental companies have been selling at auction, sometimes at
a net profit, and ordering more new models.
At the height of the business, about 18 months ago, some hire companies were
keeping their cars for as little as three or four months and 3,000 miles
before replacing them. Commonly, a Ford Fiesta, bought for Pounds 8,500,
might go through the auctions at six months and with just 5-10,000 miles on
the clock, at not much more than Pounds 5,000. Bigger cars showed even
larger percentage price falls.
Not surprisingly, dealers have been up in arms at the companies' practice,
over the past five or six years, of selling cars to big customers at far
less than to their own franchised networks - which have to operate from
premises which are often plush and expensive. Dealers have been operating on
margins of 18 to 20 per cent and coming under strong customer demand to
provide discounts up to 15 per cent.
Last year, when rental companies, notably Hertz, began retailing their own
ex-hire cars directly to the public, dealers hit the roof. Typical of their
reactions is this from Mr Terry Dignan, chairman of the Wolverton Motor
Company, who called the move 'a double whammy on the motor trade' and
claimed it showed car companies had lost control of their own franchising
system.'
'The recession has hit our business,' says one West Country sales director,
'but a lot of our regular customers, who might have bought anyway, have
become reluctant to lose so much money so quickly on their new cars.'
There is little doubt that the car firms would like to curb the practice of
selling hugely discounted cars to hire fleets; both Mr Ian McAllister of
Ford and Mr Peter Batchelor of Vauxhall have said so. But the company that
stops first risks losing market share, and history seems to indicate that
gentlemen's agreements do not work in cases like this.
Mr Peter Vardy, chairman of the north-east dealer group Reg Vardy, has been
an enthusiastic dealer in nearly new ex-hire cars for the past few years,
seeing them as a way of providing economical cars to private buyers for whom
showroom cars have become too expensive. He notes a new firmness in the way
car makers are resolving to curb the sale of ultra-cheap cars to fleets.
'They all say there will be fewer of these sales this year,' he reports,
'and they sound as if they mean it. But then again, they all said it last
year  ..'
According to Mr Vardy, the availability of nearly-new cars puts alert
dealers at no disadvantage: it presents them with a source of good cars they
can sell a lot cheaper than new, while making a healthier profit per unit
than the Pounds 200-Pounds 400 they take on, say, a new small Ford after
discount. 'As long as the cars go through the auctions, we'll be standing
there to buy them,' he says.
He is sure, however, that the market needs an end to the two-tier sales
system, which will lead to a firming of residual values, to get completely
back into its stride - December showroom sales surge notwithstanding. 'New
cars for private people have become too dear because the makers have been
selling so cheaply to hire fleets,' he declares. 'When that ends we'll get
buyer confidence back, and the world will turn a lot more sweetly.'

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (15): Differentials will
be published - Kevin Done explains the next step towards harmonising EC car
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM May, carmakers will have to publish comparative EC price-lists for
selected new vehicles twice a year under a plan agreed with the European
Commission.
The scheme will mark the next step in the vexed debate over carmakers'
pan-European pricing policies.
Publication of the price lists is aimed at helping car buyers to shop for
bargains across EC borders. The lists, agreed while Sir Leon Brittan was EC
competition commissioner, are aimed at increasing the pressure on
manufacturers to bring car prices more into line across the EC and to make
it more difficult for car dealers to discriminate against foreign buyers.
The investigation of carmakers' pricing policies across Europe is set to
intensify over the next two years. In mid-1995 the present 10-year 'block
exemption', which controversially allows car makers to use a selective
dealer distribution system in contravention of European Community
competition rules, is due to expire.
The motor industry has been warned by the EC competition directorate that a
renewal of the block exemption will depend largely on car manufacturers'
adherence to EC limits on car price differentials across Europe.
The block exemption granted in 1985 was conditional in part on car prices
between member states not differing by more than 12 per cent in the long
term or by more than 18 per cent for periods of less than a year.
During 1992 both the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the European
Commission published reports on car prices in Europe. Neither report removed
the widespread confusion over price differences, but the EC report in
particular drew attention to many cases where price differentials had
exceeded the block exemption guidelines.
According to a survey late last year by Beuc, the European consumers'
organisation, the prices of certain new models can vary by more than 40 per
cent between countries. Manufacturers point out that prices are mostly
within the 12 per cent band recommended by the Commission.
Certainly UK new car prices, which have previously provided consumer groups
with much of their ammunition, appear to have been brought much more into
line with the rest of the EC through a combination of recessionary pressures
and last September's devaluation of the pound.
Motor retailers in the UK have been disappointed about the lack of action by
the Office of Fair Trading in the wake of last year's MMC report, and they
are particularly concerned about the price distortions that result from
carmakers offering very large discounts on direct sales to some large fleet
operators.
Mr Alan Pulham, director of the franchised retailer division of the UK
Retail Motor Industry Federation, says that 'the MMC annual review spells
out several items which raise the price level in the UK, in particular the
deep discounts which large fleet owners obtain from suppliers, which distort
the price structure for other buyers'.
Direct sales from manufacturers to large fleets at enormous discounts were
not fair to motor retailers or their customers. 'Such discounts have to be
paid for by everybody else and they effect both new prices and used car
values.'
The pricing debate has recently been widened beyond Europe, however, by a
report from Ludvigsen Associates, the UK-based automotive analysts, which
claims that whatever the price differences within Europe, European car
buyers in general are paying as much as 30 per cent more for new cars as
consumers in the US and in Japan.
Ludvigsen Associates, which carried out the basic research for the MMC
inquiry in the UK, claims that 'the European car buyer is spending more than
he should for personal transportation' both in absolute terms and in
relation to household income.
The report was the first co-ordinated attempt to compare car prices between
Europe and the other main world markets, the US and Japan.
According to the study, the largest differences are with car prices in
Japan. It claims that European car prices (net of tax) are 33 to 43 per cent
higher than equivalent prices in Japan, while European prices are 15 to 45
per cent higher than in the US.
On average, it takes 27 weeks of gross family income for a European to buy a
car compared with 21 weeks in America and 15 weeks in Japan. The UK is at
the European average, while the Germans, French and Belgians need four weeks
less.
The Commission's plan for the biannual publication of price lists is not
legally binding, but EC officials have indicated that if carmakers do not
co-operate they will risk losing their jealously guarded right to operate
their sales and distribution through exclusive dealerships.
Every manufacturer that sells cars in the Community will have to select a
representative model from each part of its product range and publish the
prices in 10 EC countries. The carmakers will also have to supply
information about the price of five common options - anti-lock braking
systems, air conditioning, right-hand drive, automatic gearbox and power
steering - and details of warranty, roadside assistance options and delivery
costs.
Prices, published in May and November every year, will be shown both before
and after tax, in Ecu and local currency. Comparative figures for Denmark
and Greece - where car tax of more than 100 per cent distorts selling prices
 -will be omitted.
The Commission agreed to drop its original demand that manufacturers should
supply information about all possible models and options on the grounds that
it would be too time-consuming for manufacturers and confusing for
consumers.
Manufacturers are still likely to argue that realistic comparison is
difficult because dealers in some countries are prepared to offer large
discounts on the list price of certain models.
However, they will also hope that by being more open about comparative
prices they will stave off the abolition of selective distribution.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (13): The need for
longevity - Competiton in the after-market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE CROPLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DECADE ago, the buyer received only one thing when he bought a car: a
metal box on four wheels, covered grudgingly by a rudimentary warranty
sometimes as short as six months or 6,000 miles.
How the car fared after its first few months in service; whether it rusted
or fell apart or broke its owner with huge spare parts costs and service
bills was the very last concern of the smiling salesman. He washed his hands
of the deal.
Things have changed dramatically. Compared with life in the early 1980s,
today's car market competition is cut-throat, and the rise of consumerism -
helped by the fact that the car market has been in the buyer's favour since
the end of the 1980s - has led business buyers to judge a car on how it is
supported in the after-market.
Fleet manager or user-chooser, today's business car operator is attracted by
long warranties and free breakdown recovery deals, rust warranties and low
service charges, 'own brand' insurance schemes and fast-fit spares
operations. And an increasing number want to hear, at the end of their car's
life, how it will be recycled.
They are right to be concerned. A recent survey by City-based automotive
consultancy Ludvigsen Associates shows that a car's retail price accounts
for only 40 per cent of its whole-of-life cost. The remaining proportion
consists of fuel costs (33 per cent) and standing costs, servicing and
repairs.
Some car companies have reacted quickly to the trend, having learnt in the
middle 1980s that the crowded car market was reaching saturation point and
that repeat business was going to be crucial in the years ahead.
A salesman might sell the first batch of cars, one dealer group chief
famously said, but the service department staff would sell the second, third
and fourth.
In a bid to sell more cars to its US clientele, GM has recently been
encouraging its existing customers to become Mastercard users, and then to
'turn plastic into steel'. Two million people reportedly became GM
cardholders in the scheme's first six months. Vauxhall is believed to have
its eye on the idea.
The biggest recent UK improvement in after-market care has been in warranty
cover.
Every car has at least 12 months' unlimited mileage mechanical warranty
these days, and some much longer. In 1983, Mitsubishi cars began to carry a
three-year unlimited mileage warranty, still the most comprehensive
mechanical cover available in Britain as part of any new car's purchase
price, and this has spurred others to improve their cover.
Most other Japanese makers and some Europeans now have three-year cover
though many impose a 60,000 mile expiry limit.
Jaguar, which introduced a three-year warranty last year, claims it caused
sales to surge in August. Even the cheap Russian-built Lada cars have a
two-year mechanical warranty.
Those companies which cling to only one-year warranties (Ford, Vauxhall,
Rover and, perhaps surprisingly, BMW and Mercedes-Benz) offer warranties at
extra cost, stretching to five years and occasionally beyond.
Today's cars also carry so-called rust warranties, which are claimed to
cover the car against corrosion from the inside or 'perforation'. Until the
mid-1980s, that was a common problem in nearly all cars, though several
Italian marques unfairly bore the brunt of the criticism.
These rust warranties commonly last for six years but the all-galvanised
Audi term is for 10 years.
Though manufacturers make much play about presenting 'plain language'
warranties, the truth is that rust warranties are hard to claim against, not
least because some require regular, inconvenient inspections to retain their
validity. Others still require a car to be regularly treated with
rustproofing compound. Their main value, however, is that they have forced
car-makers to improve rustproofing at manufacture so that it is simply not
an issue in the car's first six or eight years of use.
The market has been demanding lower service costs for years, but
manufacturers resisted for quite a while, fearful that the move would harm
their dealers' profits. Citroen showed the way in the early 1980s with its
'loves driving, hates garages' slogan for the BX family hatchback.
Since then, most makers have extended their service intervals and cut labour
costs. Grease nipples, so beloved of 1950s and 1960s suspension designers,
are a thing of the past. Nearly every car now goes 6,000 miles between
intermediate 'oil' services and 12,000 between 'full' services. Today's VW
Golf needs only about four hours' workshop attention every 20,000 miles, and
the bill for this, even in central London, should not be more than Pounds
250. Even a Porsche 911, doing 12,000 miles a year, costs less than Pounds
600 for annual servicing.
Because today's cars require less frequent workshop visits, manufacturers
are anxious to keep customers loyal to their own dealer network.
They have watched askance at the rise of chain car-servicing businesses that
stress low cost and while-you-wait convenience, such as ATS, Kwik-Fit and
Halfords service centres.
Nowadays, they fight on three fronts to keep business: by opening own-brand
fast-fit centres (Ford, Vauxhall and even luxury makers such as Saab have
recently begun to do it), some (notably BMW) have made a big play of
reducing spare parts prices and nearly all car-makers now have a 'menu' of
servicing and repair costs for their cars, so that even a Mercedes-Benz or a
Rolls-Royce owner can know what a job is going to cost in parts and labour.
Meanwhile, competition to impress after-market customers continues on an
ever-widening front. Many companies offer 'own brand' finance, insurance and
leasing details which they claim can be tailored to an individual client's
needs, whether he buys one car or 500.
For the future, the buy-back scheme looms. Porsche already has one operating
for its 968 model: customers who pay Pounds 36,000 for the car now can get
55 per cent of their money back in three years, when the car has done 36,000
miles.
Big companies like Ford (with Options) and Vauxhall (with Choices 1-2-3) are
also moving towards buy-back. They already offer a form of personal leasing
which allows a customer to take a new car for a fixed term and finance only
its depreciation over the term.
Mercedes-Benz has a similar scheme working for both its new and used cars:
it looks particularly attractive as Mercedes cars lose value more slowly
than most others.
Recycling is an after-market issue which has yet to raise its head in the
UK, though few industry-watchers doubt that it will. BMW recently became the
first company to open a British car recycling plant, at Bolney in West
Sussex.
Eventually, says the company, 16,000 BMWs will be scrapped annually through
recyclers. At that stage, the company will truly be looking after the car
from the cradle to the grave.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (14): The price of fresh
air - Diesel makers submit to tighter exhaust rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN BUNTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY next October all new diesel-engined commercial vehicles must meet
European exhaust emission limits on four different pollutants - three gases
and dust.
It is relatively easy to cut emissions, but marketing men and engineers want
to do it with minimum cost and loss of fuel economy.
Companies such as Mercedes-Benz and the proprietary engine maker Cummins
have grasped the nettle by 'wrapping' the emission-related changes into a
broader package of improvements. The cost penalties of meeting new
environmental legislation from Brussels are hidden in a list price increase
justified by other improvements.
Many manufacturers' engine horsepower ratings have been revised upwards to
overcome the loss of hill-climbing and acceleration performance which would
otherwise result from the tighter emission limits.
Independent road tests on the latest 'Euro 1' (emission compliant) 38-tonne
articulated tractor units from Mercedes, MAN, Scania and ERF show that the
latest 400-plus horsepower models can complete their journeys more rapidly
with less fuel than their 1980s counterparts. Among heavy trucks introduced
in the past 12 months are Iveco's EuroTech and the 75/85-series models from
DAF. Both have performed well under road test conditions.
Their cab and chassis designs have a refinement unknown a decade ago, which
makes for safer driving over the longest inter-city hauls, at 38 or 40
tonnes all-up weight.
Though their cabs and chassis mark them as undeniably new models, the
EuroTech and 75/85 rivals are surprisingly conventional in the engine and
driveline.
The truck industry's more profound technical developments of the 1990s have
appeared behind the more familiar images of established heavies, notably
from Sweden.
Scania is unique in offering a turbocompound engine - a 400 horsepower
diesel whose exhaust gases are routed first through the familiar
enforced-aspiration turbocharger, but then into a further small turbine
(made by Holset in Huddersfield) which drives directly on to the engine
flywheel.
Turbocompounding raises the overall efficiency of the diesel engine to a new
high of about 46 per cent, though its critics say its full benefits are felt
only on continuous high-speed, high-load truck operation, such as American
coast-to-coast running. Road test performance and fuel economy on the
11-litre Scania turbocompound have been satisfactory but not spectacular.
Meanwhile, Volvo has concentrated on making heavy trucks easier to drive,
with the introduction of its Geartronic gearshift system. It is the world's
first electronically-controlled mechanical transmission to be offered to
commercial truck buyers which needs no clutch pedal.
It functions as a car-type fully automatic gearbox, but without the
formidable cost, weight and fuel consumption penalties associated with the
latter's torque converter drive. Geartronic is likely to add some Pounds
3,000 to the price of a right-hand-drive Volvo FL10 chassis when the option
becomes available in June.
On all the latest specification truck chassis there is a downside, in the
form of additional tare weight.
Engines tend to be heavier, because of their more elaborate fuel systems,
which are being called upon to deliver more precisely metered quantities of
fuel at much higher pressures.
An intercooler - looking like a second radiator - has become almost
unavoidable under the new emission laws, adding inevitable further weight.
So too, of course, do 'perceived value' features, such as wind spoilers and
cab interior embellishments, which now tend to be standard rather than
optional.
At lower truck weights, notably at the HGV driving licence breakpoint of 7.5
tonnes, competition is no less fierce, though buyers are more likely to look
first at the selling price and then at the specification. Independent
assessments of the three UK main contenders at 7.5 tonnes show the
best-selling DAF 45-series, the Iveco EuroCargo and Mercedes'
well-established 814 chassis to be all operationally-attractive vehicles.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (11): Goodbye Sierra,
hello Mondeo - A flock of new models and facelifts has broadened the buyer's
choice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW MODELS are coming and old favourites have had major mid-life facelifts.
The fleet market this year may prove to be turbulent for the car makers but
buyers are going to find themselves spoiled for choice.
First, Ford's new front-wheel driven Mondeo is replacing that fleet buyer's
staple, the Sierra. From March onwards it will be locking horns with
well-established favourites such as the revamped and significantly improved
Vauxhall Cavaliers and Peugeot 405s.
Mondeo, which from the outset will be offered as a 4-door saloon, 5-door
hatchback or estate, promises to put new life into Ford's fleet business.
Its styling is nothing like so distinctive as the Sierra's 10 years ago but
even the entry model comes with a driver's side airbag and power steering.
Multi-valve 1.6, 1.8 and 2-litre, 4-cylinder petrol engines with 5-speed
manual gears are standard. Ford's own Dagenham-built 1.8-litre turbocharged
and intercooled diesel will be a popular minority choice.
It outperforms the 1.6 litre Mondeo but the figures suggest an average fuel
consumption of close to 50 mpg (5.65 1/100km) of diesel compared with 42 mpg
(6.73 1/100 km) of unleaded petrol.
There will be posh Ghia versions of the Mondeo with air-conditioning as
standard and a host of options such as traction control or four-wheel drive,
a new US-designed 4-speed automatic transmission, leather trim and cruise
control. These - and the forthcoming 2.5 litre V6 engined Mondeo - could
tempt user-choosers out of their Scorpios.
General Motors and PSA made pre-emptive strikes against Mondeo late last
year. The Vauxhall Cavalier (Opel Vectra) and Peugeot 405 ranges have been
restyled and, more importantly, refined.
Though hardly a fleet car, the Cavalier 4x4 Turbo with a 6-speed close ratio
gearbox is either a cut-price Calibra with more room inside or a rival for
Audi's upmarket quattro models.
Peugeot, perhaps stung by criticism of patchy build quality, has given the
latest 405 the solid feel of a BMW to go with its class-leading ride and
handling.
Though its UK market introduction is still several months off, the
Swindon-built new Honda Accord (and its Rover counterpart, the 600) will
raise the stakes in the 2-litre executive market.
A dark horse that all the fleet car providers will be looking at is
Citroen's new Xantia, due in Britain by summer, with petrol engines with
diesels following soon after.
Xantia replaces the BX, which did much to establish Citroen in the UK as a
car for normal people, not just enthusiasts. But it is bigger than the BX
and elegantly styled, with lines reflecting both the large XM's lean and
hungry look and the smaller ZX's chubbiness. This sophisticated car, with
electronically controlled semi-active suspension, is expected to be priced
competitively against Mondeo and Cavalier.
Will 1993 see the products of Japanese transplants in the UK being regarded
as proper British cars by fleet managers and their financial masters? It
should, because the Sunderland-built Nissan Primera and the Derby-built,
Welsh-engined Toyota Carina E have around 80 per cent EC (and about 50 per
cent UK) content.
Magazines which persist in regarding motoring as a sporting activity, not
personal transport, are scornful of the Primera's and Carina E's alleged
blandness. Real world drivers find them quiet, comfortable and economical.
In reality, they are Ford, Vauxhall and Rover alternatives. The
psychological barrier against buying a 'Japanese' car is the only thing
likely to prevent them from making a substantial impact in the fleet market.
In the executive sector, the Mercedes 190 is still widely regarded as the
benchmark car. Its replacement, due to make its debut at the Geneva Show
next month, is likely to retain the position, with its high capital cost so
well offset by slow depreciation that it can cost less to run over, say,
four years than an apparently cheaper car.
The 3-litre and 4-litre V8 engines intended for the forthcoming new BMW
7-Series have replaced the in-line sixes in the current ones, making them
even silkier. A BMW 730i V8 with 5-speed automatic transmission (or for that
matter a two-pedal, 24-valve Mercedes 320E) must approach many executive car
drivers' idea of perfection.
Longer wheelbase Jaguar and Daimler Majestic models with 3.2-litre and
4-litre straight-sixes will not be available in the UK until the summer,
though the long-awaited V12 engined XJ6 is due to go on sale in April.
Meanwhile, a Daimler 4-litre may feel a bit soft around town but as speed
rises, it becomes a real driver's car. It would please a business driver who
loves a traditionally English car, wood veneered and trimmed in (and
perfumed by) Connolly's hide whose board won't allow him to have a Bentley
Brooklands.
A trend in 1993 will be the increased availability of V6 engines in middle
price range executive saloons. Among them are the Audi 100 and Volkswagen
Vento, Vauxhall Cavalier and, before long, Saab 9000.
A good alternative to a V6 of between 2.5 and 3-litres is a smaller
turbocharged 4-cylinder.
No-one has demonstrated this better than Saab. Despite - or perhaps because
of - the recession, its turbocharged cars have sold exceptionally well.
They, and recently introduced rivals such as the Citroen XM and Rover 800
with 2.0-litre turbocharged 4-cylinder engines, offer good economy when
driven gently, with truly rousing performance on tap when required.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (12): Head-on collisions
 -In spring, Britain's Big Four launch a free-for-all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FEAST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS YEAR promises to be critical for Britain's vehicle fleets. Three of the
four domestic car manufacturers which dominate the sector will launch models
in the mid-range categories that are most favoured by operators. The fourth
will weigh in with a small hatchback. The outcome of these moves is
uncertain, but they seem set to alter the shape of the business.
Ford starts the spring collections in March, when it unveils the eagerly
awaited Mondeo. That event will be quickly followed by the launches of the
Peugeot 306, Rover 600 and Vauxhall Corsa.
There is a buzz whenever one of these companies puts a new model on the
market. When all four do so within three months, there is bound to be a
substantial impact on fleets - the business defined by the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders as orders of 25 or more. Together, Ford, Vauxhall,
Rover and Peugeot account for four out of five fleet car sales, compared
with three out of five sales for the market as a whole.
Fleet operators seem to have weathered recent economic setbacks better than
retail or private buyers, statistics suggest. As overall car sales went into
steep decline in the 1990s, fleets have gained in importance. They grew from
around a third of all sales at the end of the 1980s to about 41 per cent
last year. While total car demand went down marginally last year, fleet
sales rose nearly 6 per cent. Britain's Big Four are hoping their imminent
new models will continue that growth.
The introduction which will have most impact is Mondeo, the replacement for
the decade-old Sierra. As long-time market leader, Ford does not like the
idea of the Vauxhall Cavalier as fleet best-seller. Its answer is to adopt
front-wheel-drive for Mondeo (like Cavalier, unlike Sierra) and what it
promises is a sophisticated specification.
Mr Ian McAllister, Ford of Britain's chairman and managing director, says of
Mondeo: 'It's a very impressive piece of machinery. I think it will do a
tremendous lot for Ford's position in the market place.'
He is convinced this year will be a good one for Ford. It will certainly be
busy. Mondeo will make up for flagging Sierra sales. It arrives shortly
after the company relaunched the Escort - No 2 on fleet buyers' shopping
lists - with a fresh look and modern engines. Furthermore, Mr McAllister has
two more niche models to lob into the market towards the end of this year:
the Maverick off-roader (built by Nissan in Spain) and Probe coupe (built by
Mazda in the US).
All that should help arrest Ford's declining lead in the fleet market. It
lost around 4 percentage points to finish the year on approximately 29 per
cent. By contrast, Vauxhall, the nearest challenger, crept up to nearly 27
per cent.
Fleets are vital to Vauxhall which, more than any other company, achieved
its climb in the British market through fleet sales. The General
Motors-owned company's business at the retail end is static at best.
This year, however, Vauxhall's main new model is in a category less popular
with fleet buyers, small hatchbacks. Nova will be replaced in April by the
new Corsa, a name used in the past only for cars sold in the rest of Europe.
But the newish Astra continues to sell well, and GM's new, Ellesmere
Port-built V6 engine will be offered as an option on the Cavalier this
spring. That will put it ahead of Mondeo, which will have V6 engines
(imported from America) only from the end of 1994.
Rover's big event will be in May, when it will present a true competitor for
Mondeo and Cavalier. It is much-needed, for the Montego, which was supposed
to do the job, never gained wide acceptance among fleet or private buyers.
The newcomer is the 600, a saloon to be made at Cowley. It will fit between
the 400 and 800. Like them, it is based on a design by Honda, which owns 20
per cent of Rover. Indeed, Honda's version, the Accord, is already in
production at Swindon and on sale in mainland Europe. It will be sold in
Britain from around the same time as its Rover twin.
By that time, Peugeot will have introduced the 306, the replacement for the
309 and a rival for the Escort and Astra. The car, a close cousin of the
Citroen ZX, will be made at Ryton alongside the recently updated 405. The
development should strengthen Peugeot's standing in the fleet business.
Mr Geoffrey Whalen, Peugeot's managing director, recalls: 'A decade ago we
were predominantly a retail company. We had nothing in the Sierra category
until we started building the 405 at the start of 1988. That was the key.'
The model allowed the company to create a fleet presence from practically
nothing. It now ranks fourth behind Ford, Vauxhall and Rover, and well ahead
of fifth place Renault. The 405 is expected to be replaced by an entirely
new model in the autumn of next year.
Of course, the Big Four will not be the only companies with new models this
year. From the volume producers there will be replacements for the Citroen
BX, Fiat Cinquecento and Uno and Renault 21. At the more expensive end there
will be new versions of the Mercedes-Benz 190 and Saab 900. The Jaguar
saloon will get a V12 version, and the Volvo 850 will be offered as an
estate. And last month Chrysler returned to the UK after an absence of 14
years with a couple of Jeeps.
The unknown is to what extent those new British makers - Nissan in Tyne &amp;
Wear and Toyota in Derbyshire - will pursue fleet buyers. Their models, the
Primera and Carina E, would slot perfectly into any fleet. So would Honda's
British-built Accord, though that company regards itself as more of a
competitor to BMW than Ford.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (10): Count the cost, not
the ozone - Acquisition Policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARS CREATE more than their fair share of pollution, some environmentalists
suggest, and they damage the ozone layer. In the UK about half the new cars
sold are bought by companies. Yet environmental concerns are having very
little impact on company car acquisition policies.
Fleet managers are still primarily interested in finan- cial criteria when
choosing cars for their fleets. For example, the 1992-93 survey of company
car schemes by Company Secretary's Review magazine, published by Tolley,
shows the cost of the car is by far the most important consideration when
companies are deciding which cars to buy. The discount available, resale
value and fuel consumption also rank highly in acquisition policies.
Most car fleet decision-makers do not think the availability of a catalytic
converter on a car makes it particularly desirable. They place it at the
bottom of a list of desirable factors that the magazine put forward for
consideration.
However, another survey shows that environmental concerns are gradually
penetrating the minds of decision-makers, even if reaction to these concerns
is limited.
According to Hertz Leasing's report, 'The Company Car in Context,' 51 per
cent of those responsible for car acquisition policy agree that running a
fleet contributes to the UK's environmental problems.
But what are they doing about it? Hertz Leasing found that 79 per cent had
considered using unleaded petrol, 47 per cent had evaluated specifying
catalytic converters, 38 per cent had considered diesel engined cars, and 7
per cent had thought about using smaller engined cars in the fleet.
Hertz says the most popular 'green' response - the use of unleaded petrol in
fleet cars - was predictable as all new cars delivered in the UK have had to
be able to run on unleaded fuel since 1989 and the price differential
between leaded and unleaded fuel acts as a financial incentive for a switch
to unleaded. The report also points out that this switch does not do too
much for the environment because unleaded fuel emits about the same level of
carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons as its leaded equivalent.
Hertz also suggests that 'it is likely the high statistic for catalytic
converters is related to a tendency for more expensive, manager/director
cars to have them fitted as standard equipment'.
There was considerable resistance among fleet managers to the use of diesel,
said to be a more efficient, cost-effective and less environmentally
damaging fuel.
However, they seemed 'highly predisposed' to using electric cars once these
vehicles become a viable proposition and 70 per cent said they would
consider adding them to their fleets.
Of the companies surveyed, 23 per cent boldly told Hertz that environmental
factors had not the slightest influence on their company car acquisition
policies. However, a similar percentage said such factors had had a
'significant' influence.
It was to be expected that UK companies would be more interested in saving
money than saving the planet when acquiring cars, after all they have been
struggling in the worst recession for 60 years and first things have to come
first.
Essentially, corporations have three choices available when buying cars:
outright purchase or finance lease with in-house management; purchase or
finance lease with outside management; and contract hire (operating lease)
with lease company management.
There seems to have been a substantial shift in sentiment at big companies
away from outright purchase as the recession began to bite severely in
1990-91. The Monks Partnership remuneration consultancy group reported in
its 1992 survey, 'Company Car Policy in the UK,' that, whereas the previous
year companies reporting had bought 61 per cent of their cars by outright
purchase, the latest statistics showed only 57 per cent were bought by this
method.
Monks reported: 'Contract hire and leasing have increased in popularity as a
method of acquisition in larger companies, while there has been a return to
outright purchase in smaller companies.'
From the fleet manager's point of view, contract hire takes away nearly all
the administrative problems associated with running a car fleet and permits
clear and accurate budgeting. Of course, monthly rentals have to reflect the
cost of providing this range of services, plus some profit for the contract
hire company. However, contract hire companies running big national fleets
can obtain huge discounts from the car makers and also buy their servicing
and repair at only a fraction of the retail rates - benefits they can
reflect in charges to clients.
An alternative to contract hire has recently emerged: contract purchase.
Here the customer continues to have the advantages of fixed costs associated
with contract hire - a useful aid to accurate budgeting - but can also claim
writing-down allowances. This method tends to be beneficial for more
expensive cars - those costing Pounds 22,000 or more. Monks Partnership
reckons that about 3 per cent of companies are now using contract purchase
compared with 24 per cent using contract hire.
Company Secretary's Review looks at the market in a slightly different way -
at the number of cars covered by different types of acquisition methods. Its
latest survey shows that contract hire and outright purchase account for 90
per cent of car acquisitions, shared about equally between the two methods.
The magazine says that the main attraction cited for contract hire was that
no capital outlay was required, 'with simplification in budgeting and
administration also very important.'
The magazine's study shows the vast majority of companies using contract
hire have a full maintenance package.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (9): Instead of a
miracle, try management / A look at how the cost of running a fleet can be
controlled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STEWART WHYTE holds up a small, brightly-coloured box which he claims is the
'miracle switch' that car companies are incorporating on many vehicles. This
simple device, he says, enables a car which can travel only 27 miles to a
gallon of fuel when on business to cover 40 miles to the gallon when the car
is being driven privately by the same driver.
A careful inspection reveals the miracle switch to be an empty cigarette
carton covered in crepe paper.
That is how Mr Whyte, managing director of Fleet Audits, a vehicle fleet
consultancy, injects some humour into the serious subject of controlling
fleet costs during his training courses.
He points out that, if a company urgently needs to reduce the cost of
running its fleet, a memo to all company car drivers saying that their fuel
consumption is being carefully monitored and that fiddles will not be
tolerated 'will reduce fuel costs that week.'
Petrol and diesel pump prices have not risen at anything like the rate of
inflation for some years but that might be change in the next UK budget. The
government has hinted that it may recoup the income lost in removing special
car tax by lifting vehicle fuel duties. There is also the prospect of a
'carbon tax' being levied on petrol as part of the government's
environmental policy.
Mr Whyte says fuel already constitutes an important part of total fleet
costs and, from Fleet Audits' experience, too many companies ignore abuses
such as blatant fiddling, aggressive driving styles which produce high fuel
consumption or a lack of journey planning to minimise the distances covered.
There are some indications that the recession is making an impact in this
area. Latest research by the Monks Partnership remuneration consultancy, to
be published in its annual 'Company Car Policy in the UK' survey later this
year, shows that 62 per cent of the companies questioned now issue drivers
with fuel credit cards which can be used only for buying fuel and limited
quantities of associated products such as oil or windscreen cleaning liquid.
A year ago only 53 per cent of companies were using these cards.
However, the latest estimates also reveal that the number of companies which
simply reimburse their car drivers for receipted bills has gone down only
slightly, from 49 to 47 per cent, and this is a method which lends itself to
fiddling.
Fuel is just one element in the cost of running a company car fleet. With
each new car today costing on average between Pounds 10,000 and Pounds
12,000 and annual running costs of between Pounds 4,000 and Pounds 7,500, a
relatively modest fleet of 50 cars has a capital replacement cost of at
least Pounds 500,000 and an annual operational budget of more than Pounds
250,000.
Yet the harsher economic climate of the past two years does not seem to have
encouraged companies to improve the monitoring of their car fleets. Company
Secretary's Review magazine's 1992-93 survey of company car schemes,
published by Tolley, showed that 28 per cent of the companies questioned do
not monitor costs at all. This is precisely the same percentage as reported
in the previous survey. Furthermore, 34 per cent of the companies monitored
running costs merely by checking petrol consumption figures against expenses
claims.
Only 54 per cent said they kept detailed records of the cost of each
vehicle.
Fleet Audits' Mr Whyte suggests that many companies never bring all cost
elements together - the accountant deals with depreciation in the balance
sheet; fuel, insurance and maintenance are lost within 'salesmen's
expenses;' funding costs are the finance director's responsibility. 'With no
overall picture of how the costs build up, or what the total annual expense
is, there is no basis of proper and effective cost control.'
It is essential, he says, to have correct information about business mileage
covered by the fleet but it took the recent change to employers' National
Insurance contributions to shake some companies out of a lethargy about
mileage information. 'Mileage recording is not difficult and is a
pre-requisite of almost every cost factor,' says Mr Whyte.
For example, it is needed to make a balanced judgment about moving the fleet
from petrol-engined to diesel cars, something which many companies might
have to consider if a carbon tax on fuel is introduced.
It was not so long ago, when big price premiums were charged for diesel cars
and the cost of maintaining them was perceived to be greater than for petrol
vehicles, that it was necessary for a car to cover 17,000 to 20,000 business
miles a year to break even. Today, Mr Whyte suggests, the annual business
mileage could be as low as 7,000 to 9,000.
Companies are also using out-of-date methods of car allocation, he says.
'Most managers accept the principle that vehicles in the same class can have
widely different cost and reliability profiles. Most then fail to follow
this through and allow vehicle selection on the most unreliable indicator of
all - the list price.'
Most companies still own their car fleets outright, so residual value is a
key ingredient in fleet costs. Too many do nothing to maximise residual
values - Mr Whyte points out, for example, the cost of a decent valet at
Pounds 30 will usually increase residual value by Pounds 100 to Pounds 250 -
or to encourage employees to look after their vehicles.
According to the Company Secretary's Review survey, 42 per cent of the
companies they polled sold their cars directly to employees, which Mr Whyte
suggests is highly cost-inefficient. The survey continues to show that very
few companies offer employees an incentive to maintain their company cars in
good condition - only 4 per cent.
Too many companies have not changed their car replacement policies for
decades even though vehicle technology has improved tremendously while at
the same time, given the state of the jobs market, employees have become
less demanding, Mr Whyte points out. 'It is important that the responsible
director examine all the issues rather than slavishly continue an outdated
tradition.'
Once again the recession seems to be having an impact in this area. For
example, the Monks Partnership found that in the past year the percentage of
companies keeping their cars for between 60,000 and 70,000 miles had risen
from 34 in the 1992 survey to 38 this year and those keeping their cars for
more than 70,000 miles was up from 27 to 35. Also, those companies keeping
their cars for between three and four years had risen from 27 to 29 per cent
while those keeping cars for four years was up from 2 to 3.
Mr Whyte says another common theme in company car fleets is a lack of driver
discipline. Management fails to set standards or to take sanctions against
those who breach the rules. One way this impacts costs is that fleet
insurance charges are generally increasing by more than 25 per cent a year.
Mr Whyte says that Fleet Audits regularly identifies savings in annual costs
of between Pounds 300 and Pounds 1,200 a vehicle simply by applying the same
management disciplines and controls to the company car fleet as are applied
elsewhere in the organisation.
The bottom line is that 'businesses simply under-manage their fleets. A
competent fleet manager with adequate resources to deal with the fleet
operation and manage it pro-actively is undoubtedly an expense. But in most
companies that expense is likely to be repaid many times over by the savings
generated by effective control.'

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (5): Leasing still faces
frontiers - European Trends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DERRICK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's vehicle leasing industry is the EC's most developed and
sophisticated by a significant degree, so the advent of the single market in
Europe presents unparalleled opportunities.
The removal of trade barriers should lead to a growth in business and
leisure travel and an increase in the pan-European movement of labour.
According to Mr Freddie Aldous, president of the European Car and Truck
Rental Association, 'for British-based leasing companies, the single market
offers a rich prize: wider markets, increased flexibility and a host of new
opportunities.'
However, the UK's leasing and contract hire specialists will not be storming
Europe overnight; and any forays into Europe are likely to be careful and
slow. The reason is that, despite the best efforts of the EC Commissioners,
each individual European market retains its own specific characteristics -
and, perhaps more importantly, its own fiscal regimes.
British companies cannot go blundering into France or Spain and expect to
run a vehicle leasing operation on the same lines as their home-based
business; so growth in Europe is most likely to come about as a result of
joint ventures with a local business that fully understands the local
marketplace.
That is the view of Mr Norman Donkin, chairman of AT&amp;T Norfolk Finance. 'In
the fullness of time we plan to expand into Europe, though how has still to
be determined. But we also need to be cautious. So I think the route would
be either to acquire a well-founded company or to go into partnership with
one. The last thing we would do is set up alone and in isolation.'
Though Britain has the lead in contract hire, it is not Europe's largest
business car market. Germany is at the top of the tree as far as numbers are
concerned with a business car parc (population) of almost 4m units. The more
sophisticated European markets - France, Belgium, Holland and Italy - are
all experiencing strong growth in contract hire.
In Germany, most company car business used to be undertaken by finance
lease. However, companies are now moving away from purchasing vehicles
towards contract hire, which is known as 'kilometre leasing'.
France, which calls its contract hire location longue duree, has seen its
leasing business dominated by the home-based manufacturers in the past. So
far, the big three - Renault, Peugeot and Citroen - have kept the
independent contract hire operators at bay.
Italy, too, was once almost wholly dominated by its major domestic
manufacturer, Fiat, but other companies such as VAG, Peugeot and Opel are
making inroads. Finance leasing is a popular means of acquisition but full
contract hire is still relatively small business.
It is even smaller business in Spain, where the current tax regime means it
is cheaper for the employee if the car is bought by the company rather than
leased; as a result contract hire has only a tiny percentage of the market.
Holland is a relatively mature market as far as contract hire goes but its
customers are traditionally geared towards price only.
'Quality of service and customer loyalty are not high on the list of
priorities,' comments Mr Neil Pykett, managing director of Cowie
Interleasing. He predicts that UK contract hire operators may see Germany
and France as likely markets in which to expand in the near future.
However, the single market for vehicle leasing will not achieve its
potential until full tax harmonisation becomes a reality rather than a myth,
says Mr Ron Elder, managing director of Avis Lease and Fleet Management.
'Each EC member state still operates its own tax jurisdiction regulating
VAT, excise duties, benefit-in-kind and ad hoc car taxes. All of these
affect the attractiveness and suitability of the range of lease products on
the market compared with other means of acquiring vehicles. National
governments also retain control of domestic interest rate structures which
impact local lease rates.
'Add these to national variations in car delivery costs, maintenance costs
and residual values and the estimated time of arrival of true pan-European
leasing is somewhere at the end of the decade,' he predicts.
But despite the variables, he does discern one trend: a marked shift in
Europe away from purchasing vehicles in favour of leasing or contract hire.
'It will account for around a third of the market by the year 2000, compared
with a current market share of 21 per cent,' says Mr Elder though he warns:
'But once again, the lack of true harmonisation within the EC may serve to
stifle the development of one of the most advanced leasing products
available.'

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (6): 'No hassle if you
hire' - How operators are financing acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DERRICK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RECENT survey of asset acquisition trends by Lombard Business Finance
reveals that businesses hard-hit by the recession are still retrenching and
plan to make fewer asset purchases in 1993. What the 'Sourcing of Finance by
British Business' survey also shows is that of those companies that do
intend making acquisitions, the current trend on financing methods is
towards a cautious approach, with a high proportion of companies favouring
self-financing where possible - except in vehicles.
Here, there is a marked decline in the use of instalment credit (hire
purchase/lease purchase) and a corresponding increase in the use of leasing
and contract hire.
The reasons are not hard to find. Not only does contract hire free capital
within a business, but it also reduces a company's administrative burdens
and allows it to concentrate on the core business - more important than ever
in difficult trading times.
That is why, a year ago, Gulf Oil put its fleet of 160 cars into the hands
of PHH Allstar. During a review of internal costs it became apparent that
company car administration was taking up too much management time. Mr Paul
Henshaw, Gulf Oil's contracts manager, says: 'PHH Allstar put forward a
proposal to take over responsibility for managing all aspects of the fleet.
'The arrangement is self-financing and after six months it is already clear
that the operation is extremely cost-efficient. The cost of the fleet
management fee is covered by the reduction in maintenance costs.'
Mr Roderick Simpson, assistant managing director of Gardner Merchant, the
contract catering organisation, which runs a 1,200-strong fleet, tells a
similar story.
'Gardner Merchant offers expertise, economies of scale and experience. It
was logical to hand over the running of our fleet to a company which
provides a specialist fleet management service in order to reap similar
benefits.
'Administering the fleet internally was taking up an increasing amount of
time and staff could only react to problems that arose with the fleet,
rather than plan and ensure that these problems didn't happen. We decided we
were better off concentrating on the business we knew best - catering - and
handing over the management of the fleet to a specialist. We are making a
net saving, even taking into account the service fee.'
Reducing internal administrative burdens is one good reason for switching to
contract hire or fleet management, but it is by no means the only one; and
during a recession many companies have found it makes sense to release the
capital tied up in the fleet through some form of sale and lease-back deal.
That was the main reason prompting retail group Aquascutum recently to
change from owning and running its own 100-car fleet to opting for full
contract hire with Fleet Management Services. 'They saw the advantages of
releasing the considerable capital employed in the cars and they wanted a
professional company to run the fleet both to save on management time and to
ensure it was being operated in the most efficient possible way,' says Mr
Pete McAree, sales director of FMS.
But as more companies switch to contract hire or fleet management, it is not
only the national and multinational fleet and leasing specialists which are
picking up this extra business. Many individual dealers, supported either by
their manufacturer-importer, or by one of the larger companies such as Dial
Contracts which has launched a franchise system allowing dealers to take
advantage of the economies of scale Dial can offer in terms of funding and
vehicle acquisition, are also making local inroads into the contract hire
market.
'It is definitely a growing area of the market for us', says Mr Stephen
Cliff, business manager at BMW dealers Coombs of Guildford. 'Many
businessmen and women are sick to death of owning cars and now simply want
them provided with no hassle and funded with someone else's money. Three
years ago we had five vehicles on contract hire, last year we added 40 and
this year we will add another 60 to the portfolio.'
Those are not big numbers in comparison to the contract hire specialists
with up to 60,000 cars on their books but the growth potential for dealers
is clear - and the customers seem to like what they get from a local firm.
One of Coombs' contract hire customers is Roskel Contracts, which runs
around 50 cars on its fleet. Mr Roger Harris, a director, says they changed
from purchasing cars to contract hire for simplicity's sake: 'I'm told there
are tax advantages, but that wasn't the reason. Contract hire is so much
easier. If we get a rogue car, it's not our problem but the contract hire
company's.
'We know exactly what each car will cost so it takes all the hassle out of
running a fleet. All the niggles are passed on to the contract hire
company.'

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (8): Security now a
selling point - How crime is distorting the new car market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DERRICK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK motorists are more than twice as likely to suffer from car crime than
they were 13 years ago when the Conservatives came to power, according to Mr
Tony Blair, Labour's home affairs spokesman. He says that each year one in
five drivers will either have their cars stolen or broken into, writes
Martin Derrick.
The Home Office response is that its Car Crime Prevention Year has an
advertising and promotional budget of Pounds 5m and that during the first
three months of the campaign, car thefts were down 7 per cent.
Leaving aside the political point-scoring, the fact remains that car crime
is at epidemic levels - so much so that it now distorts the new car market.
Insurers are either refusing to cover or demanding massive premiums for the
high performance cars that seem to be the major targets. The result has been
a significant fall in demand for hot hatchbacks and CT models, both new and
used.
The government's response is primarily that it is up to the motor
manufacturers to provide better in-car security measures, and the efforts of
the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association over the past five years
to persuade manufacturers to do just that are finally bearing real fruit.
The BVRLA instituted an annual anti-theft award in 1989 and in the first two
years it went to Vauxhall, the only volume producer to take the subject at
all seriously at that time. No award was made in 1991, but a well-deserved
winner last year was Rover for the highly sophisticated measures - including
a standard ultrasonic alarm system - on the revised Rover 800 Series cars.
Happily, the BVRLA judges are going to have their work cut out to decide on
the 1993 recipient, because virtually all major manufacturers have now b e e
n p e r s u a d e d t h at security is an important selling point and that
the cost of providing improved protection is outweighed by the commercial
benefits.
Rover is likely to be a front- runner again since it has launched the 200
Coupe range, fitted with the same infra-red central door locking and
ultrasonic alarm system as the larger 800. Even more pointedly, it has
fitted as standard all Metros for the 1993 model year with an immobilising
system - the first time any volume manufacturer has done so at the lower end
of the market. And although it will not discuss future products, a new 600
Series will be launched in the spring and it is reasonable to speculate that
this model will incorporate advanced security measures.
Similarly, what Ford expects to be its biggest-selling fleet car, the
Mondeo, which is launched in March to replace the Sierra, features a visible
VlN number, high security door locks operated by sleeved cables and shielded
from attack by protective steel plates between the two door skins, and an
optional deadlocking system combined with an anti-theft alarm which also
immobilises the starter motor.
A state-of-the-art protection system is standard on the ultra-high
performance Ford Escort RS Cosworth which involves not just deadlocking and
alarms but also a Vecta immobilisation system that requires a second
electronic key to disarm it.
Vauxhall, like Rover, is now bringing improved anti-theft measures to the
lower end of the market with deadlocks available on all models in the new
Corsa range which goes on sale in April. A security alarm and engine
immobiliser is also standard on 65-versions and optional on all other
models.
Porsche has just launched an approved Anti-Theft immobiliser system which,
like the Escort Cosworth's, requires a high security microchip key to be
fitted into a dashboard housing before the car will start. Porsche claims
that with over 35bn key combinations, no two codes will ever be the same and
as a result Norwich Union is offering an insurance discount to customers who
have the immobiliser fitted to their Porsches.
In many ways it is insurance companies which stand to benefit most from
improved vehicle security and this is why Mr Derick Perkins of Fleet
Management Services says they should do more to contribute towards research
to help manufacturers improve the security of vehicles: 'Total vehicle
security is still a long way off and needs considerable research before
manufacturers are in a position to know how to deal with the problem
effectively,' he says.
Perhaps long-term, research being undertaken by Ford will provide the answer
to car theft. Its proposed 'Star Wars' system uses satellite technology to
pick up signals sent out by the electronic engine management system of the
car in the event of theft. A signal is then sent back from the satellite
which stops the engine, applies the brakes and triggers an alarm. Combined
with the sort of location system already used by Datatrak to follow
high-security trucks and vans, it could also alert police to the exact
position of the car.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (7): Budget hopes for
diesel - Why British drivers are now more interested
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 10 years, the diesel car has changed from being a curiosity into the
logical choice for the driver who has some regard for fuel economy and
environmental protection.
At least, it has in Britain. In many mainland European countries the
diesel's ability to cut the cost of motoring has been well-known for a long
time.
While diesel's share of annual UK registrations has risen from 1 per cent in
1982 to 12.6 per cent last year (200,835 cars), there is still a long way to
go before penetration matches that of France. There, with both
horsepower-based annual tax and fuel duty favouring diesel cars, they have
routinely been chosen by high mileage drivers and now account for more than
40 per cent of registrations.
Until recently, fuel economy, long engine life and reliability had been the
strongest cards in the diesel car's suit.
Typically, a diesel will achieve a year-round fuel consumption between 20
and 30 per cent less than that of a comparable petrol-engined car. Higher
economy gains are achieved in heavy traffic rather than motorway driving as
the diesel engine performs best when producing less than full power.
Equally, a diesel car shines when used continuously on short journeys
involving many cold starts. Because it burns little more fuel when warming
up than it does when running at normal working temperature, its consumption
may be only half that of a similar petrol car during the first 10km of a
winter journey after starting from cold.
This benefit is not fully reflected in the official Department of Transport
fuel consumption figures. These are obtained by simulating traffic driving,
as well as 90 kmh (56 mph) and 120 kmh (75 mph) constant-speed cruising,
with the engine at full working temperature. Life is much harder in the real
world where diesels can show more than 30 per cent greater economy when used
mainly in stop-start, fairly low speed conditions.
Smoke-belching, ill- maintained and often overloaded lorries do nothing for
the diesel engine's image as an environmentally acceptable power unit. Many
believe a diesel car is inherently dirtier than a petrol car, especially one
with a catalytic converter. That is not so.
A diesel produces only a fraction of the amount of poisonous carbon monoxide
created by a petrol engine. Its output of carbon dioxide - the so-called
greenhouse gas believed to be the cause of global warming  - is lower
because it burns less fuel. Less energy is used to produce diesel than
petrol at the refinery.
Although its emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide are worse than
a petrol engine's, overall a diesel is less damaging to the environment than
the average petrol engine with an exhaust catalyser. Now that many car
diesels are being fitted with simple oxidation catalysers, the balance of
advantage is tilting further in their favour.
But by itself, the environmental argument would cut little ice with business
drivers and fleet managers if diesel cars were significantly less pleasant
to drive than petrol cars.
They used to be slower, noisier and generally harsher to drive than their
petrol engine counterparts but a great deal has happened over the last
decade. Turbocharging and intercooling have significantly raised output and,
by way of a spin-off, made the car diesel engine smoother and more refined.
Engine design changes have improved the combustion process, reducing
particulate emissions (in other words, smoke) at source. Two-stage injectors
have reduced the diesel engine's disagreeable knocking immediately after
cold-starting and almost eliminated it when idling.
The fleet manager and, for that matter, the executive user-chooser deciding
to go diesel are now faced with an embarrassment of choice. The days when
only a handful of manufacturers offered viable diesel options have long
gone. Almost every make of car from supermini to senior businessman's saloon
is now available with a diesel (and often turbo-diesel) engine.
Peugeot-Citroen (PSA) is the acknowledged leader in small automotive diesel
design and production. Its engines are used in a wide range of cars of its
own and other makes, from the small Citroen AX, Peugeot 106 and Rover Metro
to the medium-sized Peugeot 405 and Citroen BX, which is soon to be replaced
by the Xantia. At present, the 12-valve, 4-cylinder, 2.1-litre PSA diesel is
exclusive to the Citroen XM and Peugeot 605.
Indeed, the best of the modern diesel cars, such as the Citroen ZX
turbo-diesel, actually outperform some petrol-engined cars of comparable
size and price while returning around 50 mpg (5.65 1/100 km).
Among other diesels that perform exuberantly but quietly enough to be used
as police patrol cars are the Vauxhall Nova (Opel Corsa) and Astra, powered
by engines supplied by General Motors' Japanese partner, Isuzu.
In Britain, most of the growth in diesel car registrations has been at the
lower end of the market with engines of under two litres capacity. Current
Inland Revenue rules impose a heavy tax penalty on drivers of over two-litre
diesel cars. (The rules ignore the fact that a diesel engine needs more
cylinder capacity than a petrol engine to produce a given amount of power).
However, the disincentive of tax banding based on engine size to the use of
executive-class diesels will probably be swept away when Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, presents his next budget. EC tax harmonisation proposals may
also lead to a greater price differential between unleaded petrol and
diesel. The threat of a carbon tax can only increase the longer-term appeal
of executive-class diesel, especially as it uses less fuel.
Despite the tax disadvantage, UK sales of upmarket diesels went up last
year. Mercedes-Benz sold 33 per cent more 190D saloons and 45 per cent more
300D and 300TD diesels in 1992 than the year before.
More startling was VW-Audi's 286 per cent and Vauxhall's 307 per cent
year-on-year increase in diesel car sales last October though this was
mainly due to their introducing greatly improved models.
Diesel executive car sales will be boosted later this year when BMW
belatedly enters the UK market with its super-smooth 6-cylinder engined
cars.
These, and Audi's powerful yet frugal direct-injection 80 and 100
turbo-diesels, will give quality and image-conscious business diesel car
drivers an alternative to Mercedes-Benz, whose diesels are still unmatched
for silence and urbanity. And exceptionally, Mercedes-Benz offers automatic
transmission on every one of its diesel models. Few others do, though
Citroen (the XM) and Vauxhall (the Carlton) are notable exceptions.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (3): Market 'will still
be distorted' - Industry's reaction to the Inland Revenue's proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Inland Revenue's proposed new company car tax regime has met with a
chorus of criticism. At least one accountancy group has warned that 'there
will be considerably more losers than winners' if it is adopted unchanged.
Critics include the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. In a formal
submission, it voices 'profound' opposition to the Revenue's proposed
retention of price banding as a means of assessing the tax benefit payable
on the personal use of company cars.
The SMMT argues that any new regime should be based solely on a fixed
percentage of list prices, with the exception of very expensive makes such
as Rolls-Royce and Aston Martin, whose manufacturers could be severely
disadvantaged by a wholly pro rata scheme.
At the heart of its opposition is its belief that any form of price banding
will lead to market bunching of manufacturers' models at around the price
'break points', thus perpetuating - even if to a reduced degree - market
distortions already complained of by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Despite the SMMT's stance, a survey of company car operators undertaken
during a series of Association of Car Fleet Operators 'roadshows' late last
year revealed users, at least, divided. Some 50 per cent of those surveyed
favoured a more sophisticated banding system but almost as many - 42 per
cent - backed a straightforward percentage system.
ACFO is a powerful voice in the sector, founded some 20 years ago and now
with about 500 member organisations operating some 450,000 cars and light
commercial vehicles.
But the diversity of views expressed by its membership makes it all the more
likely that changes to the scheme as proposed by the Revenue itself are
unlikely to be significant.
There were, however, some broad areas of consensus:
that published list prices, rather than actual cost to buyer or other
yardsticks, should be used as the basis for calculating tax;
that most users are believed already to be over-taxed - Mr Lamont's claims
to tax neutrality notwithstanding - and that no more than 20 per cent of
list price should be used to assess the level of tax liability;
and most significantly, that the Revenue had done the entire sector a
disservice by not allowing business mileage thresholds into the consultation
process.
thresholds is one of the thorniest in the entire debate. ACFO describes many
of its members as being 'incredulous' that it should not be up for review.
Mr Stewart Whyte, ACFO's spokesman and a director of the Fleet Audits
consultancy group, declares: 'Without addressing this issue, the review can
be at best half-hearted. The current system of mileage adjustments is
hopelessly anomalous and is widely accepted as generating a great deal of
unnecessary business mileage just to exceed the thresholds.'
The thresholds are under 2,500 business miles; 2,500 -18,000 and over
18,000. At each threshold, the assessed tax payable is halved to reflect a
perceived progression from 'perk' to essential car user.
Mr Whyte's argument, endorsed across much of the fleet sector, is that not
only does the system waste fuel and company time and resources - through
drivers inventing business trips merely to lower their personal tax bills -
but it is arbitrary in making no allowances for differences in industry,
operating patterns or territorial factors.
Fleet Audits has put in its own submission to the government, advocating a
sliding scale charge based on the ratio of private mileage to business
mileage as an indicator of whether a car is a 'perk' or essential for
business.
Under these proposals, if less than 5 per cent of total mileage was private,
no scale charges should be incurred as the vehicle would clearly confer no
tangible private use benefit. Between 6 and 35 per cent, 50 per cent of the
scale charge is proposed, rising to 130 per cent where more than 85 per cent
of a car's mileage is private.
Like other organisations which reacted to the Revenue's request for
criticism, the company must wait until next month to find out whether any
elements of its proposal have been taken on board.
At least on the broad mileage issue it is in accord with the British Vehicle
Rental and Leasing Association, which claims that its industry currently
buys 25 per cent of all new vehicles sold in the UK. The BVRLA, too, has
expressed considerable concern that there is no apparent intention to change
the 2,500 and 18,000-mile thresholds.
It, too, disputes the government's assertion that the current scale charges
'have moved much closer to realistic levels', claiming that they are now
well in excess of the amounts required to cover average private use of a
typical car.
Like the SMMT, however, the BVRLA advocates a scale charge structure based
wholly on the published retail price of cars, and remains opposed to the
price banding concept retained in the Revenue proposals. It supports the
SMMT that even the new system would 'inevitably lead to distortions and
bunching below the price break points and continue to perpetuate some of the
anomalies in the present system.
'It is the BVRLA's majority view that a simple percentage of list price
would avoid any unfairness at the top and bottom of the band and would avoid
the distortions experienced with the current system.'
Among other critics, Mr Brian Friedman, managing director of Stoy Benefit
Consulting, echoes the concern felt by many manufacturers that the drivers
who will be hardest hit - senior executives driving the most expensive cars
 -are user-choosers who will simply opt for cheaper vehicles. 'The logical
result will be a general downsizing of company cars.'
The Automobile Association insists that the Revenue's proposals are
'unrealistic', unfair, will encourage inefficient, high-mileage driving and
do nothing to correct what it sees as distortions in the new car market.
According to Mr Simon Dyer, its director-general, 'work cars should be taxed
on one factor alone: the actual value of the private benefit to the
employee.
'This should be calculated on the cost to the employer of providing the car,
and the number of private miles driven annually.'

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (4): Threat to the
company car - The Cash Option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS recession has deepened, unemployment has climbed and the personal tax
burden on company cars has risen further, the survival of the company car as
an integral part of the business scene has become more than an academic
question, writes John Griffiths.
According to this year's annual Company Secretary's Review of company car
policies, which monitors the fleet activities of nearly 600 UK companies,
more than half of the companies surveyed are considering offering a
financial alternative to the company car, although relatively few expect to
act before the fine detail of the Inland Revenue's revised taxation of
company cars can be properly digested.
Significantly for vehicle makers in particular - because of the high
business car content of their sales - the Review research showed that the
'cash-for-cars' option is being considered by 60 per cent of companies
operating larger fleets, of 50 cars or more.
The evidence of a strengthening 'cash-for-cars' trend is not quite so
conclusive in another prominent company car policy survey, conducted by the
Monks Partnership.
Its research shows that 20 per cent of the 200 companies it surveyed had
instituted a cash alternative, but that it appeared to be unpopular with
employees. Only around one in 10 had taken it up.
Nevertheless, Monks' finding that another 20 per cent of companies may
change their policies this year and are also considering a cash option does
indicate that a much closer evaluation of company cars is now on the
corporate agenda.
Mr Simon Rodwell, a director of Monks Partnership, is convinced that
companies are holding back until the taxation uncertainties are resolved.
'If higher priced cars were to be more heavily taxed under any new rules,
this might make a cash alternative more attractive which, in turn, could
affect a company's attitude towards the design of its cash allowance
scheme.'
Companies which have already made the switch include a number in the
financial sector, such as JP Morgan and Bankers Trust.
Others have studied the issue closely but have opted to retain their cars
and subject them to much tighter purchase and operating controls.
There is even a very small minority which has simply withdrawn its cars and
offered only partial or nil compensation. But these have tended to be
companies fighting off receivership.
During the 1980s boom years of jobs chasing scarce skills, such debate as
there had been about 'cash-for-cars' tended to focus on whether it might
benefit employees whose cars were primarily a 'perk' and part of their
remuneration package.
Now, with employers not only ravaged by recession but also having to pay,
for the first time last year, National Insurance contributions on their
employees' benefit for the private use of their cars, the issue is being
examined from the viewpoint of potential cost savings to the company.
Because company cars are embedded in the UK business culture, the cash-v-car
assessment cannot be wholly financial. Employees place an obvious
non-monetary value on them as tokens of status and esteem within a company;
They also, surveys show, value the 'no-hassle' aspects of their company
cars, such as not having to worry about maintenance bills.
Factors such as these help explain the decision of National Westminster
Bank, which operates a widely-varied fleet of 11,500 cars, to reject the
cash alternative and simply to operate the fleet more cost-effectively.
According to NatWest's Mr Allan Robertson, 'despite rises in taxation, most
managers, if offered cash representing the true time cost of a car to a
company would be worse off if they had to provide themselves with a car. Yet
in most instances companies will not even offer what it costs them to
provide a car.'
NatWest's approved list of manufacturers has been cut from 29 to seven and
its fleet controllers themselves specify the cars and level of equipment,
based on whole-life cost. Replacement takes place only when market
conditions are favourable. When a car is disposed of, it still usually goes
to auction but NatWest sets the reserve. Employees who have failed to take
care of a car can face disciplinary action. Diesels are being introduced
without the option.
In the first 18 months of the new regime, Mr Peter Parkinson, head of group
vehicle purchasing, claims to have made savings of Pounds 1,750 a vehicle -
or Pounds 20m in all and big savings continue to be made.
Contract hire gets short shrift. 'Would you hand over your wallet or purse
to a contractor who is trying to make a profit from you?' he asks.
There are other potential pitfalls. For instance, one executive was an
essential car user in frequent contact with his company's customers. He took
a cash option for his middle management car and bought an elderly Ford
Escort for which he claimed over 18,000 miles of company reimbursed mileage
 -at 40p a mile.
That is why Midland Bank, for example, insists that employees covering
18,000 or more business miles a year must have a company car, while offering
lower mileage employees a cash option.
Fleet managers are starting to learn to their cost that the closer they look
at the cash-v-car issue, the more complications seem to arise. Another
recent one, arising from soaring car thefts and so-called 'joyriding', is
the rise into four figures of the typical premium for the GTis of young City
executives.
Factors such as these do so much to complicate the efforts of fleet
management analysts to come up with a relatively simple formula by which the
cash versus car benefit can be calculated.
However, Mr Clive Tulloch, a partner of Coopers and Lybrand, argues: 'If the
cash is an alternative which the employee can choose instead of a car, it
need not be set at a generous level, especially if the purpose is to provide
an alternative to the car for those for whom the car is an expensive option.
If cash is an option which employees are free to ignore if they wish it
could simple be set at a figure which does not increase the employer's
cost.'
If a mandatory cash scheme were introduced for all employees it would
theoretically require - because of mileage and other factors - that
different amounts should be paid to those who had been provided with the
same level of company car.
In practice, however, employers would be likely to offer the same cash sum
to all employees who had operated similar cars. And since that would create
winners and losers, the overall cost would rise as a result of the company's
understandable desire to minimise - for morale and associated reasons - the
number of 'losers'.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (2): Wait for the tax
changes - Drivers on business face a new regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN his budget speech next month Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is
expected to indicate the extent to which the Inland Revenue's proposals for
the reform of company car taxation, first outlined last summer, have been
amended by criticism invited from the motor industry and other interested
parties.
The legislation to implement the revised tax regime will then be introduced
in this year's Finance Act. But such are the complexities of change - to
PAYE systems, car makers' production and marketing strategies, for example -
that there will almost certainly be no attempt to introduce the changes
before the start of the 1994-95 tax year. If the switch- over seems likely
to cause more complications than expected, it could even be postponed until
later.
Despite, or perhaps because of, the wide range of responses to and
criticisms of the Revenue's draft, there appear few signs that there will be
significant departures from the scheme as originally proposed.
The Revenue has declared four principal aims in restructuring the way
personal taxation of the company car benefit is assessed: greater fairness,
reduced distortion of the new car market caused by manufacturers producing
'tax break specials' within the current price and engine capacity 'banding'
system, to promote fuel efficiency and to simplify the administration of
company car taxation.
Central to the Revenue's proposed new regime are a dozen new bands, based
wholly on price and stretching up to Pounds 60,000. The current regime,
which the Revenue itself has described as outdated and crude, has only two
price thresholds, of Pounds 19,250 and Pounds 29,000, above which the
assessed tax benefit to the user rises sharply.
These, however, currently are assessed in combination with three engine
capacity bands, of under 1.4 litres, 1.4-2 litres and over 2 litres. One of
the long-standing criticism of these capacity bands is that they do not
differentiate between petrol and much less powerful but more economical
diesel engines, which require more cubic capacity for a given level of
performance.
The proposals favour using the manufacturer's list price as the basis for
the bandings, but leave open actual cost to purchasers after discounts, and
estimates of original market value for a particular category of car, as
alternatives.
The Revenue has done its own calculations about the expected effect on some
2m company car drivers and asserts that 1.2m drivers would benefit from the
revised structure, with their tax bills falling by up to 25 per cent.
However, it also acknowledges that there would be 700,000 losers. About
500,000 of these, with cars currently in the Pounds 13,000-Pounds 15,000
bracket, would be less than 10 per cent worse off. But about 200,000 drivers
of high specification cars with prices just under the current two 'break'
points face a 40 per cent tax rise.
Launching the proposed scheme, Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to
the Treasury, said that it was designed to end the unfair situation whereby,
for example, the presumably low-paid driver of a basic 1.8 litre Ford Fiesta
diesel, using mainly for business, paid the same tax as the driver of a
Mercedes 190 for equivalent business mileages.
What the new regime apparently does not seek to do is increase the total tax
burden by more than the current scheme would impose in the normal course of
annual adjustments.
In a foreword to the proposals, Mr Lamont signalled that the swingeing
annual increases in scale charges that have quadrupled tax payable by
company car users in less than a decade are at an end: 'The government
recognises that company cars are an important feature of modern business
life and of the UK car industry, and make a significant contribution to the
Exchequer.'
While not spelling it out precisely, Mr Lamont indicated that, in the
government's view, company cars are now just about tax neutral - neither
encouraging nor discouraging their provision. Currently, the Exchequer's
receipts from the tax are around Pounds 1.4bn.
The proposed dozen price bands are: under Pounds 5,000, Pounds 5,000-Pounds
6,499, Pounds 6,500-Pounds 7,999, Pounds 8,000-Pounds 9,999, Pounds
10,000-Pounds 12,499, Pounds 12,500-Pounds 15,499, Pounds 15,500-Pounds
19,499, Pounds 19,500-Pounds 24,499, Pounds 24,500-Pounds 30,999, Pounds
31,000-Pounds 38,999, Pounds 39,000-Pounds 49,999, Pounds 50,000-Pounds
62,500, and over Pounds 62,500. The advantage seen in this successively
wider banding is that it would be particularly sensitive in the Pounds
10,000-Pounds 19,500 region where company cars are concentrated.
To generate the same revenue yield as the present system, the proposals
suggest a scale representing two-ninths of a car's value for drivers
covering 2,500-18,000 business miles a year, one third for low-mileage
(below 2,500 miles) users and only one-ninth for those covering more than
18,000 business miles a year. The document proposes no changes to the
business mileage bands, despite widespread criticism that essential car
users are heavily penalised if they do not cover more than 18,000 business
miles.
Cars now costing between Pounds 19,250 and Pounds 29,000 would be split into
two bands. The 60,000 cars in the lower half of the current band would have
the tax charge cut by 15 per cent on average. In the case of cars costing
more than Pounds 24,500 - affecting about 20,000 - the drivers would be
modest losers.
For the most expensive cars, priced now at more than Pounds 29,000, those at
the bottom of the range - up to Pounds 39,000 - would have a tax charge
reduced by more than 30 per cent. This would benefit companies such as
Jaguar.
Above Pounds 39,000, the tax charge would rise by 35 per cent for cars
costing between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 60,000.
By using the price mechanism more strongly, the scheme also aims to
encourage the use of more economical cars. In that context, the regime, if
adopted largely unchanged, should give a significant boost to diesel cars.
The administrative argument in favour of the Revenue's proposals is widely
seen as a strong one. Whereas, at budget time each year, car makers and
fleet users alike have traditionally waited on tenterhooks for the revised
scale charges in each Budget, to assess the likely impact on both car users
and car sales, the Revenue's proposed new system would be broadly
self-correcting. Each year, cars could be expected to drift up through the
price bands, depending on prevailing rates of inflation.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (1): Lure of a buyer's
market - For UK carmakers, fleet sales are vital. But the new tax regime may
lead more companies to offer employees a cash alternative to a car
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS

<TEXT>
IN THEORY at least, the savagery of the current recession has provided an
opportunity for vehicle fleet managers to adopt the mantle of heroes  -
slayers of waste on behalf of a corporate sector in distress.
Reality, in an unnerving number of cases, is somewhat different. According
to one influential annual survey of the fleet policies of nearly 600 UK
companies, the harsher economic climate has had no noticeable effect in
terms of tightening the financial disciplines applied to company fleets, in
particular those where cars are provided primarily as 'perks'.
Nearly one in three companies is still not even monitoring the operating
costs of its car fleet, according to the current Company Secretary's Review
of Company Car schemes*. Only 54 per cent of companies surveyed kept
detailed records of the running cost of each vehicle.
As might be expected, there is a considerable difference between the
controls exercised by small companies, with their limited resources, and
large ones: 69 per cent of companies running a fleet of 100-plus vehicles
kept detailed records on each vehicle. But if the survey's findings reflect
approximately the UK picture overall - and there is no reason to suppose
that they do not - that still means that nearly one in three of these larger
companies has no proper idea of its fleet costs.
There is evidence, however, that the sector as a whole has started to become
more sensitive to fleet costs, even if in some cases its attempts to control
them have proved counter-productive. In that category, for example, comes
the retention of vehicles to an age and mileage where maintenance and repair
costs become excessive and where their unreliability potentially impairs the
effectiveness of employees.
There has been no lack of initiatives from vehicle makers to persuade
business car users to sign fresh orders. With most large continental new car
markets turning down, Ford, Rover, and General Motors through its Vauxhall
subsidiary, as well as other key players such as Peugeot, have been doing
their utmost to encourage and capitalise on faint stirrings of recovery in
the UK economy.
The UK business car sector is exceptionally important to them. Britain
rivals Germany as Europe's leading market in terms of the number of
business-funded cars on the road - more than 3m - but it outranks Germany in
terms of company car sales as a proportion of the total.
'Fleet' sales - defined as sales made to companies operating 25 cars or more
 -accounted for nearly 42 per cent of total new car sales in the UK last
year. Add on sales to smaller fleets and cars bought for business but
registered in the name of individuals, such as architects and lawyers, and
most estimates put the total at between 65 and 70 per cent.
For UK market leader Ford, even though it substantially reduced its
unprofitable sales to the big car rental companies last year, fleet sales
alone accounted for more than half its total. Two out of every three
Vauxhalls sold went to the 25-plus fleets.
Even so, after several 'false dawns' of sales recovery last year, the total
new car market reached only 1.59m units - 700,000 less than in the record
year of 1989. That was after the removal, in two stages, of the 10 per cent
Special Car Tax against which manufacturers had lobbied for more than a
decade. Against that background - with car plants on short-time working,
tens of thousands of jobs lost and the collapse of Leyland DAF and AWD in
the commercial vehicle sector - fleet managers may justly consider
themselves in a buyer's market.
Indeed, the competitive screw is about to tighten further. At the end of
last year, the first cars began emerging from Toyota's new car plant at
Burnaston, Derbyshire, and from Honda's at Swindon in Wiltshire. By the mid-
to late 1990s, these plants will be adding at least 300,000 units to UK car
output, in addition to well over 200,000 a year from Nissan's plant at
Sunderland.
All three Japanese manufacturers know that to achieve long-term success in
the UK they must establish a firm fleet presence, and have set up marketing
divisions specifically to cater to the sector. For Nissan, which last year
took over its UK distribution operations following the rupture of its ties
with Mr Octav Botnar, the efforts have already begun to bear fruit: nearly
11,000 of its sales last year were to the 25-plus fleet sector, or nearly 15
per cent of its total.
Surveys of companies' fleet policies show that what was once an entrenched
hostility by British companies towards putting Japanese-badged cars on their
fleets is now rapidly crumbling.
According to this year's Monks Partnership guide to company car policies**,
65 per cent of the 200 companies it surveyed (72 of them with Pounds
500m-plus turnover) now have Japanese cars manufactured in the UK on their
'approved' company car lists. Even cars produced in Japan or elsewhere
outside Europe are approved by 47 per cent of such companies. The figures
are only slightly less - 50 per cent and 38 per cent respectively - among
smaller companies.
Thus when the Mondeo, the medium car range replacing the Sierra, on which
Ford claims to have spent Pounds 4bn, hits the marketplace next month as its
first 'world' car, even Mr Ian McAllister, the Ford of Britain chairman,
acknowledges that the days when a new product from Ford would sweep all
before it are now over. Nevertheless, the Mondeo stands a good chance of
becoming the market leader in its sector.
However, it will be fighting for a place in the market among many more
rivals than when the Sierra was launched more than a decade ago, and rival
manufacturers will not meekly give way.
Thus there is little prospect of an end to the deep discounting that is now
endemic in the motor trade. The scope of this discounting is also apparent
in the Company Secretary's Review. Fleet managers report mean discounts of
around 15 per cent on mainstream fleet cars, and even the executive sector
'specialist' companies like BMW and Mercedes are not immune, with the survey
finding mean discounts of 5-10 per cent, depending on model.
Despite such discounts, and the seemingly contradictory lack of effective
monitoring of operating costs by many companies, all the signs are of
continuing caution by fleet managers towards new car purchases. Thus Mr
McAllister expects at best a 10 per cent recovery this year, a view shared
by most other industry leaders.
Yet there are special reasons why the outlook for the fleet sector is
uncertain. Not least, many fleet managers want to know the final form of the
revised taxation regime for company cars and their users. Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, is expected to shed more light on its detail and the timing
for its introduction in his budget speech next month. It is expected closely
to follow outline proposals unveiled late last year, and to equate taxation
levels solely to new vehicle price.
Once the detail is known, companies will have a much better idea whether the
time is appropriate, as a growing number appear to think, to offer their
employees a cash alternative to a car, thus allowing them to disengage from
the risks and complexities of running a fleet. An obstacle to such a switch
was removed last year, when the courts ruled that no VAT should be levied on
cash offered in lieu of a car - for uncertainty on that point had acted as a
brake on 'cash-for-car schemes'.
Overcoming another brake on such schemes - that surveys show a strong desire
by most employees to keep their company cars at almost any price  - is
another matter altogether.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (6): Starting point
for success - Gary Mead tries to find the secrets of a good conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THERE IS no ready-reckoner to indicate how best to fix any of the many
variables concerning a conference. How much to spend; how long it should
last; what the venue should be; how best to publicise it - all are crucial
factors in determining whether or not it will be successful, but any
conference organiser requires from a client one basic starting point.
Setting carefully defined objectives and aims to be achieved by the
conference or exhibition is an absolute prerequisite for a successful event.
According to Mr Paul Swan, managing director of event organiser Spectrum
Communications, 'there is now almost no capital city that does not have what
it terms a convention centre and many secondary capitals such as Birmingham,
Edinburgh or Glasgow, all either have or plan to have good conference
centres.'
The wide choice of international venues, with at least 10 conference centres
with excellent infrastructural support in the former west Germany alone,
means that event organisers can be spoilt for choice - and have the
opportunity for fine-tuned negotiation over not just price but other
services too.
Moreover, the line between conferences and exhibitions is blurring; it is
increasingly rare to find a conference without some sort of exhibition, and
many exhibitions are now offering associated seminars. That development has
resulted partly from the fact that the sector has suffered from the
recession.
'Absolutely loads' of companies in the industry have gone under, according
to Mr Swan. 'What has happened is that an awful lot of the smaller
organisations have gone and there is a move towards the more secure
suppliers, and they are all quite busy,' he adds. The more casual spending,
especially at the euphemistically titled 'incentive' end of the market, has
stopped, as testified by empty hotels everywhere.
'It is also tougher to win clients,' says Mr Swan, 'because there are people
who go purely on price, since their own company is in survival mode.'
The event organisers that are surviving have had to learn some essential
business lessons These include: building solid relationships with their
clients; how to understand their clients' strategic needs; taking a
long-term view to maintain quality of service; and being able to compete not
just on price but also on giving value in many different ways.
Spectrum and similar companies are investing in efforts to measure the
success of what they do, by pre and post-event measurements of retention of
the message of events.
Ms Diana Ambrose, managing director of Conference Associates and Services,
and vice-president of the International Association of Professional Congress
Organisers (Iapco), says that when it comes to selecting a conference or
exhibition organiser it is vital to 'see how long they have been in
business. Study their track record. Look at the type of events they have
organised, speak to some of their previous clients, even look at their
office structure, how it operates. There are a lot of companies that appear
and disappear. Many conferences are now being planned for two years' time
and it is vital to make sure that the organiser has the financial means to
survive.'
Choosing a venue requires careful planning. If international, then it must
be a location well-served by airlines and with adequate accommodation. If
people are paying to attend rather than being required to do so by their
company, then a line-up of attractive speakers is important.
Making sure that no-one speaks for 20 minutes is a basic rule of thumb,
since, as Ms Ambrose puts it, 'no-one says anything more in 60 minutes than
they can adequately do in half that time.' Mr Swan says that it is important
to get from the client what the purpose of the event is: 'Is this meant to
be fun? Is it meant to have very cerebral overtones, in which case we could
go to Oxford or Cambridge?
'Some time ago one of our clients had booked one of our favourite venues,
the NEC in Birmingham. Then they told us what the show was meant to achieve
and we took them instead to Paris. We are big fans of the NEC but what our
clients were trying to do in overall terms of ambience and feel was best
served by Paris, even before we found the individual hotel.
'First impressions at an event are crucial; by stepping into a luxury hotel
in Paris you create a certain feeling. For other types of events, the NEC
might be much better. It's a bit like three-dimensional noughts and crosses;
you've have got a lot of variables which need to be considered.'
Ms Vanessa Cotton of the Event Organisation Company, confirms that those
event-organising companies which are marketing-led have not only survived
the recession but actually done rather well through it. 'Corporate clients
are now looking for very visible value for money. A meeting which generates
a few hundred leads in the form of real people as part of an overall
communications campaign has got value stamped all over it, compared to
meetings which are just held because they always have been or those where
no-one has really thought about why they are doing it. People now have to
examine - and are examining - why they hold an event.'
It is therefore impossible to define a good conference in any single way.
For delegates, it must mean a satisfying experience without hassles over
poor accommodation, food, transport and service.
For those who have spent their money on holding the conference, it must lead
to new custom (if the host is a company) or a certainty that any future
conferences will maintain or increase attendance (if the host is a trade or
other association).
As with any other marketing tool, the only reason for using it is if the
response is positive. Two organisations which are able to give advice on
organising conferences are:
The Association of British Professional Conference Organisers (ABPCO); Tony
Waters (secretary), c/o 54 Church Street, Tisbury, Salisbury, Wiltshire SP3

International Association of Professional Conference Organisers (IAPCO);

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (7): A world of
locations - Venues, The choice is becoming more varied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was a time when conferences were considered an easy source of income
by hoteliers and others who found themselves with large halls or bedrooms
that would otherwise stand empty. Unwary conference bookers were faced with
unreliable service, awkwardly shaped conference rooms and ever-rising
charges.
Now, however, conference planners find an industry with high standards and
enormous capacity to fill during a recession. Customers can assume venues
will be amenable to tough negotiations on price, without withdrawing the
extras - high tech audiovisual equipment, notepads and soft drinks at each
delegate's place, hairdriers and chocolates in every room - which have come
to be expected.
The recession has made many European clients anxious to avoid the appearance
of extravagance, according to Ms Sally Greenhill, of conference production
specialists Spectrum Communications. Conferences have become shorter,
numbers smaller and locations less lavish, though high standards are still
expected for meeting rooms, equipment and service, she says.
Maturing markets also mean that demand for large conferences is levelling
off or declining in most of Europe and the US, but the small meetings sector
of the industry, encompassing training, internal management meetings and
small conferences, continues to expand.
On the other side of the world, there is still considerable room for growth
in the Asia-Pacific region's conference market. There is already a wide
choice of large venues in the region, with another ambitious conference
centre due to open in Singapore next year, but there is space for more hotel
development in some of the newly industrialised countries.
Cultural differences mean the Asian market is developing in slightly
different ways to the more established American and European markets, says
Mr Geoffrey Breeze, vice-president for corporate marketing of Hilton
International, part of Ladbroke. For example, Japanese companies tend to
hold small meetings and training programmes in-house, so clients for
Hilton's smaller meeting rooms in Japanese locations are mostly
international rather than domestic companies, a reverse of the usual
pattern.
The Australian conference industry, with ties to both western and eastern
markets, has seen rapid growth recently. In Sydney, 32 four- and five-star
hotels have opened since the Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre on
Darling Harbour began operations in 1989. But the fast rate at which new
accommodation and meeting space has come on line, combined with an economic
slowdown, has left the new hotels competing harder for business,
particularly at the international end of the market.
However, Ms Lani Sullivan, sales director of Novotel's Sydney branch, says
the Australian meetings industry has benefited from a government initiative
which requires companies to spend 1 per cent of profits on training. Demand
for small meeting rooms has soared.
The growing sophistication of British conference planners and intense
competition among meeting-space providers has led some operators to develop
niche markets, while others have reacted by broadening their range.
The De Vere hotel chain, which runs 26 four- and five-star conference
hotels, has been forced to keep prices down, but by branching out into golf
and other leisure pursuits it has raised the average spend by conference
delegates, compensating for slimmer profits on core activities.
Ms Janice Eagleson, group sales and marketing manager at De Vere, says that
as another recession-surviving measure, the group decided against taking
short cuts on quality, and risking the loss of long-standing customers.
Instead, it aimed to increase volume. This has meant pointing out
competitive rates for small meetings to clients who might normally use the
chain only for their biggest events, and cross-marketing leisure breaks to
conference guests, and conferences to single business travellers. Hotels no
longer insist on separating different categories of guest.
One company adopting the opposite approach is Hayley Enterprises, a
subsidiary of A1 Exports, the car parts group. Hayley already owned one
hotel, but saw a gap in the market for a small, business-oriented conference
venue, free from the distractions of holidaymakers and children. Sedgbrook
Hall, in 13 acres of grounds near Northampton, was the result. It opened a
year ago, after Pounds 5m had been invested in converting the Victorian
country house into meeting rooms, and building a new wing containing 60
four-star standard bedrooms, and hotel-type catering facilities.
Sedgbrook Hall's client list is drawn from the top 100 companies, according
to Mr Norman Bellone, its general manager, and the core business is training
and management meetings. In its first year the centre had a turnover of
Pounds 1.5m. 'People have got to communicate with each other, regardless of
the fact that there is a recession on. In fact, they have to communicate
with each other more,' says Mr Bellone.
He attributes Sedgbrook Hall's success to its provision of a businesslike
environment which facilitates communication and learning. For example, a
common request from companies booking rooms for training purposes is for
plentiful natural light. Specialist management centres frequently score
better on this point than hotels, which have often been designed with
evening social functions in mind.
British universities have been used for conferences for decades, but not by
most corporate conference organisers. However, Mrs Carole Formon, general
secretary of the British Universities Accommodation Consortium, says that
the recession has made companies take another look. 'If you hadn't been to a
university for 10 years, and you went back now, you would see a tremendous
difference,' she says. The 63 universities and colleges represented by the
consortium, ranging from former polytechnics to 500-year-old Oxbridge
colleges, have all made investments in upgrading facilities in recent years.
Universities still cannot compete with purpose-built conference centres and
luxury hotels when it comes to upmarket conferences for a few hundred
people, but they do well at two opposite ends of the market: high
attendance, low budget conferences, and smaller training and management
seminar type events.
What other kind of venue could provide meeting rooms, accommodation and
catering facilities for several thousand people within walking distance, at
an all-in 24 hour rate of Pounds 32? Students, as well as conference
delegates, are now accustomed to greater creature comforts, and many
universities are improving standards of student accommodation.
More universities are moving upmarket by opening year-round management
centres for meetings of up to 200 people. Whether purpose-built or converted
from country houses, the centres are usually fitted out to at least
three-star standard, with sophisticated audiovisual equipment. Unlike most
university conference facilities, availability is not limited by the
academic timetable. There are at least 30 such centres, with more due to
open this year.
Jaded conference planners, to whom all conference hotels are beginning to
look alike, might be tempted by a novel meeting package put together by
Stena Sealink, the ferry operator. It offers a one-day conference on board a
ferry plying the Harwich-Hook of Holland line. Guests go on board in the
morning, and by the time the ship sets sail at 11.30am, the conference can
be under way in the purpose-built auditorium seating up to 230.
Before disembarking next morning, delegates have the added attraction of
stocking up in the ship's duty-free shop. Rates start at Pounds 74 per
person for three meals, one night's use of an outside cabin, and conference
room hire.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (5): Marketing in the
aisles - A visitor's guide to exhibitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW DOES an avid visitor select which exhibition to attend and which to
avoid? To make sure of not being disappointed, spend a little time carrying
out adequate pre-planning and research to ascertain precisely what an
exhibition or conference offers; do not simply spin a globe in the search
for exotic locations, and beware of hyperbole.
According to Ms Vanessa Cotton, a partner in the Event Organisation Company,
one of the ways of telling whether an exhibition will be worth visiting is
good quality advance literature, 'with clear information and some real hard
facts, about who is attending and so forth. If the advance brochure is full
of pure hype, then I would say: beware. Also, look for support from other
organisations. A good exhibition is a bit like a magnet: if it's going to
deliver lots of stands, then it will generally attract support from trade
associations and journals.'
It is equally important to assess in advance what other events are going on
around the exhibition as an indication of what extra benefits can be gained.
For instance: is there a seminar programme? Are there any technical clinics?
Are there opportunities to pre-book special meetings with exhibitors? The
last is a trend which is growing in US-located exhibitions.
Ms Cotton believes that the location of a venue is not the best guide to the
quality of the exhibition: 'You can have a good exhibition in an inferior
venue and some of the most fantastic venues have in the past hosted terrible
shows. Much depends on the quality of the organiser and the organiser's
long-term commitment to the exhibition.'
Ms Diana Ambrose, vice- president of the International Association of
Professional Congress Organisers (Iapco), agrees that there are no easily
fixed rules about the best choice of venue, either for conference and
exhibition organisers or visitors: 'People call and ask how best to arrange
a venue, to which the best response is in turn to ask them 'how do you
choose your holiday?' You look at where you want to go, how much you have to
spend and what facilities you want when you get there.'
Exhibitions, perhaps even more than conferences, provide a relatively cheap
and easy means of keeping a watchful eye on new developments, as well as a
chance informally to bump into competitors and customers. Their importance
as a marketing tool is likely to grow, as advertisers become increasingly
wary of spending vast sums for no easily measured return from conventional
advertising, be it in television or press.
But the industry consensus is that there is no handy guide as to which
exhibitions to attend and which to avoid. There are criteria which visitors
would be wise to consider before attending any exhibition, which can be
summarised as the balance between the intangible gains - such as networking
with competitors, customers and suppliers - and the practical costs of
spending time away from production.
'It's at least a day out of your life, maybe more, and you may just end up
walking up and down aisles looking at inferior exhibits; nobody has really
thought building in any more opportunities for you to do business. When a
show gives you a catalogue in advance of who is going to be exhibiting, that
signals it will probably be a good show,' says Ms Cotton.
Ms Ambrose believes that it is also vital for those considering staging an
exhibition or conference to plan the objectives carefully. 'You need to
know, as an organiser, where are people coming from, how easy is it for them
to get to the venue and how many meeting rooms you want. There isn't really
a top ten list of best venues because it depends so much on what the event
is.
'People at a top management meeting may want to cloister themselves in a
luxury five-star country hotel where no-one can get to them; they have a
different set of venue criteria from an international association meeting
for 5,000 people.'
Mr Paul Swan, managing director of Spectrum Communications, suggests that an
event venue is often a combination of the pragmatic and the appealing:
'International associations tend to choose those venues that have some kind
of associated tourist appeal, and those cities which tend to be great
tourism cities also tend to be great conference cities.
'A combination of both is essential; it is vital to have the infrastructure
to support the show - you need flights from all over the world, a good range
of hotel accommodation, adequate transport around the venue itself - but you
also need lots of fun things for visitors to do after the event is over for
the day.'
Whatever the pros and cons of trudging round an exhibition, there are a
number of factors which suggest that the visitor will have an increasingly
wide range of choice. Primarily, the changing nature of marketing
communications - a continuing explosion of television, radio and other
broadcast media - plus a reluctance of companies and associations to return
to the pre-recession days of high spending on conventional advertising,
means that all forms of narrow-cast marketing (such as exhibitions) have
become more attractive.
Traders who put marketing cash into exhibitions can build a database of
visitors who, by definition, have already shown an interest in their
products and services by simply turning up to see what is on offer.
For advertisers, the media world is becoming ever more complex; in 1978 90
per cent of all US television viewing was on the three major networks; now
NBC, CBS and ABC combined have about 60 per cent. What advertising, if any,
is the missing 30 per cent now watching?
The same pattern is occurring with magazines. In the UK there were almost
4,000 consumer and business magazines in 1980; a decade later the figure was
closer to 7,000.
An exhibition can give both buyers and sellers one vital ingredient which
broadcast advertising generally fails to achieve - personal contact.
Competition will get fiercer, in all aspects of business. If anything,
exhibitions are likely to become even more attractive, with more little
extras to tempt the visitor than ever before.

of a stand / A look at the role of the organiser

MANUFACTURERS always face a challenge in selling their products, and in a
recession the challenge becomes even harder. One popular marketing method is
to exhibit at trade fairs and public showcases - but exhibiting is only half
the battle.
'At a trade fair every single one of those visitors is there for a purpose -
because it is his, or her, line of business. The visitor is already
demonstrating an interest by being at the exhibition,' says a leading
exhibitions organiser.
But there is more to exhibiting than watching visitors collect leaflets and
the business of turning visitors into sales contacts is itself big business.
There is a lively market in offering back-up services to exhibitors, from
advice on how to present a stand to following up contacts after the show is
over and helping them to achieve maximum publicity. The biggest of these
service providers is Blenheim which, in spite of the recession, saw pre-tax
profits rise 31.8 per cent to Pounds 37.3m in the 12 months to the end of
August 1992.
Blenheim organises exhibitions in the UK, US, France, Germany, Sweden,
Switzerland, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands and south-east Asia; the sectors
it covers range from clothing and textiles to information technology.
Organisers say their business has been resilient - exhibitions accounted for
an estimated 9.3 per cent of UK media spend in 1991, up from 4.7 per cent in
1981 according to the Exhibition Marketing Group, and some trade press
publications complain that the industry is draining their advertising
revenue.
'In a recession, exhibitions are one of the most cost-effective ways of
reaching customers', says one organiser.
The challenge for an exhibitor is turning visitors into customers.
Organisers say that making the visitor feel special is important - they
suggest that exhibitors give important potential customers VIP status. At
Confex, the exhibition industry's annual showcase, some visitors are given
VIP passes to the exhibition which entitles them to use a special business
lounge with refreshments.
'Exhibitions are value for money,' stresses Blenheim. 'It's the only medium
where you can have three-dimen- sional advertising - where clients can not
only see, but touch and feel the product.'
The appearance of the stand is also important, say organisers. 'It's no good
taking a huge stand if you've only got a few samples of a small product to
display,' Blenheim adds. It offers exhibitors at its shows the choice of
either taking the space only or of making use of its team of contractors and
designers to make the best of their stand.
To get the most out of the space, organisers suggest running raffles and
competitions on the stand, as well as giving away free samples of the
product and demonstrations.
Blenheim produces an exhibitors' guide with advice on everything from where
to get plants to how to arrange plumbing and lights. It runs an exhibitors'
day for most shows before the event itself, which are mostly workshop-type
sessions on the basics of exhibiting. For Confex, this includes sessions on
setting objectives for the show, building image, focusing on stand design,
choice and construction, and the importance of forward planning.
But not only the design and products are important. The professionalism of
the people staffing the stand can have a big impact on visitors. Blenheim's
guidance to exhibitors emphasises that eating and drinking on the stand
should be avoided, as should smoking and chatting with friends. Instead, it
recommends, set a goal of a certain number of sales contacts every hour;
keep an eye on the competition and make sure anything that requires
attention is dealt with immediately.
Organisers also stress the obvious: one should approach potential customers
with a friendly smile. 'To this end, it's often better to have marketing
people on a stand rather than sales people as you might expect,' says
Blenheim.
As well as potential customers, exhibitors will also be dealing with the
press, an important source of extra publicity. Blenheim produces a guide for
exhibitors on looking after the press, ranging from tips on how to write a
press release - alerting publications to news which may end up as editorial
in a publication and thus attract more visitors - to briefing someone on the
stand to deal specifically with press inquiries. A press office is also
provided at the venue, the first stop for journalists covering the show.
The media is also important before the show, organisers stress. Blenheim
says: 'It's important to come to us as soon as possible when you decide to
take a stand. Then you can tie in with things like production schedules for
magazines so as to get maximum publicity.'
To help exhibitors, Blenheim also holds a series of one-day seminars on
getting the most out of exhibitions. Such a day includes sessions on
promotion and publicity, aimed at helping exhibitors getting the maximum
exposure for their companies; as well as sessions on making the most of the
exhibition, including pre-show planning and tips for successful exhibiting.
It also may include sessions on capitalising on the event and following up
contacts made.
When the show is over, it is not just a case of packing up and going home -
organisers can also help with post-show management.
And the next event should always be on the exhibitor's mind. Blenheim runs a
database of 6m names worldwide, helping to maintain contacts with clients
and following up sales leads. 'At some exhibitions we give each stand a
light-pen, and visitors wear bar-coded badges so that when the pen reads the
code, the name and details go straight onto the database.'
After the show the organiser can put together an analysis of the event,
detailing what attracted visitors to it - for example whether they attended
because they saw an advertisement or from free tickets - helping to plan
advertising for the next show.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (3): It's time to be
more selective - Christopher Price considers whether exhibitors get good
value from their shows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

HOW effective are exhibitions? The latest industry statistics suggest that
as the recession has bitten, companies on both sides of the exhibit stand
are becoming more selective.
A recent survey by the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers (ISBA)
found that the amount spent by British companies on trade, technical and
consumer exhibitions declined from Pounds 549m to Pounds 539m in 1992, the
first fall in the 20 years the survey has been conducted.
Examples of the contraction include the oil services industry which has seen
the number of exhibitions directed at the sector fall from five to three in
the same period. The machine tool business has seen around a third less
exhibitions, according to one industry executive, while the ISBA survey
suggests expenditure on agricultural shows showed a slide of 32 per cent
last year.
However, the cutbacks are largely welcomed by exhibition industry watchers.
'In the past, British exhibition organisers have not been particularly
forthcoming with detailed information about their event,' says Mr Reg Best,
a director of ISBA. 'The result has been disappointment among both
exhibitors and delegates and ultimately in sales. Now it is the well-
organised and rewarding exhibitions that are surviving and prospering.'
Despite the downturn, companies still rate exhibitions as value for money.
The ISBA survey found that 82 per cent of its members considered it as a
cost-effective promotional medium. This echoes a similar survey by the
Exhibition Marketing Group the previous year. This found exhibitions came
second only to the trade press when considering a new product launch, with
24 per cent of those surveyed against 38 per cent preferring it, ahead of
direct mail (8 per cent), and newspapers and public relations (7 per cent
each).
But as the most effective medium for quality sales leads, trade exhibitions
came first - with 24 per cent - followed by the trade press (23 per cent),
sales reps (14 per cent) and direct mail (12 per cent). And as the best
medium for corporate image and public relations purposes, exhibitions
trailed the trade press by 24 per cent to 28 per cent.
Mr Alan Bowers, finance director of Fairline Boats, the listed boat builder,
is positive about the value of exhibitions. He says that in an industry
where it is difficult to compare homogeneous high-value products, the
exhibition situation is a good medium. 'A high proportion of our turnover is
geared to our exhibitions, with the London Boat Show still the main draw,'
he says. In addition, there are several other shows in the out-of-season
period. He estimates that around one-third of the group's marketing budget
is invested in exhibitions.
While the audience for industries like boat-building can be fairly easily
identified, other sectors are not so easily served. New technology
industries are rightly recognised by exhibition organisers as growth areas
but unfortunately these industries are prone to fail to target their
potential buyers.
Mr Derek Brown, managing director of Target Automation, an electronics
services group, says: 'We have literally dozens of potential exhibitions
that would possibly be the right ones for our products, as well as several
relevant trade magazines - but only a limited promotional budget.' A former
regular exhibitor at around a dozen UK events and two overseas, he now uses
just five and has opted to use more direct mail. 'I now know the exhibitions
I need to use,' he says.
Target's dilemma is echoed by Mr Peter Reed, marketing manager of Forster
Engineering, a Yorkshire-based precision tools maker. 'We have grown more
selective in our choice of media, and now look very carefully at the
exhibitions we go to,' he says. 'The right ones can generate very healthy
sales.'
But how do companies recognise 'the right ones'?
The ISBA says there are hopeful signs. Organisers are providing more
detailed information, particularly when pushed, although more still needs to
be done. Organisers are reluctant to be too specific over the scope of an
exhibition which might restrict attendance.
Before attending an exhibition, the association recommends the following
procedure:
1. Make sure that the exhibition is independently audited. This will ensure
that the information on the previous year's event should be accurate and
relevant.
2. Insist on an exhibitor and attendance profile.
3. Make sure the timing and the venue meet requirements.
4. If exhibiting, ensure all staff are properly trained. One of the most
common complaints concerns undertrained sales staff.
Another industry development over the past two years is that exhibitions no
longer go on for so long. The Exhibition Industry Federation estimates that
the average length of events has declined from 3.7 to 3.4 days. Exhibitors
are also hiring less stand space, so that they are not spending as much.
Average expenditure per exhibitor has fallen 15 per cent in real terms over
the past two years.
Perhaps in line with the economic situation, the more selective approach to
events is likely to accelerate before it levels off. Up to 1989, the ISBA
survey reported that all companies expected to increase their annual
exhibition expenditure. However, last year nearly 20 per cent expected to
reduce their outlay.
This year a further 10 per cent say they plan cuts. Nearly 80 per cent
expect their budgets to remain the same, an increase of 10 per cent on the
previous year.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (1): A bigger slice of
the cake - The future looks promising for a sector that should grab moreof
the marketing budgets than in the past
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MOST industries have walked through fire and ice in the current recession,
and the conferences and exhibitions business is no exception. But unlike
others, there are plausible arguments to suggest that, while uncomfortable
for those who have gone out of business, the recession has been a useful
maturing process for the surviving organisers of conferences and
exhibitions. It has thinned out those with limited ability to offer the
full-blooded support increasingly demanded by corporate management, trade
fairs and international associations.
Those that have survived - and many have - have been tempered by the
experience. They have invested in crucial information technology and
databases in advance of demand; they have pruned excessive staffing; they
have adapted to client demands to organise a conference or exhibition with
far less advance notice.
In general, the economic squeeze has sharpened up thinking in a sector which
has - with justice sometimes - been criticised for flaccidity and a failure
to match promises with achievements. After all, who has not been tempted
into attending an event by its glossy pre-launch publicity, only to discover
on the day that it was not worth the effort? If the recession has killed
that off, it will have provided a service.
It is hard to estimate the current value of the international conference and
exhibition business. Too many variables exist for definitive accuracy. The
sector covers a broad range of functions - conferences, seminars,
conventions, forums, symposiums, meetings - the list of types of function
and possible venues is almost endless.
Nevertheless, industry estimates calculate the sector may be worth Dollars
40bn annually, with Britain taking around 10 per cent of that pie. About
8,000 major international conferences are staged annually around the world,
of which 5,000 are in Europe.
The choice of venue is huge and growing, ranging from the internationally
distinguished, such as the purpose-built Queen Elizabeth II Conference
Centre in the political heart of London - where the 300-seat Mountbatten
room, secure against electronic eavesdropping, with multi-lingual
simultaneous interpretation, a splendid three-course lunch and plenty of
refreshments, will set you back Pounds 5,300 (plus value added tax) a day -
to any number of secluded country house hotels, ideal for the private small
company annual general meeting.
Because the conferences and exhibitions industry crosses so many boundaries
 -hotels, leisure centres, large publicly quoted groups such as Blenheim to
small organisers working from a spare bedroom - it is almost impossible to
establish how many involved in the sector have gone under as a result of the
recession. Certainly, the length of many conferences is now shorter,
attendances are down and advance bookings happen later.
But the blows have largely been taken in the corporate sector; companies
have chosen to spend less on customer-oriented conferences, more on
internal, staff-aimed sales and training conferences. Conferences involving
international associations have been less badly affected, since they are
normally required by their own statutes to stage regular conferences.
The recession has not had a blanket, homogeneous effect; in the case of new
product launches companies are, if anything, boosting their spending on
conferences and exhibitions. Vauxhall, part of General Motors, will have
spent well in excess of Pounds 1m on a five-stage event between February and
June in the UK, launching a new model, the Corsa, via Spectrum
Communications.
The future, nevertheless, looks promising for this sector, not just because
the companies involved in it are themselves given to relentlessly
self-promoting optimism, but because the nature of marketing communications
is shifting, in ways which favour this sector grabbing a larger share of
marketing budgets than in the past.
Vauxhall, for example, will achieve the following in its Corsa launch for a
relatively small marketing spend: 16 simultaneous exclusive dinners for
dealer principals and their partners; four regional launch venues for dealer
principals, their staff, guests and local business users; a multitude of
hands-on nationwide training sessions for sales managers and their staff;
other launch events at points of sale; and a driving evaluation event at
which dealers and guests can try out the new product range.
Naturally, Vauxhall will also spend heavily on conventional television and
press advertising, but the most cost-effective marketing for its new product
may well be the relatively hidden expenditure, closely targeted on
salesforces and key business customers.
Perhaps the single most important trend within marketing at the moment is
the shift away from broadcast to narrow cast means of reaching out to
customers. Exhibitions and conferences, if properly organised and
publicised, provide a relatively cheap and certain way of creating a
relationship between seller and buyer.
Exhibitions doubled their share of marketing spend between 1981 and 1991,
from 4.7 to 9.3 per cent, while television advertising stood still (from 26
to 26.2 per cent) and national newspapers' share shrunk (from 16.9 to 14.8
per cent). The exhibition sector's growth averaged 18.4 per cent a year over
that decade.
Venues are doing much to provide not just crude value-for-money, but added
extras to entice organisers.
Ms Gill Price, commercial director of the QEII conference centre, says: 'One
potential exhibitor was interested in knowing if it would be possible to
organise an internal television relay of the forthcoming Wimbledon tennis
men's singles' final this coming summer, so that those who would be setting
up his exhibition at the centre would be able to watch the match as they
worked. Being able to provide such extras is increasingly important if you
want to get the business.'
Hotel chains are now actively marketing themselves as conference venues as
well as tourist destinations. Inter-Continental Hotels offers a 'European
Meetings Portfolio' guaranteeing a daily delegate rate fixed until March 31
1994 and a complimentary room for every 15 booked, across 40 European
locations.
Conference centres are looking at how to make their venues more attractive.
For instance, the NEC at Birmingham intends to erect an entertainment
village the size of Wembley football pitch to go alongside Ipex '93, the
September 7-15 trade show for the print and graphics industry. The village,
set up by the exhibition company Button Eventures, part of Reed
International, is based on an idea which has evolved at Cannes media
festivals over the years.
In a commercial world increasingly cluttered by marketing developments and
daily more confused by technological developments in broadcast media and
database manipulation, there is probably only one certainty: it will become
more difficult to get the attention of customers. Given that, the conference
and exhibition business has a head start against other sectors of marketing
communications.
As the explosion in broadcast media continues, marketing professionals
involved in narrow cast, close targeting exercises should be able to take
advantage of a situation where finance directors have learnt to ask of
marketing departments: 'What am I getting for my expenditure?'
Certainly, for business-to-business marketing, it increasingly makes less
sense to lavish fortunes on the high-cost, little obvious return involved in
using broadcast media. If you want to speak to your customers, build a
database and use that to make the customers whom you already have feel
important. And from the profile of existing customers it is possible to
identify and target likely others.
That is precisely what conferences and exhibitions can offer. And for
organisers of conferences and exhibitions one trend stands out; the sheer
number of available venues means that would-be organisers of events should
be able, even when the recession lifts, to demand the very best in extra
facilities, if not the very lowest in prices.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (2): How a speech
poisoned the atmosphere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYONE who has spoken at a conference remembers the disasters.
The one lodged in my memory is being hustled out of a hotel rear entrance to
avoid being attacked by aggrieved supermarket managers.
Having discussed speech-making with Ms Cristina Stuart, managing director of
Speakeasy, who teaches people how to address meetings, I think I know now
why my mishap occurred. I was in too much of a hurry.
The supermarket managers' conference was an angry occasion even before I got
there. It was a time when hardly a week went by without a food poisoning
scare. Mrs Edwina Currie had just resigned from the UK government over her
remarks about salmonella and eggs. The supermarket managers felt besieged
and misunderstood. They had no doubt who was to blame for inflaming the
situation: the press.
Asked to speak about the press and food retailers, I arrived just a few
minutes before my alloted starting time. Had I known how aggrieved the
meeting already was, I might have started off by acknowledging that the
supermarkets' job was a difficult one. I might have conceded that public
expect- ations were, to some degree, unrealistic, driven by a desire for
preservative-free food which lasts forever, before pointing out that press
interest in the subject was good and proper in a democratic society.
Instead of which, I launched straight into a defence of newspapers'
screaming- headline treatment of salmonella and other issues, pointing out
that journalists had families just like everyone else and did not want to
see them poisoned.
I looked out at rows of set, sullen faces, but it was too late to change
tack. When I finally sat down, the nervous chair- woman asked for any
questions, thanked me for coming before anyone had a chance to raise a hand,
told the assembled throng that tea was waiting outside the conference hall,
offered me none, and showed me the way out.
It is, says, Ms Stuart, a good idea to arrive at the conference venue early,
stand up on the stage, look out at the empty seats and imagine them filled.
The more you feel at ease, the more naturally you will speak. And she could
have added, if you sit and listen to the speeches before your turn comes,
you will have a chance to assess the nature and mood of your audience and
have a better idea of how to get your message across.
At least the supermarket managers were sufficiently angry to pay attention.
The problem with most conference speeches is that hardly anyone listens to
them. This is not because the acoustics are poor but because most conference
audiences spend their day in a semi-comatose state.
I have never entirely understood why this should be so. Some conference
speakers are dull, but even the mildly interesting ones manage to lose their
audiences after the first few sentences.
Mr Lee Bowman, chairman of the Kingstree Group, which also teaches people
how to speak in public, says the reason conference audiences fall asleep is
that nothing is expected of them.
In everyday conversation, the person doing the speaking does not set the
pace; it is the person being addressed who determines how quickly the
speaker talks, when he or she pauses, speeds up, slows down, goes back to
explain and so on. If we are talking to someone, they tell us by nodding
that they have understood, by looking puzzled that they have not, by
appearing bored that we should get a move on.
The larger the group, the more diffuse these signals. And at most
conferences the speaker has no idea at all what the audience thinks because
the lights are dimmed. The darkness is a signal to the audience that no-one
is going to disturb their peace. They are not going to be asked to
participate. If they thought they were, their interest would be unflagging.
Anyone who has been to a live performance by Dame Edna Everage, the cross-
dressing Australian raconteur, recalls the fear of having questions directed
at them and the schadenfreude when she picks on someone else.
Ms Stuart tries to involve her audiences whenever she can. For the novice
speaker, there is the danger of losing one's thread and not being able to
find it again. But an audience asked to contribute seldom sleeps.
The other soporific factor at conferences is the slide show. No conference
speaker arrives these days without a large selection of slides. The first
one might show the speaker's company logo. Subsequent ones might show an
entire balance sheet or a statement encapsulating the company's strategy:
Target the Ketchup-Flavoured Yoghurt-Eating Sector.
Slides seldom leave any impression. The only mildly entertaining feature of
a conference slide show is when one appears upside-down.
The problem with 'visual aids' is that while watching them the audience is
not listening to the speaker. You cannot look and listen at the same time.
Ms Stuart likens it to trying to read the newspaper while listening to the
radio. Neither makes much impression.
The experts advise selective use of visual aids. For most of the speech, the
screen should be blank. When something does appear on the screen, the
speaker should pause, allowing the audience to take in the image. The slide
itself should be memorable; a cartoon makes a bigger impression than a set
of figures, or a screen filled with words.
The most important barrier to audience attention is that the speaker's
personality does not come through. Most speakers are too nervous. They speak
too quickly. Many have written out every word of their speech, which they
then proceed to read.
There is a vast difference, however, between the written and spoken word.
Most written speeches sound tedious when read aloud.
Mr Bowman says speakers should try to treat their speeches as enlarged
conversations. If you have a prepared text, depart from it, adding personal
asides and reminiscences. Your audience will appreciate it, even if the
note-taking journalists do not.

FT  22 FEB 93 / A flawed drive for fairness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I was among the first to criticise Lord (then Mr Nigel) Lawson's 1988 Budget
which sharply cut British top rates of tax. So I should be madly applauding
President Bill Clinton's 'soak the rich' economic package. Yet the crude
emphasis on fairness - the selling of the plan as virtuous simply because
the affluent are bearing most of the burden - leaves me cold. It is a bit of
a cheek coming from Mr Clinton's elite economic team, many of whom got very
rich during the now-despised 1980s.
Mr Clinton is demanding that the top 2 per cent of families - those with
incomes of Dollars 200,000 or more - finance nearly 60 per cent of the total
tax increase, which means increases averaging nearly Dollars 15,000 a year.
The rest of the top 10 per cent face much lower but still stiff increases.
The bottom 90 per cent is barely touched, with increases ranging from nil
for families with incomes less than Dollars 30,000 to a few hundred dollars
for the near-affluent.
The president is proving a marvellous salesman. Yet his cosy sessions with
schoolchildren are beginning to get irritating. He projects the image of the
'philosopher king' who knows everything, yet his depiction of the 'greedy'
1980s is decidedly one-dimensional.
Mr Clinton argues that the sharp drop in top income tax rates - from 70 per
cent to 28 per cent - was a boon for the wealthy. What he fails to mention
is that the rate paid on the last dollar of income bears little relation to
the overall tax burden.
The point about the tax reforms of the 1980s is that they balanced cuts in
tax rates (which affect people's incentive to work or save) with
restrictions on the loopholes and special concessions that favoured the
wealthy.
The upshot was little change in 'effective tax rates' - the ratio of all
federal taxes (including social security contributions) to incomes. The
poorest 20 per cent of families paid 8.5 per cent of their incomes in tax in
1991 compared with 8.4 per cent in 1980; the richest 20 per cent paid 26.8
per cent rather than 27.3 per cent. The very affluent did gain: the
effective rate on the top 1 per cent fell to 28.9 per cent against 31.8 per
cent in 1980, but the decline was modest relative to the plunge in the top
marginal rate. The stability of effective rates reflected Democratic control
of Congress.
The contribution of affluent families to total revenues actually rose
substantially during the 1980s because their share of national pre-tax
income rose sharply, more than compensating for the minor decline in their
effective tax rates. The shift in pre-tax income shares partly reflected
underlying trends such as a decline in the relative pay of unskilled workers
but a behaviourial response to lower tax rates was also a factor.
As Mr Clinton will shortly discover, the affluent have great discretion over
how much income they chose to declare; if rates are high they may, for
example, take pay in the form of untaxed fringe benefits. They can also
choose how long and hard to work; if rates go up, the golf course becomes
relatively more alluring. However distasteful it may seem, the big decline
in top tax rates in the 1980s squeezed more, rather than less, tax dollars
from the very rich.
Inequality statistics are not straightforward. The average income of the
bottom 20 per cent has undeniably fallen in recent years. But the families
falling into this category constantly change.
The Urban Institute, a Washington thinktank, tracked families that formed
the bottom 20 per cent in 1977. Surprisingly their incomes had risen 77 per
cent by 1986, reflecting the fact that nearly half had moved into higher
income groups. The incomes of families in the top 20 per cent in 1977 rose
only 5 per cent - half had dropped into lower income brackets over the same
period. This mobility is not surprising: for example, when students leave
college they move into higher income brackets whereas when senior executives
retire they move down a few notches.
Taxes should be related to people's ability to pay. But the practicality of
trying to raise so much revenue from the top 2 per cent is questionable,
especially when the technique employed is a sharp increase in the top
marginal rate from 31 per cent to about 45 per cent, allowing for the
'millionaire's surcharge' (which applies to taxable incomes over Dollars
250,000), the lifting of caps on Medicare taxes and other changes. An
attempt to broaden the tax base by eliminating perks, such as the
deductibility of up to Dollars 1m in mortgage interest, would have made more
economic sense.
The affluent have never paid particularly high effective rates of tax, if
only because they can afford the best legal advice. Historically, high top
rates were mainly a cover for lower, but substantial, tax increases on more
numerous middle income families. But Mr Clinton has blown this opportunity;
he is demanding so little from middle income groups that he lacks the
resources both to increase public investment and decisively reduce the
budget deficit, which is expected to be still nearly 3 per cent of national
income in 1997. If, as is likely, revenues from the affluent prove
disappointing, his 'fairness' drive will have been entirely in vain.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The most significant fact about President Clinton's state of the union
address is what it did not say. We all know it was mainly devoted to a
detailed economic programme for tackling the budget deficit; some people
even think the programme looks plausible. What has been less noticed is that
this economic programme was almost the only subject in the speech. There was
virtually no reference to the international scene, and certainly nothing to
suggest that President Clinton has a foreign policy, or even feels the need
of one.
This would be consistent with Mr Clinton's campaign rhetoric, but it is a
remarkable break with tradition.
It is instructive to glance back at Mr Clinton's predecessors, and at what
each of them said in his first state of the union speech. It turns out that
almost all of them, going back as far as the second world war, devoted
considerable time to foreign policy. As you would expect, George Bush went
on at length about the international scene - Panama, Poland, East Germany,
and the European allies. Ronald Reagan expatiated on nuclear arms control
with the Soviet Union, Star Wars, Nicaragua and Afghanistan, not to mention
the European allies.
Jimmy Carter talked about a new international order, human rights, nuclear
arms control, Middle East, Poland, and the European allies. Gerald Ford
delivered a long section on international relations, including communist
countries, nuclear arms control, the developing world, and the European
allies. Richard Nixon spoke of the Vietnam War, the Soviet Union, nuclear
arms control and the European allies. President Johnson talked about
disarmament, east-west relations, and the European allies. John Kennedy
spoke of Vietnam, the Congo, the Soviet Union and China, and the European
allies. President Eisenhower talked of defence, the Korean War, and the
European allies.
President Clinton's was quite different. In two brief paragraphs he makes
perfunctory nods in the direction of the generalities of America's
traditional aspirations as a great power; but the passage contains not a
single specific. The US needs a restructured defence to deal with new
threats of the post-cold war world; the US has responsibilities as the
world's only superpower; the US must be prepared to lead a world challenged
by ethnic conflict, by proliferation of weapons, by the global environment.
But there is no hint of what are the real foreign policy objectives of the
new administration. Nor is there any mention of a single foreign country by
name. In particular, there is no reference, direct or indirect, to the
European allies.
To find a general US policy declaration which is as domestic as this, you
have to go back to Harry Truman in 1945. There may be a reason for the
similarity. Truman was bringing the boys home from a world war; Clinton has
probably grasped, and welcomed, the implications of the end of the cold war.
Foreign policy is expensive. In wartime it is an essential ingredient of
government. But in peacetime you do not need so much of it.
The optional characteristic of foreign policy in peacetime is particularly
applicable to the US, because it is now virtually invulnerable to
aggression. During the cold war America was in permanent danger because of
the nuclear confrontation in Europe. Today that threat has almost vanished.
America's European allies face new and serious risks of conflict, including
those in the former Yugoslavia and the disintegrating Russian empire. But
these risks need not affect the US, unless the US chooses; and if Mr Clinton
has his way, the US will not choose.
Some will object that the actions of the new administration already belie
its words. President Clinton may prefer to stay at home; but in practice he
has been goaded willy-nilly into taking the leadership of the Euro-UN peace
process for Bosnia. The world needs America to lead, so President Clinton is
obliged to do his duty.
The world is being taken in by a public relations exercise. True, President
Clinton could not categorically turn down the pressing pleas of the
Owen-Vance mediators; but he agreed to take part only on terms which
virtually guarantee to stalemate the peace process.
When the US says it might, after all, be prepared to use force in Bosnia,
the world is impressed and relieved. The small print tells a different
story. The US will use force only to back up an agreement, but no such
agreement is in sight. The US will support a peace plan, but not the
Vance-Owen peace plan. Yet Vance-Owen set the agenda for all other plans.
Vance-Owen would require the Serbs to surrender much of the territory they
have captured. Any different plan should in justice require them to
surrender even more. But Washington's first step has been to submit the
Bosnia peace process to the Russians, who are Serbia's most powerful allies.
In short, the Washington shift probably reduces the (already minimal) chance
that the peace process could lead to an agreement which might be enforced.
What we have instead is US 'leadership', because that is what the rest of
the world demands, but it is the kind of leadership which is designed to
lead nowhere.
Europe will have cause to reflect that it does not rate a mention in
President Clinton's first state of the union speech. Already under Bush it
was clear that the US did not intend to take responsibility for Europe's new
disorders, let alone for the peaceful reconstruction of the ex-Soviet
empire. We may now need to come to terms with the idea that Mr Clinton
really does intend to put the US economy first, second and third.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Monday Interview: Mogul with the most - American
entrepreneur David Geffen talks to Alan Friedman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is the definition of a renaissance man in 1990s America?
If the criteria were to include an extraordinary business acumen which
ranges from founding and selling a company for half a billion dollars to
making shrewd investments in commercial property, stocks and bonds -
combined with a passion for the worlds of both modern art and national
politics, and the ability to produce hit movies, records and Broadway shows
 -then David Geffen might just fit the bill.
The 50-year-old Mr Geffen made his first Dollars 1m in 1969 in the record
business, and went on to reap more than Dollars 700m of cash profits when he
sold his shareholding in the November 1990 takeover of the MCA/ Universal
entertainment group by Matsushita of Japan.
He has invested much of his money on Wall Street, effectively becoming
Hollywood's version of Mr Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor who
figured prominently in the rebuilding of Salomon Brothers last year.
Mr Geffen is one of the wealthiest entrepreneurs in the US, a consummate
telephone schmoozer who moves almost effortlessly across sectors too
disparate for most self-made men with net worths of more than Dollars 1bn.
Mr Geffen, whose preferred dress is a white T-shirt, jeans and tennis shoes,
operates from a comfortable third floor office notable for its L-shaped
sofa, absence of a desk and westward view along Hollywood's Sunset
Boulevard. He spends an hour each day working out at one of the gyms he has
installed in his houses on the beach at Malibu and New York's Fifth Avenue
and in his Beverly Hills mansion.
'I am being what I want to be every day,' he declares, clearly irritated by
Hollywood speculation about what business venture he will next undertake.
Amid the back-stabbing politics of Tinsel Town, Mr Geffen is one of the few
individuals who garners nearly universal praise from studio heads and stars
alike. The word most often used to describe him is 'smart'.
It is an adjective that might also be used to describe the handful of close
friends who for years have chatted on the telephone with Mr Geffen almost
daily. This inner circle includes Mr Barry Diller, the former chairman of
Twentieth Century Fox; Mr Felix Rohatyn of Lazard Freres; Mr Jeffrey
Katzenberg, who runs the Disney studio, and Mr Allen Grubman, the leading
entertainment lawyer in America.
For Mr Geffen, contacts are everything. 'His Rolodex has few rivals, in this
town or anywhere,' observes the chairman of a big Hollywood studio. 'He is
very tough in business, very direct. He is like a laser beam,' says an old
friend who prefers not to be named.
Mr Geffen was not born to wealth. He grew in Brooklyn, the son of the
enterprising Mrs Batya Geffen, who supported the family by designing corsets
and brassieres and eventually became a landlord. The academic life was not
for the young David Geffen, who dropped out of university and in 1964 went
to work in the mailroom of the William Morris talent agency, where he met
his friend Barry Diller.
By the late 1960s he discovered Laura Nyro, the folk singer. Acting as her
manager and producer, he launched her career and made more than Dollars 1m.
It was then a short hop to his successful backing of Linda Ronstadt, The
Eagles, Joni Mitchell and many more stars.
In 1972 he sold his record label to Mr Steve Ross, the founder of Warner
Communications. Mr Ross named Mr Geffen vice-chairman of Warner Brothers,
the group's Hollywood studio, in 1975, but he was not comfortable in a
corporate structure and soon left. A year later, when he was diagnosed as
having cancer, he dropped out of the business world, only to return in 1980
when the cancer scare proved to have been a false alarm.
It was the founding of Geffen Records in 1980 that created an asset so
valuable that it fetched Dollars 545m in stock when Geffen sold it to MCA a
decade later. Eight months after that deal, at the end of 1990, MCA itself
was sold, netting Mr Geffen Dollars 710m in cash.
Mr Geffen's activities since the MCA deal have been increasingly
diversified. The one area he has rarely discussed, however, is his
investment portfolio - and Wall Street. The portfolio now totals more than
Dollars 750m.
'As an investor I have been averaging a 25 to 30 per cent annualised return
since 1990,' he says. 'At first I was doing it with high-yield instruments,
but in the past 12 months many of the bonds have been redeemed by the
issuers, and I have transferred about Dollars 400m into equities.'
Over the past year Mr Geffen has bought big share stakes in companies such
as Wells Fargo, the California bank whose stock has jumped by more than 50
per cent; American Express, of which the share price rose substantially
after the resignation of Mr James Robinson, its chairman; and RJR Nabisco,
the food and tobacco group.
Mr Geffen considers it 'a good thing' that institutional investors are
taking a more active role in shaking up the top managements of US companies
such as IBM, General Motors and American Express. He also reckons that 'a
great number of companies are trading at very reasonable prices', and says
there are now 'tremendous opportunities in the equities market'.
In 1991 Mr Geffen showed Wall Street he was prepared to be a big-time
corporate player when he teamed up with Bechtel Investments and Mr Richard
Rainwater, the Texas investor, to make a Dollars 3bn bid for Executive Life,
the failed insurance group. The bid was not accepted but Mr Geffen went on
last year to help out his old friend Mr Calvin Klein, the fashion designer,
buying a total of Dollars 61m of Klein's junk bonds for an estimated 50 to
60 cents on the dollar. 'Those bonds will be retired by the end of February
and replaced with bank debt that has a much lower interest cost,' Mr Geffen
discloses, although he will not reveal the substantial capital gain he is
expected to make on them.
Paper profits are also likely for Mr Geffen in the art world. He says that
over the past couple of years he has spent more than Dollars 50m buying the
works of masters from the abstract expressionist era to early 1960s pop art.
'I don't think of it as an investment, but as a pleasure.' None the less he
also reckons the art market will have turned around within the next year or
so.
The other new focus of Mr Geffen's life is politics. An ardent supporter of
Bill Clinton, Mr Geffen contributed more than Dollars 150,000 to the
Democratic party last year. He was also among those at Mr Clinton's economic
summit in Little Rock last autumn. 'I found it very valuable. Both Bill and
Hillary Clinton are very impressive and there is every reason to expect that
a lot will happen in Washington that is valuable for this country.'
Mr Geffen has not merely supported the new US president; he has also
expanded his private foundation and has been giving away Dollars 5m to
Dollars 8m each year to such causes as abortion rights, homelessness and
Aids research. He donates to the foundation all his personal earnings from
managing the record business now owned by MCA, the movies he makes and the
Broadway shows he backs.
Mr Geffen has also broken new ground in Hollywood by publicly announcing his
homosexuality. Last November 18, with 6,000 people packed into a Hollywood
amphitheatre for a concert that raised Dollars 4m for Aids research, Mr
Geffen was honoured for his contribution. Yes, he says, 'there was a time in
my life when I would have been uncomfortable getting up in front of 6,000
people and acknowledging I was gay. But this was intentional.'
The only subject that makes Mr Geffen bristle is the way his Hollywood peers
gossip about his next big deal. His response is direct: 'I am running a
record company, a big investment portfolio; I am financing Broadway shows
and making movies such as the new production of M Butterfly with Jeremy
Irons; and I am working with my foundation. Some people might think of that
as enough activity.'

FT  22 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on the Yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERN over the Yen ahead of Saturday's meeting of the Group of Seven
finance ministers and central bank governors is expected to be one of the
focal points for financial markets this week, writes Peter John.
The conference will be the first of the G7 policymakers since President
Clinton took office on January 20. It is expected to examine ways to help
the world economy and particularly to rein in Japan's soaring trade surplus.
Press meetings given by the Japanese finance and economic planning ministers
on Tuesday and Friday will offer clues to the path the G7 meeting will take.
The fall in German M3 money supply announced on Friday and comments by Mr
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, are also likely to act as financial
market motors.
Most economists have seen Germany's 2.3 per cent contraction in money supply
as a technical correction - the result of rebasing the figures on the fourth
quarter of last year when there was an unusually heavy level of
intervention. However, some still argue that it augurs well for an easing of
monetary policy some time after the next Bundesbank meeting on March 4.
On the other hand the comments made in Mr Greenspan's testimony to Congress
signalled a tightening of monetary policy. At the very least it removed the
possibility of easing rates, a threat which has hit the US currency in the
past week.
Mr David Deakin, the economist for Nikko Bank says: 'If German rates are
likely to fall and if the American rates are less likely to fall the
dollar/D-Mark is likely to rise.'
Meanwhile, the market will continue to watch the performance of the Spanish
peseta and the Swedish Krona which have been propped up by intervention from
their respective central banks.
In the UK, money is expected to be tighter this week as a result of a large
amount of short-term loans expiring and needing to be rolled over.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Risk and Reward: UK equity options trading fails to find its
stride
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EQUITY options trading in Germany has surged in the last few years, despite
the relatively low level of stock investment in Germany. But the UK equity
options market has still failed to take off, even though UK fund managers
are heavily invested in stocks. Preconceptions that an active stock market
is a prerequisite for a healthy options market seem to be wrong.
A year after the merger of London's futures and options exchanges, amid
hopes that the union would revive trading in UK stock options, the best that
can be said is that volume has stabilised.
Trading in individual stock options had been falling steadily since 1987,
when retail investors were scared off by the stock market crash. But UK fund
managers have not been willing converts, despite marketing efforts by the
London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe).
Liffe's difficulties are part of a broader trend: US-based exchanges - from
a far stronger base - have suffered declining volume in stock option
business, as retail investors deserted their markets.
But Germany's Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), has bucked the trend. In 1992, the
DTB traded 14m Dax option contracts and 10m individual stock options,
compared with 3m FT-SE options and 4.5m individual equity options on Liffe.
There are a number of factors involved.
First of all, the smaller number of large German companies may actually have
proved an advantage, rather than a disadvantage. Liffe lists 66 UK stock
options, while the DTB lists only 15, concentrating on the relatively small
group of blue-chip German companies.
Mr Roger Barton, head of product development, said that Liffe is considering
reducing the number of options, but the problem is that liquidity tends to
shift, so that an option on one stock may be very quiet for as much as a
year, and then suddenly spring to life.
Many options specialists believe that the DTB's screen-based trading system
is better suited to options that Liffe's open-outcry market, since it is
easier to trade a variety of similar products - in this case, different
series of options - on a screen.
Liffe's APT screen-trading system is being developed to handle options, but
the board has yet to decide whether to go ahead with screen-based trading.
The systems capability is expected to be ready by the end of the year.
Many options traders also argue that the rules governing the UK stock market
are a severe handicap to dealing in stock options. The delay in reporting
large equity trades gives the main equity marketmakers an unfair advantage,
and forces options marketmakers to make prices on an uneven playing field,
they argue.
Another advantage for the DTB is that there are tax benefits involved:
foreign investors can avoid paying capital gains tax on German share
dividends by using the options market.
But, given the potential revenues available, many analysts are surprised
that more UK fund managers do not write call options. Writing, or selling,
call options involves agreeing to sell an equity at a pre-set 'strike'
price: an extremely dangerous practice for investors who are not covered.
But for fund managers, holding huge portfolios of shares, it is a relatively
attractive method of earning money and boosting performance.
But even if more fund managers started to write options, there is still a
lack of business on the other side of the equation, hence Liffe's desire to
promote equity options among retail investors, who often buy options as a
means of obtaining exposure to a stock for a limited outlay.
The other hope is that the development of a more active over-the-counter
market in equity derivatives, which many banks are actively pursuing, would
feed through into the exchange-traded market as banks seek to manage their
exposure. But business in that area too, seems to have stalled.

FT  22 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Borrowers turn attention to global
offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONCEPT of global bond offerings is catching the attention of a growing
range of borrowers. Last week, the Kingdom of Sweden, the World Bank and the
Canadian Province of Quebec all launched large global bonds.
The process of offering bonds simultaneously in the US, Europe and the Far
East allows borrowers to raise larger sums and to place paper at the best
possible price. Not surprisingly, borrowers are eyeing the mechanism
closely, but it does have some limitations.
The concept was pioneered by the World Bank, which launched a Dollars 1.5bn
issue in September 1989. Last week's Y200bn global bond issue was its tenth,
and it plans to launch the first D-Mark global offering later this year.
Mr Kenneth Lay, director of financial operations, says that one of the main
motives was to achieve a single world price for its bonds.
This has resulted in what the World Bank regards as a more accurate
valuation of its bonds, thereby increasing investor confidence in the
pricing of the paper.
Prior to the start of its global programme, there was often a yield
differential of 10 to 20 basis points between World Bank Eurobonds and bonds
placed in the US market. In practice, all triple-A credits are not the same:
European investors were willing to pay a higher premium for World Bank paper
than US investors. Under the global programme, the knowledge that there
would be a strong bid for the paper in Europe helped increase US investors'
confidence.
But there are other differences between US and European investors. European
investors are heavily influenced by their views on the currency outlook,
buying dollar bonds aggressively when the dollar looks set to rise. Japanese
investors take a similar approach, but the timing is different, since there
are occasions when, for example, the dollar is weak against the yen but firm
against European currencies. US investors on the other hand are blind to
such considerations.
So far, there have been global offerings in dollars, Canadian dollars, and
yen. Global bonds denominated in D-Marks and French francs are expected this
year.
That experiment may be less successful. Although both currencies are
increasingly widely traded internationally, US fund managers are still far
more averse to currency risk than their European counterparts. US bankers
are sceptical about how well the structure would function, given that most
US fund managers still want to buy only dollar bonds.
So far only two corporate borrowers, Matsushita Electric Industrial of Japan
and Ford Motor Credit of the US, have issued global bonds, and the scope for
more global corporate bonds appears limited. Few companies need to borrow
sums of Dollars 1bn or more in one go.
Further, differences in credit perception between corporates from different
countries are more difficult to overcome. For example, Ford's recent global
offering was mostly placed in the US, where Ford paper trades far tighter
than in Europe.
The greater familiarity of investors with domestic companies is likely to
mean that the advantages of global bond offerings for companies are more
limited: when a single-A rated UK company launches a long-dated sterling
bond, it is likely to be placed with a small base of domestic investors,
even if it were to be packaged as a global offering.
The global bond market is less a single market, than the linking of a number
of different markets, to the benefit of both investors and borrowers.
Global bonds combine the features of US bonds and Eurobonds. The borrower
has to register its intended offering with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) and get its prospectus approved by the SEC, as for a US
domestic bond.
But global bonds have the same fee structure as for Eurobonds, which is
cheaper than the US market.
Efficient distribution and settlement between markets in different parts of
the world have considerably reduced price spreads because the bonds can flow
to areas of greatest demand.
Secondary trading in global bonds is facilitated by the formal bridge
between the Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the US and the European
clearing houses, Euroclear and Cedel. The Bank of Tokyo operates a book
entry register for yen global bonds, and depositary and custodial links are
established between Euroclear, Cedel and DTC to enable the transfer of those
bonds against payment.
'The bonds can therefore be settled freely in each market,' says Mr Charles
Berman, director in the capital markets group at Salomon Brothers in London.

FT  22 FEB 93 / UK Gilts: Economic indicators point to long-end gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE long end of the gilt market made further gains last week, due to more
settled news on inflation and a slight easing of fears about the public
sector borrowing requirement (PSBR).
Gilt investors were cheered by news of yet a further slowing in the
year-on-year rate of increase in average earnings. This came down to 4.75
per cent in December, from 5 per cent in November, and represents the
smallest rise in 25 years.
There was also some optimism that a higher-than-expected Pounds 3.83bn
surplus in government finances in January might indicate a slight easing in
the pressures on the PSBR.
While long-dated gilts slipped in yield by about 20 basis points over the
week, prices at the short end stayed virtually the same, with little to
suggest any immediate cut in bank base rates.
Friday's first report by the Treasury's panel of outside economic advisers
provided a tonic for the gilt market in one respect, in its espousal of the
abandonment of the full-funding rule for financing the PSBR.
Such a step - which is being examined by the Treasury before the March 16
budget - would mean purchases of gilts by banks and building societies would
count towards financing the deficit, expected to be about Pounds 37bn this
financial year and nearly Pounds 50bn in 1993-1994.
The move has been advocated for months by many gilt specialists on the
grounds that the action would reduce the amount of issues required over the
next few years. As a result it might pull down long-dated gilt yields.
The report from the seven-strong panel was generally gloomy about the UK's
short-term economic outlook, putting likely growth this year at just over 1
per cent. It said there was uncertainty about whether a significant recovery
would take place, while underlying inflation this year is likely to stay
within the 1 to 4 per cent target range set by the Treasury.
Further good news on inflation came from labour market data which underlined
the firm downward pressure on wage settlements. The year-on-year rise in the
index of underlying earnings across the economy has now come down in every
month since June when it was 6.25 per cent.
With all the signs being that the government will probably stick to its
target of keeping rises in public sector wages at 1.5 per cent or less, the
prospect of further falls in wage inflation in the months ahead look
reasonably good. Even so, this may not necessarily feed into the headline
inflation rate.
According to the Treasury's economic advisory panel, inflation as measured
by the year-on-year increase in the retail prices index will rise from 1.7
per cent last month to 2.6 per cent by the end of this year and 3.6 per cent
by the end of 1994.
Few analysts, however, are getting too excited about any build-up of cost
pressures which may be in the pipeline. Most economic statistics continue to
indicate fairly stagnant demand. The latest retail sales data did show a
better than expected 1.6 per cent rise in sales volumes in January compared
with December.
But much of this was a rebound from a poor Christmas period. In the three
months to the end of January, sales volumes were up a modest 0.2 per cent
compared with the previous three months, significantly less than the
quarterly rises in the middle of last year.
On the PSBR, the large surplus in January - the first for a year - is likely
to be countered by big deficits this month and in March as technical changes
related to the collection of tax revenues work their way into the figures.
However, the publication of the January number diverted many gilt
practitioners from the extremely large forecasts for the PSBR for the
1992-1993 financial year which have been published by some in the City in
recent weeks.
On the back of the January number, Mr Chris Anthony, an economist at the
normally extremely bearish UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, says he thinks the PSBR for
the year will come out at Pounds 35bn, Pounds 2bn less than the prediction
made by the Treasury last November.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Canadian Bonds: Passionate embrace fosters flood of issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENTS with hefty borrowing requirements and investors looking for
decent yields at low risk are embracing each other with a passion in the
Canadian bond market.
International and domestic issues by all levels of government in Canada have
exploded recently. Borrowings in January exceeded CDollars 10bn.
Last week alone, Quebec raised CDollars 1.4bn through its first global issue
and Manitoba tapped the Yankee market for USDollars 300m. At home, the
federal government priced a CDollars 1.8bn five-year issue, while Prince
Edward Island raised CDollars 60m.
The market has so far absorbed the flood of new issues - not to mention
numerous EuroCanadian offerings by non-Canadian borrowers - with remarkably
little indigestion.
Spreads between Canadian and US bond yields widened in January when domestic
institutions were net sellers, but the gap has narrowed more recently. The
benchmark Government of Canada 10-year bond yielded 7.49 per cent towards
the end of last week, 135 basis points higher than equivalent US Treasuries.
The gap was as wide as 164 points in January.
'There's a slight cost to this, but less than I would have expected it to
be,' says a government-finance specialist at one Toronto securities firm.
The surge in borrowing stems from yawning budget deficits at both the
federal and provincial levels. The federal deficit is expected to jump to
CDollars 34.5bn in the fiscal year to March 31 1993, compared to a projected
CDollars 27.5bn in last February's budget.
Royal Bank of Canada estimates that the 10 provinces will have a combined
budget deficit of CDollars 23.5bn this year, up from CDollars 22.2bn in
1991-1992 and CDollars 9.8bn the previous year. Public sector borrowings in
the domestic market could top CDollars 60bn in 1993 as a whole.
The supply of funds has so far matched, and even outstripped, demand. Some
smaller provinces are said to have been offered a year or two's requirements
in a single issue.
For investors, the main attraction has been the combination of a stable
currency, a more generous yield than US securities with little extra risk,
and a liquid market.
Mr David Adamo, director of fixed-income research at ScotiaMcLeod, says: 'If
you're a US or European investor looking for an attractive rate in a country
with minimal inflation, Canada looks good.'
Prices, especially at the short end, are expected to remain firm for the
time being. With the economy still weak, analysts predict further falls in
short-term interest rates with inflation at 1 to 2 per cent. Canadian
securities will also benefit from any further improvement in the US bond
market.
Mr Daniel Kelly, vice-president for fixed-income research at Wood Gundy,
adds that the Canadian provinces, almost all of which have single-A credit
ratings or better, will continue to have access to the Yankee market 'as
long as people are reasonably optimistic on the US dollar and US interest
rates'.
But a warning shot was fired over the market last week by the CD Howe
Institute, one of Canada's premier economic think-tanks. The institute
reported that most of the 19 economists at a recent seminar on the fiscal
outlook felt that Canada's public debt burden has grown to the point where
'continued easy access to financing cannot be taken for granted'.
Mr Warren Jestin, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia, suggested that
uncertainty about the outcome of Canada's general election later this year,
further bad news on provincial finances, or evidence that Ottawa will have
difficulty cutting its deficit 'could all trigger a less receptive borrowing
environment'.
Demand for funds, especially from the provinces, shows few signs of easing,
however.
Mr Benoit Durocher, a Royal Bank economist, predicts that provincial
deficits will not come down much in 1993-1994. While tax revenues will rise
as the economy accelerates, finance ministers can no longer rely on
inflation to push taxpayers into higher income-tax brackets, or to boost
receipts from sales taxes.

FT  22 FEB 93 / US Money and Credit: President delivers a rosy outlook for
Treasuries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS unlikely that any new president in modern history has received so
enthusiastic a reaction from the domestic bond markets as has Mr Bill
Clinton the past week.
When he won the presidential election on November 3, the yield on the
benchmark 30-year government bond was standing at 7.645 per cent and the
yield on the two-year note was 4.416 per cent.
On Friday, after a week-long rally in bond prices, the 30-year yield had
plunged to 7.000 per cent and two-year yield had dropped to 3.945 per cent.
The 30-year is now recording the lowest yield since the issue was first sold
to the public in 1977. Given that Democratic presidents are normally
regarded as the enemy of fixed-income investors - because they like to use
the power of the government to generate economic growth, a policy approach
that can have inflationary consequences - the performance of the bond
markets under President Clinton has been remarkable.
The recent strength in bond prices can be put down to a variety of factors,
but one has been dominant - a surprise among Treasury investors at the
president's willingness to propose tough, politically unpopular measures to
cut the huge federal deficit.
Last week's economic plan from President Clinton, a mixture of big tax
increases, selected spending cuts, and targeted government 'investments' - a
euphemism for more spending - was a braver assault on the deficit than the
bond market could ever have imagined in the pre-election days of mid-1992.
The president's economic package - which is geared to short-term economic
stimulus this year but which quickly shifts its focus towards
deficit-reduction in 1994 and 1995 - has been welcomed by bond investors not
just because it tackles the deficit problem.
The plan has also earned applause because the Treasury market believes the
net effect of the measures proposed in the State of the Union address last
week will be to slow the rate of economic growth in 1994 and possibly
beyond.
This is not only good news on the inflation front, but also in terms of the
direction of monetary policy. As Mr Neal Soss, chief economist at First
Boston, said of the president's economic package last week: 'This is
extremely bullish for securities markets, because it postpones the prospects
for any Federal Reserve tightening of monetary policy.'
Mr Soss believes that the tax increases will effectively take the place of
interest rate rises as the main method of pacing economic growth and
stifling inflation.
President Clinton, however, cannot claim all the credit for the bond rally.
Prices have been driven higher recently by at least two other factors. One
has been the flight to quality by investors frightened by the dramatic
downturn in stock prices after the president's tax increases were first
announced.
The other has been the continued speculation that the Treasury plans a big
cut in the size of future long bond issues as part of a plan to reduce the
cost of servicing the federal deficit.
The flight to quality will probably continue to benefit the bond market
until equity investors have grown more comfortable with the new economic
policy emanating from the White House, and despite hints from the Treasury
to the contrary, longer-dated prices will also continue to benefit from
expectations of future cuts in long-bond issuance.
Consequently, the market's short-term outlook looks rosy. As Salomon
Brothers said on Friday: 'If the key 7 per cent threshold on long Treasury
yields is breached - as we expect - long-term yields are likely to head
toward 6 1/2 per cent.'

Elkem as dividend omitted

<TEXT>
ELKEM, the troubled Norwegian light metals producer, yesterday revealed
sharply increased net losses in 1992, and warned it would omit its dividend
payment for the third year running.
Net losses last year rose to NKr616m (Dollars 89m) from NKr443m in 1991
while sales fell by NKr514m to NKr7.3bn. Elkem said its main markets
continued to be plagued by weak demand, high levels of exports of metals and
alloys from China and eastern Europe, and over-capacity.
'The company considers that there are no reasons to expect significant
changes in the market situation in 1993,' Elkem warned further.
Group operating costs were cut by NKr63m to NKr6.99m but the company pledged
to continue cost-cutting efforts. The number of employees was cut by 679 045
last year.
Elkem said cost reduction measures announced in the second half of 1992,
including a further cut in its workforce and renegotiation of raw materials
contracts, would have a positive effect in 1993. The company charged
accounts with a NKr125m loss on Elkem Technology and NKr86m for
restructuring.
However, the charges were offset by a NKr214m gain on the sales of assets
and a NKr50m tax reduction. Elkem's shareholdings in associated companies
yielded net losses of NKr76m in 1992 against profits of NKr58m previously.
Net interest expenses rose to NKr431m from NKr416m in 1991. Elkem said it
suffered foreign currency losses on debt of NKr33m in the fourth quarter.
Finance expenses rose to NKr511m from NKr421m in 1991. 'Financial costs were
also affected by the high level of interest rates in domestic money markets
in the fourth quarter.'
Elkem said its financial base had been strengthened in the fourth quarter by
NKr580m raised from a share issue, gains from assets sales and the
establishment of a NKr550m credit facility.

FT  22 FEB 93 / International Company News: Earnings of ADollars 36m for
Fairfax at halfway
</HEADLINE>

   By KEVIN BROWN

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN Fairfax, the Australian newspaper group controlled by Mr Conrad Black's
Daily Telegraph group, has announced interim net profits of ADollars 36m
(USDollars 24.4m) for the six months to end-December.
Fairfax, which was floated on the Australian Stock Exchange in May, said the
figures were not comparable with the first half of the previous year, when
the group was in receivership.
However, the group earned net profits of ADollars 27m in the six months to
June, after offsetting an income-tax liability of ADollars 11.5m against tax
credits carried over from the receivership. Sales were ADollars 388.5m
compared with ADollars 357.4m in the second half of last year.
Fairfax said it benefited from higher advertising revenue and lower net
interest costs, reflecting Australia's falling interest rates and gradual
recovery from recession.
Sales of the Sydney Morning Herald and The (Melbourne) Age increased, but
the group said the difficult business environment was responsible for a 3
per cent fall in the circulation of the Australian Financial Review.
The board said it had decided in principle to build a ADollars 300m printing
plant in Sydney, which is intended to match the improved printing facilities
installed by News Corporation, Australia's biggest publishing group.
The group said the plant would be operational by 1996, allowing improved
presentation of its newspapers and reducing production costs. 'These factors
are expected to have a significant positive impact on the long term
competitive strength of the company,' the board said.
The directors said there would be no dividend, in line with forecasts in the
flotation prospectus.
The Daily Telegraph owns 15 per cent of Fairfax, but has applied to the
federal government for permission to lift its stake to 20 per cent.

FT  22 FEB 93 / International Company News: Pinault considers Prisunic sale
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PINAULT, the French retail group, is considering the sale of Prisunic, one
of France's largest store chains, as part of its efforts to raise capital to
reduce the debt left by its takeover of the Au Printemps stores group.
Galeries Lafayette, one of Printemps' main rivals in the department store
sector, is mooted as a prospective purchaser. Galeries Lafayette, already
burdened by FFr2.8bn (Dollars 505m) of debt after its acquisition of the
Nouvelles Galeries group, has denied French newspaper reports that it was in
negotiations with Pinault. However, it left open the possibility of future
talks by saying it 'did not envisage bidding for Prisunic at present'.
Prisunic, a chain of 94 mixed merchandise stores with 230 affiliates, is a
leading player in French retailing. It came to the fore in the 1970s when it
was influential in introducing contemporary design to France, fulfilling a
similar role to Habitat in the UK.
The group has come under pressure in recent years, reflecting the sluggish
state of French consumer spending and the intensely competitive condition of
the retail sector. It made operating profits of just FFr34.3m on sales of
FFr4.9bn in 1991.
Pinault has been selling assets for some time. Initially it concentrated on
its old industrial interests but in recent months has started selling its
recently acquired retail interests. Pinault, which is reported to hope to
raise FFr2bn from the Prisunic sale, has also reshuffled its finances in an
attempt to alleviate the burden of its FFr19bn net debt.

FT  22 FEB 93 / International Company News: GM offers salaried staff paid
leave in job cuts plan

<TEXT>
AS PART of its cost-cutting drive, General Motors, the largest car
manufacturer in the US, is offering salaried employees paid leave of between
six and 15 months if they agree to leave the company once the leave is
completed.
GM hopes that the plan, combined with natural attrition, will reduce its
white-collar workforce by 8,000, or 10 per cent, before the end of the year.
Only salaried employees who have been with the car maker for more than a
year are eligible for the plan.
The company has already had success with its early retirement programmes for
white-collar workers over 50 years old, which have helped reduce the
salaried workforce from 91,000 to 76,000.
Overall, GM is trying to cut 74,000 white and blue-collar jobs.
Toyota, Japan's leading car maker is considering manufacturing pick-up
trucks in the US after the collapse of talks with General Motors over a
joint venture, writes Charles Leadbeater in Tokyo.
Toyota said it would start looking at whether to set up its own production
facilities in the US after GM rejected proposals for a joint venture to make
the Toyota T100 truck. 'Partnership with GM was one of our choices,' it
said.
Toyota started exporting its T100 truck to the US last autumn, but sales
have been restricted by the 25 per cent tariff charged on imports. This led
Toyota to consider manufacturing the truck in the US.

FT  22 FEB 93 / International Company News: Metsa-Serla cuts losses by half

METSA-SERLA, the Finnish forestry group, cut losses after financial items to
FM290m (Dollars 49m) in 1992, less than half the previous year's FM635m
deficit.
The improvement came despite FM275m in exchange rate losses and reflected
the benefits of cost-cutting, improved efficiency and the fall in the value
of the markka. There will again be no dividend.
The group believes it will show a profit after financial items in 1993, with
sales increasing to FM8bn. It says its strategy of product specialisation
should assist the recovery, although it expects general market conditions to
remain difficult.
'Metsa-Serla's main targets are to improve profitability, secure a good cash
flow and reduce indebtedness,' it said.
Sales for 1992 rose to FM7.75bn from FM7.74bn, although allowing for
divestments, the increase was 9 per cent.
The devaluation of the markka compensated for the sharp fall in market
prices, the company said.
The operating margin climbed to FM1.23bn from FM896m while operating profits
rose to FM718m from FM391m.
Corrugated board and tissue was the group's best performing sector,
increasing operating profits to FM352m from FM242m.
Paper and paperboard produced an operating profit of FM199m, up from FM190m,
while sawn paper and pulp managed FM167m of profits after 1991's FM41m
losses.
Hafnia, the Danish insurance group which is up for sale, has sold Cambio +
Valoren, its Swiss asset management bank, to Union Bancare Privee, the
Geneva-based private bank, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen.
The deadline for offers to buy Hafnia, which was placed on the market last
autumn, passed last week.

<TEXT>
HEAVY fare discounting to maintain market share and restructuring charges
brought Air Canada's 1992 net losses to CDollars 454m (USDollars 361m), or
CDollars 6.13 a share, against losses of CDollars 218m or Dollars 2.94 a
share, the year before.
Revenues were barely changed at CDollars 3.5bn. Domestic markets continued
to be depressed because of the recession and Atlantic routes were highly
competitive.
The only favourable sign was an upturn in operating results for the fourth
quarter, said Mr Hollis Harris, president. Operating costs were reduced 10
per cent in 1992 and 2,200 jobs were eliminated.
The 1992 final loss was worse than analysts had forecast. On an operating
basis before all special charges, Air Canada's operating loss was CDollars
145m, against CDollars 164m.
Air Canada has warned it will lose about CDollars 200m in 1993, with further
rationalisation of equipment and manpower, and hopes to return to
profitability in 1994.
Mr Harris said having two Canadian airlines operating internationally was
counter productive. He called again for a merger with rival Canadian
Airlines, now trying to complete a stock and operating alliance with
American Airlines.
PWA, Canadian's parent company, forecast it would report a heavy 1992 loss
later this month.

rights issue looms

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NET PROFITS at RWE, one of Germany's largest industrial groups, slipped
fractionally during the six months to December, the first half of the
Essen-based group's current financial year.
Excluding minority interests, net profits fell to DM395m (Dollars 241m) from
DM398m a year earlier, while turnover rose by 2.5 per cent to DM26.7bn from
DM26bn.
RWE is planning to hold its long-awaited rights issue next month. Last year
it won approval for shareholders to increase its share capital by as many as
6.2m new shares. Analysts expect the company to raise between DM1.6bn and
DM1.7bn from the issue.
The group said that despite the downturn in the German economy, it was
confident that in the year to the end of June it would be able at least to
hold sales and profits at the same level as in 1991-1992.
Energy, construction and related businesses continued to do well, RWE said.
Combined with cost-cutting and other rationalisation measures in other
sectors such as printing equipment and oil, the group is hopeful that it
will be able to maintain its dividend at the same level as last year - DM12
per share. This will be payable on the new shares issued in next month's
rights issue.
In energy production, turnover in the first half of the year was stable at
DM9.2bn, while in oil and chemicals turnover dropped 7 per cent to DM10.3bn.
RWE was at the centre of controversy in December when shareholders voted to
retain an antiquated voting rights structure giving local authorities in the
Ruhr area 60 per cent of the votes although they own only 30 per cent of the
shares.
Calpers, the large US investor, said at the meeting that it was naive of RWE
to retain voting rights restrictions while expecting to enjoy continued
access to international markets. Although the vast majority of independent
shareholders voted to remove the special voting rights, the local
authorities blocked the initiative.

lifting its stake from 30 to 90 per cent. The family provided 10 per cent.

half of Chemplex Australia from Consolidated Press, Mr Kerry Packer's
Australian media and industrial group, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney.
ConsPress had agreed to sell Chemplex to Sentrachem, the South African

FT  22 FEB 93 / International Company News: BZW moves to regroup capital
market operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS DE Zoete Wedd, the investment banking arm of Barclays, the UK
clearing bank, has regrouped its capital market operations in an attempt to
boost its activities in the debt and structured finance areas.
Like rival NatWest Markets, which has been through an extensive
reorganisation of its own, BZW's move appears to demonstrate a recognition
that its debt and derivatives operations lag behind more ambitious US and
continental European rivals in London.
The bank's bond activities have been largely restricted to sterling in the
past, though last week it won its first big European currency unit mandate
as joint lead manager on an Ecu500m bond issue for the European Investment
Bank.
The new debt capital markets group comprises bond origination and private
placements, structured finance - previously part of the corporate finance
unit - and swaps and options.
Debt trading and sales activities will remain in the bank's markets
devision, though swap and options trading will be part of the new group.
Mr John Spencer, managing director of Barclays' financial markets group,
said the changes did not signal any wider shake-up of BZW's corporate
finance operations.

FT  22 FEB 93 / International Company News: Sherwood Computer in two deals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sherwood Computer Services has paid Pounds 300,000 in cash to acquire THS
(Guernsey), in a move which strengthens its position in the insurance
companies market.
THS (Guernsey) comprises the majority of the assets and business of the
company which traded as THS Limited, a subsidiary of English &amp; American
Group. At the date of acquisition, THS (Guernsey) had net assets of Pounds
1.1m. The deal will give Sherwood the rights to a number of proprietary IBM
software products.
In a separate move, Sherwood announced a joint venture with Beta Computers
(Europe) to form a new company, Sherwood International. The company is 51
per cent owned by Sherwood, which acquired its equity by way of a
subscription for shares for Pounds 255,000 cash. The new company has been
formed to acquire the rights to PALACE, an advanced life and pensions
administration system with international potential.

FT  22 FEB 93 / International Company News: Westminster Health value may top
Pounds 100m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE flotation of Westminster Health Care, the nursing homes group, will go
ahead this spring and is expected to value the group at Pounds 100m or more.
WHC also announced that interim profits before interest and tax had more
than doubled to Pounds 4.3m (Pounds 2.1m) on turnover of Pounds 17m (Pounds
9.9m). The prospectus for the float will contain a profit forecast for the
year to May 31. In the previous year it made Pounds 5.3m before interest and
tax, on sales of Pounds 23.4m.
The prospectus will also refer to law suits filed in the US against National
Medical Enterprises, WHC's US parent. NME has been sued by insurance
companies claiming overcharging. NME is defending the suits.
The float, which is likely to raise at least Pounds 50m through a placing
with a clawback to allow the public to buy shares, will reduce NME's stake
in the group to a percentage in the low 40s. However, NME is not taking cash
out of the business, rather it will repay WHC's debt and fund further
expansion.
The company aims not to ask shareholders for further cash for at least 18
months or two years. A fast rate of expansion is expected. WHC owns 39
nursing homes in the UK with 2,620 beds, mostly in purpose built homes, with
a high proportion in single, ground floor rooms with ensuite bathrooms.
WHC has another 9 under construction, adding 737 beds. Mr Pat Carter, chief
executive, said that it planned to open 700 to 800 beds a year.
By the financial year end it expects to have 3,230 beds making it one of the
larger groups in the industry, although still relatively small in the
private sector nursing home market, valued at Pounds 2.2bn a year. New
openings are likely to mean that second half profits do not rise as fast as
in the first half.
WHC's prospectus will also describe the changes taking place in the industry
from April 1 as a result of the government's reforms of community care.
These shift the funding responsibility for patients who cannot afford
private care from central to local government.
Mr Carter said that local authorities are now preparing for the new system,
setting prices and giving patients choice within available funding. WHC
takes a higher proportion of private patients than most of the operators in
the industry.
The leading quoted operator of residential nursing homes is Takare, whose
shares trade on a multiple of over 20 times analysts' earnings forecasts for
1992.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd is sponsor to the issue, and de Zoete &amp; Bevan is
broker.

FT  22 FEB 93 / International Company News: Cashing in on conservation -
Vardon's purchase of the Gweek Seal Sanctuary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are no fruit machines or fairground rides at the Cornish Seal
Sanctuary on the banks of the Helford river at Gweek. But there are paying
visitors - 200,000 of them a year, spending almost Pounds 1m between them.
Last week, Vardon, the leisure group which owns the London Dungeon, the York
Dungeon and the Sea Life Centres and which obtained a Stock Exchange listing
in October, paid Pounds 1.8m to acquire the sanctuary.
The deal highlights the increasing interest being shown by leisure companies
in conservation which, in turn, reflects growing public concern about the
environment and environmental issues.
There is also a greater realism among some conservationists who appreciate
that a commercial partnership can help provide a more stable financial
framework for their operations. For example, London Zoo's latest survival
plan, also unveiled last week, emphasises its research, breeding and
conservation work in an attempt to attract visitors rather than the old
Victorian-style menagerie concept.
The Cornish Seal Sanctuary was founded by Mr Ken Jones, a former coal miner
who in the mid-1950s ran a beach cafe at St Agnes on Cornwall's north coast.
One day he found an injured baby seal pup and decided to nurse it back to
health. The sanctuary started from there.
Mr Jones continued to build on the work of the sanctuary, caring for injured
and abandoned animals, but eventually outgrew his beach cafe site. So in the
early 1970s, against considerable local opposition, he obtained permission
to build the present sanctuary on a 35-acre site on the banks of the Helford
in south-west Cornwall.
The new centre was opened in 1975 and subsequently expanded through a Pounds
750,000 building programme to include a visitors' centre, cinema, aquarium,
fully-equipped hospital, five seal pools and an exhibition about the effects
of pollution.
Most of the funding for the sanctuary was provided by Mr Jones himself, or
from visitors' donations and a 25p entrance fee.
However, in 1990 Mr Jones sold the sanctuary to a group of local and West
Country investors and retired, something he now deeply regrets because of
his fears that it has become too commercialised.
When he heard a week ago that Vardon had approached the Seal Sanctuary with
a view to buying it, he tried to raise the money to buy it back himself, but
had insufficient time to do so.
Since he sold his interest, the sanctuary has been run on a commercial basis
by Seal Sanctuary Plc, although most visitors might not have realised it had
switched from an amateur, charitable organisation to a business footing.
Indeed, the sanctuary's new commercial owners did little to advertise their
presence. Visitor literature and notices around the sanctuary thank
customers for their 'support' and still invite donations.
The fences surrounding the seal pools are covered with the names of families
and children who have financially sponsored or adopted a seal. It is a moot
point whether these funds would have been so available had the donors
appreciated the changed status of the sanctuary.
Today, the sanctuary charges an entry fee of Pounds 2.50 for adults and
Pounds 1.50 for children. On Sundays, more than 1,000 people visit the
attraction. Last year it made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 124,000 after
paying Pounds 251,000 in interest and non-recurring charges.
Nevertheless, the sanctuary performs a vital conservation function. There
are only an estimated 100,000 Atlantic Grey Seals in the world and two
thirds of them are found around the coast of Britain. Until they were
protected, the population was declining and only about 400 are thought to
remain around Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly.
The conservation work undertaken by the Gweek sanctuary will mesh closely
with the work of the Sea Life Centres which Vardon acquired in October.
Sea Life operates seven wholly owned and one 50 per cent owned centres
around Britain. It is building another in Southend and one in Scheveningen,
Holland. Despite the recession, in the year to December 31 the centres
posted a profit of Pounds 2.15m, a 19 per cent increase on the previous
year.
The Sea Life Centre at Oban, in Scotland, already operates a scaled-down
version of Gweek's rescue facilities. Volunteers from both Oban and Gweek
worked together on a seal rescue programme in the wake of the Braer
oil-spill in the Shetlands.
All the centres have rescue and rehabilitation facilities and operate their
own successful environmental programme called 'Sea Watch'.
Mr David Mace, Sea Life's founder and managing director, says Vardon plans
to open two new centres a year.
However, as a marine biologist, he is also sensitive to the concerns of
those who fear that conservation and commercial interests do not mix. He
says: 'We are certainly not going to change the sanctuary's aims and
ambitions'. He adds that conservation will continue to be pursued with
'vigour'.
And already, the sanctuary's new owners have moved to reassure other
sceptics like Mr Jones. 'They have told me they will run it the right way. I
hope they will, but we will keep an eye on them,' he says.

FT  22 FEB 93 / CSFB pre-tax profits rise to Dollars 277m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CS FIRST Boston, the New York-based global investment bank, has announced
pre-tax profits of Dollars 277m (Pounds 195m) for last year, up from Dollars
266m in 1991. An unusually heavy tax burden, however, meant net profits for
the year were Dollars 175m, well below the Dollars 215m earned after taxes
in 1991.
The largest contribution to earnings came from fixed-income sales and
trading, where the lowest US interest rates in 30 years and buoyant domestic
government and corporate bond markets created favourable conditions for all
the main investment banking houses.
CSFB said debt and equity underwriting revenues were also strong - a
reflection of the record-breaking amounts of new corporate stock and bonds
sold in the US markets during 1992 as companies took advantage of low
interest rates and heavy demand for equity from investors.
The bank's worldwide privatisation and mergers and acquisitions businesses
also thrived last year. CSFB topped the rankings in 1992 as the busiest
adviser among international investment banks.
Yet, in spite of low interest rates, booming US stock and bond markets, and
extraordinary levels of new debt and equity issuance, earnings growth at
CSFB in 1992 was well below that of other big US-based investment banks and
securities houses, most of which reported record profits last year.
Observers said that the relatively modest growth in CSFB's pre-tax income in
1992 was partly because of its decision to invest large amounts of money in
new business development, technology and people, and partly because of the
firm's small equity base.
CSFB's equity capitalisation last year was Dollars 1.07bn, small by the
standards of big Wall Street investment banks. The equity capitalisation
last year of Morgan Stanley, for example, was almost three times as large as
CSFB's.
The figures confirm that CSFB has recovered from its problems of two years
ago, when its Dollars 1.2bn exposure to troubled corporate 'bridge loans'
forced its parent, the Swiss banking group Credit Suisse, to launch a
financial bail-out of CSFB in 1990. That year CSFB lost Dollars 587m, but
returned to profitability in 1991.

FT  22 FEB 93 / RTZ goes west for a foothold in US coal mines: Nerco
acquisition offers UK group prospects for long-term growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coal mining is unglamorous and to the uninitiated investor seems
environmentally unfriendly. And it does not look like perfect timing to move
into coal mining in the US just after Bill Clinton has been elected
president - with a new energy tax and promises to clamp down more firmly on
environment-damaging operations.
Nevertheless, that is what RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining
group, is doing. It is making a Dollars 1.16bn (Pounds 810m) entry into US
coal mining with the proposed acquisition of Nerco, the floundering natural
resources company.
The stock market was perturbed by this diversification and marked RTZ's
shares down. Mr Euan Worthington, head of the mining team at SG Warburg,
says: 'It looks like a very good deal - if you want that sort of deal. But
should anyone be buying coal anywhere in the world, even reasonably
high-quality coal?'
According to Mr Bob Wilson, RTZ's chief executive, the answer is a
resounding: Yes.
His company has been looking for opportunities for some time and towards the
end of last year offered to buy Nerco's coal business after the US company's
third-quarter results showed it was financially stressed. RTZ was rebuffed
then but now is back with an agreed offer for all of Nerco.
The US company will be split up: RTZ will sell Nerco's oil and gas
operations and probably its gold and silver mines too but will keep the
profitable coal business and merge it with its Kennecott subsidiary in the
US. It hopes to build on that base with more coal acquisitions. 'This is the
first step for establishing a new high-quality business for RTZ in the
States,' says Mr Wilson.
RTZ is not the only UK company to hunt for US coal. In 1989 Hanson, the
Anglo-US conglomerate, took over Consolidated Gold Fields which brought with
it a 49 per cent stake in Newmont Mining, which in turn owned about one
third of Peabody, the second-largest US coal producer.
Hanson was expected to sell that stake but instead spent Dollars 715m to
take full control of Peabody and it became a core business destined for
expansion.
Coal is now Hanson's fastest-growing business and accounts for more than 30
per cent of the group's capital employed.
So what makes US coal so attractive?
According to Mr Wilson, it offers long-term, if modest, growth prospects.
Before Mr Clinton's election the consensus was that electricity consumption
in the US would grow by 1.7 per cent to 2 per cent a year and that would
provide 2 per cent growth for coal used by the utilities.
Mr Wilson suggests there will also be important changes within coal demand
as the US clean air legislation bites deeper during the rest of this decade.
Coal with a high sulphur content from Illinois and the Appalachian Mountains
is expected to be displaced by low-sulphur coal from the Powder River Basin
which straddles Montana and Wyoming. 'So low-sulphur coal demand could grow
at better than 2 per cent a year for a long time to come,' says Mr Wilson.
Nerco gives RTZ two open pit, steam coal mines in the Powder River Basin and
a half share in a third. Nerco's share of production was 16.6m tonnes last
year and its share of reserves is 580m tonnes.
More than 60 per cent of production from these mines is secured by long-term
contracts, 95 per cent of the contracts run into the next century.
Mr Wilson says the mines 'are about the lowest-cost in the world', with coal
typically costing only Dollars 4 a tonne to mine. This is because the
deposits are thick and very little waste has to be removed before it can be
extracted by cheap, open-pit methods.
The snag is that Powder River coal has to be transported by high-cost
railways up to 1,200 miles to reach customers. Also, Powder River coal might
be 'clean' but it usually contains only a moderate amount of energy compared
with Appalachian material.
Nevertheless, the acquisition fits in with RTZ's philosophy of wanting a
portfolio of wholly-owned, world-class, long-life, low-cost mining assets.
Neither is President Clinton's proposed energy tax much of a setback. Mr
Wilson says this came as no surprise to RTZ. According to the group's
analysis, the proposed tax would be less damaging to the coal business than
a carbon tax, will hit oil's competitiveness most of all but favours gas
against coal.
Via its 49 per cent-owned subsidiary, CRA, RTZ has interests in coal in
Australia and Indonesia, 'so the business is familiar to us both technically
and commercially'.
Some time ago RTZ decided to add a wholly-owned coal operation to its core
businesses which already include copper, aluminium, gold, titanium, borax
and iron ore. It started in the US 'because it is the biggest market for
coal'.
Mr Wilson says there might be opportunities to add to its Powder River Basin
reserves because Nerco owns only about 9 per cent of the reserves in the
area and there is no dominant producer.
RTZ might well benefit from this fragmentation, particularly as some of the
reserves are owned by oil companies which seem to want to move out of the
coal. Also, 'market forces are pushing for rationalisation because it is an
over-supplied market'.
Over-capacity is keeping coal prices in the spot market low but Mr Wilson
suggests they are unlikely to go much lower. RTZ will also look for
opportunities to buy into the internationally-traded coal business or add
some value by putting some international coal trading companies together.
Analysts suggest that the Nerco deal seems a good one for RTZ. Mr Geoff
Campbell, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group, says
that, while it is difficult to estimate, RTZ seems to be paying only Dollars
1 a tonne for Nerco's coal.
He says: 'The sector is out of favour at present and not subject to the
inflated values seen in some of the base metals sectors.'

FT  22 FEB 93 / BSM in talks for October flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BSM GROUP, owner of the British School of Motoring, one of the UK's largest
franchisers, is in advanced discussions to obtain a listing on the London
stock exchange later this year.
Mr John Mackie of Morgan Grenfell, who is a non-executive director of the
company, said yesterday that a flotation was planned for early October.
Final details are still being prepared, but it is believed that the value of
the share offering may be about Pounds 50m.
The BSM proposal comes at a time when a number of companies are considering
going public while the equity market is buoyant, including Westminster
Health Care which plans to float in the spring.
Mr Mackie said the share offering would provide an exit from ownership for
the team which financed the management buy-out of the company in 1990, as
well as reduce the level of borrowing and help fund future growth. BSM has
already selected Morgan Grenfell as the sponsoring merchant bank and James
Capel as brokers for the float. It is expected to select Coopers &amp; Lybrand,
the auditors, as reporting accountants.
The company reported ordinary profits of Pounds 810,000 in the year to
December 31, 1991, before a tax credit of Pounds 109,000 mostly caused by
advance corporation tax written back.
Morgan Grenfell Capital Partners put up Pounds 11.5m in equity as part of
the Pounds 40m buy-out of BSM in April 1990. The 1991 accounts show senior
debt of Pounds 11m.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Banks given assurance by Daily Mirror
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOUR banks which are majority shareholders in Mirror Group Newspapers
received an assurance on Friday afternoon from Mr David Montgomery, MGN's
chief executive, that the Daily Mirror will remain a left-of-centre
newspaper.
'As a result of conversations which took place last week, I have no doubt
that the Daily Mirror's left-of-centre position will continue,' said Mr John
Melbourn, a senior executive director of National Westminster Bank. Mr
Melbourn added that 'left-of-centre' is synonymous with backing the Labour
Party in general elections. The banks believe a rightward shift would damage
MGN as a business.
Separately it also emerged yesterday that MGN's board is likely to issue a
statement this week, reaffirming both the left-of-centre stance of the Daily
Mirror and stating the board's support for Mr Montgomery's management.
NatWest is MGN's biggest shareholder and Mr Melbourn has been playing a
leading role in attempts by the bank to restore stability to MGN, after its
employees and the Labour Party accused Mr Montgomery of attempting to break
the Mirror's traditional Labour allegiance.
Representatives of National Westminster, Midland, Goldman Sachs and Lloyds,
which between them control 54 per cent of MGN's shares as collateral on
loans to the late Mr Robert Maxwell, saw Mr Montgomery on Friday for a
briefing on the performance of the businesses. A banker at the meeting said:
'After all last week's speculation, we asked him for an assurance that the
newspaper would stay left of centre.' Mr Montgomery gave that assurance.
Earlier in the week, Mr Melbourn sought and received a similar commitment on
the Mirror's political stance from Sir Robert Clarke, MGN's chairman. He
also asked Sir Robert to stay on as chairman for another year, but suggested
that the board should be slightly reconstituted so that non-executives make
up 60 per cent of all directors. One or two other non-executives are
therefore likely to be appointed.
A banks' representative also had a meeting last week with Lord Hollick, the
Labour businessman who is a non-executive director of MGN. The banker asked
Lord Hollick whether he had a hidden agenda as a director of MGN, following
reports that he plans to make a bid for MGN. Lord Hollick told the banks
that he had no hidden agenda and that no bid was planned.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Economics Notebook: Steady nerves needed in Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
There is near panic in Spain's ruling socialist party and government over
the dire state of the economy and the government's own polls suggesting it
might even be defeated if an election were held this week.
Fortunately for the socialists, an election can wait until the end of
November. But Spain went into recession in the last quarter of 1992 and the
mood of the country has taken a turn for the worse in the last month. The
government is being paralysed by cabinet divisions, with ministers urging
prime minister Mr Felipe Gonzalez to ignore finance minister Mr Carlos
Solchaga and relax fiscal policy.
Worse, relations between Mr Gonzalez and the left-wing deputy party leader,
Mr Alfonso Guerra have become even more strained than usual.
Momentarily at least, Spain is rudderless and drifting. Last Friday's
regular cabinet meeting ended without its equally regular press conference.
Earlier, after the official statistics institute reported unemployment had
risen to an historic 3.04m in 1992, the government added to the air of
unreality by driving up interest rates in secondary markets to defend the
peseta from some relatively mild speculation.
'Defending' the strongest currency in the EMS may have been consistent with
the government's commitment to exchange rate stability and a strong peseta
(to attract foreign currency to its debt auctions). But with bankruptcies at
record levels and the jobs created in the 1986-1989 boom fast disappearing,
posturing for foreign bond dealers did not, perhaps, strike quite the note
the country was looking for in the wake of the unemployment figures.
The Spanish business community has deserted the Gonzalez administration en
bloc, furious about the party forcing a watered-down strike law through
parliament last week. Opposition from Mr Solchaga, who wanted a tougher
bill, was simply ignored in yet another demonstration that when push comes
to shove on domestic issues, it is Mr Guerra and the party who rule.
This crunch - recession and election - was bound to catch the socialists
sometime. Spain's core problem is its Dollars 200bn-plus (Pounds 140bn-plus)
public debt and the price it pays - high interest rates - to persuade
foreigners to finance it. If it cuts rates faster than the Bundesbank, it
cannot sell its debt. But unless it does, the recession will probably
deepen. One way out would be a third devaluation in a year but this would
signal panic to the markets and cause great anguish in neighbouring
Portugal.
A second way out, unspoken even a year ago but broadly canvassed now in
business and, more timorously, in cabinet, is to pull the peseta out of the
exchange rate mechanism and allow the currency to float. Downwards,
inevitably.
But this government would not be able to do that. It has staked everything
on being a loyal player in the EC and it has, anyway, no way out of the debt
trap. The Spanish public purse pays about 15m people - pensioners, the
unemployed and a massive civil service - and any serious threat to any of
those sectors would unquestionably cost the socialists the election.
Thus interest rates will have to stay relatively high (13 per cent against
headline inflation of around 5 per cent) at least until financing for the
year is complete and to keep pressure on employers until the spring wage
round is over. There are already worrying signs that settlements are
averaging 8 per cent or more.
Faced with all this, Mr Gonzalez has to decide when to hold his election
and, then, how to win it.
He first needs to repair the rift with Mr Guerra. Mr Gonzalez is considering
running the socialist campaign himself but he has never run an election and
Mr Guerra has put him in office three times in a row. This cannot be the
end. They have fallen apart over policy before and they are doing so again,
but neither is suicidal.
Second, he needs some policies that do not upset the peseta - perhaps the
removal of or a cut in a business tax, a public works programme and a
possible labour reform that would end obligatory and expensive government
arbitrage in large-scale redundancy programmes.
That may or may not be enough but the socialists have time to fine-tune and
to steady themselves. Certainly, the victory rolls already being drummed out
in the opposition press seem absurdly premature. Their economic platform -
outlined earlier this month - is an opportunistic mix of unspecified tax
cuts and privatisations and an uncosted promise to create jobs at the
expense of cutting inflation.
But Mr Solchaga's orthodoxy may pay off. Inflation is already falling and
slowly creating room for interest rate cuts later and the gut feelings of
many in business that the recession will be deep and long remain just gut
feelings. Who knows? The worst of this could just as easily be over by
September.

FT  22 FEB 93 / EC steel job cuts may top 100,000: Krupp-Hoesch chief warns
his company may pull out of steelmaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WESTERN EUROPE'S steel industry may be forced to cut more than 100,000 jobs
in its latest market crisis, more than double the estimate of the European
Commission, according to the German steel federation.
Social spending to ease the burden of redundancies would have to increase
substantially, and protection from cheap eastern European imports ensured to
enable the industry to restructure, Mr Ruprecht Vondran, president of the
federation, said in an interview.
At the same time, the head of Germany's second largest steel producer,
Krupp-Hoesch, said he believed it was 'perfectly realistic' to consider
quitting the steel industry altogether, if 'radical measures' were not taken
to meet the crisis.
Mr Gerhard Cromme, chief executive of Fried. Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp, which is
in the process of merging the steelmaking operations of Krupp Stahl and
Hoesch Stahl, told Der Spiegel magazine the country's leading steelmakers
must co-operate to survive.
He refused to predict which German steel companies would outlive the latest
crisis, but said that even the three strongest - Thyssen, Krupp-Hoesch and
Preussag - would enjoy long-term survival prospects only if 'all the
opportunities are used for the best possible co-operation'.
The grim forecast for the likely job losses in the entire European industry
was made by Mr Vondran in a plea to Brussels to reconsider the funds
available for social programmes.
He said the European Commission's plan to spend Ecu240m (Pounds 198m) to
ease the mass redundancies would be inadequate, with Germany alone facing
job losses of 35,000-40,000 in both halves of the country.
At the same time he urged a stern regime to limit state subsidies to
loss-making producers, especially in Italy and Spain, and restrictions on
cheap steel imports from eastern Europe.
Mr Vondran rejected the Commission's proposal for agreed minimum prices for
east European steel imports, to prevent steel dumping, believing it would be
ineffective. He suggested an import ceiling on the most sensitive steel
products of 1991 import levels, plus 20 per cent.
EC industry ministers meet in Brussels this week when a rescue package will
be presented by the Commission, calling for capacity cuts of up to 30m
tonnes, in exchange for social spending, and some form of protection from
imports.
Asked in his interview whether the idea of pulling out of steel production
altogether was 'thinkable' for Krupp-Hoesch, Mr Cromme said: 'That is a
perfectly realistic idea. I do hope, however, that we will be able to avoid
any such step by taking a series of radical measures.'

</HEADLINE>

   LVOV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRYNA IASMYSKA is one of Ukraine's new entrepreneurs. Iryna, 30, now owns
the general store she used to run, along with six of her co-workers. They
bought it at the weekend in the first of Ukraine's privatisation auctions.
In all, 17 small restaurants, shops and businesses were sold at the auction
in the western Ukrainian city of Lvov. The sale could presage rapid
privatisation of the rest of the economy, 94 per cent of which is still
owned by the state.
Another buyer is Oleh Horbatiuk, a bulky, 42-year-old businessman. He bought
a grocery shop for 28m coupons, and a textiles factory for 20m coupons. Mr
Horbatiuk once served time in a Siberian prison for illegally trading in
hard currency. 'I came out of jail and I became a capitalist,' Mr Horbatiuk
cheerfully explained.
Nine of the 17 enterprises sold in Lvov went to workers who used their 30
per cent discount off the bid price and the right to make a 30 per cent
downpayment and pay the rest over a year.
Opening the auction, Mr Volodymyr Pylypchuk, chairman of the Ukrainian
parliamentary commission on economic reform, said: 'With the bang of this
hammer, I declare the beginning of mass privatisation in Ukraine.'
Iryna and her colleagues bid 48m coupons (the equivalent of Pounds 13,200)
for the store, although they will get their 30 per cent discount. They had
hoped to buy the store more cheaply, but bidding was fierce enough to raise
784m coupons in all, more than 100 times the book value of the businesses on
sale. 'Because of an auction, we had to pay 48m coupons (up from a book
value of 150,000 coupons),' said Iryna. 'Until we pay off this debt, I think
I will earn less as an owner than I did as a state manager.'
But Iryna, who won a bottle of champagne as the first successful bidder,
believes the store is a going concern. 'I have a very big task before me,
but I know I will succeed. There is such a great shortage of everything in
our country that I am confident we will be able to sell everything that we
offer our customers.'
Lvov municipal officials said they hoped this weekend's auction would become
a twice-monthly or even weekly event in their city, which has 4,000
businesses available for privatisation.
The sale, run with the help of the International Finance Corporation, the
privatisation arm of the World Bank, is the strongest indicator yet that the
government of prime minister Leonid Kuchma is committed to market reform.
Mr Vadym Vasyliev, deputy head of the State Property Fund, responsible for
privatisation, said he hoped for similar auctions in all of Ukraine's
regional centres by the end of March.
Several large-scale projects are in the pipeline, including the
transformation of an association of 10 meat processing plants in Odessa into
an open joint stock company under the IFC's auspices, and privatisation of
the state river shipping company, Ukrichflot, with advice from the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
But there are still obstacles: many businesses are being run under lease
between workers and the government. There is also opposition from
bureaucrats, who fear erosion of their power, and many workers' collectives
are worried about losing jobs under privatisation.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Prices in British supermarkets 17% below European average
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING'S devaluation over the past five months has turned Britain's
supermarkets into a bargain basement for shoppers from other European
countries, according to an international price survey.
It finds that UK retail prices for a range of branded foods, drinks and
consumer products are 17 per cent less than the average for 14 European
countries and 43 per cent lower than in Sweden, the dearest country.
The survey, carried out for the Financial Times last month by Nielsen, the
market research company, also finds little evidence that leading consumer
product manufacturers have raised their UK prices since sterling left the
European exchange rate mechanism last September.
Of 31 market-leading branded products surveyed, 17 have fallen in price
since August, by as much as 7 per cent. The biggest rise, for canned salmon,
was 23 per cent, though the price had moved sharply up and down in the
previous six months.
In several cases, price cuts of brand leaders were not matched fully by
retailers' own-label products, which are usually cheaper.
The survey covered a basket of 45 'Euro-brands' - products sold in at least
four of the larger European countries. Among the products assessed were
processed foods, snacks, pet food, alcohol, soft drinks, household cleaners
and personal care products.
Britain was cheapest in every product category except alcoholic drinks, for
which prices were 6 per cent above the European average. Prices in Austria
were 56 per cent higher than the European average and in Ireland and
Switzerland 47 per cent higher.
Among the best bargains in Britain are Heinz tomato ketchup, Kellogg's
cornflakes, Whiskas cat food and Palmolive washing liquid. All are half or
less the average European price.
However, some items still cost more in Britain than elsewhere. The UK price
of Ajax household cleaner is 8 per cent higher than the European average and
twice the level in Spain, while Nutella chocolate spread and Danone yoghurt
are respectively 10 per cent and 18 per cent above the European average.
The cheapest country after Britain is France, where the basket of
'Euro-brands' costs 96 per cent of the average, followed by Greece, Spain
and Germany.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Scheme to buy empty dwellings likely to beat 20,000 target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 750m government programme to buy 20,000 empty properties to provide
housing for the needy will almost certainly beat its target, according to
figures to be presented to officials this week.
The scheme to help the depressed British housing market, announced in the
Autumn Statement in November, is due to finish at the end of next month.
Just over half the 16,500 empty properties acquired so far have been bought
from recession-hit housebuilders, according to the Housing Corporation,
responsible for administering three-quarters of the money.
Another two fifths of the homes have been bought on the open market from
members of the public. Less than a tenth have been repossessed homes.
The findings will disappoint building societies and banks, which have been
struggling to reduce their estimated 65,000 stock of unsold repossessed
properties. A total of 200,000 empty homes is estimated to be on the market.
The corporation says many of the repossessed homes offered to housing
associations have been in poor condition. Properties must be suitable for
immediate occupation if the programme is to be completed in time.
English housing associations under the scheme are to receive Pounds 577m.
The rest of the money is to be spread between right-to-buy schemes, local
authorities and housing action groups in Wales and Scotland.
Almost three quarters of the English budget is to be spent on properties in
the south-east, which has been targeted by the government as the housing
market worst hit by the recession.
English associations so far have agreed to 16,500 purchases involving Pounds
530m of grants. They have already exceeded their target of 16,000 homes by
the end of March. The final total is likely to be between 17,000 and 17,500
according to the Corporation.
It says associations have been able to take advantage of falling house
prices. Builders offered special deals to reduce the amount of unsold stock
on their books.
Public sector grants under the scheme are expected to provide 60 per cent of
the sale price. The rest of the money is expected to be provided from
private investors. In total associations have spent nearly Pounds 1bn.

FT  22 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Nordic insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The eternal triangle of Nordic insurers - Hafnia, Skandia and Uni Storebrand
 -may become something of a magnet for overseas capital. Bidding for
Denmark's Hafnia closed on Friday, with the likes of AGF of France and
Denmark's Codan, controlled by Sun Alliance, still in the hunt. Uni
Storebrand's administrators must soon come forward with a plan to
recapitalise that business. Most of the funding is likely to come from
Norwegian institutions. But any auction of its 28 per cent stake in Skandia
should attract an international crowd.
Skandia itself has so far been happy to shrink its business in line with its
capital base. So its solvency ratio remains adequate despite the 20 per cent
decline in net asset value announced last week. If Swedish property values
continue to fall, though, fresh capital may be required. With more than 40
per cent of its shares in the hands of Hafnia and Uni Storebrand's
administrators, a rights issue looks difficult. An overseas partnership
which might take over these stakes must be an attractive option.
But a flow of foreign capital to the region could slow the return to
profitability by raising capacity too quickly. Nordic insurers are no
different from any others in that the most reliable source of capital is
retained profits.

FT  22 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: UK coal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Leaks and threats of legislation are doubtless the stock in trade of
Whitehall negotiations. Still, a large gap clearly remains between the
amount of coal the electricity generators want to take and what the
government is trying to unload. The basic deal, which gives British Coal a
contract for 40m tonnes this year, has been agreed: it will give a
significant boost to the generators' earnings. National Power and PowerGen
are willing to burn an additional 8m tonnes of subsidised coal a year by not
running stocks down rapidly and by displacing imported coal. That total
might be increased somewhat but it is still well short of the 13m tonnes
which Mr Heseltine thinks he needs to head off a government defeat. The
difficulty arises because the government is unwilling to curb gas or nuclear
output, or to sever its electrical French connection. At the same time the
generators are reluctant to stockpile coal which might be in their yards for
10 years, even if the government were to cover the carrying cost.
By running the generators shares up to all-time highs the market is betting
that a deal will be stitched up behind the scenes. Yet if the government
cannot ease a little extra room for coal in the electricity market it faces
a choice between trying to sell parliament a smaller coal industry and an
increasingly public squabble with National Power and PowerGen. As the
government still wants to sell its 40 per cent stakes in both companies, it
has an obvious incentive to find an acceptable solution before the market's
insouciance fades.

FT  22 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Advertising
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The brace of rights issues sprung upon the market by two advertising
agencies last week may have convinced investors that life is returning to
that most unfashionable of sectors. A glance at the agencies' share prices
only reinforces the conclusion. Abbott Mead Vickers has had a strong run in
recent weeks. Even WPP's and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's shares, which have long
lingered in the world of the living dead, have shown signs of resurrection.
They have outperformed the market by 39 per cent and 27 per cent
respectively over the past three months.
However, the sector's revival is based more on hope than expectation. In
theory advertising should be one of the first beneficiaries of an economic
upturn. So far at least, its practitioners have seen scant signs of it.
On closer inspection, last week's rights issues confirm this more cautious
view. Both companies want the money to position themselves for recovery
rather than meet specific expansion needs. Gold Greenlees Trott's Pounds 15m
cash call was designed to fund as yet unspecified acquisitions. Lopex's
Pounds 3.5m rights issue is being used to bolster its depleted balance
sheet. This should eventually help it chase new business, with clients as
much concerned with an agency's financial stability as its creative
credentials. Advertising's operational gearing will show through in time.
Investors, though, are being somewhat premature.

FT  22 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: ICI's splitting headache
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having christened its pharmaceuticals side and reformed its management
structure, ICI is just one small step from the giant leap of demerger. The
performance of its shares since the scheme was hatched last summer suggests
some scepticism of the practical benefits of separation. Even allowing ICI
the benefit of the doubt on that score, there is a danger its enthusiasm
will cloud its judgment on timing.
In the absence of a remarkable turn-around in the final quarter, ICI can
scarcely afford to pay a maintained dividend for 1992. Cutting the Pounds
400m pay-out would be easier to present as part of a demerger package. But
distributing a reduced dividend between the two sides of the business will
not be easy. Chemicals barely nosed into profit in the third quarter. A
cyclical chemicals business might be forgiven for paying an uncovered
dividend at this stage in the cycle, but over-capacity and a looming
European recession make it far from clear when this side of the business
will be in a position to pay its way. One way of assuaging such fears would
be for ICI to endow the chemicals balance sheet with cash, or ask the
pharmaceuticals side to bear a greater share of the dividend. That can only
be at the expense of Zeneca's rating.
The plan to raise Pounds 1bn cash for the group as a whole on a fancy
drugs-company multiple already looks dated. Glaxo now stands on a yield and
price-earnings multiple close to the market average. Since Zeneca is
suffering from the patent expiry of its biggest-selling drug - and has a
less promising research pipeline - it might be expected to trade somewhat
lower. By pricing its rights at a heavy discount, Zeneca could doubtless
attract underwriters to the issue. But the arithmetic suggests that a cash
call from a unified ICI would make more sense. By delaying demerger until
the prospects for both sides of its business are clear, ICI would leave
itself open to accusations of dithering. But fear of being seen as
indecisive is never a good reason for action.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Breaking up is hard to do: Imperial Chemical Industries will
this week decide whether it should split itself into two companies. Tony
Jackson and Paul Abrahams examine the implications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Wednesday, the 14 directors of Imperial Chemical Industries assemble for
the most important board meeting in the company's 67-year history. The topic
on the agenda is simple but momentous: whether the most distinguished
survivor of Britain's industrial past should split itself in two.
As they take their seats in the wood-panelled boardroom overlooking the
River Thames, the directors can be in little doubt about the outcome. In the
seven months since the plan was made public, the world recession has got
steadily deeper and the trading outlook grimmer. But however unlucky the
timing, ICI has invested too much effort and credit in the venture to pull
out.
The idea is that ICI should be carved into two separate companies: Zeneca,
which will comprise pharmaceuticals and other high-tech products, and a new
ICI, made up of bulk commodity chemicals.
The plan has the formidable backing of ICI's chairman, Sir Denys Henderson,
and the equally redoubtable Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief operating officer. It
also involves raising about Pounds 1bn of new money from the stock market.
It is, according to one of the non-executive directors, '99 per cent
certain' to go through.
Both the new companies face a rough ride; rougher, indeed, than could have
been foreseen when the plan was revealed last July. The European bulk
chemical market is in worse shape, according to some industry executives,
than at any time since the second world war. The plan envisages floating the
new ICI with a much reduced burden of debt. Even so, at least one board
member has expressed doubts on whether it would make enough profit in its
first year of operation to maintain its share of the dividend.
Zeneca's problem is slightly different. Its industry is largely
recession-proof. But like all international drug companies, it depends
heavily on the US market. The US patent of its biggest product, the heart
drug Tenormin, expired last year. US sales have since halved. Zeneca has no
big product to take its place, at least for the next two or three years.
It is central to the demerger plan that Zeneca should raise about Pounds 1bn
through a rights issue. This raises another problem. The newly-elected
Clinton administration has asserted its determination to slash healthcare
costs. The share prices of US and UK drug companies have tumbled as a
result.
Shares in Glaxo, the biggest UK drug company, have fallen by 17 per cent
since the turn of the year. Yet Glaxo has just reported a 16 per cent rise
in profits. Zeneca's profits for 1992 are widely expected to fall.
Pharmaceuticals aside, the rest of Zeneca's portfolio - consisting of
agrochemicals and speciality chemicals - is not in very good shape either.
The threat to European Community and US farmers posed by the Gatt round and
the reduction of farm subsidies is also a threat to the agrochemical
industry. In the UK, Germany and France the market fell on average by some 8
per cent last year. This year it may well fall further.
As for the speciality chemicals division, it made a mere Pounds 35m of
profits in 1991 on sales of Pounds 1.2bn. Profits this year are expected to
be lower. As a drug company, Zeneca is not among the industry's most
attractive. As a hybrid, it is less attractive again.
Given all the drawbacks, ICI's apparent determination to press ahead might
seem perverse. The counter-argument is that all these difficulties are
essentially temporary. The plan is designed for the longest possible term.
Nothing has changed in its underlying logic.
The chief argument for demerger, as expressed by Sir Denys and Mr Hampel
last July, is that it allows both parts of the business to concentrate on
what they do best. Some ICI directors argue that the business as it stands
is too complex and far-reaching to be understood by any one person. In
practical terms, there is no connection between the breeding of
pest-resistant crops at one extreme and the operation of giant petrochemical
complexes at the other.
In addition, Zeneca's drug business is by general consent not big enough to
stand alone in world terms. Freed from entanglement with the rest of ICI, it
could start to plan mergers or joint ventures of a kind which have become
commonplace in the world drug industry in recent years.
This is one reason for the planned Pounds 1bn rights issue. The other is
that Zeneca can then afford to take on most of the debt of the old ICI,
leaving new ICI to face the more volatile world of commodity chemicals with
a clean balance sheet.
There is another important motive for pressing on. In the months since the
plan was announced, the demerger has already gone ahead internally. This has
involved considerable upheaval, and is a source of occasional complaint
among ICI's middle managers. Indeed, it is suggested by competitors that ICI
has sometimes been too preoccupied with internal change to address itself
fully to its markets.
Faced with those arguments, the board can scarcely shelve the whole idea. To
do so would be to admit that the plan was misconceived at the outset. It
would also make it impossible to implement in anything like the same form in
future.
On the other hand, as the directors debate the arguments round the boardroom
table on Wednesday, they will doubtless reflect that their choice need not
be quite so clear cut.
They could postpone the demerger on the grounds of recession. They could
press on with the demerger, but postpone the rights issue until the market
for drug stocks has recovered. More daringly, City analysts suggest, they
could announce a rights issue not for Zeneca but for ICI in its present
form. They could then demerge at leisure.
The last option is not as fanciful as it sounds. It would certainly involve
a public change of tack: in its statement of July 1, ICI specified that any
rights issue would be held by Zeneca, or ICI Bio as it was then known.
But the attraction lies in the fact that while drug stocks are out of
fashion on the stock market, shares in supposedly cyclical companies such as
ICI are decidedly in vogue. Hence the curious fact that at Friday's closing
price of Pounds 11.18 per share, ICI's shares stand at a multiple of some 22
times last year's earnings.
In today's market, Zeneca could only expect an earnings multiple of little
more than half that. And the higher the multiple, the more cash can be
raised for a given number of shares. The original logic, that money raised
through the drug side could be obtained more cheaply, has thus been stood on
its head.
It is also becoming apparent that something more novel than an old-fashioned
rights issue is on the cards. ICI has made plain to its advisers that the
London institutions must be offered first refusal of the new shares in the
traditional way, if only because of their support against the predatory
manoeuvres of Lord Hanson a couple of years ago.
It is also adamant that the issue must be conventionally underwritten in
London, so that receipt of the Pounds 1bn is guaranteed in advance. But it
also wants to tap the resources of new shareholders, particularly in the US.
How these conflicting goals are to be reconciled is not yet clear. But to an
extent, these minutiae can be left to Warburg and ICI's other financial
advisers. The central decision to be weighed by the directors is of quite a
different order: whether to call a halt to ICI's remarkable history and
culture, and start afresh.
They might perhaps take courage from a historical analogy. The formation of
ICI in 1926 was Britain's response to the merger of the German chemical
industry into one gigantic conglomerate, IG Farben. At the end of the second
world war, IG Farben was broken up by the victorious allies into its
original constituents: Hoechst, Bayer and BASF.
All three went on to become world-class chemical companies, at least as big
as ICI itself. If ICI could perform the same trick by splitting itself in
two, it would be a satisfying act of historical revenge.

England must feel increasingly like enemy territory to the president of the

had to be smuggled in and out of the university to avoid demonstrators from
the 'Campaign for an Independent Britain'.
Admittedly there were only a dozen agitators, but that was a dozen more than
there were EC star-spangled blue banner wavers. The purpose of Delors's
secret mission was to attend a small seminar on 'relations between science,
ethics and society' - one of a series of EC-inspired powwows in ancient
university towns. Others have included 'law and democracy' in Poznan and
'the EC and the South' in Salamanca. Delors likes to look in on these
seminars, and plans to round them off with a grand conference early next
year.

But someone ought to have a quiet word with Senor Ignacio Arcaya,
Venezuela's new man in London. His plan to invite the powerful commons trade

Presumably, the British government was too occupied with explaining away
last week's terrible unemployment figures to notice that one of its oldest
lame ducks - the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company - has made a startling
recovery and is beginning to behave like a glamour stock.
Its profits and dividend rose by a quarter last year and cargo volumes were
up by 12 per cent. With results like these, it's hard to imagine there's a
recession on and even harder to imagine that this company spent almost two
decades in the government's intensive care unit. Today, its shares are
selling on 18 times fully taxed earnings and are trading at a premium to the
market. It is even talking of buying a rival port on the east coast.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Life at the top of the construction industry is just as insecure as at the
bottom judging from the abrupt departure of ex-French Kier chief Richard
Allen as boss of one of the world's biggest civil engineering projects -
building Hong Kong's Pounds 16bn airport.
It is not the first time that 50-year-old Allen has been out of work. He
parted company with Beazer in 1989, two years after it had taken over French
Kier. However, his departure this time was as swift as it was unexpected.
No one doubted his commitment to the airport. In two years he had built up
Hong Kong's Provisional Airport Authority from nothing to an organisation
employing 200 people. He was a single-minded and determined manager, but one
who had more than a touch of the 'one-man band' syndrome for his board's
liking.
A sign that all was not well came when more than 20 of the world's leading
consulting engineers refused to tender for certain aspects of the new
airport's design. In the words of their association they said they found the
risks they would have to accept if successful to be 'onerous' and the work
'so ill-defined and uncertain that it was impossible for the jobs to be
priced with any degree of realism.
It's up to Allen's replacement, Hank Townsend, a 60-year-old Bechtel man, to
make the PAA more user-friendly. He says his door is open to anyone and his
management style will be 'team based'. As for Allen, he left his job as he
had occupied it: tight-lipped and declining all comment to the media.

FT  22 FEB 93 / The UK's half-exposed economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How open is the British economy to international competition? What
proportion of British production has to keep abreast of foreign competition;
and what proportion is more insulated?
These are extremely important questions in relation to the value of an
anchor such as the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) in lowering and
then stabilising inflation. They are equally important outside the ERM, if
we are to gauge the ultimate inflationary potential of sterling's 16 per
cent effective devaluation since Black Wednesday last September and the
impact of future exchange rate changes.
It is scarcely credible that during more than a decade of ferocious debate
about the pros and cons of ERM membership, hardly anyone on either side
bothered to make any estimates of how open the British economy really is -
which would have been far more valuable than the actual debates.
To make such estimates, it is not enough to look at exports or imports as a
proportion of gross domestic product. For just as important are the products
which are made at home but for which imports could easily be substituted. An
article by Chris Mellis in the February Bank of England Bulletin* takes the
bull by the horns - or nearly so. Nearly so, because the author has for
statistical convenience used the weights in the Retail Prices Index as a
basis, even though they are based on consumption rather than production.
The author starts out by dividing the RPI into goods and services (omitting,
of course, mortgage interest payments), as goods are more exposed to trade
than services. For one measure of 'tradeables' he excludes seasonal
foodstuffs and taxes on drink and tobacco. For another measure he excludes
all food, drink and tobacco. The two variants make quite a lot of
difference. In the first case, the proportion of tradeables is 67 per cent;
in the second, it is only 40 per cent.
The truth must lie somewhere between the two. Food and drink are obviously
subject to international competition, but perhaps less so than other goods
after taking into account the very large element of transport and
distribution services in their retail price. As a rough approximation, one
might say that the openness of the British economy is a little over 50 per
cent.
The first finding to emerge from the Bank of England analysis is that the
tradeable sections of the RPI increased less rapidly than the rest of the
index - in fact, about 2 percentage points less since 1983. This is hardly
surprising in view of the lower rate of productivity improvement in the
services which make up the bulk of non-tradeables.
The differences are in the same direction in other European countries
although they seem a little smaller. Even Germany was not able to secure an
annual rate of price increase for tradeables averaging less than 2 per cent
in the best period of the 1980s.
Of course, few sectors of a relatively open economy can be insulated for
ever from international influence. If wages are held down in the tradeable
sector, labour will tend to move to the more sheltered areas, thus holding
down labour costs and thus prices there, too. It is reassuring, therefore
that sophisticated statistical tests showed some transmission of inflation
rates from the traded sector to the rest of the economy. If the UK could
achieve something similar to German performance consistently and not just in
recession years, the overall rate of inflation would fluctuate at about a
rate of 3 per cent or 4 per cent.
Not surprisingly, the gap between UK tradeable and non-tradeable price
increases has been at its largest in years when the real exchange rate has
been at a peak, thus limiting the ability of producers in the open sector to
pass on cost increases.
In 1992, the UK divergence was about 3 percentage to 4 percentage points.
The downward pressures were specially noticeable in clothing, footware,
leisure and household goods. The Bank author believes these exceptional
developments may have been connected with membership of the ERM, as this
could have influenced expectations in the tradeable sector. It is also
possible, however, that tradeables simply reacted more strongly to
recessionary forces.
In any case, I do not see how anyone looking at the charts and tables in the
Bulletin can regard the exchange rate as just a price like that of tomatoes
instead of the main link between inflation rates in Britain and those
overseas.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Financing the deficit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH government will borrow some Pounds 38bn (6 1/2 per cent of gross
domestic product) in the current financial year and, argues the Institute of
Fiscal Studies, another Pounds 54bn in 1993-94. That is just the beginning.
Under plausible assumptions, the government will be borrowing Pounds 1,000
for every man, woman and child in the country every year for many years to
come. But even such a borrower enjoys some choices.
They are not unlimited. Wherever the government borrows and however it
borrows, it faces highly positive real rates of interest. The only escape
from the trap would be borrowing in conventional long-term gilts, followed
by a burst of inflation. This was what happened after the second world war.
It must not happen again.
Even so, the government can - and should - try to minimise the real interest
rates it faces. Mr Lamont's target for inflation is 1-4 per cent. Judged by
the spread between index-linked and 15-year conventional gilts, now 4.8
percentage points, the non-taxpaying investors who purchase most of these
securities are not convinced by Mr Lamont. The government should put its
money where its mouth is, by borrowing in index-linked gilts. It could also
borrow short term at 6 per cent, rather than long at over 8 per cent.
That is not how things have been in 1992-93. The government's borrowings
this year include nothing shorter than a year, Pounds 5bn in conventional
gilts of 1-5 years maturity, Pounds 22bn in conventional gilts of over five
years maturity, a mere Pounds 3 3/4 bn in index-linked gilts and Pounds 4bn
via National Savings. Government funding also includes some Pounds 8 1/2 bn
in net foreign exchange intervention.
The Bank of England argues that the funding pattern is determined by what
investors want. But is it not rather a question of price? Maybe the
government regards index-linked gilts as an expensive way to fund, because
it does not believe in its own targets for inflation. Similarly, the
government may not believe short rates of interest are a bargain for
borrowers - house buyers, please note - because it expects them to shoot up
once more. As for turning borrowed D-Marks into sterling, this might be
rather profitable now, though it was certainly not before September 17.
The government needs also to reconsider from whom it borrows. The full-fund
rule, which requires it to sell securities to the non-bank private sector
equal to the public sector borrowing requirement, was designed in the
mid-1980s to ensure that government borrowing (or repayment) would have no
effect on broad money.
That never made sense when the government had ceased to believe broad money
was important. It makes even less sense now that the chancellor has a
monitoring range for M4 of 4-8 per cent. Since its growth has been well
below the bottom of that range, why not monetise some of the PSBR, ask the
monetarists? Others hold out the hope of lower yields on gilts, reduced
pressure on institutional cash flow and a supply of higher quality assets
for battered banks.
The case seems strong, but the government cannot just end the full-fund
rule. It has to replace it with another one: an M4 target, for example, or
perhaps a longer period over which full-funding would apply. Otherwise, the
beneficial effects of underfunding on gilt prices could be more than offset
by the effects of higher expected inflation on interest rates.
Expected inflation, not the mechanics of funding, is the fundamental issue.
Provided the government is thought to be committed to low inflation, it
should be able to finance the PSBR at manageable cost. The danger is the
fear that, as debt mounts, so too will the temptation towards another
inflationary default. Funding policy can aid credibility. But a government,
like any other borrower, can borrow cheaply and effectively only if it
demonstrates that its appetite has limits.
This is the fifth in a series of leaders on the March Budget.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Leading Article: After FYROM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST absurd, but not least dangerous, of Balkan squabbles is within
reach of solution. Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, has
retreated from the untenable position on recognition of the former Yugoslav
republic of Macedonia ('FYROM'), which he imposed on the EC.
At last June's Lisbon summit the EC, fearing that Greece would refuse to
ratify the Maastricht treaty, agreed to recognise the republic under any
name not including the term 'Macedonia'. The Greeks argue that this name
belongs exclusively to their own northern province, and that its use by
anyone else implies the revival of a scheme, current earlier in the century,
to create a larger Macedonian state including that province as well as part
of Bulgaria. The leaders of the new state repeatedly abjured any such
ambition, and amended their constitution so as explicitly to exclude it, but
to no avail.
Greek public opinion has become so inflamed that it must have taken courage
for Mr Mitsotakis to announce, earlier this month, that he is now willing to
accept a UN-sponsored arbitration process, leading to a name which could
include the word Macedonia, with a suitable epithet to distinguish it from
the Greek province. His retreat reflects awareness that international
support for Greece's position, never wholehearted, is crumbling.
Meanwhile, the UN Security Council is considering the republic's application
for UN membership. The three EC members currently serving on it - Britain,
France and Spain - have come up with an ingenious formula: the Council would
admit the republic while noting that its name is still in dispute, recommend
that this dispute be settled by arbitration, and decide that it will be
referred to as FYROM in the meantime.
Neither side has yet accepted this. The Greeks know that in practice the
state would be called Macedonia (as it already is), while Mr Kiro Gligorev,
the Macedonian president, fears excoriation by hardline nationalists in his
parliament if he agrees to compromise. He should be encouraged to stand up
to them: Macedonia has suffered enough from isolation, and the compromise
amounts in fact to a moral victory. His government should now concentrate on
a domestic problem which is much more serious: the tense relations between
its Slav majority and Albanian minority. Greece should take a leaf out of
Bulgaria's book and adopt the minuscule landlocked republic as a little
sister.
Even if one or both sides refuse to accept the compromise, the Security
Council should still adopt it. Balkan governments which do not feel strong
enough to face down nationalist passions may yet find it easier to bow to a
decree from the world's top authority.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Rocard's move
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHEL ROCARD has long been one of the leading contenders to succeed
President Francois Mitterrand as the standard-bearer of the French Socialist
party. At various times he has seemed to have at least an evens chance of
defeating the most plausible conservative rivals in that election. So his
call last week for the creation of a new broad-based liberal-left political
movement, to encompass socialists, ecologists and others, is doubly striking
since it comes on the very eve of next month's general elections.
The most immediate explanation, is that the socialist vote appears to be
facing a collapse of catastrophic proportions next month. From a peak of
more than 35 per cent in the late-1970s and early-1980s, the socialist score
looks set to fall to about 20 per cent; whereas the conservatives may take
40 per cent of the vote, with a huge majority in parliament. It is even
conceivable that the socialists may be overtaken by the ecologists.
The dilemma for the socialist leaders is that they cannot be sure how much
of the likely voting swing is due to temporary factors, and how much is
structural. Undoubtedly, there is a large element of popular protest at the
corruption in the Socialist party, coupled with indignation at the
contaminated blood scandal. No doubt there is also disillusionment that the
socialists have offered no remedy for rising unemployment. The unknown
question, is how far the fall of the Berlin Wall has stripped the socialist
label of political credibility.
But if the projected voting figures should, even in part, represent a
structural realignment of political sentiment in France, the socialists
might never be able to recover power on their own, and they would obviously
have an incentive to seek electoral allies.
Even so, Mr Rocard's move is a high-risk strategy, both in itself and in its
timing. The Socialist party leaders and the grass roots federations will not
support Mr Rocard's suggestion if they think it means the dissolution of the
party. In any case, it is hard to see how such a radical strategy can be
implemented in time to affect next month's elections.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Dutch rescue keeps Daf on the road: Government intervention
is unlikely to cause political controversy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
State ownership of industry in the Netherlands has never been widespread. So
this weekend's Fl 195m (Pounds 73.50m) government rescue of Daf, the
troubled Dutch truckmaker that was plunged into receivership three weeks
ago, puts the authorities in the novel position of controlling almost half
of one of the country's best-known companies.
The government's intervention reflects deep concern over the state of
domestic industry. Recently, a string of 'crown jewels' ranging from
Philips, the electronics group, to Fokker, the aircraft maker, have either
fallen on hard times or have had to turn to foreign companies for
assistance.
Unlike Britain, where privatisation has had strong ideological overtones,
the instrument of state intervention is a highly pragmatic one in the
Netherlands; it is designed to provide sufficient breathing space for a
company to put its house back in order.
The government's investment in the new slimmed-down Daf Trucks NV which will
be set up this week, will make it the biggest single shareholder with a
stake of more than 42 per cent in the successor venture. But the government
is a reluctant participant; it does not see itself as a long-term investor.
A similar approach was taken with Fokker in the late-1980s: the state
acquired 32 per cent of the aircraft maker's shares in a bail-out in 1987
but made clear from the outset that the company would eventually have to
find a strong partner if it wanted to develop new generations of aeroplanes.
In drawing up a rescue package for Daf, both the Dutch and the Flemish
region of Belgium - where Daf's axle and cab plant in based - were driven by
a keen sense of pragmatism: both wanted to safeguard only those jobs in
their territories.
The Dutch wanted to preserve 2,750 of the 7,000 jobs at Daf's home base in
Eindhoven, while the Belgians were keen to safeguard 750 of the 1,500 jobs
in Westerlo. The fate of Daf's UK subsidiary, Leyland Daf, which employed
5,500 people until the present crisis arose, is seen as a matter for the UK
government. The British government has refused to inject capital in the same
way as the Dutch and the Belgians.
The links between the Dutch and the UK plants, however, mean that UK
receivers have been able to secure potential supply agreements for the
British factories. This will help the factories to find the market solution
to their problems desired by the UK government.
The reluctance of Mr Michael Heseltine, the UK trade and industry secretary,
to intervene is not just because of the government's espousal of free-market
principles; his reluctance is also attributable to past support by
successive governments (Labour and Tory) for Leyland when it was part of the
wider British Leyland car, bus and truck group. British Leyland still failed
to find its feet despite millions of pounds of state aid, Mr Heseltine said.
No such political controversy is likely to be stirred in the Netherlands
over the Dutch government's financial support for Daf. On the contrary,
public opinion has been skilfully mobilised in support of the company.
Last week, unions and Daf's works council ran a successful campaign under
the motto 'Keep Daf on the road' to persuade more than 70,000 people and
companies to pledge Fl 12.5m towards a special Daf bond. Among the telephone
subscribers to the bonds were the Dutch prime minister, Mr Ruud Lubbers, and
all the members of the PSV football club, which is based in Daf's home town
of Eindhoven.
The government's decisive support of Daf does not, however, mean that it has
entered into an open-ended commitment. The rescue package - the first
undertaken by the government so far in the 1990s - differs from the
interventions of the 1960s and 1970s, when billions of guilders in the form
of state aid, grants and subsidies were poured into the shipbuilding and
textile industries. These state injections were designed to save jobs at all
costs in declining industries. But the policy failed, giving state
intervention a bad name during the late-1980s.
Under Mr Koos Andriessen, the economic affairs minister, the Netherlands has
moved to a policy of promoting high-skilled jobs rather than simply seeking
to preserve employment in declining sectors. Mr Andriessen believes Daf is a
company worth saving - at least in the Netherlands - because of its
high-tech base, its links with Dutch research institutes, and its importance
to smaller local suppliers.
Mr Heseltine has the same belief in the UK Daf operations. But he insists
that if they are to be bailed out then it should be by the market - not the
government.
The new Daf Trucks NV is, in effect, retreating to the heavy and
medium-truck base which characterised its activities before its takeover of
Leyland in 1987. It is for this reason that the new company has indicated
that it may be able to accommodate distribution of the Birmingham-made 45
series light van.
The rescue of Daf, however, is a risky venture that could yet cause
political embarrassment in the Netherlands if the company goes down a second
time, this time with government money. As it is, shareholders who
participated in Daf's flotation in 1989 have lost their investment, and
subscribers to this weekend's 'Save Daf' bond appeal run the risk that their
loan to the company may prove worthless if things go wrong again. In which
case, Mr Lubbers will have lost both the government's money and his own Fl
1,000 contribution to the Daf appeal.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Letter: UK's electricity structure not incompatible with
efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr SIMON TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial on the electricity generating duopoly ('Duopoly power',
February 15) asserts that 'there is already evidence that the duopoly does
not work to customers' advantage'. You also say that, were there to be a
reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the MMC could recommend
a break up into smaller units. I suggest the industry structure is quite
compatible with efficiency.
Although privatisation was not ideally carried out, the UK will soon have
some of the world's most efficient coal power stations, together with
environmentally friendly gas power. Economic theory moved away some time ago
from a simple association between industry structure and efficiency and any
argument based purely on the duopoly claim needs to be justified.
There are two theoretical benefits from break up: lower average production
costs and more competitive pricing of the output. On the first point, it is
scarcely credible that production costs would be lower with five or six
companies - on the contrary there are probably some economies of scale. Both
generating companies are now heading for a halved workforce with substantial
reductions in other operating costs.
On the second point, the regulator has accepted that pool prices remain
below avoidable costs. The pool will be a highly imperfect spot market for
some time to come, but there is no evidence that the generating companies
are exploiting their power, for the simple reason that they would gain very
little from it, but would immediately fall foul of the regulator. Both are
now careful to avoid any behaviour that could be construed as
anti-competitive. This largely removes any danger to the public interest.
Break up would therefore probably raise the overhead cost of electricity and
reduce the generation industry's purchasing economies in fuel and transport,
for little or no benefit in the pool. It would also rob the UK of the
opportunity to take a large position in the emerging foreign generation
market, where the two companies should be able to produce substantial
profits and export earnings in future.
Over the next five years, the electricity regulator will be able to point to
lower prices for most customers, better service and a choice of supply. This
is not a bad outcome for an imperfect privatisation.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Letter: Closures part of a pattern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr PETER DRAPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial on the proposed changes to the NHS in London ('Health
care in London', February 17) presents the controversial hospital plans as
'rationalisation'. This was certainly one feature but severe cuts were also
part of the package - 2,500 acute bed closures despite 132,000 Londoners on
waiting lists. For similar closures, the King's Fund estimated the annual
savings at Pounds 200m.
When it is realised that closure of several thousand other acute hospital
beds throughout Britain is currently planned, (for instance, 1,000 in
Edinburgh and in Glasgow, 500-1,000 in Liverpool), the London proposals are
seen as part of a pattern.
That pattern will delight a far-sighted Treasury, inflate waiting lists and
further fuel commercial medicine.
It would be most useful if the FT were to publish a national survey of these
planned closures and the estimated financial savings.
