FT  22 FEB 93 / Letter: Salvation Army not so silent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From JOHN LARSSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The FT ('Bank probed in Britain and US', February 20) gives a
misleading impression in saying that the Salvation Army has 'remained
silent' over developments in its attempts to recover Dollars 8.8m missing in
an alleged fraud.
The Army's intention to be open about the matter was reflected by the fact
that it issued a statement on February 16, which was widely reported in the
media.
It issued writs against 15 defendants. Extracts from these writs have been
widely reported.
The Army now has to balance the public's right to know the facts with the
need to recover the missing money. Its lawyers have advised that, to go
beyond the statement already made, could jeopardise that recovery.

commander, UK territory,

FT  22 FEB 93 / Letter: Right way out of a fiscal hole
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From M C KENNEDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Fiscal hole or fiscal panic? In your editorial ('Filling the fiscal
hole', February 9) you join forces with the OECD and Institute of Fiscal
Studies in calling for a tax increase to reduce the public sector borrowing
requirement. The reasons you give are, first, that the government's
anti-inflationary promise needs a tax increase if it is to be believed, and,
second, that a tax increase is required to prevent a spiralling rise in the
ratio of national debt to income.
On the first of these arguments you must be right, since almost any fall in
demand in the economy is likely to reduce inflation. Inflation, however, is
hardly a pressing problem at the moment, whereas mass unemployment and the
collapse of companies - which you do not even mention - most certainly are.
On the problem of the spiralling national debt, may I suggest that it should
not, and would not, arise if the Treasury knew how to manage its finances.
It is absurd, in a recession, that it should be thought necessary to add to
the interest-bearing national debt in order to find the funds for public
expenditure. There is no reason in principle why the Treasury should not
borrow directly, and free of interest payments, from the Bank of England. In
practice, the Bank and Treasury have put their own obstacles in the way of
such a simple act of credit creation. But this means that it is the
authorities' own act of self denial, not the PSBR, which must be held
responsible for adding to the interest-bearing debt - and also for the taxes
needed to pay the interest. To be blunt, it is Treasury folklore which
threatens to raise the tax burden, and taxpayers should object.
Naturally, one would not advocate direct credit creation when the economy is
fully stretched - as, for example, in wartime. But in times like the present
it is the clearest way out of what you call the 'fiscal hole'. M C Kennedy,

and social studies,

FT  22 FEB 93 / Mainland moves the market: Shares in Chinese companies are
hot property in Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The appearance on the Hong Kong stock market today of Denway Investments, a
holding company for state-owned automotive assets in the southern Chinese
province of Guangdong, is the clearest example of the transformation that is
taking place in Hong Kong's financial markets.
The stock market - which has been dominated by property companies, financial
institutions, trading houses and utilities - is broadening to encompass
large manufacturing and industrial companies, many of which are based in
China and controlled by official interests on the mainland. The result is
that four and a half years before its reversion to Chinese sovereignty, Hong
Kong is laying claim to the title of 'China's financial centre'.
Local and international demand for Chinese assets has grown sharply over the
past 12 months. For investment managers the reason is plain. Says Mr Robert
Lloyd George, chairman of Lloyd George Management, one of the
fastest-growing fund managers in Hong Kong: 'There is no more exciting
economy in the world than China's. It is the emerging industrial power in
Asia and Hong Kong has the market to play it; it is like Tokyo 30 years
ago.'
The Denway issue set a record for the Hong Kong market in the level of
oversubscription for a new issue. Investors found HKDollars 240bn (Pounds
21bn) for 330m shares valued at HKDollars 400m, or 657 times the amount on
offer. The best a single investor could have done in the allocation was just
eight 'board lots', the tradable parcel of shares on the colony's bourse, or
16,000 shares in total. For that amount he would have had to bid for 10m
shares and put up HKDollars 12.2m.
Popular interest in Denway came as little surprise. New issues - especially
those involving mainland companies - have become a one-way bet. They are
usually underpriced and successful applicants in the primary issue are able
to make considerable sums by immediately selling a stock when it is listed.
Denway's current 'grey market' price is more than twice its HKDollars 1.22 a
share issue price.
But of more significance than the ability to 'stag' an issue has been the
influence on Hong Kong of economic reform and liberalisation in China. Last
year, the country's Gross Domestic Product grew by more than 12 per cent.
Economists' forecasts of continued strong growth this year has strengthened
international business interest in China. Not even the current difficulties
Hong Kong is having with Beijing about its political development have doused
investor interest in what are locally known as 'China plays' or 'red (pace
Marx) chip' stocks.
Such stocks will increasingly become available to international investors.
In the next 12 months nine large Chinese state enterprises - embracing
petrochemicals, brewing, ship building, steel and machine tools - will be
brought to the Hong Kong market.
They will differ from Denway, which is a Hong Kong incorporated holding
company, and Brilliance China Automotive, a Bermuda registered company,
brought to the New York market last September, in that they will be
incorporated under Chinese law.
This presents a difficult test for merchant bankers because many Chinese
companies comprise much more than businesses; they often include schools,
hospitals and housing and are responsible for the provision of welfare for
their workers. Consequently, it is difficult to place a value on the
companies and estimates of the aggregate amount of capital to be raised for
the nine vary widely. Forecasts range from HKDollars 7bn to as much as
HKDollars 25bn.
But the long-term significance for the Hong Kong stock market of the
flotations exceeds the amount of capital to be raised. The new issues,
merchant bankers believe, reflect a decision by the Chinese regulatory
authorities to make Hong Kong the main market for raising foreign capital
for corporate China.
Underlying merchant bankers' confidence was the barely disguised official
anger at the approval given to Brilliance to list in New York. It slipped
through a gap in regulation created by the transfer of responsibility for
stock exchange matters to the Securities Regulation Commission (SRC) from
the People's Bank, China's central bank, late last year. The SRC moved
quickly in January to prevent Shanghai Petrochemicals - one of the nine -
from seeking a primary listing in New York, as its adviser Merrill Lynch was
encouraging it to do. It was told to list in Hong Kong.
The reasoning of Chinese officials in their preference for Hong Kong is is
simple and turns on the colony's reversion to Chinese sovereignty on July 1
1997. On that date, China will have a stock market run on western lines and
backed up by western regulation and Hong Kong's version of British common
law, ensuring property rights. But most important for mainland companies is
the Hong Kong dollar's fixed rate against the US dollar. This means that
Chinese companies raising funds in Hong Kong will effectively be raising
fully convertible, dollar-backed, funds.
Already Hong Kong has become a significant capital market for mainland
companies and Hong Kong companies expanding in China. Warburg estimates that
of the HKDollars 73.5bn of gross equity (equity before dividends are
subtracted) raised in Hong Kong last year, the amount raised for Chinese
companies and China-related business ventures was nearly HKDollars 20bn.
This year Warburg forecasts that capital raised for China and China-related
ventures will be about HKDollars 35bn.
Mr Ewan Cameron Watt, head of Far East research at Warburg Securities,
expects that a second wave of Chinese state companies and western-Chinese
joint ventures will follow the nine forthcoming listings and will bring
structural change to the Hong Kong market. His views are echoed by Mr Andrew
Bell, head of corporate finance at South China, a local brokerage, who
estimates that up to 50 mainland companies could be lining up to seek a Hong
Kong listing once the first nine have been digested.
'If the listing of nine succeeds - and with reputations and careers in China
riding on their success, I think they will - then the gates will be open,'
he says.
Fund managers agree. Mr Lloyd George believes that, by the end of the
decade, China-related listings in the Hong Kong market will account for 45
per cent of its capitalisation which he estimates will have grown to
USDollars 900bn from USDollars 175bn in 1992.
Foreign investors have been swayed by such predictions. Since last March,
more than USDollars 1.5bn has been put into China investment funds. This
compares with the USDollars 920m for the combined market capitalisation of
both the Shanghai and Shenzhen 'B' share market - the only way, other than
through Hong Kong, that international investors can own tradeable equity in
mainland Chinese companies.
But not all fund managers are convinced of the wisdom of investing in
mainland companies listing in Hong Kong. Mr Oscar Wong, who manages GT
Management's USDollars 30m China fund, for example, is sceptical about the
prospects.
'On average I don't think they are very good companies and they will give
foreign investors a bad impression of what is happening in China,' he says.
'They are not efficiently managed and it will take a long time to reorganise
them.'
But the Beijing government is determined to succeed in its plans to bring
state enterprises to the capital markets of the neighbouring colony. For
Hong Kong, success in this strategy will underwrite its own future. As Mr
Archie Hart, head of research at Crosby Securities, notes: 'If Hong Kong has
a future role it is as the financial capital of southern China.'

Sir, Your report, 'Watchdog to probe complaints against taxman' (February
19) contains one error which needs to be corrected. You said: 'The Revenue
received 15,000 complaints last year, of which 100 were referred to the
government's ombudsman. Yesterday it said it expected the adjudicator to
handle 20 to 50 complaints a month.'
I am certainly not the government's ombudsman. I serve parliament and the
results of my investigations were rightly described by Mr Francis Maude,
when financial secretary to the treasury, as not always comfortable to the
government.
The new Revenue adjudicator will, I hope, be able to sort out many
complaints between taxpayers and the Revenue, but he is to be appointed by
the board of Inland Revenue. While this latest initiative is welcome, it
will still be open to dissatisfied taxpayers to ask members of parliament to
refer their grievances to the parliamentary ombudsman. William Reid,

FT  22 FEB 93 / Arts: Don Pasquale/Turandot - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Patrick Mason's version of Donizetti's subtle comedy arrives at the Coliseum
with clod-hopping coarseness from Opera North, for whom it was conceived
with much of the same cast three years ago. Time has done nothing to mellow
it or lend any discrimination to its relentless, elbow-nudging jokiness.
Some of the excesses have apparently been trimmed back, but more than enough
of the deadly gags remain to ensure that the production remains irredeemably
vulgar and unperceptive.
A fair proportion of the audience did laugh heartily at Friday's opening,
but to me it seemed as glum an evening at a comic opera as one could have
the misfortune to encounter. Early in the preparations for this staging the
production team appears to have decided that Don Pasquale is so weak
dramatically or musically, perhaps even both, that it needs all possible
help to come alive on stage. If even this Donizetti agnostic can hear that
the opera is both a fount of delightful music and a subtle and affectionate
comedy of manners, one can wonder how that basic perception managed to
escape Opera North and now ENO, which is proud to announce this as the
company's first new Donizetti production for 25 years.
Mason and his designer Joe Vanek set Don Pasquale in the Rome of the 1990s;
Pasquale is a hard-nosed property developer, Ernesto a feckless yuppy,
Norina a fashion-follower who runs a pavement kiosk. The updating works
smoothly, but brings no fresh insight or perspective. Instead there are just
added opportunities for feeble jokes, each one repeated several times, about
gawping American tourists, Italian motor scooters, indolent house painters,
bimbos from aerobics classes. The level of humour never rises above the
obvious; most of it wouldn't be out of place in a Christmas pantomime, so
that one half expects a song sheet to descend from the flies in the final
scene.
Musically, though, it does pass muster. Andrew Greenwood conducts with
breezy efficiency, even if understandably in the circumstances he never
seeks out the melodic buoyancy of the score. Within the parameters set for
him Andrew Shore was again a model of comic timing and style; no depth is
required of course, and his patter with Alan Opie's Malatesta was slick and
expert. Adrian Martin was a plausible, full-toned Ernesto until his vocal
line took him above the stave, when the sound became constricted. Best of
all was Rosemary Joshua's Norina, entering fully into the spirit of the
production, catching the double-takes with assurance and getting around her
coloratura with aplomb. In a non-vintage season at ENO, Ms Joshua's deserved
emergence as a principal is a precious highlight.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAFELY RETURNED from Wembley to Covent Garden, Andrei Serban's celebrated
production of Puccini's Turandot began a new run of 11 performances on
Saturday. By the end, every solo role will have been sung by two or three
different artists; but on Saturday Turandot herself was again Dame Gwyneth
Jones, steely and indomitable as ever, with Vladimir Popov in reliably lusty
voice as her Prince Calaf.
As rehearsed by Vernon Mound, the staging still looks terrific in Sally
Jacobs' designs, though memory says that Ping, Pang and Pong's athletic
exertions used to be even more strenuous. The new Pong is Ian Thompson,
whose true tenor was a touch lightweight for their trios. The opera is now
conducted by Mark Ermler, whose customary broad authority was evident once
past Act 1 (where there was some first-night disarray). The Romanian soprano
Angela Gheorghiu made a striking debut as poor Liu, affectingly pale and
pretty. The voice is free, even and secure, with unexpected strength in her
last aria. She has a lovely dignity; one was glad that in this production,
her tortures are only symbolic.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Arts: Spic-O-Rama - New York Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Leguziamo is a prodigiously talented young performer whose recent
one-man play Spic-O-Rama reveals that he is on the way to an excellent
writing career. In Spic-O-Rama, which played at New York's Westside Theatre,
Leguziamo portrays, in turn, six members of the Gigante family of Jackson
Heights, Brooklyn, as they prepare for their eldest son's wedding.
Everything about Spic-O-Rama, from its title to its pre-show disclaimer that
'this Latin family is not representative of all Latin families . . . if your
family is like this one, please seek professional help,' to Leguziamo's
appropriation of stock types for their comic and tragic value, makes clear
that he is not going to pander to those who have called his work politically
incorrect. The Gigantes are, as their name suggests, larger than life, but
what makes this play effective satire is that it springs from Leguziamo's
unflinching societal observation.
Spic-O-Rama wants editing - it's too long and becomes heavy-handed - but
Leguziamo's performances and energy carry the evening.
Roy Arcenas' set places us in an archetypical urban wasteland of dented
chrome, graffiti and chain-link fences. In bounds nine-year-old Miggy
Gigante, sporting trendily oversized jeans, and tranquiliser-worthy excesses
of energy. Miggy begs us to take him away from his family of 'monsters,
freaks and weirdos': 'you don't have to go to a third-world country to adopt
me - I'm here]'
Slide shows and musical montages keep the play moving while Leguziamo is
offstage changing costumes. He next emerges as teenaged Raffi, a would-be
Shakespearian actor, who claims he's the bastard son of Laurence Olivier.
Desert Storm veteran Krazy Willy wonders why he's not considered a hero for
having shot at 'people who look like us except they have towels on their
heads'.
Leguziamo's characterisations are all remarkable, but materfamilias Gladyz,
who minds the family launderette, is his greatest feat. Her bitchy prattling
about a life trapped in endless cycles of spin dryers and baby-making is the
production's most acidly funny segment.
Two unsubtle portraits blunt Spic-O-Rama's effectiveness. Wheelchair-ridden
brother Xavier spouting bile about his screwed-up family is an obvious and
heavy-handed symbol, and, having met the rest of the family, it is
absolutely no surprise that father Felix, who gives an overlong wedding
toast at the play's end, is a sexist lout.
Despite sell-out audiences, Spic-O-Rama played only a limited engagement in
New York, largely because Leguziamo's talents are in demand. He is appearing
in the film Super Mario Brothers with Bob Hoskins, has filmed both
Spic-O-Rama and his previous series of monologues, Mambo Mouth, for Home Box
Office cable TV, and is working on his first screenplay.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Arts: A bright baton - BBC Symphony
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Friday's BBC Symphony concert was exciting to hear on Radio 3 - even more,
no doubt, in the Festival Hall. That was not only because the peerless Hakan
Hardenberger played Peter Maxwell Davies' recent trumpet concerto, but
because the conductor Eduardo Mata had bright, unexpected ideas about his
otherwise hyper-familiar programme.
At the start, his crisp, punchy reading of Mozart's 'Haffner' Symphony gave
notice that this was not to be a run-of-the-mill concert. Mata is Mexican,
and like most musicians from the Hispanic world he prefers rhythms to be
extremely taut: not rigid, for (as we were to hear in his Ravel) he likes
bold rubato nuances too, but precise and snappy. It was delightful, for once
in a way, to hear Mozart's Andante sped along with such unhesitating energy.
The Davies concerto, a sort of mini-opera with the trumpet in the role of
Saint Francis, was an experience in itself. Hardenberger's virtuosity is of
the gleaming, well-honed kind, where the dedicatee of the work, John
Wallace, cultivates a greater variety of quasi-vocal sounds and shadings;
but as the piece proceeded toward its visionary close, Hardenberger's
fantastic security (the part is taxing to the nth degree) established its
own spell.
Mata drew marvellous colours from the orchestra. The long passage in which a
dark brass chorale evolves over a darker bass pedal, while marimbas and
glockenspiel twinkle above like sunlight on Orcadian waves and the trumpet
soars in high, slow phrases, was memorably beautiful. Easy to understand why
only Hardenberger and Wallace, so far, have dared to perform this work; but
it must surely have an assured future.
The concert belonged to the BBC's 'French Connection' series, with the
excuse of two Ravel pieces in the second half. But that proved to be more
than just an excuse; Mata had points to make. La Valse followed directly
upon the Valses nobles et sentimentales, with no applause permitted between.
Where the Valses are generally treated as delicate parlour-inventions - the
original piano-writing is notably spare - Mata aimed to show just how
closely akin they are to the grander, wilder La Valse.
The first of the VNS was a full-scale explosion, the seventh an expansively
dramatic study in sweeping and swooning. In all the slighter waltzes, Mata
reminded us forcefully that though the piano score may be spare, Ravel's
orchestral version is sumptuously tricked out. Innumerable details that
usually whisper past the ear became vivid and significant. The nightmare of
La Valse came as a natural culmination (or inevitable disaster) - just as
Mata intended, obviously. Fascinating.

connected with all matters sexual in the early years of this century. Vastly
inferior is ITV's Good Sex Guide (10.40pm) which seems more concerned with
getting a succession of familiar telly faces on to the screen than with the
standard of its journalism. Horizon tries to establish how the Egyptians
built the pyramids (8.00pm BBC2). World In Action investigates the grubby
activities of the Conservatives during Clinton's presidential campaign
(8.30pm ITV). Cutting Edge (9.00pm C4) goes into insurance claims,
especially the fraudulent sort. And Panorama weighs in, somewhat late, with
a report on the British monarchy (9.30pm BBC1). BBC1's new comedy series
Bonjour la Classe (8.30pm) is about a school teacher, which brings to mind
'Whacko' and 'Please Sir]'. Nigel Planer splutters energetically but to
little effect.

<TEXT>
The facts about the new Chelsea and Westminster Hospital are pretty
extraordinary. It is the only brand new urban teaching hospital in Britain.
It is described as the largest and most ambitious hospital development in
the UK. It has 70 different departments, 665 beds, eight operating theatres
and 260 bedrooms for nursing staff. It was planned and built in five years -
a record for the NHS. The building cost Pounds 117m to construct. It opens
in London as the government announces plans to close several London
hospitals because there are too many hospital beds in the capital . . .
The new hospital is situated on the site of the old St Stephen's Hospital in
the Fulham Road. The old hospital had grown from the infirmary of the former
St George's Union Workhouse and no tears were shed when it was decided to
demolish it. But tears were shed by some over the decision to close four
hospitals - Westminster Hospital, Westminster Children's Hospital, the West
London Hospital and St Mary Abbots Hospital and to bring all the services
they offered to the new site at the congested end of the Fulham Road,
surrounded mainly by streets of modest houses. This was very much an estate
management manoeuvre of the 1980s which depended for its success on the
willingness of property developers to buy the old hospital sites to fund the
new building.
Architects for the new development were chosen by the Riverside Health
Authority through a form of limited competition, which was won by the firm
Sheppard Robson (the partner in charge of the scheme was Sinclair Webster).
In many ways the new hospital represents the new style NHS. I was fascinated
to learn that the architects were chosen not so much because they had
designed lots of hospitals (they hadn't) - but because they had plenty of
commercial experience and were ready to design for a 'fast track approach'.
Sheppard Robson has a record of competence in the design of research
laboratories, universities, shopping centres, offices and housing. At Triton
Court, Finsbury Square, it designed the most agreeable and successful large
atrium in the City; its work at Royal Mint Court is perhaps less successful.
As a well established British firm that has successfully operated in both
the public and the private sectors, it was particularly well placed to plan
the first of a new generation of hospitals.
The brief called for a very large building on a site that is surrounded by
small-scale houses and shops and suffers from a planners' height
restriction. The unusual decision was made to incorporate shops (as yet
unlet) on the Fulham Road entrance front, and to design the whole hospital
around a huge glazed atrium which is like an indoor street. It is naturally
lit and ventilated, using the power of the sun and the heat loss from the
surrounding building. The atrium is the most remarkable element of the
design and is something of a tour de force as a unifying element in the
whole hospital.
You enter the hospital beneath a faintly absurd Teflon canopy on the Fulham
Road and proceed through the slowly revolving doors, as though you were
going into a supermarket. Wheelchairs and zimmer frames can be accommodated
by the moving doors. The main reception desk commands the entrance to the
atrium and is manned by friendly attendants. (It seemed to me that the
success of the whole hospital depends on the patience of the staff on the
main desk. Because of the size of the hospital they are going to be asked
for directions 24 hours a day.)
The huge white atrium, with lifts and escalators, defines the centre of the
building, but the actual circulation, and finding your way, still depends
largely on signs and graphics. These are definitely inadequate and, much as
the architects may deplore the spread of the handwritten notices, they will
soon be everywhere. I was amazed how difficult it was to read the signs and
felt initially as confused as I do in an airport. Because the architecture
is so uniform and the overall colours so bland, there are few markers to
guide the visitor or the patient. Also, people are so preoccupied in
hospitals that they get lost much more often than they do in other
buildings, and so need more help from the architecture rather than less.
But in the atrium you do not feel as though you are in a hospital at all. It
is an enjoyable place to be and the idea of inserting separate small
buildings into the space - such as the chapel and the dispensary  - adds a
little human scale. There is also a great deal of art around the place, some
good and some terrible. On the whole the paintings are better than the
sculpture, especially the waterfall series by Mel Chantry. Giant trees help
to furnish the atrium but at the same time contribute to the sense of
unreality; they have to be lit by special lights and will need a lot of
care.
When you reach the waiting areas for the out-patients they come as something
of an anticlimax after the brilliant height of the atrium. These low spaces,
filled with ghastly NHS furniture that must have been a job lot from the
1950s, often have no views of the atrium and not much light. The wards are
fairly standard, with groups of six or eight beds separated from the staff
areas by low walls. The ward floors work well with a sense of semi open-plan
allowing a fair degree of privacy. Again the furniture is disappointing -
Parker Knoll of the '50s reigns supreme.
I am sure that patients well enough to totter about will make for the atrium
all the time because it brings a light and elegant dimension to the whole
hospital. Its lighting is stylish and there is constant activity, and the
whole idea of making one big space for all the vertical and horizontal
circulation is a brave one. The size of the hospital was not the architects'
decision; it could be overwhelming, especially to the elderly finding their
way about unescorted.
From the outside the design of the main building is orderly and controlled
and fits a great deal on to a small site as unobtrusively as anyone could
expect. I would not want the great chimney at the bottom of my expensive
Chelsea garden, but I do feel that the architects have done their very best
to be good, if large, neighbours.
Is this the first of a series, or the last of a line of NHS hospitals? I
would have thought that patients prefer smaller hospitals, less enclosed
worlds for medicine, and less evidence of the scale of the vast NHS
bureaucracy.
There is one completely marvellous thing in the new hospital. Not so long
ago a wise chaplain of the Westminster Hospital acquired a magnificent
painting of the resurrection by Paolo Veronese (1528-1588), which has now
been moved with its glorious gilt frame to the chapel at the heart of the
new hospital. It is of such superb quality that, in every way, it outscales
its surroundings.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Construction Contracts: Apartments in Abu Dhabi
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Following six months of negotiations, JOHN LELLIOTT INTERNATIONAL has been
awarded two overseas contracts approaching Pounds 100m. The first is for the
construction of a 24-storey luxury development on the Abu Dhabi Cornishe.
The project, valued at Pounds 60m consists of 20 levels of apartments, four
levels of retail space and four levels of underground car parking, was
negotiated with representatives of His Highness Sheikh Saife bin Mohamed Al
Nahyan. Negotiations continue for a second project in Abu Dhabi for a
22-storey block of offices in Hamdan Street valued at Pounds 40m.
Lelliott attribute their success in part to a pioneering approach to the
design of the project using fast track techniques based on the use of a
steel structure, a method of construction little in evidence in the UAE in
recent years.
Work is scheduled to commence on site in May 1993 and is to be completed in
22 months.
The second contract is a resort development in St Lucia, West Indies, where
agreement has been concluded with New Century Developments Inc, New York,
US, in respect of a hotel, casino, golf course and villa complex valued at
USDollars 49m (Pounds 33.8m).
The construction management agreement, which is in joint venture with
Balfour Beatty Inc, is set to commence in June. The development is designed
on a high quality/low maintenance specification.

FT  22 FEB 93 / People: Ayling changes his crew
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Valerie Scoular, general manager of British Airways' ground operations in
London, has been promoted to be director of human resources. She will be
responsible for the administration and development of 49,000 staff.
Scoular's promotion is part of the second big reorganisation of BA's
marketing and operations team in less than 18 months. The last time the
changes were precipitated by the abrupt departure of BA marketing chief Liam
Strong to become chief executive at Sears. This time they have been
triggered by the promotion of Robert Ayling, Strong's successor at BA, to be
group managing director.
Ayling has taken the opportunity to reorganise his old marketing and
operations department. In addition to the existing flight operations, human
resources and engineering and information management departments, Ayling has
set up seven new units: regions and sales; marketing; network management;
operations; service delivery; cargo and business units.
Scoular, 37, who joined BA as a graduate trainee in 1977, is taking over the
human resources part of the job being done by John Watson, director of human
resources and information management. Brian Haydon, the current deputy, has
been made director of information management. Meanwhile, Watson has been
appointed director of regions and sales and takes charge of the airline's
sales activities worldwide as well as regional management.
Among the other new appointments are Mike Street, director of service
delivery; Kevin Hatton, director, cargo; and Mike Batt, director of
marketing. BA is looking for a head of business units, who will be
responsible for airline subsidiaries.
However, Ayling's new empire is not as big as it sounds. BA has confirmed
that Sir Colin Marshall, the new chairman, retains direct executive
responsibility for finance, corporate strategy, safety, security and
environment, health services, company secretariat, legal, communications and
public relations. The respective directors and heads of these departments
report directly to him.
*****
For the first time since the summer of 1991, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi will have a
finance director on the main board. Wendy Smyth, who has been chief
financial officer, is promoted with effect from April 1.
Charles Scott, who joined the company at the same time as Robert
Louis-Dreyfus in January 1990 and helped steer it through a period of
much-needed restructuring, had been finance director until July 1991. He
then became chief operating officer but retained board-level
responsibilities for finance as well. Now Louis-Dreyfus has departed for
Adidas, and Scott has stepped up to become chief executive.
The company says that the title of chief operating officer has been lost; it
had been appropriate when Scott was sorting out the individual operating
units, 'but now that task is completed and we are paired down to a minimum,'
according to a spokeswoman .
Smyth, 39, who trained at Thomson McLintock, joined Saatchis in the US in
1982, before becoming UK regional finance director in 1984. Between 1986 and
1989 she was finance director of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising
International, and then held the same position in the communications
division.
Saatchis will in fact be without a finance director for another three months
because in late March Smyth goes on maternity leave - timed when it had been
expected that Louis-Dreyfus would stay until June. Her responsibilities will
be spread around the finance department, although the break comes at a quiet
time, after the year's results are announced on March 9.
*****
Sir Christopher Hogg, chairman of Courtaulds, has been appointed to the
board of SMITHKLINE BEECHAM on the resignation of Alain Gomez, chairman and
chief executive of Thomson SA. Sir Archibald Forster (right), recently
retired chairman and chief executive of Esso UK, has been appointed a
non-executive director at UNITED NEWSPAPERS.

Frank Amhurst has retired from HARMONY LEISURE.

Big business comes to town. Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of Grand
Metropolitan, chaired the first board meeting last week of London Forum, a
group of business leaders who want to help promote London overseas. Seated
to the left of Sir Allen are Jan Hall, chief executive of Coley Porter Hall,
and Michael Howard, the environment secretary. Back row from left: Brian
Pearce, chairman Pearce Signs; Clyde Williams, chief executive WWA; Nigel
Fox-Bassett, senior Partner Clifford Chance; Sir Brian Jenkins, partner,
Coopers &amp; Lybrand and former Lord Mayor of London; Sir Idris Pearce,
chairman English Estates; Sir David Scholey, chairman S G Warburg, and Sir
Colin Marshall, chairman British Airways.
The other members of the board are Sir Hugh Bidwell, chairman London Tourist
Board, Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman Wembley, Sir Christopher Bland, chairman
LWT, Harvey Goldsmith, director Allied Entertainments, David Goldstone,
chairman Regalian Properties, Ian Reeves, chairman Highpoint and Maurice
Saatchi, chairman Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.

BALFOUR BEATTY, based at Thornton Heath, Surrey, has received its
largest-ever civil engineering contract in the United States with an
USDollars 86m (Pounds 60.1m) award to replace a rail viaduct and drawbridge
in Bridgeport, Connecticut with new and partially refurbished structures.
The project for the Metro North Commuter Railroad involves the replacement
of Peck drawbridge and the refurbishment of Bridgeport viaduct which
together carry passenger trains on the line running from New York to Boston
as it passes over the Pecquonock river.
A temporary crossing of the river will be constructed to carry two lanes of
rail traffic during the demolition and while the rebuilding work programme
is in progress.
Once the temporary crossing is fully operational the drawbridge will be
completely demolished while the viaduct will be dismantled in stages.
The new 1.25km structure will be constructed using concrete and structural
steel. The contract is scheduled for completion in 1998.

The four-storey building will have a total floor area of 27,000 sq metres
and will be constructed of an in situ reinforced concrete frame clad in buff
coloured precast stone panels. The pitched roof will be finished in Welsh
slate.
The building will be fully air-conditioned and the repositories, which have
stringent environmental requirements, will be separated from other areas by
atria.
A computer controlled car and track system will also be installed for
document transfer between the repository and the search rooms. Extensive
landscaping will assist in the integration of the existing building with the
extension and provide an appropriate civic setting at the Thamesside
location.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Economics: Focus on recovery prospects in G7 industrialised
nations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTENTION remains focused on the US this week, after the unveiling of
President Bill Clinton's programme to tackle the budget deficit and
stimulate economic recovery.
Although The US January consumer confidence index due tomorrow is expected
to be unchanged, the quarterly GDP figures due on Friday are expected to
show a 4.5 per cent annualised growth, underlining the strength of the US
economy at the time of President Clinton's election.
With the UK also due to publish fourth quarter GDP figures this week, debate
continues about the prospects for economic recovery.
Although the GDP is predicted to be slightly down on last year, it is
expected to show some improvement over the previous quarter. The CBI's
monthly industrial trends survey on Friday will give a more up to date
picture of business mood.
The G7 finance ministers will meet in London on Saturday, amid continuing
concern over the state of the world's economy, but no communique or decision
is scheduled.
Some of the week's economic highlights follow: the figures in brackets
represent median forecasts, supplied by MMS International, a financial
information company.
Today: UK, fourth quarter GDP (up 0.2 per cent on quarter, down 0.4 per cent
on year). US, January Treasury budget (Dollars 27bn). France, December
current account; January official reserves. Canada, seasonally adjusted
December retail sales (up 0.6 per cent on month), December department store
sales (up 0.5 per cent on month).
Tomorrow: US, Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan gives Humphrey
Hawkins testimony to House banking subcommittee; January consumer confidence
index (77 per cent). UK, quarterly analysis of long term unemployment.
Wednesday: US, President Clinton meets British Prime Minister John Major;
January durable orders (down 2.3 per cent), shipments, auto and truck sales
February 11 to 20. Canada, December wholesale trade (up 0.4 per cent on
month); France, fourth quarter GDP (down 0.2 per cent).
Thursday: Belgium, EC ministers discuss steel industry. Germany, banking
sector wage talks third round. UK, January trade balance with non-EC
countries (Pounds 1.3bn deficit). US, money supply week ending February 15,
initial claims week ending February 13, January existing home sales. Canada,
January industrial production price index (up 0.3 per cent on month).

FT  22 FEB 93 / The Week Ahead: Results due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the UK's largest manufacturer, reports its
preliminary year-end results on Thursday, and pretty grim reading they will
make. Hoare Govett expects the group to report fourth quarter pre-tax
profits of only Pounds 27m, making a total of Pounds 550m for the year. That
compares with Pounds 843m in 1991 and the peak of Pounds 1.5bn in 1989.
The poor results will be immaterial compared with the announcement of the
board's decision whether to sunder the company in two. The aim is to make
Zeneca, the pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and specialities subsidiary, into
a separately quoted company.
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American drugs and consumer products company,
reports preliminary year-end results tomorrow. Analysts expect pre-tax
profits to rise up to 13 per cent to between Pounds 1.11bn and Pounds
1.125bn, against Pounds 1bn a year earlier.
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group, is expected
tomorrow to report that pre-tax profits for the full year break through the
Pounds 2bn barrier, an improvement of 13 per cent on the previous Pounds
1.79bn.
British Aerospace expects to see a revival in its fortunes during 1993
following a year in which its performance was undermined by Pounds 1bn of
provisions. Hopes for a return to profit, however, will do nothing to soften
the impact of its preliminary results on Wednesday. These are likely to show
losses of about Pounds 1.1bn compared with losses of Pounds 81m a year
earlier.
Restructuring charges of Pounds 950m in the regional aircraft division have
been blamed largely for the hole. The company is due to pay a deferred
interim dividend of 3p on Thursday, and a further 3p dividend is expected in
the final results.
The mild weather and new regulatory regime imposed by Ofgas is likely to be
reflected in the final results for British Gas. The company is expected to
announce on Thursday that profits have slipped to around Pounds 900m
compared with a Pounds 1.16bn last time. Increased competition and lower
prices for domestic gas sales may also reduce the company's scope for a
substantial increase in dividend. A pay-out of about 14p is expected,
against 13.4p last year.
Royal Dutch Shell will report its preliminary year-end results on Thursday
when a small increase in profits is expected of up to Pounds 3bn compared
with Pounds 2.89bn for 1991. The company is likely to raise its dividend in
line with inflation to about 22p from 20.9p last time.
Royal Insurance is expected to report a sharp fall in its pre-tax losses
when it unveils its 1992 results on Thursday. Losses should amount to
between Pounds 105m and Pounds 137m, compared with a deficit of Pounds 373m
in 1991. A dividend of 5p is forecast.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Management: Linking values to success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A link between corporate values and good business performance has been
claimed by more than one management guru in recent years. So it is perhaps
encouraging that a survey* of executive opinion sponsored by the Digital
Equipment Company reveals the widespread use of formal mission statements in
the UK.
Corporate values are defined as important beliefs widely held to be crucial
to the success of an organisation. According to the Digital survey 80 per
cent of 429 top managers interviewed last year say they have formal
statements, a similar number believe these contribute directly to
profitability, and 75 per cent see implementing them as one of their central
responsibilities.
Companies' top five priorities - defined both by the relative importance
attached to a value and the scope seen for improvement - are people,
competitiveness, customers, quality and productivity. More intriguingly
their lowest priorities are social responsibility - mainly because there is
perceived to be little room for behaving better  - and profitability.
The low emphasis on profits sounds like defeatist talk in the midst of a
recession. But the authors believe it may be that companies do not really
see it as a value as such, or that profitability is the result of a
value-driven strategy.
The real test, of course, is whether mission statements are integrated into
a company's day-to-day activities. Only 6 per cent of those interviewed
openly admitted that corporate values make little practical difference, but
30 per cent confessed that short-term commercial gain gets priority if there
is a conflict between the two.
Interestingly the under 40s turned out to be more single minded in the
pursuit of profit than their elders.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Management: A rollercoaster out of control - Christina Lamb
describes the ups and downs of doing business amid skyrocketing prices in
Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So persistently high is Brazilian inflation, that the Central Bank has run
out of famous Brazilians to put on its banknotes and resorted to Amazonian
fish (there are more than 2,000 varieties).
A good lunch costs more than Cr1m (Pounds 39), shops have to ring up large
items in parts to fit on the tills and calculators can only be used by
dropping three zeroes, despite two changes of currency in the last five
years.
This is irritating enough for the average person who has lost all sense of
what something should cost and must spend hours each day calculating how
best to protect his or her money, consulting the 13 indexes for monetary
correction published daily for everything from tax bills to savings
accounts. Imagine running a business in such a climate.
Luis Junqueira, financial director of Alpargatas, Brazil's leading footwear
and garment company, describes keeping up with inflation which has been
above 20 per cent a month for the last 15 months and in four figures for
five of the last six years, as: 'Feeling like the white rabbit in Alice in
Wonderland, always late.' He adds: 'I have all the textbooks on financial
management but may as well throw them down the drain for all the use they
are here.'
With inflation at 1.25 per cent a day and interest rates considerably
higher, a company can be made or broken on its cash management and it is
crucial to keep a constant track of money and have a strong credit control
department.
Milton de Carvalho Cabral, financial director of Souza Cruz, the Brazilian
subsidiary of BAT Industries, says: 'Our main challenge is to ensure that
money earned from sales all round the country reaches headquarters in Rio as
rapidly as possible in order to invest it. An hour lost can be an
opportunity gone.'
Terms of payment become an important factor. Cabral attributes the financial
health of Souza Cruz to the fact that it gives stockists only three to five
days to pay. The aim is to have a long lead time in paying suppliers, but
fast collection of receivables. Thus retailers often sell products for less
than they pay suppliers. If they can sell within 15 days but have 30 days to
pay, the cash can be invested for 15 days in the moneymarkets where the real
profit is to be made.
As a result, financial divisions tend to carry far more importance than the
production or marketing departments. Most leading manufacturers estimate
their financial department is at least 40 per cent larger than would be
necessary in a low inflationary climate. Autolatina, the holding company for
Ford and Volkswagen, has a larger financial department than Ford Europe.
Inflation is nothing new in Brazil - it has been more than 400 per cent a
year since 1987 - and companies have developed many mechanisms to survive
and prosper. In many cases the core activity has become simply a means of
generating cash for financial operations on which the real profits are made.
Eduardo Giannetti da Fonseca, an economist from Sao Paulo University,
explains: 'Inflation breaks the connection between what you sow and what you
reap. It's a school of opportunism where what matters is financial wizardry
rather than supply and demand.'
Rather than putting money into the company, cash goes into financial
operations. This has had negative repercussions on areas such as marketing,
quality, productivity and product development, which could be devastating
once Brazil opens up wider to foreign trade.
William Cosgrove, the financial director of Autolatina, complains:
'Everyone's working on the constant battle to recover last month's inflation
rather than concentrating on competing with Korea.'
The effects permeate throughout the company. Jeffrey Brantly, finance
director of the Monteiro Aranha group, says: 'Everyone becomes a financial
person. The marketing person cannot simply sell a product - he must obtain
the best terms of payment. The production guy cannot just install a new
machine to increase efficiency but must study whether it is better to buy
now, later or spread over several payments.'
The greatest loser is the consumer. Emerson Kapaz, owner of a toy company,
says: 'There's this constant race against time so when costs go up 30 per
cent prices are automatically adjusted by at least that, thus feeding
inflation. It's like a fever.' A study by consultants KPMG found that 81.6
per cent of companies listed government measures and inflationary
expectations as the most important factors in pricing. Production costs were
way down the list.
Moreover, periodic government price freezes (five in the last six years)
mean companies fear being caught with prices too low. The longest price
validity is 30 days, and companies such as ICI and Autolatina have
full-scale price negotiations with unions and suppliers at least monthly -
an activity that would occur perhaps annually in other countries.
This is a particular nightmare for the retail sector. Carlos Rocca,
president of the leading department store group Mappins, points out the
store sells 80,000 different items and must negotiate with 6,000 suppliers
on a case-by-case basis. High inflation also militates against companies
retaining stocks because of rapid depreciation. The retail sector is a
constant battle between wanting a rapid turnover and wanting to keep prices
up, without losing out to competitors.
Winners of this situation are oligopolies and cartels given the continuing
high import tariffs enabling them to price arbitrarily. According to Fipe,
one of the inflation monitoring agencies, oligopolies were responsible for
45 per cent of last year's 1,149 per cent inflation.
The instability generated by a highly inflationary economy means information
is at a premium, whether on likely government policy, inflationary trends or
the best financial instruments of the moment. There are 13 leading agencies
monitoring inflation and former economy ministers make fortunes running
consultancies.
The hardest situation is for those running subsidiaries of multinationals,
having to calculate in trillions and explain to the parent company the
confusing Brazilian accounting system where inflation and monetary
correction are often divergent and the impossibility of planning more than
three months ahead.
But high inflation also presents an opportunity, particularly with real
interest rates often topping 5 per cent a month. Though reluctant to admit
it, some companies generate 80 per cent of their profits from financial
gains. There are many businessmen in Brazil who would be sorry to see high
inflation end.
Eugenio Staub, president of electronics company Gradiente, says: 'Brazil
offers the best financial profits in the world,' though adding that his
company always focuses on the core business.
Most large Brazilian companies have turned into banks with large operating
tables where dealers are in electronic contact with the money markets.
Autolatina is involved in a network of consortia, providing financing to
dealers through capitalisation funds to which both manufacturer and dealer
contribute. Particular beneficiaries are those who, through export credits,
can raise money overseas at low rates to invest locally. Last year
Certificates of Deposit offered a 27 per cent return over international
rates.
The financial sector is an obvious winner and makes up 15 per cent of GDP -
far more than in most countries. With everything from school fees to gas
bills payable through banks, holding the float for a few days can be highly
profitable. According to the economy ministry there is Dollars 110bn
invested in short-term instruments.
So sophisticated is the Brazilian banking system that account holders can
invest the money for a day at a time and cheques are cleared within one day.
While Brazilian bankers cheerfully admit inflation is good for business,
manufacturers say financial operations simply preserve the value of profits
and mask the hidden costs of inflation, not least the erosion of consumer
spending power which over the last three years has dropped 10 per cent.
Cosgrove says: 'So-called financial profits are accounting gains which do
not show the long-term costs. No capital-intensive business likes this
climate. We need a three- to five-year lead time but here we can't even
forecast six months.'
There are compensations. Many directors of multinationals in Brazil have
returned to their parent companies in top positions and some such as
Citibank are sending their high-fliers to Brazil on the basis: 'If you can
survive here you can survive anywhere,' says Kapaz.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Management: Inflation lessons over a Big Mac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the site of boot camp for the shock troops in the battle to cope with
Russian inflation, few places could out-class Brazil.
That was the conclusion of the McDonald's Corporation. And that is why it
sent a group of high-level trainees there for a crash course in how to brave
inflation in a country where prices have risen by at least 400 per cent a
year since 1987. Last year, Russia's rate of 1,450 per cent was one of the
few to top Brazil's astounding figure of 1,149 per cent.
The contingent consisted of three Canadians, including the head of Russian
operations, and a native Russian vice-president. The Canadian subsidiary
controls the branch in Moscow, where the outlet on Pushkin Square is the
fast-food company's busiest.
'They came in search of the tools needed to manage and operate in a
hyper-inflationary environment,' said Gerson Ferrari, finance director for
McDonald's in Brazil. Ferrari led them to multinationals well-versed in
adapting to rocketing prices - firms such as Cargill, Goodyear and Kodak.
Ferrari's lesson emphasised cash-flow management, control of raw materials,
sales and price-setting strategies and how to hedge for potentially
substantial distortions in the exchange rate.
The visitors learned that in Brazil McDonald's negotiates a separate
inflation rate for each of its suppliers. It then uses those rates for
monthly realignments, instead of applying the government's generic inflation
figure across the board. The monthly adjustments for suppliers are 'wedded'
to periodic price increases for Big Macs, Ferrari said.
Could the McDonald's experience portend a boom in the export of Brazilian
'inflationary intelligence' to the troubled economies of eastern Europe? 'I
think there will be a migration of people in the financial area to those
countries,' observed Ferrari.
'There are executives in other countries that understand inflation, but the
best specialists in this area are the Brazilians.'

FT  22 FEB 93 / Small companies report upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MODEST upturn in business confidence is reported by the Small Business
Research Trust in two surveys published today.
In a survey for Lloyds Bank, 63 per cent of companies questioned said they
were stronger or unaffected by the recession. More than half said sales had
increased last year and almost as many expected sales to be higher this
year.
The report is the first of a series on companies in the manufacturing,
retail, distribution and business services sectors. It excludes the
construction sector.
Only 4 per cent of com-panies said they had been weakened by the recession
although it had had a strong impact on their ability to plan ahead.
The second survey, for National Westminster Bank, detected signs of an end
to the recession for manufacturers, wholesalers and the business services
sector.
It covered all business sectors and showed that sales, employment and
investment levels had all recovered from their all-time lows.
A special study for the survey showed that business rates had risen by 28
per cent over the past three years compared with an increase of 20 per cent
in the retail prices index.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Can Britain Make It: Charting the mechanics of decline -
Britain's manufacturing base is shrinking and its trade gap is growing. In
the first of a series Andrew Baxter looks at the mechanical engineering
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE head of a German machine-tool company was asked recently whether he was
worried by the pound's devaluation since Black Wednesday. After all, his
British competitors in the export markets are now over 15 per cent more
competitive.
Not at all, he said. But 10 years ago it would have been different. Britain
had a machine-tool industry then.
The machine-tool sector was a star in the UK balance of payments. Today its
story reads like a sad parable of the decline of Britain's mechanical
engineering industry.
UK industrialists complain that they are forced to buy foreign equipment for
their factories or overseas-made kit for a big contracting job. Process
plant contractors, for example, say it is no longer possible to buy big
UK-produced compressors, a vital component of chemical plants.
Mr Neil Johnson, head of the Engineering Employers' Federation, says the
only thing wrong with mechanical engineering in the UK is its size. 'The
only way of attacking that is to build up our manufacturing capacity.'
The problem might seem exaggerated if the bare figures are anything to go
by. Last year the UK had an apparently healthy surplus in engineering, with
exports 20 per cent larger than imports.
The problem is not just the absolute numbers, it is the trend. At the
beginning of the 1970s exports were comfortably twice the level of imports.
The balance dipped to virtual equilibrium in 1989. It has edged up since,
but that is because recession has dented demand for imports.
Adjusted for inflation, the numbers tell a similar story. In 1993 money, as
calculated by Mr Ian Thompson at the federation, total output has fallen
from Pounds 45bn in 1979 to Pounds 33bn last year - in line with that of
France but a long way short of the German sector, Europe's biggest.
Exports slipped from Pounds 15bn to Pounds 12bn, while imports have risen
from Pounds 9bn to Pounds 10bn.
Two severe recessions have depressed UK demand. In a shrinking home market
companies have rationalised or gone out of business, and have a smaller base
from which to make overseas sales.
Some good news for the heavy engineering sector came last week with the
announcement that Davy International had won a Pounds 200m contract to
supply a complete stainless steel rolling mill in South Africa. Most of the
equipment will be bought in the UK from suppliers including GEC in Rugby and
Bronx Engineering in the west Midlands.
The performance of different sectors has varied widely, although none could
be called sparkling. Comparing 1990-91 with 1978-79, the worst performer was
fabricated and structural steelwork where exports fell 57 per cent and
imports surged by 184 per cent.
Among the better performers was power equipment, where exports fell 44 per
cent and imports dropped by 71 per cent, mainly because of the lack of UK
demand. But real progress was made in ball and roller bearings - exports up
23 per cent, imports up 4 per cent.
The shrinking of the home customer base produces an effect that cannot be
gauged by statistics. In machine tools, for example, the main types of
equipment, such as lathes and milling machines, are still built in the UK.
But the strength - until recently - of markets in Germany, Japan and
Switzerland has allowed companies there to offer much fuller product ranges.
UK companies have also been hit by newly industrialised countries.
Previously captive export markets in countries that formerly were part of
the British empire, especially in Asia, have built up their own industries.
So how can Britain improve its trade performance? One answer is to follow
the example set by the motor industry and attract inward investment. The
improvement in ball and roller bearings largely results from heavy
investment by Japanese companies.
Engineering companies frequently complain that they have not received the
support, in terms of trade finance and market intelligence, that has been
available to their competitors in other European countries, notably Germany,
for winning overseas business.
Mr Johnson insists that it would be wrong to be too gloomy. The UK, he
argues, is one of the most attractive countries for companies that want to
establish a European presence. In addition, he says, the UK already has
world leaders to build on.
In the short term, there is excess production capacity of 20 per cent to 40
per cent that can be soaked up as the world recovers from recession. Going
beyond that, however, needs new investment. The history of the past 20 years
suggests that will be harder than it sounds.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Engineering sector pay freezes spread
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of pay freezes in British engineering industry almost doubled at
the end of last year to cover nearly a third of all settlements in the
sector, according to the latest figures from the Engineering Employers
Federation.
The sharp rise recorded by the federation appears to confirm a new wave of
pay freezes across British industry which was first noted by the
Confederation of British Industry pay databank. It found that third of all
employers introduced pay freezes during the final quarter of last year.
The rise in the number of freezes suggests that the recent spate of
industrial action, for example at the Yarrow shipyard on the Clyde, is
unrepresentative of the mood in industry as a whole. Pay analysts also say
that the clampdown on pay rises in the public sector, announced in November,
could be having a significant impact in the private sector.
The federation found that 100 of the 346 settlements reported between
November and January were pay freezes. A further 107 settlements, not
included in the figures, were deferred, meaning no pay rise was awarded but
that the position will be reviewed again during the course of the year.
The period covered by the federation's figures came soon after Britain's
withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism but also coincided with
a string of large redundancy announcements from big employers.
The increase in the percentage of freezes, which had been running at only
about 12 per cent of settlements during last summer, indicates that anxiety
about job security was a stronger influence on wage-bargainers than the
possibility of higher inflation arising from Britain's withdrawal from the
ERM.
The average pay rise in the engineering sector for the three months from
November to January, including the freezes but excluding the deferrals, was
down to 2.47 per cent.
The trend continues downward with the average settlement in the sector for
January at only 2.39 per cent. Although that is still comfortably above the
1.7 per cent inflation figure for January it shows that strong downward
pressure will remain on the government's annualised average earnings
increase figure, which in December fell to 4.75 per cent the lowest figure
for 25 years.
The federation's figures also underline how diverse pay bargaining has
become in the recession. For the three-month period, and excluding freezes
and deferrals, nearly one fifth of all settlements were more than 4 per
cent.
Pay analysts such as Incomes Data Services and Industrial Relations Services
emphasise that the majority of settlements are still above inflation. The
IRS figure for settlements for the whole economy found an average increase
of 3.6 per cent in the last quarter of last year.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Agent at Lloyd's warns on reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEADING agent at the Lloyd's insurance market has attacked possible plans
to reduce the role of members' agents. Such agents handle the affairs of
underwriting members or Names, and allocate them to syndicates.
Mr Julian Crispin, chairman of Sedgwick Lloyd's Underwriting Agents, said
any attempt by Lloyd's to handle the administrative functions of members'
agents centrally 'would cause a riot' among the agency's more than 1,500
Names - individuals whose wealth backs the market.
Changes in the role of members' agents are being considered by the Lloyd's
Market Board as part of a business plan to be unveiled in April.
Last month Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of Lloyd's, told a group of
Names: 'It would be better to centralise everything other than investment
advice and recruitment.' Members' agents' responsibilities for administering
the reserves and deposits of Names, for distributing profits, collecting
losses and assessing the solvency of Names could be carried out centrally.
He said that Lloyd's had given responsibility for administering Names'
deposits to agents following criticism from Names about the quality of
service offered by the corporation, the body which regulates and administers
the market.
A role change would be part of a package of measures designed to increase
efficiency at the market following heavy losses in recent years.
Lloyd's may consider placing business from underwriting syndicates that no
longer write new insurance into a central pool and reinsuring all
outstanding claims, Mr Middleton told a group of leading figures in the
insurance market.
It may also create a central run-off agency to deal with claims from
previous years.

THREE quarters of companies help employees they sack to find new jobs,
Cranfield School of Management has found.
Independent consultants providing 'outplacement' services were the most
popular with organisations, particularly for executives being made
redundant, the management school's research, published today, indicates.
Outside consultants were seen to help improve morale among remaining
employees, as well as providing expertise for those seeking jobs, the study
found.
More than half of the companies using consultants said there had been a
positive effect on public relations. However, there had been little
observable effect on the retention of employees or on customer or supplier
relations.
Individual counselling was popular for executives being made redundant,
while other employees were more likely to be advised in groups. Irrespective
of redundancies, more than 65 per cent of organisations provided some sort
of career counselling for their staff.
Over half of companies said they would have handled redundancies differently
if they had been doing them again. The need to improve communications was
most frequently mentioned.
The study of more than 600 companies was carried out by Cranfield for the
Institute of Directors and the consultancy Pauline Hyde and Associates. The
IoD said it welcomed the evidence that companies were accepting
responsibility for managing redundancies effectively and realising that
severance pay was no longer enough.

FT  22 FEB 93 / London trails on economic growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREATER London will perform worse than any other UK region this year in
terms of economic growth, while Wales will lead the way to recovery,
according to National Westminster Bank.
The bank warns in a report that growth will be 'very modest' over the next
five years, with unemployment expected to fall only slowly from a peak of
3.25m at the end of this year.
It says demand will be constrained by several negative factors including
large fiscal and trade deficits, high consumer debts and worries about job
insecurity.
The bank's economists say economic activity in Greater London will increase
by only 0.4 per cent this year, compared with the 0.9 per cent growth
expected for the UK as a whole. Wales will be the fastest growing region,
with its economy expanding by 1.1 per cent.
Growth in the UK as a whole next year will be 2 per cent, the report says,
with East Anglia, the east Midlands, the south-west and Wales expanding
faster than other regions at between 2.2 per cent and 2.4 per cent.
The weakest region next year in terms of growth is expected to be Northern
Ireland, which the bank believes will see output increase by just 1.6 per
cent.
Between 1993 and 1997 Yorkshire and Humberside will be among the leaders in
regions experiencing relatively fast growth, the report says.
Banks will find little demand from companies for loans during the next few
years because of fears about economic prospects, says a report by Lloyds
Bank. It adds that many businesses are likely to continue shutting down
parts of their operations rather than expanding them.

UNEMPLOYMENT is again increasing much faster among ethnic minority groups.
This follows a period in the mid-1980s when the gap between white and
ethnic-minority unemployment narrowed, the Commission for Racial Equality
says.
The commission's report says that during the mid-1980s ethnic minority
unemployment was double that among whites. In the boom years that followed,
the gap narrowed to two thirds. The latest Labour Force Survey found that
the gap widened again in 1991 for both qualified and unqualified people.
'More recent figures indicate that it is continuing to grow,' the commission
says.
'It is difficult to avoid concluding that a significant degree of
discrimination lies behind these appalling figures, and this makes it all
the more important that the recession should not be used as an excuse to
drop equal opportunity measures.'

observable effect on the retention of employees or on customer or supplier
relations.
Individual counselling was popular for executives being made redundant,
while other employees were more likely to be advised in groups. Irrespective
of redundancies, more than 65 per cent of organisations provided some sort
of career counselling for their staff.
Over half of companies said they would have handled redundancies differently
if they had been doing them again. The need to improve communications was
most frequently mentioned.
The study of more than 600 companies was carried out by Cranfield for the
Institute of Directors and the consultancy Pauline Hyde and Associates. The
IoD said it welcomed the evidence that companies were accepting
responsibility for managing redundancies effectively and realising that
severance pay was no longer enough.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Tests to start on power from sea tides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TEAM of energy experts is attempting to use tidal power as a new way of
generating electricity without a barrage or engineering works causing
extensive environmental damage.
First tests will be made this spring off the west coast of Scotland of an
underwater 10kw turbine with a 4-metre rotor driven by the rise and fall of
the tides.
The test machine will be anchored to the seabed, and attached to a buoy  -
the only obvious indication of its presence - containing radio-monitoring
equipment.
As the tide sweeps inshore, the current will turn the rotor, just as the
wind turns the sails of a windmill, and drive the underwater generator. As
the tide goes out, the apparatus will swing around and be driven by the
outgoing current.
The Pounds 200,000 pioneer project is being run by a consortium of Scottish
Nuclear; IT Power, a research and consultancy company; and NEL, the research
organisation that operates the UK wind turbine centre.
If the experiment satisfies the consortium that the technology is worth
pursuing, it could lead to the development of larger, commercial tidal
current turbines linked by marine cables to the national grid.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Homes plan beats target: Scheme to help homeless buys few
repossessed houses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 750m government programme to buy 20,000 empty properties to house
homeless people will almost certainly beat its target, according to figures
to be presented to officials this week.
The scheme to help the depressed British housing market, announced in the
Autumn Statement in November, is due to finish at the end of next month.
Just over half the 16,500 empty properties acquired so far have been bought
from recession-hit housebuilders, according to the Housing Corporation,
responsible for administering three-quarters of the money.
Two fifths of the homes have been bought on the open market from members of
the public. Less than a tenth have been repossessed homes.
The findings will disappoint building societies and banks, which have been
struggling to reduce their estimated 65,000 stock of unsold repossessed
properties. A total of 200,000 empty homes is estimated to be on the market.
The corporation says many of the repossessed homes offered to housing
associations have been in poor condition. Properties must be suitable for
immediate occupation if the programme is to be completed in time.
English housing associations under the scheme are to receive Pounds 577m.
The rest of the money is to be spread between right-to-buy schemes, local
authorities and housing action groups in Wales and Scotland.
Almost three quarters of the English budget is to be spent on properties in
the south-east, which has been targeted by the government as the housing
market worst hit by the recession.
English associations have so far agreed to 16,500 purchases involving Pounds
530m of grants. They have already exceeded their target of 16,000 homes by
the end of March. The final total is likely to be between 17,000 and 17,500,
according to the corporation.
Almost 5,000 families and individuals have been housed under the scheme,
says the corporation.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Police to probe alleged Pounds 6m fraud on Salvation Army
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE METROPOLITAN and City Police Company Fraud Squad is expected to launch a
formal investigation this week into the disappearance of Dollars 8.8m
(Pounds 6.19m) from the Salvation Army.
The inquiries come as investigators continue to search for details of
Islamic Pan American Bank, which is named in a writ issued by the charity as
part of its efforts to recover the missing funds.
The July 1992 edition of the Bankers' Almanac, a standard reference book
published in the UK, says the bank is based in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with
nine representative offices around the world. The bank has been under police
investigation since last summer and is on the warning list of the US banking
regulator.
Senior Argentine banking sources said they had never heard of the bank,
which is not registered with the Central Bank of Argentina.
The Bank of England said yesterday that Islamic Pan American Bank does not
have a presence in the UK.
Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, will examine the suggestion in the
almanac that it acts as auditor to the bank. PW says the bank is not a
client of any of its South American member firms.
In a letter to the Financial Times today, the Salvation Army says it has
been advised by its lawyers not to make public any further details of the
circumstances surrounding the alleged fraud.
It has emerged that the officer suspended without pay pending an internal
investigation is Colonel Grenville Burn, a public affairs officer. No
allegations of fraud have been made in connection with him.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Partners make their mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARTNERS at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the UK's largest accountancy firm, have
resisted attempts to restrict their involvement in the choice of a new
chairman, in a highly unusual exercise of their power.
The firm's governing board earlier this month discussed more democratic
selection procedures for the top job, which becomes vacant in May next year.
These must now be approved by the elected council in the next few weeks.
The procedures follow a revolt by Coopers' 715 partners, at the annual
meeting in Birmingham in December, against attempts to restrict their
involvement in the process.
Mr Brandon Gough, the chairman and senior partner, had proposed that
partners merely ratify a candidate selected by a nomination committee, which
would have included all members of the 13-strongboard selected by him not
standing for the post.
Under the revised proposals, a nomination committee of up to 40 people will
be elected by all the partners, with only two places reserved for board
members, four for partners aged under 40 and several for those from the
regions.
All partners will then vote from a shortlist prepared by the committee, at
an election likely to take place before December.
One senior partner said that the new chairman might be drawn from outside
the partnership, and might even not be a chartered accountant.
He added: 'The candidates must have the attitudes and characteristics that
reflect the needs of the business, and will present a plan on how to
delegate any elements of their role.'

FT  22 FEB 93 / Retailers under assault: The big increase in violence faced
by shops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE abduction and murder of the Merseyside toddler James Bulger from a
shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside, has focused attention on what
retailers say is an increase in violent crime in shops and shopping centres.
The blurred pictures of two boys leading him from the shopping centre - and
the enhanced images from the security cameras that prompted a flood of calls
from potential witnesses to police when they were shown on television - are
testimony to the efforts retailers have made to protect their staff, their
customers and their businesses.
Mr Allan Sayers, chief executive of the British Shops and Stores Association
which represents 15,000 department stores and retailers, says that while no
statistics are available, there is much anecdotal evidence of a rise in
threats to and attacks on shoppers and staff.
'Three or four years ago that kind of problem was almost unheard of,' Mr
Sayers says. 'It is now causing great concern among retailers.'
Most of the crime, he says, is committed by groups of young people, often
unemployed or playing truant from school.
Mr Frank Pegg, of Volumatic Systems, a manufacturer of security devices with
30 years' experience of advising retailers, says the rise in violent crime
is 'frightening'. There has been a big increase in armed robberies, attacks
and violent vandalism such as ram-raiding. This is in addition to the petty
theft that has always plagued retailers.
Home Office statistics show a 9 per cent increase in theft from shops in the
year to June 1992. There was a 9 per cent increase in violent crime overall,
and a 7 per cent increase in violence against the person.
Marks and Spencer, which is leading a campaign against crime in association
with the British Retail Consortium, says crime costs retailers Pounds 2.5bn
a year.
'Violent crime is increasing quickest of all,' it says. 'We have had people
threatened with everything from knives and syringes to guns.'
Marks and Spencer loses Pounds 30m a year through theft, and is spending
Pounds 21m this year on counter-measures. Tesco, the UK's second-largest
food retailer, says it is spending 'a very large amount of money' on
securing its stores. Only last weekend a customer was wounded during an
armed robbery at its store in Wandsworth, south London.
Although video cameras cannot prevent crime, they can help police trace
those responsible.
Mr Harold Couch, president of the British Council of Shopping Centres, which
represents 900 centres, says the council will revise the guidance notes on
safety already prepared by its security committee. Up to now these have
dealt mainly with terrorism and bomb scares. He says many shopping malls are
safer than traditional high streets because of the presence of security
staff and closed-circuit television. 'A well-managed centre, if it sees any
undesirables, can get rid of them,' he says.
Surveillance equipment is installed as standard in most new shopping
centres, and many older centres and shops are ordering equipment in spite of
the recession.
Mr Robert Haymon-Collins, marketing manager at the British Security Industry
Association, says: 'Some companies have decided that security is one area
they can cut back on. But many others see the benefits of greater investment
not less.'
The security industry has grown during the recession. Mr Haymon-Collins says
total turnover of member companies grew from Pounds 1.1bn in 1989 to Pounds
1.4bn in 1992. Spending on closed-circuit television equipment rose from
Pounds 37m to Pounds 64m.
Mr Mel Jordan, a sales consultant with Visual Information Systems, says
retailers use CCTV systems to monitor shops where health and hygiene are
important, and to gather market intelligence.
'The camera can capture a shopper picking up a particular item and then
maybe discarding it . . . that is useful information to a manager,' he says.
The security industry expects the Merseyside incident to focus the minds of
less committed retailers on improving security.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Closed-circuit Television system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM a control room, Mr Gordon Allanson, manager of the Eldon Square
shopping centre in Newcastle upon Tyne, surveys a row of giant television
screens, Jimmy Burns writes.
The centre, one of Europe's biggest, spent Pounds 50,000 in 1990 upgrading
its closed-circuit television system.
There are 16 cameras continuously recording and monitoring activity in the
17-acre centre, which can have as many as 18,000 people passing through in
an hour. At the push of a button cameras can zoom in on an individual and
take a colour photograph.
Technology to enhance the quality of the images and the scope of the
coverage is used. The closed-circuit television system is supported by an
integrated fire and burglary system.
Mr Allanson said the security is a 'customer service' which has helped
rather than hindered business. 'People feel more comfortable when they're
shopping if they know we are protecting them properly. They don't see the
security as a threat.'
A few months ago film and photographs from this system helped convict a gang
of 40 on a variety of conspiracy and theft charges, he said.
A combination of human and technological security has led to arrests and
convictions in two other recent incidents at the centre - one of breaking
and entering and the other an assault on a staff member.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Row over tendering rules spreads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday faced conflicting demands to take action in the
legal wrangle over whether public-sector workers' pay, conditions and
pensions are protected by European law when their jobs are contracted out.
The Public and Local Service Efficiency Campaign (Pulse), which is a
supporter of compulsory competitive tendering of public services, insisted
that the government should take action against councils that have suspended
tendering because of the legal uncertainty.
The government has said that the legislation protecting workers, known as
the Transfer of Undertakings Regulations (Protection of Employment) or Tupe,
would 'not normally' apply to contracting out. The Department of the
Environment has also warned councils that framing contracts to include Tupe
would be regarded as anti-competitive.
Yet Pulse says Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, is dragging his
feet by not taking action against seven councils that have either suspended
tendering or stated that Tupe must apply. They are Oxfordshire County
Council, Gillingham Borough Council, Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council,
Leeds City Council, Leicestershire County Council, Lancashire County Council
and Beverley Borough Council.
In a separate development the Prison Officers Association insisted that,
contrary to the widely held view, occupational pensions were not excluded
from the protection offered by Tupe.
Two recent industrial tribunal cases - Warrener v Walden Engineering in Hull
and Perry v Intec Colleges in Bristol - both found that pension rights were
transferred when Tupe applied.
Mr John McMullen, of solicitors Simpson Curtis, said the Warrener case might
be overturned at the Employment Appeals Tribunal.
But he pointed to further evidence of courts giving a much broader
interpretation than the government of when Tupe applies to contracting-out.
The High Court of Ireland, for example, recently ruled that the
subcontracting of security services by a shopping centre amounted to a
transfer of an undertaking.
Mr McMullen also said that a possible 'acid test' for how generally Tupe
applies will be provided in the spring by a European Court ruling on whether
the regulations apply to the contracting out of a one-person cleaning
service in Christel Schmidt v Spar und Leihkasse der Fruheren Amter
Bordersholm.

<TEXT>
A MODEST revival of investment in the commercial property market is expected
in the second half of this year, a survey of institutional investors and
property companies has found, Vanessa Houlder writes.
However, the study by Corporate Intelligence Group of 90 investors, owning a
total of Pounds 24.4bn of property, found that no significant increase in
commercial property values was expected before 1994. One in five investors
do not expect any increase in commercial property values before 1995.
Sentiment towards offices had marginally improved during the past nine
months, although most respondents believed that office rents would continue
to fall this year. Investors' attitude to industrial property had
deteriorated over the past nine months, and a growing number expected
further decline in rents.
Warehouses are likely to be the most sought-after buildings this year.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Protest call over off-peak trains
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday demanded a 'mighty uproar' from commuters over new fears
that off-peak train services might be at risk after rail privatisation.
Mr Brian Wilson, an opposition transport spokesman, said remarks made by a
minister meant private operators would be free to abandon loss-making
services outside peak hours.
Mr Wilson will challenge the government to reverse what is seen as a breach
of pledges already given.
The row erupted after Mr Roger Freeman, the public transport minister, told
the Commons standing committee on the railway privatisation bill: 'The
number of trains run in the off-peak, their frequency and their
attractiveness must depend in the last instance on the views of the
operator.'
He also said: 'The concept of peak and off-peak relates primarily to
commuting services, including those in the Passenger Transport Executive
areas - certainly in London - where little use is made of off-peak services,
so it is not reasonable to stipulate hard and fast services.'
Mr Wilson said yesterday: 'Communities which value evening and weekend rail
services must make their voices heard sooner rather than later. There must
be a mighty uproar from commuter areas to end this threat to off-peak rail
services.'

FT  22 FEB 93 / Conservative Euro-sceptics vow loyalty at by-election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY Euro-sceptic MPs yesterday pledged not to back any anti-Maastricht
candidate who stood against an official Conservative in the forthcoming
Newbury by-election.
Sir Teddy Taylor, MP for Southend East and an opponent of the Maastricht
treaty, described as 'unthinkable' the prospect of supporting anyone other
than the official Tory choice.
The by-election has been caused by the death on Friday of Mrs Judith
Chaplin, Newbury's Conservative MP, which has reduced the government's
Commons' majority to 20 while it is still struggling to get legislation on
Maastricht approved.
The row over the treaty will erupt again today when Liberal Democrats press
for the attorney-general to make a statement on the government's legal
advice concerning the treaty. Later in the day MPs will return to the bill's
committee stage.
Lord Tebbit, a former Tory party chairman, yesterday again urged MPs to vote
against the government and block Maastricht, saying it need not end
parliamentary careers. He said: 'People who have opposed governments find
themselves in government. People who support governments sometimes find
themselves in the dog-house.'
Tory MPs know, however, that backing an opponent in a by-election would
invite expulsion from the party. Sir Teddy said: 'There is no way that we
could be part of an attempt to undermine a Conservative candidate.'
One of the Euro-sceptics' unofficial whips at Westminster added: 'I would be
totally against it.'
The by-election will nevertheless be a significant test for the government,
with the Liberal Democrats expected to mount a strong challenge. Mrs Chaplin
had a majority of 12,357 over the Liberal Democrats in April 1992 - smaller
than Tory margins overturned by Liberal Democrats in by-elections before the
general election in April last year.
The town is typical of many of the Liberal Democrats' most sensational
by-election victories.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Kinnock warns over Labour union plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL KINNOCK, the former Labour leader, warned his successor Mr John
Smith yesterday that proposals being floated for creating 'associate
membership' of the party for trade union members were unworkable.
An interim report, setting out options for Labour's union links, will be
considered by the party's national executive on Wednesday. 'Associate
membership' is a possible compromise between ending union involvement and a
'one member, one vote' system.
Mr Kinnock said on BBC television: 'I don't think that you can have a kind
of diluted system in which people can exercise the full rights of being
members of the Labour party without accepting, at the appropriate rate of
subscription, the responsibilities of being members of the Labour party.'
Mr Kinnock, a supporter of 'one member, one vote' for selecting
parliamentary candidates, regretted that a decision on Labour's union links
had not been taken at last October's party conference.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Tories divided on public deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIVISIONS among Conservatives over how to curb Britain's public sector
borrowing requirement emerged yesterday as the Treasury confirmed that
Whitehall departments are studying the impact of a hypothetical cut in
spending of up to 5 per cent.
No clear consensus was found in a survey of 106 Conservative MPs for BBC
Television - although there was a slight majority of 55 in favour of tax
increases. However, 80 said the government needed to take action this year
to cut the deficit.
Mr Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary, has written to departments as
part of this year's public spending review, asking them to calculate the
impact of 2 1/2 per cent or 5 per cent cuts in 1994-95 spending.
His letter was described by Whitehall officials as 'routine' and no
different from those sent out at the same stage during previous public
spending rounds.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said on BBC Television: 'All
spending departments are making sure that they have looked at the options.'
However, she reiterated that the Conservative manifesto promise of real
increases in spending on the health service would not be breached.
Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's Treasury spokesman, protested that Mr Portillo's
letter 'threatens the most serious breach yet of election promises after a
precise commitment from the prime minister that spending plans would not be
reduced.'
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, faced conflicting calls from Tory MPs as
he canvassed opinion ahead of the Budget. The BBC survey showed that among
backbench Tories the most popular form of tax rise would be in VAT, which
was supported by 54 MPs. An increase in National Insurance contributions was
backed by 24, and a rise in income tax by 22.
However, many Tories warned that an increase in income tax would jeopardise
economic recovery and undermine the Conservatives' election credibility.
The total of local authority job losses since the beginning of February is
18,534 in 140 authorities, a report published yesterday by Mr Jack Straw,
the shadow environment secretary, shows. Mr Straw said that 2,434 job losses
were announced in the past week. The report is part of a Labour-commissioned
monitoring exercise by the Centre for Local Economic Strategies.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Blunkett urges compulsory community service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPULSORY community service for everyone aged under 21 is proposed by a
Labour frontbencher to tackle rising crime and unemployment.
The proposals from Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, would mark a
significant change of policy direction for Labour towards a scheme similar
to National Service without the military component.
It comes as ministers and the opposition call for tougher measures to tackle
juvenile crime - and for the government to take responsibility for
reinforcing 'social values'.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, said yesterday: 'The government has got
to give a lead to society.' He told the BBC that 'a loss of a sense of
purpose among our younger people' was one cause of rising crime.
Mr Clarke said he is to restructure the police and prison services, give
courts power to send juvenile offenders to secure homes, and increase
penalties for offences committed by adults on bail.
Yesterday Mr John Major, the prime minister, said in an interview with the
Mail on Sunday that 'society needs to condemn a little more and understand a
little less'.
Mr Tony Blair, Labour's home affairs spokesman, will also call for tougher
penalties for juvenile offenders when he sets out details of his party's
revamped crime policies today.
Yesterday he backed Mr Clarke in saying there was a need to 'condemn what is
wrong' but also to recognise that the young have to be given 'some stake in
society'.
But Mr Blunkett's proposals, set out in a personal submission to Labour's
social justice commission reviewing the party's policies, go a step further.
He proposes a nine-month period of full-time community service, linked to
adult education, for everyone under 21. Participants would be paid a proper
wage which would not replace training or education grants. Making the scheme
compulsory would prevent it being seen as only for those who failed
academically, he says.
Mr Blunkett adds: 'There were some very unfortunate elements of National
Service - people were taught to use guns - but I think that the good parts
of National Service could be brought to teach people to help each other.'
Mr Blunkett also calls for an investigation into the future of mortgage
interest tax relief and housing benefit and proposes the integration of the
tax and benefit systems. He says: 'We must look to the future and the
technology of the 21st century, rather than the constraints and outdated
thinking of the decades already passed.'

FT  22 FEB 93 / London keeps its banking status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON maintained its status as Europe's main financial centre last year
with the number of banks leaving the city equalling those moving in.
The latest survey by Noel Alexander Associates, a consultancy which
specialises in financial statistics, shows that 22 banks moved out of the
capital last year while the same number moved in. The number of foreign
banks in London totalled 494.
According to the survey, however, seven of the apparent departures were the
result of mergers or restructuring of foreign banks.
European banks accounted for more than half the departures or mergers and US
banks for another five. These included the merger of Security Pacific
National Bank with Bank of America and that of Manufacturers Hanover Trust
with Chemical Bank.
Pressure on US banks has led to a steady decrease in their presence in
London from 77 in 1982 down to 45 last year.
For the first time since 1960, the number of Japanese banks in London fell -
to 52 last year from 54 with the departure of Nippon Trust and Hyogo banks.

FT  22 FEB 93 / MPs to examine PO privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMONS trade and industry committee is to use an unexpected gap in next
month's schedule to interview senior Post Office executives.
Questions from the cross-party body are expected to concentrate on the Post
Office's possible privatisation and on the findings of an EC green paper on
European postal services. The intention is to raise any points it is thought
necessary to follow up with ministers at a later date.
The move comes amid mounting speculation concerning the government's plans
for the future ownership of the Post Office. Privatisation of it as a single
unit is thought to be increasingly favoured in Whitehall. The government is
so far committed only to selling the parcels division.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman, has added
his voice to the debate, saying the best solution would be an 'autonomous'
Post Office corporation based on the French model, with taxpayers as
shareholders.
He added: 'Ideally the Post Office should not be privatised at all.'
The Post Office has been profitable without subsidy for 16 years, making a
net profit last year of Pounds 152m on turnover of Pounds 5.1bn. However, a
conventional share flotation could raise Pounds 2bn at a time of escalating
public sector borrowing.
The gap in the committee's schedule arose with the postponement of a session
with Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, because of the
crisis over the government's pit closure plans.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FRESH momentum is likely to be injected next month into the government's
rail privatisation programme when British Rail expects to issue a memorandum
of sale for its Red Star express parcels service, David Owen writes.
The move will come eight months after the government announced its intention
to sell the business.
It made the announcement just before parliament rose for the 1992 summer
recess. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, told last year's
Conservative party conference in Brighton that the government anticipated
concluding a deal this year.
The government is free to authorise the sale of Red Star without legislation
because the unit is not part of BR's core business.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Food prices remain stable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH sterling's devaluation has increased the cost of many imported
products, it has yet to feed through into higher retail prices for many
popular products sold in British supermarkets.
A survey carried out for the Financial Times by AC Nielsen, the market
research group, shows that the prices of a range of popular consumer goods
have remained remarkably stable since the pound left the European exchange
rate mechanism.
A comparison made last month of 45 'Euro-brands', sold in at least three
other large European countries, found that none had risen in price in the UK
by more than 1 per cent since August, while 16 have become slightly cheaper.
Another Nielsen survey, of 31 product categories, found that in 17 of them
the price of the brand leader had fallen in the past six months. In the case
of shampoo, mineral water, pasta sauces, disposable nappies and toilet
tissues, the fall was as much as 7 per cent.
The biggest price increases were for canned salmon, baked beans, sliced
cooked meats and mayonnaise, which rose by between 9 per cent and 23 per
cent. The prices of most other goods were almost unchanged.
This stability suggests that the recession and weak demand are leading many
large manufacturers of consumer goods to put a higher priority on preserving
market share than on recouping cost increases caused by devaluation.
For most brand leaders, the keenest competition comes not from other
manufacturers' brands but from retailers' own-label products, which usually
sell more cheaply.
Sales of some categories of own-label goods have grown strongly during the
recession, as consumers have 'traded down' from dearer alternatives.
However, in several cases - notably nappies, tampons, canned fruits, pasta
sauces, breakfast cereals and hosiery - the difference in prices has been
narrowed significantly since August by falls in the prices of brand leaders
and increases for own-label products.
The main exceptions to this pattern are detergents, fruit juices, bleach and
tea, where the branded/own-label gap has widened.
In some categories, prices have shown they can also move sharply from month
to month in response to competitive conditions.
For instance, the prices of hosiery, carbonated drinks and toilet tissues -
none of them seasonal items - were higher in November than now.

THE government's policy of giving greater power to school governors has been

as governors.
About half of the 300,000 governors' posts were up for election last year
and the education department says that about half those whose terms ended
stood for re-election. In spite of fears of a shortage of candidates, most
of the 75,000 other vacancies were also filled.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MODEST revival of investment in the commercial property market is expected
in the second half of this year, a survey of institutional investors and
property companies has found, Vanessa Houlder writes.
However the study by Corporate Intelligence Group of 90 investors, owning a
total of Pounds 24.4bn of property, found that no significant increase in
commercial property values was expected before 1994. One in five investors
do not expect any increase in commercial property values before 1995.
Sentiment towards offices had marginally improved over the past nine months,
although most respondents believed that office rents would continue to fall
this year. Investors' attitude to industrial property had deteriorated over
the past nine months, and a growing number expected further decline in
rents.
Warehouses are likely to be the most sought-after buildings this year.
Property investment yields are generally expected to stay level or fall over
the next year. About half the investors expected retail yields to level or
harden over the next year, while the majority expected office, industrial
and business space yields to remain at current levels.

FT  22 FEB 93 / ANC sanctions plea until poll date set
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE African National Congress yesterday relaxed its policy on economic
sanctions against South Africa, but said sanctions should remain until a
date is set for multi-racial elections.
This cannot be done until multi-party negotiations yield agreement on a
range of difficult issues, including basic principles for a new
constitution, the re-incorporation of nominally independent black homelands
and multi-party control of the security forces.
Agreement on an election date is likely to take several months, although
swift progress in multi-party talks, due to begin next month, could bring
agreement sooner.
The ANC yesterday imposed several linked conditions for the lifting of
sanctions, apart from an election date: a multi-party council must be
established to oversee the government, with subsidiary councils to supervise
elections and the state-run broadcasting corporation, and the existing
constitution must be amended.
Once these steps are taken, the ANC would call for trade, investment,
financial and diplomatic sanctions to be lifted, but the international arms
and oil embargoes would remain in place.
Such a move would boost the business mood in South Africa, but would have
little effect on private investment, with domestic and foreign investors
more concerned about prospects for political stability and economic
discipline under a multi-racial government.
A resumption of lending by multilateral financial institutions such as the
World Bank and International Monetary Fund would be the biggest benefit from
an end to sanctions.
The IMF might make funds available immediately through its compensating
financing facility, designed to reimburse member countries for an unexpected
shortfall in export receipts or for a rise in imports.
However, South Africa could not seek balance of payments support until its
current account was in deficit. It was around R4.5bn (Pounds 1bn) in surplus
last year.
Since the mid-1980s, South Africa has been forced to run a substantial
current account surplus to cover foreign debt repayments, since
international banks halted new lending to the republic. Capital outflows
since 1985 have totalled over R40bn.
ANC officials hope that lifting sanctions would prompt a surge of foreign
investment and boost its chances of victory in the first multi-racial
elections.
At the weekend, ANC leader Nelson Mandela appealed for R130m for the
organisation's election campaign.
Meanwhile, Mr FW de Klerk, the President, tried to tackle his government's
racist image in advance of elections, by appointing two coloureds (mixed
race) and one Indian to his cabinet in minor positions.
However he also appointed a noted hardliner, Mr Kobie Coetzee, to the
sensitive position of Minister of Defence.

TWO weeks into Australia's five-week federal election campaign, the
conservative opposition parties are increasingly confident of ending a
decade of Labor rule.
Buoyed by an unexpectedly strong performance by Mr John Hewson, the
opposition leader, the Liberal/National Party coalition has built up a lead
of 6-12 percentage points in the opinion polls.
At face value, the polls suggest a comfortable margin for the coalition,
which requires a uniform national swing of only 0.9 per cent on March 13 to
win the six seats needed to take power.
But, as polling day draws nearer, detailed local polling suggests that the
gap is much smaller in marginal seats that will decide the election.
That raises the uncomfortable prospect for the conservatives of a repeat of
the 1990 election, when the coalition won the biggest share of the popular
vote, but failed to win enough seats to take power.
The key to victory lies in about 20 marginal constituencies, many of which
are being fought on local issues that tend to insulate voters from the
national trend.
The government is weakest in Western Australia, where it holds four seats by
majorities of less than 2.5 per cent; South Australia, where it would lose
four seats on a swing of 3.8 per cent; and the sugar belt of northern New
South Wales and Queensland, where it holds six seats by margins of less than
5 per cent.
Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, can do little to defend the Western
Australian seats except hope that the defeat of a Labor state government
earlier this month has assuaged voters' anger against the party.
However, Labor is fighting hard in the sugar belt, where it has offered to
exempt sugar farmers from its tariff reduction proposals for the duration of
the next parliament.
The coalition, which also holds a highly marginal sugar belt seat, has
matched the government's offer with a ADollars 145m (Pounds 69m) package
designed to compensate for its own proposed tariff cuts.
Mr Keating tried last week to shore up Labor support in South Australia by
offering ADollars 600m in federal funds to rescue the state Labor government
from the financial consequences of a ADollars 3bn loss by a state-owned
bank.
However, the critical battle will be fought in the conservative-controlled
states of New South Wales, Tasmania and Victoria, where the conservatives
are defending six seats with majorities of less than 3.3 per cent.
Labor's chief hope is in Victoria, where the party lost heavily in 1990, and
was defeated in a state election in October. Government strategists believe
the conservative vote in the state may have peaked.
An analysis of local opinion polls published in The Age newspaper in
Melbourne concluded that Labor would benefit from a swing of between 0.5 per
cent and 3 per cent on present voting intentions, which could translate to a
gain of three or more seats.
If the coalition does well elsewhere, Victoria will not matter. But in a
close election, Labor gains in the state could keep the conservatives out of
office, or reduce the size of their majority in the House of
Representatives.
That would be a severe blow for the coalition, which is relying on the moral
authority of a substantial majority to force controversial legislation
through the Senate.
Unlike the House, the Senate is elected by proportional representation,
which usually delivers the balance of power to the Australian Democrats, a
populist left-wing party which has never won a House seat.
Senator John Coulter, leader of the Democrats, says the party will oppose
key conservative proposals to expand private health insurance, deregulate
the industrial relations system and introduce a goods and services tax.
Unless Senator Coulter backs down, that would ensure that large parts of the
conservative agenda would be blocked, leaving Mr Hewson with little choice
other than to seek the dissolution of both houses and a second election.
Many Australians, already grumbling about compulsory voting every three or
four years, would regard that as the worst outcome of all.

FT  22 FEB 93 / The importance of picking the right inflation target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S membership of the European exchange rate mechanism may have
delivered painfully high interest rates, an uncompetitive exchange rate and
a deeper recession than the government needed in order to control inflation.
But it did have the advantage of simplicity. Monetary policy-making outside
the ERM may be less painful; but, as the Bank of England's extensive
inflation report demonstrates, it is much more complicated.
In the ERM, the UK government's monetary policy was largely determined by
the need to keep the exchange rate within its target zone, assuming this
delivers low and stable inflation. But chastened by its ERM experience, and
the failure of domestic money targeting in the early 1980s, the government
now appears to have abandoned intermediate monetary targets altogether.
Instead it has adopted an explicit inflation target, the annual rate of
retail price inflation excluding mortgage interest payments, which the
Treasury aims to keep within a 1-4 per cent range.
The Bank of England, like the Treasury, appears in no mood to advocate a
return to domestic monetary targeting. 'Inflation is a a monetary
phenomenon,' the Bank confirms in language reminiscent of the writings of
the monetarist guru and Chicago University economics professor Milton
Friedman. But 'the lags between changes in monetary policy and changes in
inflation are known only imprecisely, and will vary with the state of the
cycle'. The current erratic behaviour of monetary aggregates merits only a
little over one page in the Bank's 45-page report.
Nor is the Bank willing to view the government's inflation target as a
simple guide to policy. It makes sense, the report suggests, to announce an
inflation target in order to guide expectations and to provide a means of
assessing past performance. But 'monetary policy is set in relation not to
the current rate of inflation but to inflationary trends over the next year
or two'. The fact that underlying inflation rate is currently within its
target range makes little difference to this judgment.
The Bank also counsels against placing undue emphasis on the government's
chosen inflation measure out of the many other inflation indicators that
could have been picked. If all prices were to rise at the same rate, the
Bank says, then there would be no ambiguity about the measurement of
inflation. But relative prices change all the time. So while one price index
is needed for assessing performance, and the underlying RPI is 'as good as
any, and better than most', it would be 'unwise to rely on any single index
as the only guide to inflationary trends in the economy'.
Sterling's recent devaluation does, in fact, make it particularly important
that movements in the underlying rate of retail price inflation are not the
main guide to monetary policy. The devaluation will inevitably lead not only
to higher import prices but also to a higher aggregate price level, and thus
temporarily faster inflation, than would otherwise have been the case. What
matters is that this rise in aggregate prices occurs through a rise in the
prices of traded goods, largely manufactures, relative to non-traded goods
in order to increase the profit margins of exporters and help close the
trade deficit.
This shift in relative prices is already under way. The left-hand chart
tracks the squeeze on manufacturing export profit margins over the past
seven years, the combination of sterling's appreciation and the poor state
of the world economy. But last autumn's devaluation means that exporters
have been able to raise the sterling prices of their goods, as the middle
chart shows, which should increase export profit margins and volumes.
Unless, that is, the rise in producer prices leads to higher wage inflation,
thereby preventing the change in relative prices by spreading the increase
in aggregate prices to non-traded goods as well. Wage settlements are
currently depressed, largely because of the persisting recession. A rise in
wage inflation, not the underlying RPI, should be the government's first
serious inflationary danger signal.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Row over deportees dogs Christopher tour
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, carried his listening tour of
the Middle East from Damascus to Riyadh yesterday, having heard Jordanian
and Syrian assurances of their resolve to continue the faltering peace
process.
But leaders in both countries stressed that Israel's deportation of
Palestinians continued to obstruct a return to the talks, adjourned since
mid-December.
Mr Christopher said after meeting President Hafez al-Assad that the Syrian
leader had 'emphasised his commitment to the process of direct negotiations'
in the peace talks.
King Hussein of Jordan told Mr Christopher on Saturday that he was anxious
to return to the talks, but the continued exile of the Palestinians deported
by Israel two months ago remained an obstacle. Mr Farouq al-Sharaa, Syrian
foreign minister, made a similar statement on Mr Christopher's arrival in
Damascus. The peace talks remained the sole option for countries in the
region. 'What is the alternative except disaster?' he asked. 'Hopefully the
obstacles can be removed from our path.'
Mr Al-Sharaa told reporters he had advanced some new ideas to help resolve
the impasse over the deportees, although he refused to give details. 'We
shall work together to have the peace talks resume in a convenient and
admirable atmosphere.'
US officials have repeatedly stated that the secretary of state has no
immediate plans to resolve the stalemate over the deportees. Officials
travelling with Mr Christopher said he would, at best, gently encourage
Israel to speed up a judicial review of the deportees' cases.
Mr Christopher said over the weekend that he stood by a formula worked out
between Israel and the US whereby Israel would take back 101 of the 396 men
immediately and the rest within a year. Arab parties to the peace talks have
rejected this.
Mr Christopher flew last night to Saudi Arabia for a brief visit before he
travels to Kuwait, where talks are more likely to focus on Gulf security
issues than on the peace process.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Inter-religious forgiveness is just not cricket: Sectarian
intolerance which has swept through India is echoed on Bombay's playing
fields
</HEADLINE>

   BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE recent inter-religious violence which tore through Bombay seemed to be
forgotten at the weekend as Hindu and Moslem cricket fans flocked to the
city's Wankhede stadium and united to support India against England.
But even in the brilliant sunshine, dark reminders of the anger simmering in
Bombay were never far away. Like the city itself, cricket in Bombay is
falling prey to intolerance.
Shiv Sena, the local militant Hindu party whose supporters were among the
bloodiest participants in the recent riots, rules the roost at the cricket
ground. Mr Manohar Joshi, president of the Bombay Cricket Association and
host for the test match, is also a deputy leader of Shiv Sena. Mr Bal
Thackeray, the Shiv Sena leader who has often expressed his appreciation for
Adolf Hitler's 'patriotism', is a frequent guest in the committee box.
The city bore the brunt of the violence which hit India after Hindu
militants, including many from Bombay, destroyed the Ayodhya mosque in early
December.
Today, a month after the unrest reached its bloody climax, much of India's
commercial capital has returned to normal life. But the fears fanned by Shiv
Sena and other Hindu and Moslem extremist organisations persist.
Mr Joshi, a life-long cricket fan, was elected president last year after
Shiv Sena supporters broke into the Wankhede stadium and vandalised the
wicket to force the cancellation of a match between India and Pakistan.
Pakistan drew Shiv Sena's ire both because it is Moslem and because of the
support it gives to rebel movements in the north Indian state of Kashmir.
Mr Joshi shows no remorse for the attack on the pitch, nor is he in any mood
to let Pakistan play in the future.
Even though India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have just won the right jointly to
stage the next cricket World Cup, Mr Joshi will not promise to let Pakistan
play in Bombay. 'It will all depend on the political situation,' he says
with a thin smile.
The soft-spoken Mr Joshi has an unsettling way with words. At one moment he
praises Mohammed Azharuddin, India's Moslem cricket captain, and says: 'I
love my (Indian) Moslem brothers.' At another he says India's Moslems should
be shorn of their privileges, such as the right to their own family law.
The widely held belief that Shiv Sena organised anti-Moslem violence is
dismissed as 'propaganda'.
There are Moslem extremist groups as virulent as Shiv Sena, such as
Jamaat-e-Islami, but outside Kashmir they attract little support and carry
virtually no political weight. Shiv Sena matters; together with the
Bharatiya Janata party, the national Hindu militant grouping, it controls
100 of 252 seats in the state assembly of Maharashtra, which includes
Bombay.
The ruling Congress (I) party is struggling to keep its majority intact.
A few liberal Bombay citizens are prepared to stand up publicly to Mr Joshi
and Shiv Sena, among them Mr P. Sainath, a local magazine editor who has
organised a support fund for journalists who suffered losses in the
violence. 'We must fight Shiv Sena. Look what it has done to our city,' he
says.
Many more prefer to express their condemnations of Shiv Sena in private  -
for fear of reprisals. In public they limit themselves to decrying violence
and to contributing to charities aiding the victims.
Bombay's political leaders have failed to orchestrate any campaign against
Shiv Sena. Since the riots ended the Congress (I) party has been locked in
an internal dispute in which Mr Sudhakarrao Naik, the chief minister, is
pitted against Mr Sharad Pawar, the national defence minister, whose power
base is in Bombay. Each is trying to push responsibility for the riots on to
the other.
The absence of any strong political call for the defence of the city's
cosmopolitan traditions has left many Bombay residents confused.
Among the elite there is a reluctant but growing willingness to side with
Shiv Sena and the BJP, if only because their views are clear. 'People say:
'At least we know where we stand with them',' says one retired Hindu
academic. 'Congress offers no alternative.'
Some liberals are close to despair.
One leading industrialist says: 'I see parallels with Germany in the 1930s.
People who say the BJP is not so bad are like the Jews who said they were
too rich and powerful for Hitler to hurt them.'
But others see such fears as exaggerated. 'To make comparisons with Germany
is complete rubbish,' another industrialist says. But he, like the first,
prefers not to have his name appear in print.
'It's difficult. These people (militants such as Shiv Sena) are so
unpredictable.'

Voting began yesterday in Senegal's presidential election, with separatist
violence claiming 26 lives, Reuter reports from Dakar.
Twenty people were killed when a truck carrying voters of the ruling
Socialist party hit a landmine in the troubled southern Casamance province.
The explosion came just 24 hours after six people were killed when rebels
ambushed a taxi in the same area.
Political analysts say President Abdou Diouf is tipped to win, but the race
will probably be close. The spread of candidates and new rules will probably
mean a run off on March 7.

Mr Rafael Alunan, Philippine secretary of the interior and local government

offered his resignation yesterday, writes Jose Galang from Manila.
Mr Alunan's move came three days after Mr Fidel Ramos, the Philippine
president, called for the resignation of police officers who had earlier
been relieved of field assignments or accused of corruption or incompetence.
However, Mr Alunan's offer is unlikely to be accepted.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Poland's central bank, the NBP, has cut its basic refinancing interest rate
by three points to 35 per cent, writes Christopher Bobinski from Warsaw.
The move reflects optimism about an expected 2 per cent GDP growth in the
economy this year and a lower inflation rate, projected at 32 per cent. Mrs
Hanna Gronkiewicz Walc, NBP chairman, expects Polish banks to reduce their
lending rates, which currently range between 40 per cent and 60 per cent.
The refinancing rate is used by the NBP to lend money to government-funded
investment projects and is regarded as the marker for the banking system.

for Baghdad. But he would not elaborate on the objectives of the visit.
Another team of UN inspectors already in Baghdad extended its stay beyond
the planned departure date yesterday, after saying it had gathered fresh
information on Iraq's ballistic missile programme. UN officials in Bahrain
said that team was likely to stay at least until tomorrow. Mr Smidovitch
insisted there was no link between the two visits.

Voting began yesterday in Senegal's presidential election, with separatist
violence in the south claiming five more lives, Reuter reports from Dakar.
The rebel Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance (MFDC) has vowed to
disrupt all political activity in Casamance province, which is practically
cut off from the rest of Senegal by Gambia. At least 140 people have been
killed since the MFDC stepped up its decade-old rebellion last September.
Elsewhere, campaigning has been peaceful.
Political analysts say President Abdou Diouf is tipped to win, but the race
will probably be close. The spread of candidates, and a new stipulation that
the winner must be backed by at least a quarter of the 2.5m registered
voters, will probably mean a run off on March 7.

Mr Rafael Alunan, Philippine secretary of the interior and local government,
whose jurisdiction includes the scandal-tainted Philippine National Police,
offered his resignation yesterday, writes Jose Galang from Manila.
Mr Alunan's move came three days after Mr Fidel Ramos, the Philippine
president, called for the resignation of police officers who had earlier
been relieved of field assignments or accused of corruption or incompetence.
However, Mr Alunan's offer does not appear likely to be accepted. According
to observers, the Ramos call was directed at 16 generals and 35 colonels in
the PNP who now have no specific assignments. The so-called 'floating'
officers include Mr Cesar Nazareno, the PNP director-general who was
relieved of his duties last August by Mr Ramos.

<TEXT>
POLAND'S central bank, the NBP, has cut its basic refinancing interest rate
by three points to 35 per cent, writes Christopher Bobinski from Warsaw.
The move reflects optimism about an expected 2 per cent GDP growth in the
economy this year and a lower inflation rate, projected at 32 per cent.
Mrs Hanna Gronkiewicz Walc, NBP chairman, said she expected Polish banks to
reduce their lending rates, which currently range between 40 per cent and 60
per cent.
The refinancing rate is used by the NBP to lend money to government-funded
investment projects and is regarded as the marker for the banking system.
The central bank's rate cut follows recent falls in Treasury bill yields and
inter-bank lending rates, which at the end of last week stood at an annual
40 per cent for three-month deposits.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Dumping study set to provoke row: Report commissioned by
Hills likely to embarrass Clinton administration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WIDE-RANGING study of the possible cost to the US economy of anti-dumping
actions, commissioned as one of the final acts of Mrs Carla Hills, former US
trade representative, appears set to provoke a storm of controversy among
protected US industries, and embarrassment for the new Clinton
administration.
The demand for the study was described by one senior US trade official as
'potentially nuclear' in its implications, pitching powerful domestic
industries such as cars, steel and textiles against US exporters and
consumers, all of whom have to pay higher prices because of such duties.
It could embarrass President Bill Clinton, who has come under strong
pressure from domestic industry lobbies to use dumping laws fully to protect
US companies against 'unfair competition'.
Mrs Hills told the International Trade Commission, the administration's main
trade protection body, that she had called for the study because of the
'considerable public debate' stirred recently over the economic effects of
anti-dumping duties and linked import restraints.
Studies by the World Bank, and in the US by the Heritage Foundation and the
Brookings Institution, have concluded that anti-dumping actions - duties and
fines against alleged sales of products at below-cost prices  - represent a
creeping protectionism which is raising costs and hurting US competitiveness
rather than helping the US economy.
Adding to possible controversy between advocates and opponents of dumping
actions, the letter was sent just five days before Mrs Hills stepped down
from office a month ago, and was not received by Mr Don Newquist, chairman
of the ITC, until January 25 - five days after she was succeeded by Mr
Mickey Kantor, Mr Clinton's appointee.
To avoid being countermanded by Mr Kantor, ITC commissioners have asked him
to confirm that he is willing to endorse Mrs Hills' instructions. He is
expected to do so, but will be under pressure to ensure the study also takes
note of domestic industries' arguments on the supposed advantages of dumping
laws.
Users of products subject to dumping duties often complain they result in
higher costs, making it harder to remain internationally competitive.
Controversy has been heightened in recent months following the US imposition
of dumping duties on steel exporters from 19 countries, and threats to
impose them on motor vehicle imports.
Mrs Hills called for a study of 'the net economic welfare of the US' arising
from dumping and countervailing duty actions. She required an examination of
effects on:
Industries which have petitioned for protection;
The income and employment of US workers;
US consumers - from shoppers to companies that use affected products as
inputs to other production;
US parts and components producers.
The study must be completed by January 1995, and is among the most ambitious
ever demanded of the ITC. Its studies are normally highly specific. For
example, one recent study examined imports of durum wheat, while a current
study is looking at mackerel imports.
Trade experts in Washington were uncertain last week about Mrs Hills' exact
motives for leaving the Clinton administration such an explosive study. Some
argued it might be in deference to those ITC commissioners who have become
concerned that anti-dumping laws are being used increasingly as a weapon of
first resort by recession-pressed US industry.
Trade lawyers were uncertain last week whether the study would escape
subversion by the many powerful lobby groups in Washington.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Single Market Watch: Europe turns inward - and falls behind
/ The fruits of the single European market are starting to look less healthy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and PROF WINTERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS Europe starting to seize up again? Fears during the last decade that
Europe was suffering a damaging loss of international competitiveness were
dissipated during the EC's mini-economic boom of the late 1980s, partly
engendered by the run-up to the single market.
With the European Community this year facing a re-run of the 1981-1982
recession, and the Maastricht integration process bedevilled by
question-marks, Europessimism seems to be coming back into fashion.
Backing up the new mood, a discussion paper from the London-based Centre for
Economic Policy Research (CEPR) concludes that the economic effect of
integration has been far less positive than often argued.
Further, it has led to an inward-looking and protectionist trend in the EC's
international trade policy. This appears to have contributed to a
technological lag between the Community and other parts of the world.
The study's conclusions are borne out by figures from the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development showing declines in the export market
shares of leading EC economies in recent years - though this is a problem
shared by virtually the entire industrialised world.
The study's author, Prof Alan Winters of Birmingham University, denies being
a 'Eurosceptic'. He backs the single market programme as a way of pressing
forward with internal market liberalisation started with the Treaty of Rome
in 1957. But, he says, he produced his report 'to prick the balloon of
complacency' about the achievements of European integration.
The existence of the EC has coincided with above-average growth of its
members' economies, with the 12-member Community's share of world GDP
increasing from 22.5 per cent in 1965 to 23.5 per cent in 1989, Prof Winters
writes.
However, he adds that EC unemployment has been persistently high. In
addition, the Community has been less able to control inflation and unit
labour costs during the past decade than important competitors, and has
fallen behind in high technology compared with the US and Japan.
Among the EC's chief drawbacks, Prof Winters points to the EC's common
agricultural policy. This has brought protectionism to trade since the early
1960s, making the EC a net agricultural exporter rather than a net importer.
The subsidies flowing to EC producers have caused EC consumers annual income
losses of 1.5 per cent of GDP. In terms of overall trade flows, Prof Winters
believes EC members' success in increasing trade among each other has
detracted attention from falling ratios for trade with the rest of the
world.
This has coincided with restrictive EC trade policies to protect sectors
such as motor vehicles, consumer electronics and office machinery.
The Community suffers from 'a tendency to look backwards and preserve itself
from change, rather than to embrace change', Prof Winters remarks.
This trend is illustrated by the rising proportion of EC GDP devoted to
industry subsidies. 'Some subsidies are given to emerging sectors such as
the Airbus, but the bulk of them go to resisting change in traditional
sectors.
'The use of protection to avoid industrial restructuring has almost
certainly contributed to Europe's falling behind the US and Japan in
high-tech goods.'
Prof Winters cites figures showing that the fall in the EC's share of world
engineering markets since 1970 has been concentrated in more sophisticated
products. In less technologically demanding areas of engineering, the EC's
share of world trade has increased.
'We're doing OK relative to India, but not so good compared with Korea,'
Prof Winters says.
He complains about the protective bias of EC trade arrangements with central
and eastern Europe enshrined in the 'Europe agreements' completed last year
with Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland.
Citing restrictions on 'sensitive' east European exports in areas such as
steel and chemicals, Prof Winters says: 'A noble concern for the welfare of
our brothers in Europe was subverted by entrenched economic interests.'
Moreover, the accords are geared in the long run to giving the EC
preferential access to east European markets rather than the other way
around.
'The Europe agreements seem intent on obtaining markets and production
facilities in Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, on managing access to EC
markets and, above all, on avoiding serious levels of migration.'
Prof Winters says the European Community has reduced protectionist pressures
in some areas by giving national manufacturers the opportunity of a larger
internal market.
But 'once protectionism is introduced, it is spread around more and more
difficult to remove.'
When high interest rates and recession are spreading economic gloom around
the Community, removing these sources of Euro-protectionism will be
especially difficult.
Prof Winters' study suggests, however, that the EC should be preparing a new
trade policy agenda for the time when growth starts to edge up again.

FT  22 FEB 93 / US wants better deal on procurement bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN companies have significantly easier access to procurement contracts
in the US, according to a leaked US document that could trigger a US-EC war
of numbers in the battle to open up respective government procurement
markets.
In a document from the office of the US trade representative, the US claims
bidding opportunities worth Dollars 16.8bn (Pounds 11.8bn) were offered to
EC contractors under the Government Procurement Code in 1990, compared with
Dollars 7.8bn in EC contracts open to US operators.
The document, which highlights a wide difference between the two sides' view
of what amounts to fair access, argues that procurement contracts worth a
total of more than Dollars 150bn a year are open to bids from EC companies
'without any restriction'.
It says that in telecommunications, foreign companies won 54 per cent of the
market last year for central office telephone switches, with the EC
accounting for 13 per cent - while US companies sell no switches at all in
France, Germany, Belgium, Greece and Denmark and less than 5 per cent of the
switches in the UK, and supply Spain, Italy and the Netherlands only through
joint ventures.
The document was tabled during EC-US negotiations in Washington last week
aimed at settling the clash over public procurement which flared last month.
The new US administration threatened to bar European companies from bidding
for federal contracts in the US unless European procurement rules favouring
local manufacturers were dismantled by March 22.
EC negotiators said in Washington at the end of the talks that a possible
solution to the dispute had been found based on 'comparable, effective and
lasting access' to each other's markets.
However, the leaked document illustrates that the US and the EC retain
significantly different views on comparable or effective access. EC
officials admitted last week that there were obstacles in the way of US
companies bidding for procurement contracts in the EC. But they insisted
that systemic differences made it difficult for US officials to recognise
the obstacles foreign companies faced in bidding for US similar US
contracts.
The US document challenges EC claims that 'Buy America' laws bar EC bidders
from the US market, insisting that Buy America legislation affects 'less
than Dollars 15bn of procurement' - compared with 'over Dollars 50bn' of
contracts affected by the EC's own 'Buy Local' laws.
In a direct challenge to EC claims that the vertical integration of AT&amp;T,
the leading US telecommunications group, in effect bars EC companies from
bidding for business, a senior US trade official noted that regional US
telecommunications groups bought more equipment from Canada's Northern
Telecommunications than they did from AT&amp;T - which accounted for just 8 per
cent of total US demand for switching equipment.
'The US market is completely open. All of our firms are private and do not
discriminate in favour of national suppliers,' the document claims. It notes
that in spite of the extreme competitiveness of US-made steam turbine power
generators, the US has never sold a steam turbine in the EC, and no large
transformer since 1983.
By contrast, the US market is 'largely open', the document says.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday said the US had just stood by while Europe
invested in the Airbus airliner, but now it was time to rethink US policies
on developing new technologies, Reuter reports from Santa Monica.
Speaking in California, where defence cuts have caused job losses in the
defence industry, Mr Clinton said Washington needed to put more investment
into the private sector.
'For the last several years we have stood by while Europe invested Dollars
26bn in taxpayer money to build the Airbus,' he said.
Development of the airliner served 'to push American people out of work  -
not because they won any sort of free market competition, but because Europe
had a theory about how to get high-wage jobs going into the 21st century in
aerospace'.
He said US leaders had refused to undertake similar projects because they
felt 'that's industrial policy. We don't do that.' Such views had led to the
lengthy recession in the US, he said.
Mr Clinton said the US had to invest more in the new technologies of the
future, more in helping people to convert from a defence base to a domestic
economy.
The president, campaigning for his economic package, outlined last week, was
also planning to visit the high-tech Silicon Valley, as well as to address
workers employed by Boeing, which intends to cut thousands of jobs because
of declining aircraft sales.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Securities market practitioners 'should have more say in
their supervision'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission's plans to oversee EC securities markets should be
amended to give practitioners in the markets more say, according to the
International Securities Market Association.
The call, in a report on the development of a single European securities
market, highlights a growing struggle between officials in Brussels and
market practitioners over how the EC's markets should be run.
The Commission plans to set up a Securities Industry Committee to oversee
the implemention of its legislation on securities markets and to recommend
any legislative changes - a development which has prompted fears in some
quarters that it will lead eventually to a centralised and bureaucratic
market regulator.
The association, which regulates the Eurobond (or international bond)
market, warned that the EC 'is likely to have insufficient staff with high
level experience of working in the industry'. The plan for a committee
should be 'discussed more openly' before being carried through, and
self-regulatory bodies should 'have a role in its day-to-day functioning',
it said.
The report also argues:
Europe does not need a single securities exchange to achieve a single
securities market, but a common regulatory approach;
To help fight fraud, insider dealing and market manipulation, all
transactions should be reported to regulators. All regulators would then be
able to combine the details to obtain an overview of all market activities.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin and the speaker of the Russian parliament, Mr Ruslan
Khasbulatov, will continue this week to search for a constitutional deal in
a suicidal power struggle each side is determined to win.
After the two men traded insults directly or through their spokesmen, a
first round of negotiating between their emissaries on Saturday produced no
progress. A 10-day deadline for an agreement expires at the end of the week.
If none is found through the current mixture of behind-the-scenes
negotiating and megaphone diplomacy, Mr Yeltsin has vowed to take the
struggle to a referendum which would ask people whether parliament or the
president should rule the country.
Mr Yeltsin wants the parliament to stick to examining legislation, leaving
the government strong executive powers to conduct economic reform and
dispose of state assets.
The alternatives to a deal are grim.
A referendum would further destabilise the political situation at a time of
deep economic crisis. Some independent-minded regions could refuse to hold
the poll. Furthermore, it could be seen as a flop for failing to ask clear
questions (parliament also has a say in setting them) and by producing a
turnout too low to provide a clear answer.

<TEXT>
ROMANIA'S minority government this week faces its biggest test to date when
it presents an expansionary budget to parliament for 1993-1994.
The left-wing Democratic National Salvation Front, which formed a government
in November, plans to increase government investment by raising corporate
taxation.
Profit tax would rise to 40-60 per cent, from 30-45 per cent, although
companies involved in exporting would be eligible for discounts of up to 50
per cent. The budget deficit would rise to 428bn lei (Pounds 568.6m), or 4
per cent of gross domestic product, up from 2 per cent last year.
Despite a 15 per cent fall in Romania's GDP last year, the budget has been
drawn up on the basis that GDP will remain stable this year and that annual
inflation will drop from 200 per cent to 80 per cent.
The trade deficit is forecast to reach Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.3bn, with
external debt expected to double to Dollars 7bn this year. However, only
Dollars 4bn of foreign credit would be drawn in 1993, according to Mr Misu
Negritoiu, deputy prime minister with responsibility for economic reform.
Mr Negritoiu, an independent who is considered the cabinet's key reformer,
said government spending would be aimed at privatisation and restructuring,
infrastructure projects, agriculture and building up social welfare.

market practitioners over how the EC's markets should be run.
The Commission plans to set up a Securities Industry Committee to oversee
the implemention of its legislation on securities markets and to recommend
any legislative changes - a development which has prompted fears in some
quarters that it will lead eventually to a centralised and bureaucratic
market regulator.
The association, which regulates the Eurobond market, warned that the EC 'is
likely to have insufficient staff with high level experience of working in
the industry'. The plan for a committee should be 'discussed more openly'
before being carried through.
The report also argues that Europe does not need a single securities
exchange to achieve a single securities market, but a common regulatory
approach;

FT  22 FEB 93 / Rocard wins support for left alliance
</HEADLINE>

AN overwhelming majority of French Socialists and ecologists support the
proposals of Mr Michel Rocard, former French prime minister and a future
presidential candidate, for a 'political big bang' to create a new
centre-left alliance after next month's elections, according to the latest
opinion poll.
The BVA poll, published in yesterday's Journal du Dimanche newspaper,
suggests that 73 per cent of Socialist sympathisers and 62 per cent of
ecologists back Mr Rocard's idea of abandoning the Socialist party in favour
of a coalition of socialists, environmentalists and human rights activists.
It also indicates a high level of support among the public, with 45 per cent
approving of his plan and 40 per cent against.
Mr Rocard said on French television last night that the political
establishment was increasingly out of touch with the daily reality of
people's lives. It was necessary to create a political platform in which
different interest groups could come together to redefine objectives for
France.
The Rocard plan has caused turmoil among the Socialists, who, after a decade
in power, are heading for humiliating defeat by the conservatives in next
month's parliamentary elections, and may be robbed of second place by
ecologists.
President Francois Mitterrand has tried to brush aside the Rocard proposals
by stressing that the left's first priority should be to strengthen the
existing Socialist party.
The president's own standing is under attack, however. More than half of
French viewers (54 per cent) were unimpressed by his television appearances
last week, according to an IFOP poll in yesterday's Journal du Dimanche.
Similarly, his approval rating in yesterday's poll stood at a dispiriting 26
per cent, the same as last month.

<TEXT>
THE French postal service is poised for further disruption this week as post
office trade unions try to step up industrial action that created chaos for
the mail last week.
Four of the largest postal unions will this morning hold mandatory meetings
for members across France to discuss the next stage of their industrial
action against the post office's proposals to cut 3,000 jobs this year.
This latest call for action follows the collapse of negotiations on Friday.
The areas worst affected by the dispute have been Rouen, Rennes, Le Havre
and Marseilles, where the mail has been prey to intermittent strikes and
stoppages for the past month. But last week the dispute spread to Paris,
where the post office plans to shed 280 of its 7,000 employees.
An escalation of the postal dispute would be a blow to the Socialist
government, which also faces protests from farmers and fishermen in the
run-up to next month's parliamentary elections.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Milan shows no mercy on kickbacks: There is an overwhelming
cry for political change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS ITALY braces for more arrests and resignations in the corruption scandal
rocking the country, the consensus in Milan is that all should be brought
into the open.
'It's a scandal when the judges keep silent, not when they start putting
politicians away,' says Mr Luigi Cavallini, director of a machine tool
importing company. 'The corruption affair may be hurting our image abroad.
But it's only in really corrupt countries that the politicians don't go to
jail. People should be pleased this is happening.'
The corruption probe, which began in Milan and spread nationwide, triggered
last week's ministerial resignations and yesterday's cabinet reshuffle. The
decision by a parliamentary committee to lift the immunity of Mr Francesco
De Lorenzo, the former health minister, and rumours about the possible
involvement of Mr Giovanni Goria, the former finance minister, prompted both
to resign on Friday.
Many people in Milan share the view that the investigations into political
kickbacks should go on, irrespective of the impact on Italy's standing
abroad or the value of the lira, which plummeted to L957 against the D-Mark
late on Friday.
At Mr Cesare Sbravati's barber's shop, talk of an amnesty for corrupt
politicians is instantly dismissed by Saturday afternoon customers. Mr
Sbravati, born in Mantua but busy cutting hair in the same small shop for
more than 30 years, is convinced the judges should carry on.
'It's only thanks to them that things have come to the surface. Otherwise,
the politicians wouldn't have done anything,' he says. Mr Alberto Pirovano,
waiting for his haircut, agrees. 'We're only halfway there. If the judges
stop now, the politicians will bury everything.'
There is little sympathy for those who have traipsed into Milan's antiquated
San Vittore prison, a first stop for many of the politicians and businessmen
arrested so far. 'They should be made to give back what they've stolen,
right up to the last penny,' shouts Mr Sbravati's wife from behind the
curtain dividing the shop from their sitting room.
The customers are more moderate. They probably appreciate the
near-impossibility of tracing the billions of lire which have flowed into
private pockets and party coffers though kickbacks on inflated public-works
contracts. But they at least want new laws banning all those implicated in
corruption from holding elected office again and requiring them to repay
what money can be traced.
The vitriol is reserved for Mr Bettino Craxi, the former leader of the
discredited Socialist party, whose power base was Milan.
The Socialists 'have no future in Milan', says Mr Ambrogio Invitti, waiting
his turn in the barber's chair.
But Mr Cavallini, an avowed right-winger who castigates Italy's governments
for pumping money into fruitless ventures, usually in the
economically-depressed south, gives prime minister Giuliano Amato some
credit.
'Every political system in transition has people of the ancien regime
alongside the new. At least this government seems to be made up of
serious-minded people, unlike the last two years of the former Andreotti
government, which paved the way for the damnation of this country.'
The overwhelming mood in Milan is that the political system has to change,
amid some uncertainty and caution as to how that should be done.
With Italy's budget deficit still growing, such steps are likely to involve
further unpopular public spending cuts, hitting social security in
particular. They are likely to be least popular in southern Italy, where
support for established political parties has proved much more resilient
than in the north.
'What should I do?' asks Mrs Pierrina Fusco, a pensioner from the southern
region of Appulia, who has been working in Milan for the past 30 years.
'Everything's become more expensive. Now I'm going to have to pay for the
medicines that used to be free. Tell me what to do. I'll vote for whoever
you say.'

THE European Commission yesterday said it would propose measures in the
coming days to avert a crisis in the EC's fishing sector due to cheap
imports and recent currency turmoil, Reuter reports from Brussels
The decision to improve the market follows a meeting between French and
Commission fisheries officials in Brussels.
Prices had fallen by 15 to 30 per cent across the Community and cheap
imports from Russia, Norway and Iceland, as well as currency fluctuations in
the EC, had aggravated troubles within the fishing industry, the Commission
said.
The measures to 'improve prices' would be drawn up by EC Fisheries
Commissioner Yannis Paleokrassas and presented by the Commission imminently
 -probably by mid-week.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Bad times loom for German carmakers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEVILLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN CAR makers face at least five bleak and uncertain years ahead,
according to Mr David Herman, new chairman of Adam Opel, the local
subsidiary of General Motors of the US.
Consumer confidence was in free fall, he said at the weekend. Business
confidence was still near post-war lows, but the recent plunge in morale had
been the steepest in almost 50 years. It would be more than five years
before Opel's output returned to the levels of the recent past.
Mr Herman's grim forecasts followed news that German car production tumbled
27 per cent in January, while output of commercial vehicles was 57 per cent
lower than a year earlier.
Meanwhile, Volkswagen, the country's leading volume carmaker, confirmed that
it was considering extending short-time working into the second quarter of
this year.
Opel, No 2 behind VW, has drastically downgraded its expectations. A fresh
analysis of the company's medium-term business plans had resulted in
forecasts for annual output being cut by an average 7 or 8 per cent, Mr
Herman said.
The current recession was unusual; a 'normal' slump lasted one or two years
and was followed by a reasonably sharp upturn. This time he could see no
possibility of such a recovery. Apart from recession the industry had to
make allowances for the effects of Bonn's plans to increase oil taxes and
levy tolls on motorway users.
'Even now drivers pay twice as much on vehicle and fuel taxes as is paid out
for road construction and maintenance,' he claimed.
Motor manufacturing was Germany's single most important industry; it was
time to consider the effects of higher levies on investment and employment.
Mr Herman, speaking at the launch in Seville, Spain, of the company's new
Corsa compact car (sold as the Nova in Britain), said production on the new
model would rise from 90,000 this year to 100,000 in 1994. Meanwhile, annual
capacity would be increased to 400,000, split between the group's plants in
Saragossa, Spain, and its new low-cost showpiece works in Eisenach, eastern
Germany.
Compacts now account for 20 per cent of the German market, where General
Motors companies sold 658,000 vehicles last year - 8 per cent fewer than in
1991.
Some 40 per cent of all GM's European sales are made in Germany. The
nosedive in January output, reported by the VDA industry association,
followed the introduction of short-time working in most domestic vehicle
plants. Output is being reduced to cope with falls in domestic demand
expected to range between 15 and 20 per cent this year.
Meanwhile, car exports dropped by an adjusted 12 per cent and truck
shipments abroad fell by half, the VDA said.
New car registrations in west Germany were down 28 per cent during the
month. But the figure was distorted by exceptional demand towards the end of
last year, when buyers rushed to avoid the January 1 increase in value added
tax.

THE United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees yesterday said full
operations would be resumed in Bosnia-Hercegovina following assurances that
the three warring factions would no longer block aid convoys or
distribution.
A statement from Ms Sadako Ogata's office said she had agreed with Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, that operations would resume
'as soon as possible, perhaps as early as Monday'.
The decision came hours after a 10-truck convoy carrying 72 tonnes of aid
reached Zepa, a Moslem stronghold in eastern Bosnia. Bosnian Serb commanders
had given way to international pressure for the delivery of emergency aid to
Moslem enclaves besieged by Serb forces.
The commanders said the convoy, stranded for five days, could pass at its
own risk. It crawled along a winding snow-covered route, reported to have
been mined, to reach Zepa yesterday afternoon.
It carried wheat flour and family parcels and was only the second UNHCR
convoy to reach the village, whose population has been swollen by refugees
fleeing Serb 'ethnic cleansing' in the region, since the war erupted 10
months ago.
The successful mission follows a week of confusion in the international
community over how to distribute aid in Bosnia.
In the hope of winning Serb permission for aid to reach government
strongholds in eastern Bosnia, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem president of
Bosnia, announced a ceasefire at the weekend.
The announcement followed reports of an advance by Serb forces, besieging
Sarajevo on the western edge of the Bosnian capital.
The convoy reached Zepa after US President Bill Clinton said he was
considering making air drops to the 100,000 Moslems trapped by the Serb
stranglehold of eastern Bosnia. But UN commanders in Bosnia yesterday were
sceptical about the idea. It raised many problems, including securing the
co-operation of all parties to the conflict.
Meanwhile, in the poor former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, 300 policemen
fired tear gas and batons to disperse hundreds of Macedonians gathered in
Skopje, the capital, to protest against the building of houses to settle
Moslem refugees from the Bosnian war.
Several people were injured in the clashes, which began on Saturday.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Steel chief outlines crisis plan: Rapid decision on rescue
package sought from EC ministers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S steel industry, which prides itself as being the most independent
and efficient in the EC, is calling for tough new curbs on state subsidies
in other member states, but also for more money from Brussels to ease the
pain of mass redundancies.
It wants a 'market solution' to the crisis in the industry, but one
protected against unfair competition from eastern Europe by volume
restrictions on cheap imports. Minimum prices would not be effective, it
says.
It also wants a rapid decision by industry ministers this week on the
outline of a rescue package, in order to underpin higher prices in the
market.
Precise details of capacity cuts would be worked out by the industry itself
by September, and then two years would be needed to put them into effect.
Details of the German industry's preconditions for a Brussels rescue package
were spelt out by Mr Ruprecht Vondran, president of the German steel
industry federation, in a weekend interview.
He warned that the European steel sector as a whole would have to shed more
than 100,000 jobs, of which 35,000-40,000 would be in Germany. He agreed
with the European Commission that cuts in capacity were needed of between
25m-30m tonnes.
Mr Vondran suggested that efficient producers should in effect buy out
market share from inefficient producers, forcing inefficient plants out of
production. Subsidies should only be paid in proportion to their reduction
in capacity, and Italy and Spain must be targeted as the least efficient,
most heavily subsidised producers.
He set out six 'criteria' for an agreement, presented last week to Mr Gunter
Rexrodt, the German economics minister, who will attend the ministerial
council in Brussels on Thursday at which the package will be presented.
'We must find a solution which is as close as possible to a market
solution,' he said. 'It means the most efficient producers must remain, and
the least efficient must close.' The mistake of EC steel policies since the
last steel crisis of 1980 was to allow borderline producers to remain in
operation.
Mr Vondran singled out Ilva, the Italian steel producer, as 'a totally
over-indebted enterprise which is adding new losses month by month. Nobody
knows what its debt position is, but we believe it is somewhere between
DM11bn and DM14bn (Pounds 4.6bn-Pounds 5.9bn). There is no suggestion of
bankruptcy: they simply go on producing.'
The steel federation's six-point plan would require:
A transparent legal framework for production and delivery quotas, decided by
the industry within guidelines set by Brussels. 'There must be no cartels
fixed up behind closed doors,' Mr Vondran said.
Protection against cheap imports from eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union, focused on the most sensitive areas - long products rather than flat
products - and limited by quantity, not price. The federation proposes a
limit set at 1991 import levels, plus 20 per cent. 'Minimum prices don't
work. You simply get payments made secretly into Swiss bank accounts,' he
said.
Clear restriction on subsidies, as set out in Article 4c of the European
Coal and Steel Community treaty, with exceptions limited to those
enterprises cutting their capacity enough to have a real effect on the
market.
More generous social payments to ease the redundancies, estimated at more
than 100,000 direct job losses in the entire EC industry, and not 50,000 as
calculated by the European Commission. The Brussels offer of Ecu450m (Pounds
371.7m) between 1993 and 1995 is based on the lower job loss figure.
Adequate time to carry out the structural changes, with two to three years
estimated from agreement on capacity cuts in September.
Political agreement on the key points in the package on February 25, with
the remaining details worked out at official level by the end of March.

MR Hans-Joachim Gottschol, president of the Gesamtmetall engineering
employers' association, yesterday said IG Metall, Germany's big engineering
union, was pricing its members out of the market and would face more
unemployment if it insisted on a 26 per cent wage increase this April for
the five east German states.
In an interview with the Berliner Morgenpost, Mr Gottschol said Gesamtmetall
would stick to its offer of a 9 per cent wage increase for east Germany's
300,000 IG Metall members. The union is demanding a 26 per cent increase, as
agreed in a contract with the employers' association in March 1991.
The contract envisaged bringing east German wages up to west German levels
by April 1994. But the employers now insist they can revise the contract
because of the deteriorating west and east German economies.
East Germany's inflation rate jumped by 6.7 percentage points in January,
against a 1.8 point rise in December and an annual inflation rate of about
11.2 per cent in 1992.
Union officials, who will open arbitration talks with Gesamtmetall in the
state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania today, are expected to argue that a
wage increase is even more justified in the light of the inflation figures.
Talks aimed at reaching a compromise have already broken down in four of the
five east German states.
'IG Metall must finally weigh up the cost (of the wage increase) with the
economic reality,' Mr Gottschol said. Gesamtmetall officials have said that
a 9 per cent wage increase would cost the employers DM1.4bn (Pounds 590m),
while a 26 per cent increase would cost DM3.9bn.
IG Bergbau und Energie, the energy and utilities union, last week accepted a
pay increase of 9.3 per cent for its 60,000 east German members.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Rail union to ballot on series of 24-hour strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAIL USERS could be hit by a series of one-day strikes late next month after
RMT, the main rail union, failed to win assurances from British Rail on
employment connected to the future privatisation of the railways.
RMT, which was seeking the assurances in talks last Friday, said yesterday
it would hold a ballot early next month for a 'rolling programme' of 24-hour
strikes. It must then start the strike within 28 days or reballot its
members.
An official said the union's executive had undertaken thorough consultation
and was confident that a large majority of the 70,000 RMT railworkers, out
of a total 125,000 rail workforce, would support the call.
A decision in favour of strikes could prompt a tough reaction from BR. There
has been a recent spate of strikes or strike calls in other industries, at
Yarrow, Timex and Peugeot. Nevertheless the latest pay data show a rapid
increase in pay freezes in manufacturing which does not indicate a growing
industrial militancy.
Although the rail strike call was originally linked with the related
campaign by the National Union of Mineworkers against the government plan
for extensive pit closures, the RMT says the main reason now is BR's refusal
to rule out compulsory redundancies. RMT believes that, apart from 7,000
redundancies now being completed, BR will seek a further 20,000 in the next
financial year. Other reasons for protest are BR's refusal to stop using
outside contractors and a 'watering down' of the redundancy payment scheme.
The other main rail unions - Aslef, representing train drivers, and TSSA,
white-collar staff - have not said whether they will also back strikes.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Italian government wins reprieve with reshuffle

<TEXT>
ITALY'S SHAKY eight-month-old gov-ernment yesterday survived its biggest
political test with a cabinet reshuffle following the resignations on Friday
of two senior ministers over the growing political corruption scandal.
However, the skill and patience of prime minister Mr Giuliano Amato were
stretched to the limit. Mr Amato met fellow ministers in his four-party
coalition for four hours before agreement was reached on the new cabinet.
The prime minister used the resignations of Mr Giovanni Goria and Mr
Francesco De Lorenzo, the finance and health ministers respectively, to
reinforce his government's standing by adding some political heavyweights.
However, Mr Amato failed to broaden the government's political base because
of the opposition of parties, such as the Republicans, to join a government
scarred by the corruption investigations.
Mr Amato hopes his swift action will restore calm to financial markets today
after the frantic scenes following the resignations. The lira, which had
been losing ground against leading currencies throughout last week, slid to
L957 against the D-Mark, while government bond prices tumbled.
The reshuffle probably means Mr Amato's government has gained a reprieve
until new electoral laws, under discussion by a special parliamentary
committee, come into operation. The laws, which should increase the chances
of stable parliamentary majorities, are also subject to popular referendums,
which could be held as early as April.
Mr Nino Andreatta, a senior Christian Democrat and former minister, takes
over as budget minister from Mr Franco Reviglio, the Socialist who is moving
to the finance portfolio vacated by Mr Goria. Meanwhile, Mr Raffaele Costa,
the former minister for regional policy and European Community affairs,
steps up to become health minister, while his previous job goes to Mr
Gianfranco Ciaurro.
Negotiations yesterday were protracted partly because of the surprise
refusal of Mr Giuseppe Guarino, the industry minister, to step down. Mr
Amato had hoped to remove Mr Guarino because of his refusal to go along with
ambitious privatisation plans. Instead, Mr Amato appointed Mr Paolo Baratta,
his planned successor, to a new ministerial job, with responsibilities for
privatisation formerly held by the industry minister.
Separately, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the environment minister and former
European commissioner, said he was leaving the Socialist party for the
Democratic Alliance being formed by some politicians and intellectuals.
The scandal continued to spread at the weekend. Mr Antonio Cariglia,
chairman of the Social Democratic party, which forms part of the ruling
coalition, was informed by magistrates that he is under investigation over
alleged kickbacks linked to the port of Manfredonia.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Shell faces heavy losses on Japanese currency dealings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL DUTCH/Shell stands to lose up to several hundred million pounds as a
result of unauthorised foreign exchange contracts entered into by a Japanese
associate company.
Showa Shell Sekiyu, Japan's leading oil refiner and distributor which is 50
per cent owned by Shell Petroleum, has announced charges for the year to
December 31 1992 of Dollars 1.05bn (Pounds 730m) on a series of speculative
forward contracts entered into since 1989. That will result in a charge of
Pounds 131m against profits to Royal Dutch/Shell in its results for the 1992
financial year.
The company estimates that the total potential losses to Showa, which is
quoted on the Tokyo stock exchange, could ultimately be as high as Dollars
1.35bn. Although these are material sums compared with Shell's profits last
year of Pounds 2.9bn, the group was planning to wait until its results were
announced on Thursday before revealing the losses.
The speculative contracts totalled Dollars 6.4bn and were entered into at an
exchange rate of Y145 per dollar. The dollar has since fallen and stood at
Y119 to the dollar last Friday.
Shell made a statement yesterday after details of the unauthorised contracts
became public in Tokyo on Saturday.
It said the contracts were reported to the management of Showa in late
December last year and that a full investigation was under way.
It said its internal auditing procedures and controls had been tightened. It
added that some disciplinary action was already taking place and further
such action could be taken in the future.
The group - in common with most international traders - has substantial
hedging contracts to protect it from foreign exchange fluctuations. But an
official said its practice - which extends to associate companies - is not
to permit speculative dealings.
'The directors view this matter with concern,' he said. 'They support
actions of Showa's management to ensure that it will not happen again.'
Shell said that the future charges to be taken had not yet been fully
quantified but it had taken steps to limit its exposure.
Separately, it said that there had been a change in accounting policy for
1992, which would provide a one-off credit of Pounds 149m.
Showa had net assets of Pounds 700m in 1991, Pounds 8bn in revenues and
Pounds 100m in income. Its workforce was 2,360. Shell has a Pounds 228m
share of its net book value.
Mr Takeshi Henmi, Showa Shell president, told a news conference on Saturday
that his finance section had ignored company rules and independently
speculated with huge dollar futures contracts.
Reports in Japanese newspapers said Mr Henmi pledged that the company would
make up the shortfall by selling assets, including stocks and property, once
it had confirmed the extent of the loss.
Royal Dutch/Shell will report its preliminary year-end results on Thursday,
when a small increase in profits is expected pushing the figure up to Pounds
3bn compared with Pounds 2.89bn for 1991.
The company is likely to raise its dividend in line with inflation to about
22p from 20.9p last time.

FT  22 FEB 93 / Heseltine defends 'market solution' for Leyland Daf: Belgian
and Dutch package excludes UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, defended his
decision to put his faith in the receivers of Leyland Daf yesterday after
the Belgian and Dutch governments agreed a rescue package for the parent
truck company that excluded its three British plants.
The resurrection of the truckmaker as a new slimmed-down company backed by
fresh equity and injections of capital from the Belgian and Dutch
governments contrasted with Mr Heseltine's refusal to pledge financial
support for the company's UK operations. 'I don't believe that intervening
with money produces long-term solutions,' he said.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said: 'There could not
be a clearer example of how Britain is losing out to countries with an
industrial strategy because we have a government with none.'
As union leaders and Labour opponents criticised his stance, Mr Heseltine
appeared confident that what he called 'the market solution' led by
administrative receivers would secure a future for the remaining British
factories. The receivers of Leyland Daf said inclusion of the British plant
in the new company would have offered a 'fast track solution' for the UK
subsidiary. They would now concentrate on negotiations with potential
purchasers.
Talks should be strengthened, however, by potential outlets for the UK
plants secured by the receivers with the new company.
The receivers said yesterday they had secured the intellectual property
rights necessary for the independent British operations and had potential
supply agreements with the new company. These would cover axles and
components from the Albion plant in Glasgow, pressings from Washwood Heath
in Birmingham and components from Leyland in Lancashire.
The new venture had also given an undertaking to look at ways for Leyland's
45 series light van to be distributed within its continental dealership
network.
The company's Dutch receivers reached agreement at the weekend with the
Dutch and Belgian governments, banks and institutional investors on raising
Fl 467m (Pounds 178m) in fresh equity for a new-style Daf.
The new company, Daf Trucks NV, will concentrate on the market for medium to
heavy trucks, and its industrial operations will be divided between the
Netherlands and Belgium. The new company will employ 3,500 people, about
half the original total in these two countries.
The Dutch government is to put up Fl 195m in risk-bearing capital, while the
regional government of Flanders in Belgium is contributing Fl 75m.
Together, the two governments will own about 57 per cent of the new company,
which is to be established later this week. Of the rest of the capital, Fl
110m will be provided by banks and insurance companies, Fl 50m by
institutional investors and Fl 37m by Daf's suppliers, dealers and
importers.
On top of this risk-bearing capital, bank loans of Fl 400m will be made
available by Dutch banks ABN Amro, Rabobank, ING Bank and the National
Investment Bank as well as by the Dutch subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais.
The original nine-bank consortium - including Barclays, Lloyds and National
Westminster - is understood to have been paid Fl 340m for the assets of the
old company in the form of cash, some debt for equity and some continuing
loans. The consortium had a syndicated loan of Pounds 800m to the collapsed
company.

FT  20 FEB 93 / US grand jury probes Eli Lilly over rules on drug
manufacture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A GRAND JURY is investigating Eli Lilly, the drugs company, in relation to
the company's compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory
requirements concerning its manufacturing operations, Alan Friedman reports
from New York.
A spokesman for the Indianapolis-based company said Eli Lilly had been
informed of a US government investigation that is being conducted by a
federal grand jury in Maryland.
The company said it believed the inquiry arose from a 1989 FDA review that
resulted in a voluntary agreement between Lilly and the FDA to strengthen
the company's manufacturing quality systems.
Mr Robert Williams, Lilly's vice-president for corporate quality and
environmental affairs, said in a prepared statement that the company had
complied with the terms of the 1989 agreement and claimed Lilly's
manufacturing quality systems were now 'among the best in the industry'. He
stressed that the government had not questioned the safety or efficacy of
any Lilly product in the marketplace. Lilly's share price declined yesterday
by Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 50 3/8 in the wake of the company's
announcement.

FT  20 FEB 93 / International Company News: JVC plans German closure to stem
losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VICTOR Company of Japan (JVC), the consumer electronics group which
specialises in video equipment, is planning to close one of its
manufacturing plants in Germany to stem mounting losses.
The move would be one of the most radical yet taken by one of Japan's
electronics groups to cut costs in the face of a prolonged slump in demand.
It is almost unheard of for a Japanese group to close a production plant and
lay off workers, even abroad.
The move suggests more Japanese companies may start to retrench from
overseas operations established in the 1980s when funds for investment were
cheap in Japan.
JVC said a videocassette manufacturing plant in Germany would dismiss all
its local employees, while a holding company in the Netherlands would be
absorbed by another German subsidiary.
The closures and the planned sale to a related company of some office
buildings in Tokyo, should compensate for the loss JVC expects for the year
to end-March. It would be JVC's second deficit after a pre-tax loss of
Y2.3bn last year, the first loss for four decades.
In October JVC reported a first-half Y13.5bn parent company per-tax loss.

FT  20 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Aircraft orders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Boeing's decision to reduce its workforce was inevitable after last month's
announcement of production cutbacks. While the scale of redundancies may
have been unexpected, it only underlines the miserable state of the aircraft
production industry. Output by the three main producers, which reached 860
airplanes in 1991, may fall below 500 next year. The North American market
is particularly poor, with fare wars pushing many carriers into the red and
forcing them to cancel aircraft orders.
That has hit Boeing in its home market. Airbus has a better geographical
spread of customers, notably in the growing Far East market, but the
European consortium is hardly immune. Airbus had hoped to expand production
substantially as its new A330 and A340 aircraft came on stream. Now it is
having to cut. Indeed, with both manufacturers determined to avoid large
numbers of unsold airplanes sitting on the tarmac, output will fall faster
than in previous recessions. Airbus has already slowed production once and
may have to cut output by a further 10 per cent in the next few months.
Leased aircraft may also prove a problem. Some carriers, can return
airplanes to the manufacturers at very short notice. At least 25 Airbuses
currently leased by American Airlines could be returned. The consortium
members, including British Aerospace, would have to carry the financing cost
of such aircraft. While the problem is not as severe, it is an unpleasant
reminder of the financing debacle in BAe's regional jet business.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Boeing cuts workforce by 28,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Boeing, the world's largest commercial jet manufacturer, plans to cut its
workforce over the next two years by 28,000, or 20 per cent, because of the
worldwide slump in the airline industry, Patrick Harverson reports from New
York.
Although Boeing originally unveiled plans for major job cuts last month when
it announced a significant reduction in aircraft production, the scale of
the lay-offs was larger than expected. Boeing said this year about 15,000
jobs will be shed in its home state of Washington, 6,000 will go from its
operations in Wichita, Kansas, and another 2,000 or more will be cut from
various sites across the US. Some 5,000 or more jobs will be axed in 1994.
Boeing will employ about 115,000 people when the lay-off programme is
complete.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Bank probed in Britain and US: Islamic Pan American Bank at
centre of alleged Salvation Army fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, JIMMY BURNS and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ALLEGED fraud that cost the Salvation Army Dollars 8.8m (Pounds 6.2m) is
believed to be part of a much wider international fraud involving a
mysterious Argentine bank under investigation by police and regulators in
the UK and US for more than 18 months.
The bank, Islamic Pan American Bank, has been the subject of British police
investigation since the summer. The Federal Bureau of Investigation in
Dallas, Texas, investigated the bank in July 1991 in connection with an
insurance fraud which has since resulted in the conviction and jailing of a
financier.
The US Comptroller of the Currency, the regulator of US banks, said
yesterday it had issued a formal warning on October 16 1991 that Islamic Pan
American and an affiliate, identified as Eastech, may have been operating a
banking business from Dallas, Texas, without authorisation. Both remain on
the Comptroller's warning list.
The Salvation Army - which has an income of Pounds 80m a year, of which
Pounds 12m comes from public donations - filed a fraud complaint in relation
to the loss of funds with the Metropolitan and City Police Company Fraud
Squad.
One of the most successful religious fund-raisers, the Salvation Army has
remained silent on the affair as investigations have deepened, although it
said one of its officers had been suspended on full pay. The affair only
came to light when, earlier this week, the Salvation Army issued a writ to
recover its money.
The Salvation Army, in its writ, seeks the return of Dollars 8.8m from bank
accounts which, it claims, were intended to be used in the purchase or sale
of standby letters of credit.
The writ to recover missing cash names the Islamic Pan American Bank,
nominally headquartered in Buenos Aires, as one of a number of international
banks and companies possibly holding its funds.
A standby letter of credit is a guarantee from a bank to a customer that it
will honour that customer's trade debts to a third party. They can be used
as collateral to borrow funds or be traded.
It is understood that the Islamic Pan American Bank was at the centre of a
police inquiry begun after a UK importer, claiming funds under standby
letters of credit provided by Islamic Pan American, found no trace of the
bank. The importer had tried to collect the funds after a shipment of goods
failed to arrive.
Regulatory authorities in the UK and the Argentine police, through Interpol,
were aware of the investigation.
According to the July 1992 edition of the Bankers Almanac, Islamic Pan
American is based in Buenos Aires with US offices at 6510 Abrams Road, Suite
300, Dallas, Texas. The telephone number for the address was contacted by
the Financial Times. It was answered by a Mr Jim Burch of commodity traders
Interfin. Mr Burch said he had lost Pounds 15,000 in a transaction involving
an individual claiming to represent Islamic Pan American Bank.
The Almanac says the bank has Dollars 286m capital. However, a regulator
said: 'We do not believe all the information in the Almanac.' The Almanac
also says that Price Waterhouse, the accountant, is the bank's auditor.
PW said last night that Islamic Pan American Bank was not a client of either
its Argentina practice or any other member firm in South America and that it
would be investigating the connection claimed by the bank.
The Buenos Aires address given in the Almanac appears to have been occupied
by Arab News Agency, which is listed in the Almanac as a subsidiary of
Islamic Pan American. Pinned to Arab News Agency's door is a notice saying
that the office was closed down by judge's order on 17 October 1991.
The solicitor acting for Mr Stuart Ford, one of the defendants in the
Salvations Army's civil case to recover missing funds, said yesterday that
Mr Ford denied any wrongdoing: 'His view is that everything will be sorted
out to the satisfaction of the Salvation Army on his return (to the UK),' Mr
Jim Crocker, of solicitor Howell and Co, said.
The Salvation Army's writ accuses Mr Ford, Tilen Securities and Mr Gamil
Naguib of 'fraudulently representing to the Salvation Army that they
proposed to invest and/or had invested Dollars 10m . . . and/or the sum of
Dollars 8.8m . . . in the purchase and sale of standby letters of credit.'
The three are also accused of 'misappropriating' the Dollars 8.8m and using
it for their own purposes.
Mr Ford made at least two property transactions and it was these which led
to the involvement in the affair of Edge &amp; Ellison, a leading Birmingham law
partnership. Between three and four weeks ago, Edge &amp; Ellison received a
telephone call from the Salvation Army, alleging that Mr Ford had absconded
with its money. Edge &amp; Ellison acted for Mr Ford in the purchase of
properties in Scotland and England.

FT  20 FEB 93 / International Company News: Olivetti pins survival hope on
specialisation - Can Carlo De Benedetti save his company twice?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Carlo De Benedetti, Olivetti chairman, cuts through the politely oblique
inquiries about his company's health like a surgeon wielding a scalpel: 'The
question you should be asking,' he says reprovingly, 'is can Olivetti
survive?'
His point is well taken. Olivetti may still be the largest European-owned
manufacturer of personal computers, printers and related equipment, but its
financial results in the past two years have made dismal reading.
The company lost L460bn (Dollars 297.5m) in 1991 after heavy restructuring
costs and is likely to post an operating loss for 1992 of between L300bn and
L350bn. Further restructuring charges are expected to add substantially to
the final loss figure, bringing it up to an estimated L750bn.
Mr De Benedetti, whose holding company, CIR, has a 38 per cent stake of
Olivetti's ordinary shares, has no doubts that the group cannot survive for
long without stemming the flow of red ink and returning to profitability,
He claims, however, that Olivetti's chief problems are not financial,
drawing attention to its strong balance sheet and predominantly long-term
maturity of its debts. 'Our problem is whether we can successfully execute
our survival strategy. We have to convince our large customers that we will
be around in five years' time,' he says.
Olivetti, in common with the rest of the world's main computer
manufacturers, has been hit hard by profound changes in the indystry's
structure.
Hardware prices have plummeted - personal computer prices fell by 75 per
cent between 1991 and 1992. Customers are demanding 'open' or
industry-standard computers that command low gross profit margins rather
than the proprietary designs which have dominated the industry to date.
Olivetti's sales fell 6.8 per cent from L8,607bn to L8,025bn in 1992,
reflecting lower hardware costs, intense competition and the state of the
European economy.
The company, however, is also fighting to eliminate the effects of two
disastrous strategic errors that have compounded its problems.
The purchase of the office equipment manufacturer Triumph Adler from
Volkswagen in 1986. Triumph Adler will represent the largest element in the
1992 losses - half in operating losses, half in restructuring charges. The
restructuring element is believed to have amounted to about L150bn. A
further, much smaller, charge will have to be taken this year; by December,
Triumph Adler will have fewer than 200 staff compared with 3,000 in 1988.
The decision in 1988 by Mr Vittorio Cassoni, the former managing director to
meet the challenge of a fragmenting market by dividing the company into
three separate units to handle office products, systems and networks and
information services. The duplication of effort cost Olivetti dear as the
overall market collapsed. The three divisions have been wrapped back into a
single company.
Mr De Benedetti believes Olivetti has three characteristics that will enable
it to survive its greatest test.
First, it has proved its culture is adaptable to change. When he bought into
Olivetti in 1978, it was a loss-making typewriter company. He earned his
international reputation transforming the Ivrea-based concern into Europe's
most successful personal computer manufacturer, shifting first from
mechanical to electronic typewriters, then into PCs.
But can Mr De Benedetti manage the trick a second time? He says the company
has adaptability in its genes. He took day-to-day control of Olivetti in
1991, moving Mr Cassoni sideways to the role of international ambassador.
More recently he has appointed Mr Corrado Passera, one of his most trusted
lieutenants, to the post of joint managing director, but he emphasises his
continuing personal and financial commitment to the company.
'Olivetti is my life. It is run by an entrepreneur who is here in the office
every day and who has no interest in short-termism,' says Mr De Benedetti.
Second, it has made the right strategic choices. It has already moved away
from manufacturing in favour of software and services: 'We do not have
factories any more,' Mr De Benedetti says, with only a little hyperbole. At
one stage in the 1980s, there were 14,000 people in manufacturing. By the
end of the year there will be only 4,700.
Mr Passera fleshes out the strategy: 'We have become a systems company. Our
turnover can now be subdivided into three parts of more or less equal size -
professional services, systems and products. Office products, for example,
which used to generate 80 per cent of revenues, now generate only 10 per
cent.'
'Our focus is on Europe and on specific industries such as banking and
financial services. Other markets are marginal. Our target size for the end
of 1993 is 37,000. That gives us critical mass for professional services and
for networking.'
The strategy means the company will be retrenching in regions such as
Australia, the US and Canada, where the aim will be to avoid losses rather
than make profits.
The company is committed to open systems and has secured a number of
strategic alliances, giving it access to leading-edge technology, the most
recent with Digital Equipment of the US. In return for a 4 per cent equity
stake, Olivetti will have access to Digital's new alpha microprocessor, said
to be the world's fastest.
It is possible, Mr Passera says, that the company could develop a fourth
industrial specialisation in telecommunications through a strategic alliance
with a telecommuni-cations company. Italian analysts have regularly
speculated on some form of link with the state-owned STET telecommunications
group. This, however, seems unlikely, not least because of domestic
political differences between Mr De Benedetti and some of the governing
parties.
The third leg in Mr De Benedetti's survival strategy is financial strength.
The balance sheet is strong and even after this year's losses, he says, the
company will have Dollars 3bn in cash.
It expects to break even at the operating level, including financial charges
this year, and make a profit in 1994.
Some may remember Mr Cassoni making similar forecasts for 1992 little more
than a year ago. It will be a vital test of Mr De Benedetti's campaign to
convince customers of Olivetti's staying power that the numbers come out
closer to expectations this time round.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Labour's links with unions of 'immense value', finds report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE long-awaited interim report on the future of the Labour party's links
with the trade unions suggests they are 'a cause for celebration rather than
concern'. It argues strongly that Labour's relationship with the unions
'continues to be immensely valuable to the party'.
However, the document proposes an end to the union block vote at party
conference and the eventual introduction of one member one vote for the
selection of parliamentary candidates and election of the party leader.
But the 15-strong group of senior union officials and Labour MP's was unable
to agree on firm recommendations. Instead their report, to be presented to
the party's national executive committee, sets out a series of options.
A questionnaire will be sent out to trade unions and constituency parties.
They will have until June 10 to respond. The NEC will then decide on precise
proposals and present them for approval at the party conference in the
autumn. But Mr John Smith, the party leader, is expected to comment on the
union-party links at next Wednesday's NEC meeting.
The only member of the review group to oppose the party's present links with
the unions was Mr Tony Blair, Labour's home affairs spokesman.
The report is firm in its proposal to end the union block vote at party
conference and replace it with a system under which the voting entitlement
of each union is divided up among its delegates and cast separately.
It also agrees on the gradual move to a 50-50 voting parity between the
unions and constituency parties in the annual conference, although it
suggests the introduction in the autumn of a 70-30 split between union-party
voting strengths should be retained for the time being.
The group argues strongly for maintaining union links with Labour. It argues
the unions are 'a realistic and stabilising force in the party without whom
on many occasions in the past few decades the Labour party would have torn
itself apart'.
It suggests unions' involvement keeps the party more closely in touch with
'the concerns and preoccupations of people who vote Labour'.
The report also stresses the direct links the unions provide for the party
to 8m trade union members and the organisational strength the unions can
provide at local level.
The group notes that 'a quiet revolution' has been taking place in 'the
public appreciation of the relevance of trade unions.' But it believes
changes are needed to bring 'a new dynamism' to the union-party
relationship.

<TEXT>
MR JOHN REED, chairman and chief executive of Citicorp, is being paid a
Dollars 1.035m bonus for 1992 due to the US bank's improved performance,
according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Reuter
reports from New York. His salary will stay the same at Dollars 1.15m.
The filing said Mr Reed, who was paid no bonus for 1991 and 1990, was being
given the bonus in recognition of the success of his two-year revamping plan
to return Citicorp to health.
Citicorp produced full-year 1992 net profits of Dollars 722m, after a loss
of Dollars 457m in 1991.
But Mr Reed was only awarded 90 per cent of his targeted bonus, reflecting
work still to be done at Citicorp.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Power deal may aid coal rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DEAL struck recently between the regional electricity companies and the
main power generators in England and Wales may have eased the government's
predicament as it struggles towards a coal rescue package.
The deal over thermal efficiency rates written into long-term contracts
tentatively agreed last month should result in better margins for National
Power and PowerGen than would have applied if assumptions in the existing
contracts had remained unchanged.
This may in turn encourage the generators to view with less hostility the
government's insistence that they finance the stockpiling of an extra 15m
tonnes of domestic coal.
Leaked correspondence dating from February 4 and 5 between Mr John Baker,
chief executive of National Power, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, indicated that there was a virtual impasse.
The deal on efficiency is understood to have been reached five days later on
February 9 or 10. 'No doubt the government is seeing this as useful,' said
an individual familiar with the negotiations.
'The concession the recs (regional electricity companies) made was against
the backcloth that the generators were being pressed to take additional coal
tonnages,' said another.
The agreement is favourable to the generators because they would be deemed
to have consumed less raw material per unit of electricity produced.
Efficiency improvements achieved over the past three years by closing
inefficient plant means that assumptions written into the present contracts
have fallen increasingly out of line with true efficiency levels and have
contributed to the generators' excess coal stocks.
Under the new agreements, due to come into force in April, the regional
companies would take about 5 per cent more electricity than under the old
arrangements.

FT  20 FEB 93 / 'Illiteracy' of students alarms Patten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR out of ten students entering further education colleges from school
need help with literacy and numeracy, according to a survey published
yesterday by the the Adult Literacy and Basic Skills Unit, an independent
body funded by the government.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, said the findings revealed 'worrying
levels of illiteracy'. He said they justified the government's policy of
compulsory testing of 14-year-olds, which he confirmed would be extended to
the subjects English and technology in England and Wales this summer.
In a move designed to divide opposition to the compulsory English tests, Mr
Patten announced that the results of the first year's tests would not be
published in school league tables. However, national totals will be
compiled, allowing parents to compare their children's performance with the
national average.
Teachers' unions had claimed that the tests, to be taken for the first time
in June, had been inadequately prepared and that material for them had
arrived at schools too late.
The two largest unions, the NUT and the NASUWT, said they would continue
balloting members over boycotting the tests. Other teachers' unions welcomed
the announcement.
Mr Peter Smith of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers described the
decision as 'statesmanlike'. He said it was evidence that Mr Patten had
heeded fears expressed over the tests in a meeting with teachers' unions
earlier this week.
Mr Patten also published consultation documents setting out the government's
plans for this year's performance tables for schools and colleges. The
league tables will cover 4,000 state secondary schools and 19,000 primary
schools. For the first time, they will also cover 2,000 independent schools,
and 470 sixth-form and further-education colleges.
The tables will include national curriculum test results; GCSE, A-level and
AS-level examination results; and truancy rates.
In a concession to independent schools, schools will be able to include GCSE
exam results taken up to three years before the age of 16.
Last year, only results in the previous two years could be included, which
meant that some schools which entered pupils very early for GCSEs appeared
have fewer pupils with five or more passes at grade C and above.

<TEXT>
The rescue of the New York Post could be in jeopardy in the wake of a legal
victory by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against a company
controlled by Mr Steve Hoffenberg, the newspaper's prospective buyer, Alan
Friedman reports.
Towers Financial, Mr Hoffenberg's debt collection and factoring business,
has consented to the SEC's demand for control over the company. It has also
consented to the appointment of a trustee and to limits on expenditures as
requested in a lawsuit by the SEC.
The SEC alleged that Mr Hoffenberg's company had fraudulently sold Dollars
215m (Pounds 151.4m) of notes and overstated its assets by more than double.
Towers Financial was described by the SEC as insolvent. The newspaper
takeover may be jeopardised because the SEC consent agreement limits the
funds that Mr Hoffenberg may spend.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Bentsen gives yen further impetus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US dollar fell sharply against the yen yesterday, reaching a record low
after US Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told reporters he wanted to see a
stronger yen.
In Tokyo the dollar had already touched Y119.23, its lowest point ever, with
the Japanese authorities showing little sign of trying to break its rise
against the US currency.
But Mr Bentsen's apparently offhand remark, which he did not elaborate on,
weakened the dollar still further to Y118.15. Traders said that if the
dollar-yen rate broke through a floor of Y118.0, that could trigger further
selling down to a new level of Y115.
The yen has strengthened throughout the week, apparently on rumours that a
meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers in London on
February 27 might try to engineer an appreciation of the yen to choke off
the rise in Japan's trade surplus with the US.
Mr Bentsen said the US would be in a much stronger position to 'restore its
rightful leadership' of the G7 because President Bill Clinton's programme of
increased taxes and cuts in federal spending would set a better example of
economic policy.
Worries that the Clinton economic programme might undermine the US recovery
have also weakened the dollar in Tokyo this week. However, the surge in the
yen is also likely to be due to Japanese companies repatriating funds from
abroad to improve their finances before books close on March 31. Most
Japanese companies are facing their third year of declining profits.
Mr Mamoru Ozaki, the Finance Ministry's vice minister and most powerful
bureaucrat, said there was no need for policy changes to address the
strengthening of the yen.
The Japanese government would be happy for the yen to appreciate gradually,
in part because this might help to correct the trade surplus. But senior
officials at both the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan rule out any
concerted effort by the G7 to manipulate exchange rates to reduce the
surplus.
The long slowdown in Japanese money supply growth may be reaching its end,
according to Bank of Japan figures published yesterday.
The broadly defined money supply fell by 0.3 per cent in January from a year
earlier, the fifth consecutive month of contraction. However, the rate of
contraction has eased considerably in the past few months from a 0.6 per
cent fall in October and November and 0.4 per cent in December.
The bank's measure of broad liquidity, meanwhile, grew by 2.5 per cent from
a year before, an unchanged rate from December.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Renault-Daf project switches to France

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE planned Pounds 300m-Pounds 400m Excel van project between Renault of
France and the collapsed commercial vehicle maker Leyland Daf is to be taken
over by Renault.
Production of the vehicles, intended to replace Leyland Daf's 200/400 models
and Renault's Trafic range by 1995, will be moved from Birmingham to France
before the year's end.
Final negotiations on the transfer are under way between Renault and Leyland
Daf administrative receivers. A formal agreement is expected early next
week.
The remaining 190 Leyland Daf employees working on the project - 80 were
made redundant on Tuesday - have been offered continuing employment until
the move to France.
It is unclear whether the French vehicle maker, one of Europe's largest,
will seek another partner for the project.
Renault and Daf NV signed an agreement to develop the Excel range in 1989.
The plan was for Leyland Daf to build its version at Birmingham's Washwood
Heath vans plant, with Renault producing its vehicles at Batilly, eastern
France. Each side had spent about Pounds 45m up to the time of Daf's
collapse.
Management at the vans plant, led by managing director Allan Amey, are
continuing efforts to assemble a management buy-out of the mainstream vans
operation, with the advice of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
Job losses will mount across France in the first half of this year as
industry continues to cut costs and prune investment, according to the
latest business survey by Insee, the state statistics institute, Alice
Rawsthorn writes from Paris.
The rise in unemployment, after last year's 5 per cent increase to 2.98m
people, will keep consumer confidence and spending depressed, the survey
says. There is also little hope of a recovery in industrial expenditure.
The 2,000 companies questioned expected an overall cut of 4 per cent in
industrial investment this year.
Yesterday's announcement confirms the gloomy tone of the Bank of France's
business survey published on Monday and follows Thursday's news that the
Insee industrial production index fell in December to its lowest level for
four years.

FT  20 FEB 93 / The old master of television shows his age: Alice Rawsthorn
finds the French president looking increasingly like a man overtaken by
history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand is far too experienced a political player to
be tricked into making the same diplomatic gaffe on television two nights in
a row.
When he returned last night to the theme of Europe's future in his second
successive live question and answer session on French TV, he suggested that
the UK government would find itself 'left on its own' for failing to sign
the European Community's social chapter, rather than berating it for a 'lack
of solidarity' as he did on Thursday.
The 76-year-old president was rather less guarded in his comments on French
domestic affairs. 'What's it got to do with me?' he snapped when quizzed
about the re-opening of the Pechiney insider trading scandal.
He then declared there had been 'no favouritism' in last Monday's deal
whereby three state financial companies bought shares in Adidas, the German
sportswear company, from Mr Bernard Tapie, the socialist minister of urban
affairs.
The TV appearances marked Mr Mitterrand's debut in the French parliamentary
election campaign.
The Socialist party, which he revived in 1971, has done so badly in the
campaign that some polls predict it will not only be trounced by the
conservatives in next month's elections, but beaten into third place by the
ecologists.
Mr Michel Rocard, former socialist prime minister, on Wednesday called for a
'political big bang' in which the left would abandon the Socialist party
after the elections in favour of an alliance with ecologists and human
rights activists.
Mr Mitterrand has, in the past, been such a master of the television medium
that he should have shrugged off such handicaps.
His TV style is typically a brilliant blend of presidential gravitas,
usually deployed when he wants to avoid answering tricky questions, peppered
with colloquial references, which not only lend him a reassuringly avuncular
air to the electorate, but enable him to flirt unashamedly with female
interviewers.
What the socialists needed was a repeat of his virtuoso performance in the
three-hour TV debate before last autumn's Maastricht referendum. What they
got was a president who looked worn, weary and even evaded a few questions.
He stumbled over dates on Thursday and almost lost his temper last night.
The tone of the questions was remittingly bleak. One unemployed man worried
about his pension. A hospital worker deplored the 'dreadful deterioration'
in medical standards. 'What will become of our Lorraine?' wailed one
middle-aged woman. Another lamented the decline of the Ardeche. 'Our
businesses are closing. Our farms are disappearing,' she said.
'That's demographics,' said President Mitterrand, looking increasingly like
a man overtaken by history.
Liberation, the centre-left newspaper, said in an editorial yesterday that
he had seemed 'cut off' and that instead of delivering 'a big bang' like Mr
Rocard, all the president could come up with was 'a black hole'.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Private View: Lawyer whose profession is peace - Torkel
Opsahl, a Norwegian expert on human rights, has returned to the Irish
conflict to head a citizens' inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN AN upstairs room in Belfast this week, a Catholic taxi-driver whose son
was killed by a Protestant gunman was answering questions from the widow of
the last prime minister of northern Ireland.
Listening to him in the front row of the audience was the lanky figure of a
well-known Ulster Unionist borough councillor, one of the Province's landed
aristocracy.
A woman with a well-educated English accent rose to tell the panel that the
front of her house was in a Catholic street, the back in a Protestant one
and that nobody would talk to the army or police for fear of being, as she
put it, 'bumped off'.
At the back of the room a woman with an Irish accent complained of 'a
colonial situation'. A grey-bearded man with a briefcase said both sides
should take up meditation. Could he have Pounds 75,000 to buy a vacant hall
in the city?
This was a session of the Opsahl Commission, an independent, charity-funded
'citizens' inquiry' which has been taking the views of everyone from
prelates to prisoners in the hope of making fresh sense of a conflict which
has defied all efforts for 23 years.
The commission's chairman is Torkel Opsahl, a human rights expert who is
professor of law at the University of Oslo. His experience of human conflict
dates back to the Cold War - he studied in New York and Moscow in the early
1950s - and includes the Middle East and Bosnia today.
But what can a Norwegian professor, however qualified and however well
assisted by his panel of six commissioners, hope to extract from the
most-analysed political problem of the western world?
Over a late-night glass of lager, I asked him why he had accepted the
invitation.
'There is a personal dimension and a professional answer,' he said. Opsahl's
lawyer-like discretion seems more acquired than inborn: he is a man who
appears to enjoy an excuse to unbutton. Several times he emphasised that he
was tonight making an exception of his rule not to talk too much.
He told me that he had heard many Irish cases in the 1970s as a member of
the European Commission of Human Rights and had got to know many victims -
or alleged victims - of the security forces.
Cases sent up from the Maze Prison? I asked.
'Oh, yes I have been to the Maze prison to interview Bobby Sands (the hunger
striker) a week before he died.'
But this is not really a human rights inquiry, is it?
'No, it's not. It's peacemaking . . . no, that's too pretentious. But it's
an effort to see if there is after all any light in the end of this tunnel.
This commission is a very different thing but it rang a bell with me because
I have friends from that time.'
After years working on human rights Opsahl was tempted by the chance to play
a new role. Besides, life in Oslo was becoming dull.
What can an outsider bring to the job, apart from a pair of ears?
'But that's the most important thing. I didn't expect to bring anything but
they asked me to come. I said I will bring whatever understanding I have. I
can listen, I can read.'
Is this really a lawyer's task?
'Lawyers are useful for many things, to find honourable compromises, that's
our purpose. 'Trained incapacity', isn't that what lawyers have?'
The professor of constitutional law is a beefy-looking man who took up his
profession 'for a strange mixture of reasons'; one of which was that 'you
could still become a journalist, playwright or sports star'. He felt no envy
for friends who went on to big things: one is Norway's foreign minister,
another its chief justice.
Opsahl is a founding member of Amnesty International and in that capacity
was an observer at the Daniel and Sinyavsky trial in Moscow. For 15 years he
was an adviser for the Nobel Peace Prize committee but resigned,
unobtrusively, in protest at the joint award in 1973 to Henry Kissinger and
the north Vietnamese Le Duc Tho.
He is also one of the five lawyers who have been collecting information for
the UN about war crimes in Bosnia: their report has just gone to the
secretary-general.
At one point I said something about northern Ireland's middle class being
above the conflict. Opsahl leapt on the word class.
'Are you a Marxist? I thought I was until I met my wife (a teacher of
philosophy). She was a Marxist-Leninist and I had to talk her out of it  -
and at least the Leninist part has gone.
'I was for a time attracted to the class analysis. You say 'middle-class'. I
think of the Protestant and Catholic working class here and I don't think
Marx has helped them a lot. God hasn't either, as far as I can see. But the
class analysis may still be valid here.'
I asked him what prejudices he brought to the job. If he had prejudices, he
said, they would arise from having come in contact with people ill-treated
by the authorities. But, he assured me, he had not from that concluded that
the army and Royal Ulster Constabulary were made up only of oppressive
bigots.
'No more did I come here with the idea that this is the last part of the
Empire which Britain is fighting to preserve, or anything like that.'
Opsahl was reluctant to advertise his views before the commission, whose
hearings end next week, reports this summer.
A few things are clear. One is that he mistrusts the idea of
'self-determination'.
'It is a good slogan wherever you go and it causes a lot of killing and
bloodshed. But I don't think it's a very helpful concept, especially not in
northern Ireland.'
Another is that he thinks ethnic conflict should be tackled pragmatically,
not by brandishing principles. He had learned what he called a deep wisdom:
'It is that conflict is inevitable in all societies, conflicts have no
solutions, conflicts must be managed but they can't be solved. Someone in
the UN Human Rights Commission said once that if you want solutions you
should ask for chemists.
The process was more important than report, he added. One of the 600
submissions had suggested that it might be better to abandon talks at the
political level and try to build consensus slowly, undramatically, on the
ground.
'I like the sound of this, but I don't know where it leads us. Because it
could look rather, what do you call it?'
Defeatist?
'Defeatist, yes - that we can't do anything political, that we only work on
social matters, on the environment, commerce and unemployment. Should one
come out publicly and say there is no institutional answer?'
Opsahl would not answer his own question directly but he reminded me that
there is another argument: unionist fears and nationalist demands mean there
can be no peace until the constitutional problem has been dealt with.
I get the impression your inquiry is not taken seriously here, I said.
'But I have never had so much press in my life before. Anyway, it doesn't
matter so long as we get all these intelligent submissions.'
If the process is ignored, the result may be ignored too.
'Yes. If it's ignored by politicians and those who have influence, ideas and
the will to do something - then we have lost.'
What is your minimum expectation and what is your maximum hope?
'The minimum ambition is to write a good report. You can say that even a
good report will just go into the drawer somewhere. But I think it will be
read with attention by most of those who can influence developments here. I
am not saying they will adopt the proposals, but it may give them some
insights.
'My maximum expectation is of course that the process will lead to peace in
northern Ireland within the foreseeable future. I say 'peace' because I
think the ending of the violence is a precondition for results, but I am not
saying there must be formal peace agreement.
'Most of the parties to the conflict have locked in pictures of each other
as enemies. But they should be told that really they have no enemies. It's
more fear than animosity which is the problem.'
When you are back on your farm in Norway does this commission keep you awake
at night?
'I see this as a job, not as my own destiny. But as I said earlier on I've
done enough fact-finding and applying laws. This is different. It's . . .
again, 'peacemaking' is too ambitious . . . being part of a process for
managing conflict. I've always believed that conflicts are there to be
managed if they cannot be solved.'

FT  20 FEB 93 / Pretoria's environmental test: The battle near South
Africa's St Lucia game reserve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT FIRST thought, it seemed an outrage. In the midday heat, I had stopped
for water on the long march up the slopes of the St Lucia sand dunes,
through darkly green tangled forest, home to the black rhino. Under the
spell of the surrounding bushveld, I could hardly bear to think of the plan
to strip-mine adjacent dunes for lucrative heavy minerals.
Surely it was sacrilege to allow Mammon's bulldozers to rip through the
dangling lianas and uproot the feathery thorn trees, to chase away insect
and mammal, to destroy the magical wilderness which had soothed my urban
soul?
South African nature lovers had all reacted similarly on learning that
Richards Bay Minerals, a South African company 50 per cent owned by RTZ and
one of the world's most profitable mining concerns, planned to mine near
Natal's St Lucia game reserve, and its extraordinarily beautiful coastal
dunes and coral reefs, saline lakes and marshes.
Some 300,000 people signed petitions to protect the site on the Indian Ocean
coast, an area designated under the 1971 Ramsar agreement (drawn up under
the auspices of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and
signed by South Africa) as a globally important wetland.
An environmental impact assessment of the project by independent scientists
is to be released on March 18. It will be reviewed by a public panel headed
by a judge, but the government will have the final say.
Conservationists defend one of South Africa's few remaining wilderness areas
with zeal, urging the spiritual benefits of communion with nature against
the demonstrable returns of a mining project expected to generate R6bn
(Pounds 1.3bn) over 17 years from exports of titania slag, pig iron, rutile
and zircon.
Apartheid adds a further twist to the environmental dilemma: in the new
South Africa, with its desperate need for jobs and economic development,
nature conservation is often seen as a white elitist concern.
Conservationists have largely themselves to blame for this: they evicted
blacks from their ancestral homes to create game reserves from which blacks
were barred.
For the moment, the debate is largely between whites: Richards Bay Minerals
on one side and such internationally respected figures as Ian Player, the
Natal conservationist who saved the white rhino from extinction, and author
Laurens van der Post, on the other.
The company admits it was slow to defend its plans when it announced them
three years ago. Since then, it has built an impressive case in favour of
mining 1,400 hectares of sand dunes which are outside the nature reserve,
but within the area designated as a protected wetland under international
convention. (A government commission decided in the 1960s to create a
Greater St Lucia Wetland Park, encompassing the entire area, but the project
never happened.)
The company's defence relies on its promise to restore the dunes after
mining: to reshape them, replant them and return them to their original
fecundity.
Nature lovers can be forgiven for scepticism about such a quasi-divine
undertaking; but the results of RBM's dune rehabilitation project at nearby
Richards Bay are impressive. It is 14 years since the first dunes were
mined, the replanted forest can boast 250 plant species compared with 243 in
the original forest, and RBM scientists believe half the bird species common
in a mature forest are already present. Company scientists believe the dune
forests will reach maturity in about 25 years; and though they will not be
identical to the original forest, they will be equivalent in biological
diversity.
Ideological purists oppose the notion of mechanically rebuilding dunes
formed by natural forces; but little of the proposed mining area is pristine
forest. Two-thirds is covered in pine plantations, which are being
harvested. The Natal Parks Board plans to leave the area to regenerate on
its own.
The conservationists' main concern is that mining will disturb the hydrology
of the dunes: the underground channels which carry rain water to supplement
the fragile ecosystem of nearby Lake St Lucia, the focus of one of South
Africa's richest wildlife reserves and the biggest estuarine lake in Africa.
Player argues that, in droughts, fresh water from the dunes alone sustains
the lake's hippos and crocodiles (the hippo population is the largest in
southern Africa). Environmentalists fear the fragile saline balance of the
lake will be disturbed, both by destroying these channels, and by the extra
water used in mining. They say RBM should mine a nearby area which is less
environmentally sensitive - but which the company says would be far less
profitable.
The new South Africa is a harshly pragmatic place where economic development
is seen as crucial to a peaceful transition to democracy - and where the
prospect of R6bn in foreign exchange earnings could easily outweigh the
longer-term benefits of more sustainable jobs but much smaller revenues if
eco-tourism were developed in the area.
Indeed, with the impact assessment understood to stop short of predicting
definite damage to the area (while failing to promise there will be none),
mining will probably go ahead. Only time will tell whether future
generations will again enjoy the peace of the dunes - with a little help
from man.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Mark of evil on Adam's Apple: Dominic Lawson investigates
the apparent rise in violence by Britain's young
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Black Museum is the name given to a long dank room in the basement of
New Scotland Yard. In it are collected exhibits of some of the ghastliest
crimes and punishments.
The Black Museum is not open to the general public, but instead provides an
afternoon's diversion for groups of people who have professional contact
with the police, such as solicitors, and, it must be admitted, journalists.
Just below the ceiling, by the door, is a row of death masks of the heads
and necks of rather non-descript looking men. If the police are hunters,
these are some of their trophies.
The policeman showing visitors round is inclined to ask the question: 'Can
you see any common factor in the appearance of these men?'
The answer, given with relish, is: 'They all have crushed Adam's Apples.'
The trophies are the death masks taken of criminals who had just been
hanged.
The original reason for the taking of death masks of criminals in the 19th
century was, in fact, to find some common factor of physiognomy, in
particular of the skull.
At that time the fashionable idea in criminal pathology was that not only
was there such a thing as a criminal mind; there was also a criminal face.
Not surprisingly the criminal face was supposed to be somewhat ape-like,
with a low brow, and small, narrow set eyes. The idea was that policemen
would come into the Black Museum, study the skulls, and look for similar
characteristics among suspects.
Nowadays we laugh at such methods of detection. But the inspector plods of
the 19th century did not have DNA testing to aid them in their hunt for the
guilty men. And perhaps there is a case for returning to the idea of, if not
the criminal face, at least that of the criminal cerebellum.
The country has been shocked by an apparent wave of crime among the young.
The police have arrested two boys of 10 in connection with the kidnapping
and murder last weekend of a two-year-old Liverpool toddler, James Bulger.
On Tuesday the newspapers reported the case of a 13 year old boy who is
alleged to have stolen more than 200 cars. He is being held in a Pounds
500-a-day 'secure unit', more than 300 miles from his home. The boy was
taken from court in handcuffs.
On the same day the case was also reported of a 15 year old schoolboy,
Stuart Smith, who broke into the home of a 23 year old mother, and, at
knifepoint, raped and assaulted her over a period of two hours. The
schoolboy threatened to kill the woman's one year old child, if she did not
submit. At one point the child woke up, and the boy sexually assaulted the
mother as she attempted to comfort the infant.
Fortunately, the judge who recently freed another 15 year old rapist with
the recommendation that he pay Pounds 500 to give the victim 'a good
holiday' was not presiding over this case. Stuart Smith was ordered to be
detained for life.
These, and other cases have started a process of national self-examination,
to find out why we are breeding a new class of sadistic killers. Probably we
are not. It is not so much that crime is increasing among the young, as that
the reports of it have become far less heavily censored than in the past.
Forty years ago the newspapers would talk only of 'serious offences' in the
reporting of crimes of an unnatural sexual nature. Nowadays even The Daily
Telegraph uses the word 'buggery' when covering such matters. And assaults
on little children, with or without the social workers' invented category of
'Satanic Ritual' are also traditional English pursuits, like fox-hunting and
pigeon-fancying.
As Brian Masters, a specialist in the field of criminal analysis, wrote in
my own magazine last week: 'A statute in the reign of Henry II fixed the age
of consent at ten, which presupposes that sexual contact with young girls,
even perhaps with girls under ten, was then common, if it had to be
prohibited by law.'
I suspect that single parent families, now widely - and with some reason -
touted as the source of youthful criminal excess, were not so widespread in
the days of Henry II. Nor was the sentencing of youthful offenders
particularly lax in medieval England.
As the novelist Sally Emerson wrote this week in The Times: 'Even among the
very young there are children who are simply bad. Certain children show a
savagery, even as babies, which is frightening. Their parents,
interestingly, are unable to see the evil others witness.' Primitive stuff.
Perhaps it is time for the police to dust off those death masks in the Black
Museum, and bring them up into the light, for the public good.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Truth of the matter: Caring for the carers - Euthanasia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIA RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE current debate on how far doctors may go to relieve the sufferings of
the terminally ill, I believe the advances in palliative medicine have often
been underestimated, particularly by those who say mercy killing can be
justified.
The UK is a world leader in this branch of medicine (the science of
treatments to relieve symptoms created by disease, rather than curing the
disease itself). It started when Dame Cicely Sanders founded the Modern
Hospice Movement in 1959. A new concept at the time, it unfortunately
continues to be an alien concept today.
Palliative medicine is now a recognised postgraduate speciality in the
National Health Service. It is, however, unique, in that it started in
people's homes and in the charitable sector.
The health service recognised the enormous value of charitable hospices and
has therefore incorporated and accredited some hospices in which doctors can
train in the speciality.
It is well-known that most people wish to die at home. The reality is that
most people die in hospitals. This can be changed. The answer is to support
patients and their relatives in the home. In 1911, 27-year-old Douglas
Macmillan looked on helplessly as his father suffered from, and eventually
died from, cancer of the oesophagus. Later that same year he set up Cancer
Relief. Today there are nearly 1,000 Macmillan nurses throughout the United
Kingdom, most of whom are community-based.
Recently, the role of the Macmillan nurses has extended into helping improve
care for patients in hospitals as well. Their main role is support and
advice about alleviation of symptoms.
Ask yourself, what is the role of a hospice? Many will answer: it is a
refuge for the dying. No, I say, it is a place to control symptoms that
cannot be managed at home. The symptoms may be those of the patients or the
carer.
The reasons for admission to a hospice are numerous. They include physical
symptoms such as pain, vomiting, fatigue, weakness, loss of mobility and
many others. There are emotional factors such as fear, anxiety, panic or
depression. The list is endless. Then there is the question of a carer, or
lack of a carer at home. Respite admissions, offering a period of rest for
the patient and the family, is also common.
Pain control is, of course, essential to the running of a good Palliative
Medicine Unit. Pain has many components to it. It is influenced by disease,
anxiety, previous experiences and fear. It is rare that pain cannot be
controlled, although each patient has a different pain threshold.
The greatest fear of dying patients, and indeed, the public at large, is
pain. The cry of 'I would rather die than be in pain' is heard all too
often. The reality is that the vast majority of patients' pain is well
controlled by specialists in this field. In an extremely small minority, if
pain control is inadequate, sedation is an alternative. This is effectively
increasing the patient's sleep. It is not taking life. It is kind. It is
compassionate. It is merciful to both the patient and his or her family and
loved ones.
Dealing with dying patients every day, I have yet to come across a patient
to whom we were not able to bring comfort in the last phases of life. The
most important question is therefore one of education, not euthanasia. If
patients and doctors know where to turn for help, cases such as that of Dr
Alan Cox, the Winchester doctor who was found guilty of killing a terminally
ill patient, will be history.
The health service has recognised the need. The speciality is growing and
new posts are being created by the NHS annually. Ultimately, we should have
palliative medicine physicians in all hospitals caring for those that are
terminally ill.
In a column on this page, Hugh Dickinson, the Dean of Salisbury, said that
if we do not 'address it (euthanasia) and find and acceptable legal
protection for it, I believe we will find people taking their own lives and
the lives of their dear ones into their own hands'. May I contradict him and
say that euthanasia is the removal of life and is not acceptable, and if the
law changes to make it in any way acceptable, then we most certainly will
run the risk of people taking the lives of their dear ones. Taking one's own
life is a different matter altogether.
So let us not change the law about euthanasia, but rather change our
attitudes to dying.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Arts: Dead pop lives]
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOW THAT contemporary pop music is dead, killed off by boredom, raves and a
healthy teenage rejection of the established, we can enjoy ourselves
indulging in the best of pop's past. After all, other art forms have long
feasted off dead poets, dead artists, dead composers.
So a warm welcome for the B-52s, a transitory star which flashed across the
pop firmament around 1980. They have been London's rave from the grave this
week at the Hammersmith Apollo. The B-52s' specialised in arty trash.
Everything about them was designed mildly to titillate the style set.
They were from Athens - Athens, Georgia, wouldn't you know. Their name has
nothing to do with bombers (although it enables them to swoop around the
stage arms akimbo playing planes) but with the beehive hair style de rigueur
in the late 1970s. Their music was new wave disco but secondary to their
on-stage antics. These were built around two girl singers with competing
bouffants, come-on gestures, and clothes grabbed from a fancy dress chest,
prized apart by the decidely camp Fred Schneider.
The B-52s enjoyed their brief flutter of fame but then resurfaced in the
late 1980s. They are a cult, but a big one. If anything they have now
over-dosed on the kitsch. The ultimate B-52s' movie would be Hairspray out
of Twin Peaks. So no surprise that hair styles feature prominently in the
new stage show and that they have recruited Julee Cruise, the breathy singer
from Twin Peaks, to be one of the bimbos. In a black bunny suit, peroxide
hair, she grinds and pouts and postures like a try-out for the Kit Kat Club.
In contrast veteran Kate Pierson looks like a sedate Barbie Doll.
Most mesmerising of all is Schneider. Weighed down by silver chains, he is
the lawyer who has decided to come out of the closet at the firm's Christmas
party. There is a 'I know this is ridiculous but this is the real me'
expression on his po-face as he runs through the B-52s repertoire of very
silly songs, from 'Hot Pants Explosion' to 'Loveshack'.
The appeal of the B-52s is that they know it is tacky but they are not going
to crack up. Pretending to be lobsters with their one smash hit 'Rock
Lobster', or Wilson, Keppell and Betty in 'Mesopotamia', is a serious
business, and it is their integrity which makes it wholly enjoyable. Above
all the B-52s are fun.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Arts: A 'Trelawny' to warm the heart - Alastair Macaulay
hails the National's production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERE IS the best revival of a Pinero play I have seen, and the first to do
Pinero proud since the National staged The Magistrate some seven years back.
The whole production, a triumph of ensemble acting, brings out the best in
the play; and the first two acts, in particular, are among the Olivier
Theatre's triumphs. Everything shows how adroitly Pinero could interweave
three kinds of drama: realistic social comedy, backstage comedy, and
sentimental melodrama. And the play shuttles so delicately between laughter
and tenderness that tiny details may prompt laughter one moment, tears the
next.
The beauty of this Trelawny is not in its fun - more laughs could be milked
at several points - but in its human detail. It lies in little lines like
Mrs Mossop's 'I hope the affliction of short breath may be spared you,
Albert' (panting gently in an armchair) and Imogen Parrott's little
remembrance of 'a supper which rather - well, I'd had some strawberries sent
me from Hertfordshire' (looking momentarily bilious); and Sir William
Gower's quaint old pronunciations: (looking for chairs) 'Have ye no cheers
here?'
And it is at its most touching in the Telfers, former theatrical stars, now
rather pompous but learning to deflate their stature and become yesterday's
people. Pinero really creates a living world onstage - can an artist do
more? - so that the Act One lunch party is as real to us in all its
overlapping detail as that in Act One of The Three Sisters. Through this
tapestry, Pinero threads his central stories so subtly that you never know
for long how much it matters that Rose Trelawny should marry, or that Tom
Wrench's comedy should be staged.
Helen McCrory catches, with marvellous spontaneity, Rose's blend of outsize
theatricality and well-mannered refinement; and in her second-act costume
she looks ready to sit for Winterhalter. Robin Bailey makes Sir William's
fustian pronunciations one of the comic masterstrokes of the evening; and
those of us who have loved, since Black Snow, his genius with extraneous
wordless noises are treated to a gorgeous array of disapproving whinnies and
nervous mini-neighs, all in character. His finest moment comes as this old
grandfather tries to remember how Kean played Richard III. 'A horse] . . .
made something summer by . . .'
As the Telfers, Betty Marsden and Michael Bryant give object-lessons in the
old saying that there are no such things as small roles. It is perfect that
Marsden's first word, 'Violent,' should evoke Edith Evans (the full
trisyllabic emphasis deployed in Evans's Millamant). Bryant actually throws
away some of the comic potential of Telfer's adorably stuffy toast - throws
it away in favour of catching the character's faintly absurd dignity. There
is something about Bryant's greatness in supporting roles that makes me
tremble in awe.
The cast is large, admirable, and full of detail, and John Napier has
provided four different sets, each enlarging our sense of the world within;
I should like to describe all of them. There are moments when Pinero's plot
starts to seem too conventional (late in Act Three), and bit parts in Act
Four that are acted more for staple comedy than for sincerity. But I note
that Bernard Shaw found more fault with the 1898 premiere than I do with
this; and that he nonetheless found that it showed Pinero at his most wise
and affecting.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Arts: Amateurs take centre stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RICHARD LUCE, they said, was the best arts minister because he came to the
job 'without any preconceptions'. In other words, he knew nothing about the
arts and did not pretend to.
But he became the longest serving arts minister, and the forays he made into
the cultural hinterland brought a missionary gleam to his eye. He found
communities where the arts had a central social role, but the only arts
available were amateur.
After five years in the job Luce resigned, having ordered the most
fundamental reorganisation of arts funding and the Arts Council since Lord
Keynes set the ball rolling in 1945.
What is not generally known is that the amateur was at the core of his
thinking when he commissioned his former chief civil servant, Richard
Wilding, to reassess the arts subsidy structure.
Now Luce has become chairman of the Voluntary Arts Network (VAN), funded
with money from the Gulbenkian Foundation, the Baring Foundation and the
Arts Council. It will act as a catalyst for amateurs, with an information
network and training advice, as well as lobbying for the voluntary arts.
Peter Stark, the former head of Northern arts, is the director.
'I realised that it is entirely possible for people of all backgrounds and
talents, wherever they may come from, to enjoy music, opera, drama and
dance, or to learn to paint, write or become a craftsman' Luce said at the
Royal Society of Arts recently. 'But I became increasingly aware that,
despite all the advances made in the support of the professional artist,
society was paying scant attention to the potential role of the amateur.'
In the national arts strategy published last month the Arts Council has duly
broken with Keynes's founding principle that the amateur was not a real
artist. Research has found that more than half the population participates
in the arts somehow, and the final document, A Creative Future, pledges
support through practical help and funding for training.
And when VAN was just a steering group it commissioned a report from the
Policy Studies Institute which identified no fewer than seven million
voluntary artists, and half a million of them members of 28 umbrella
organisations like the National Federation of Music Societies.
The NFMS has 1,350 member societies, and there are probably as many more
which are not members. 'There is a remarkable resilience' said Russell
Jones, director of the NFMS. 'With the recession, cuts in local authority
funding, the difficulty of getting sponsorship, it's amazing they're not
going under in droves, but our membership has increased steadily.' Their
resilience may be that, unlike some professional bodies, amateur arts
organisations have diverse sources of funds, so that the loss of one is not
necessarily fatal.
Some sponsors have recognised the voluntary sector's potential, however.
Sainsbury saw it a decade ago, and the Choir of the Year competition - which
ended its seven-week BBC television run this week - is one of their longest
standing sponsorships, costing them about Pounds 250,000 a year.
BT's new marketing head, Rodger Broad, has taken amateurs further with the
BT Biennial, in which Little Theatre Guild amateur theatres get to put on a
professional play specially commissioned, and now the new 'Making More of
Music' programme with the NFMS, announced last month.
And the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme started by Luce, whereby first
time sponsors' largesse is matched by government money, is being modified to
reach amateurs.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Arts: St Jonathan's Passion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE ubiquitous, Jonathan Miller is now at pains to distance himself from
the opera establishment in Britain. He has consistently accused the London
critics of malicious attacks on his productions, renewing his complaints in
an extraordinary self-pitying interview published in The Independent last
week. Now Miller works exclusively in the US and mainland Europe, safely out
of reach of the slings and arrows of the London critical mafia.
But he has been tempted back to London to direct a dramatisation of the St
Matthew Passion, conducted by Paul Goodwin. The performances in Holy
Trinity, Sedding's beautiful church just off Sloane Square, are certainly
collector's items; fully staged versions have occasionally appeared in
German opera houses, but here the Bach passions have a ritualised concert
life, usually shorn of any liturgical significance. The object of this new
version, says the programme book, is to make the passion 'accessible to
audiences through its humanitarian and powerful messages'.
There is certainly nothing extravagant about Miller's dramatic packaging; it
is delivered in the round, with the two choirs (12 voices each) and the
period-instrument orchestras grouped around a small acting area. Everyone
wears casual clothes, the lighting is functional, props are confined to a
loaf of bread, an apple and a glass of wine; there is also a table at which
the Evangelist and later Pilate can sit. The chorus rises from its seats at
crucial moments, grouping and regrouping about the conductor, while the
soloists are more peripatetic; they migrate between the two antiphonal
bands, break the circle or move to join forces with the obbligato players in
the arias.
The effects are approximate, the dramatic elements generally obvious.
Nothing appears to articulate the parallel narrative flows of the action, to
make a contrast between the Evangelist's story-telling, which is sometimes
illustrated in mime, and the moments when the protagonists take on the
burden of the drama themselves, in which operatic conventions might have
been expected to apply. One hesitates to resort to the term, but the St
Matthew Passion contains its own element of alienation, and any version that
attempts to beef up its dramatic potency (begging the question of whether
that is needed at all) really ought to have taken that into consideration.
For a project that aims to make the work more accessible to an
English-speaking audience it seems extraordinary too that it should be sung
in German. In the end everything that Miller has added to the work seem
purely cosmetic; none of his glosses draws the listener into the action or
expose new layers of meaning, any more than transferring a production of
Tosca to fascist Italy or a Rigoletto to New York sheds new light on those
genuine operas.
The greatest achievement of this particular passion is probably to convey
the impression that everyone is consistently involved in the performance;
players and singers watch each other like hawks, and the chorus takes an
intense interest in what the soloists are saying and doing. That in itself
guarantees closer attention from the audience, and the musical performance
is a thoroughly decent one. Goodwin's effusive gestures convey a good deal
of brisk common sense; nothing is allowed to sag or drag, the lean
instrumental detail is always busy and pertinent. The choruses are young and
involved; there is an eloquent, lucid Evangelist from Rufus Muller, a woolly
toned but physically intense Christus from Richard Jackson, stylish accounts
of the remaining arias from Nancy Argenta, James Bowman, Jamie McDougall and
Stephen Varcoe. If the event is worth catching for its uncomplicated
musicality, the rest has curiousity value only.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Arts: Suggestion and dream - The work of Zoran Music and
Ricardo Cinalli
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a usually a great deal of contemporary foreign art on show in
London, but unless it conforms to current critical orthodoxy, we do not
always give it the attention it deserves.
Zoran Music is now 81. He was born in Slovenia, studied in Zagreb and then
Madrid, returning to Dalmatia at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. In
1944 he was arrested by the Gestapo and sent to Dachau. These many years
past he has divided his time between Paris and Venice and was indeed
accorded an Omaggio, a special showing at the Venice Biennale of 1984. But
occasional shows apart, he remains as shadowy and fugitive in his life as in
his art, his reputation more the creature of private enthusiasm than of
general acclaim - his work held in the Sainsbury Collection, for example, is
currently on show at the University of East Anglia at Norwich.
His manner of working is slight and sketchy, the image tentative in its
statement, hinted at, teased out of the gentle flurry of a few deceptively
rough, loose marks. It is an art not of any precise description, but of
suggestion, imaginative association, atmosphere, experience to recognise and
share. It may be a landscape, the dark, rich interior of a cathedral, a
Venetian alley, a seated figure: always the essential feeling is the same,
of the work left off, the sentence unsaid yet understood, the thought left
hanging in the air.
The works at Gimpel, drawings and paintings, fall into two groups: the
recent figures, the self-portraits and studies of the artist's wife, with
examples of earlier subjects such as the cathedral interiors; and works from
the Dachau series of the early 1970s which, with prescient pessimism, he
entitled 'We are not the last'.
It had taken Music 25 years to address his experiences at Dachau directly in
his art. There is a painting here, of about that time, of a fallen bush or
tree, a scrubby drawing in paint on the unprimed canvas, with the branches
or tendrils falling out untidily towards the viewer. And across the room we
find the same understated, formal composition, and the same untidy sprawl of
limbs, in the pile of corpses that is the lasting image and memorial of the
concentration camp.
Ricardo Cinalli is a young Italian painter with two current shows of
distinct groups of work. The series of large pastels on tissue paper, that
he calls his 'Premonitions', on which he has been working since 1985, is at
the Accademia Italiana; and at Long &amp; Ryle is his recent 'Dreams' series, in
tempera on board.
He is a figurative artist of remarkable technical ambition, his pastel
drawings worked on a truly architectural scale, despite the natural
flimsiness of the tissue as support and the delicacy of the medium. In
imagery too, ambition is very much the word, for he takes upon himself the
unforgiving test of the figure composition tradition, which in many respects
he carries off admirably. There is great energy to these works, remarkable
technical control in the drawing, and much fun and wit in the particular
content. His nude figures writhe and twist and fall about in their
unspecific, sub-classical Arcady, into which at any moment a monstrous foot
might fall, to squash them all.
But the technical command is itself a limitation, for to command so
extensive a surface with an essentially graphic technique, Cinalli has had
to resort to a particular and consistent mark that all too soon obtrudes as
a quality in itself - mannered and insistent, imposing its decorative visual
texture across the entire work. As decorative architectural pieces, set at a
distance, they serve well enough.
With the small tempera 'Dreams', on the other hand, he perversely takes more
risks. They are not altogether successful, but they are more interesting,
albeit quirky and inconsistent, often awkward and improbable in the drawing,
studies for further experiment and development. They too take their start in
the Renaissance composition tradition, in this case images and parables of
imprisoned saints and sinners, with angels arriving miraculously to set them
free - or less miraculously to be tempted in their turn. But they look also
to the nearer tradition, to the metaphysical strain in early 20th century
Italian painting, to de Chirico, Savinio, Carra and Sironi. There is more
going on and, we must hope, even more to come.
Zoran Music: Gimpel Fils, 30 Davies Street W1, until March 27. Ricardo
Cinalli: Accademia Italiana, 24 Rutland Gate SW7, until March 14 and at Long

FT  20 FEB 93 / Arts: Lutoslawski celebration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITOLD Lutoslawski turned 80 in January. He is a composer widely and justly
admired, since he has achieved a creative synthesis - between unfailing
'progressive' concern for form and content and equally unfailing knack of
'approachability', between experimental boldness of sound-invention and
strict probity of craft - matched by very few in this turbulent,
stylistically heterogeneous century of ours. He continues to compose (the
Fourth Symphony had its premiere in Los Angeles earlier this month); each
new work arrives at some fresh reconciliation of new and old, sounding
peculiarly fresh, exact and 'personal' the while and lasting not a note
longer than necessary.
This last week it has fallen to Manchester to host a Lutoslawski birthday
festival: eight days and nights of concerts, educational projects and talks.
The Royal Northern College, Manchester University (whose Professor of Music,
John Casken, has strong links with Lutoslawski from his student days in
Warsaw) and the Halle Orchestra have all joined in - and so has Radio 3,
broadcasting three of the events live.
Lutoslawski himself conducted the Halle's Thursday concert (final of the
three broadcasts). This brilliant event, crackling with vitality and
bursting with exuberant sonorities in sharp-cut outlines, seemed to sum up
everything that makes Lutoslawski worth celebrating. There was no new work
in it (no doubt there is a good reason why the festival was not permitted to
give the British premiere of the Fourth Symphony, but it seems a pity
nonetheless). Nevertheless, Chain 3 (1986), the Piano Concerto (1988), and
the Third Symphony added up to a uniquely satisfying programme.
The first is a virtuoso orchestral movement whose parts sparkle in separate,
then intricately overlapped patterns. The second works up a genuine revival
of the grand romantic piano-and-orchestra confrontation without ever
sacrificing its 'modernist' orchestral manners. (The piano part, written for
Krystian Zimerman, was here superbly taken by Paul Crossley.) The third is
an exploration of a set of three- and four-note figures achieved with
Haydn-like rigour, energy and wit, a 'concerto for orchestra' symphony
exhilarating in its parts and in their sum. As, indeed, was the concert
itself - diverse in its individual parts, compact and compelling as a whole.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Arts: Drama at the Marlowe Society - Will the curtain fall
on this seedbed of theatrical talent?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL ARDITTI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAMBRIDGE'S Marlowe Society may have a low public profile, but in terms of
its philosophy and personnel it is arguably the single most important
influence on the British theatre in the past 50 years. Every play at
Stratford's Swan, every production by Peter Hall or Trevor Nunn, every
performance by Derek Jacobi or Ian McKellen, has the Marlowe and its
traditions at its heart.
And yet, like so many arts institutions, the society's future is under
threat; hence the current appeal for Pounds 300,000. This will enable it to
continue to employ professional directors, designers and other production
staff, as well as to provide a room in the Cambridge Arts Theatre, which it
can use for meetings, readings and other small-scale entertainments.
The Marlowe was founded in 1907 by Justin Brooke, of the tea dynasty, but
the leading light in its early years was his cousin, the poet Rupert. From
its origins in a failed exam and the wish to see set texts in performance,
the society was, and remains, an undergraduate one, drawing its members from
open auditions, but supplemented by professional actors, such as Peggy
Ashcroft and Michael Hordern, for its celebrated Shakespeare recordings, and
directors for its annual production at the Arts.
From the start, its achievements were profound. Its revivals of Marlowe,
Jonson, Webster and Tourneur were directly responsible for introducing their
work to the modern repertoire. With pioneering productions of Troilus and
Cressida, Timon of Athens and Titus Andronius, it also, in director Steven
Unwin's words, 'showed that there were other Shakespearian plays beside
Twelfth Night'.
Linked to this has been its focus on verse-speaking, in which, as Unwin
says, it opposed the dominant metropolitan culture, where classic plays were
produced with grand actors on grander sets. Sir Peter Hall, who was
introduced to the Marlowe's productions as a Cambridge schoolboy, sees its
verse-speaking tradition as fundamental, particularly today when 'no one
else is interested in it; drama schools don't bother with it, because most
of their students won't do Shakespeare', and he compares it with the Kings'
choral tradition. 'You can argue with it, but the standards are consistently
high.'
In its 85-year existence, the Marlowe has, in director John Barton's words,
produced 'a long roll call of honour'. Cecil Beaton acted and designed;
Michael Redgrave played Prince Hal and James Mason, Brutus; Richard Baker
and Noel Annan appeared in a 1947 White Devil. 'Later actors have ranged
from Michael Pennington and John Shrapnel to Tilda Swinton and Simon Russell
Beale.
But the society's greatest discovery has been its directors: from 1950s
figures such as John Barton, Peter Hall, David Jones, Robin Midgley, Toby
Robertson and Peter Wood, through Trevor Nunn, to more recent graduates like
Sam Mendes, Nicholas Hytner and Steven Unwin.
It is easy to see why the so-called Cambridge mafia is resented; and yet no
better seedbed for directors exists. Griff Rhys Jones, who directed
Bartholomew Fair and acted in The Jew of Malta dressed in a gold leotard and
virtually nothing else, attributes this wealth of talent to a sense of
freedom. 'I'm a great believer in the chaos theory of learning to do
theatre. When I was up, there was a picture of Peter Hall inscribed 'Thank
you for letting me make my mistakes'. That's what we all felt.'
Hall acknowledges that the influence of the Marlowe and particularly that of
Dadie Rylands, the Kings College don and Bloomsbury initiate who led the
society between 1929 and 1966, was crucial to his whole career. 'My
intention in founding the RSC was to adopt a particular way of approaching a
text. It wasn't much noticed at the time, but it came directly out of Dadie
and the Marlowe.'
His own appearances for the society included Tybalt in Romeo and Juliet,
when he fought a duel with John Barton's Mercutio, which he describes as
'the longest stage fight in history . . . John only went to hospital once,
with a split thumb due to my inaccuracy'. The production transferred to
London's Phoenix Theatre, where they played before Winston Churchill, and
for once, as Barton explains, the principles of textual fidelity were
abandoned. 'Churchill was sitting in the front row with a large first folio,
following it line by line. So we decided to improvise . . .'
John Barton, widely regarded as the most scholarly of our major directors,
sees in the society conditions analagous to those of Elizabethan theatre,
where actors discovered texts on their feet. 'If you give young actors
Shakespearian verse to learn in a fairly short rehearsal time without a lot
of psychological probing, they are going to hang on to the verse much more
than people who are trained naturalistically in today's drama schools with
their emphasis on TV.'
This raises the question of whether the Marlowe is a genuine training
ground, and should be encouraged as such, or an undergraduate society,
dependent solely on the enthusiasm of its members. Barton believes that 'the
proof is in the pudding' - and the pudding certainly contains plenty of
plums. For example, the cast of his own 1959 Henry IV included Ian McKellen,
Clive Swift, Corin Redgrave, Julian Curry, John Fortune, John Bird, Eleanor
Bron, and Derek Jacobi as Hal.
Jacobi attests to the merits of the training. 'For those of us intending to
go into the profession, it was the equivalent of a drama school. We learnt
things which in our enthusiasm to become actors we'd never considered: vocal
technique, wearing costume, attention to text. And unlike drama schools, we
always performed in public, which gave an edge to the work.'
And yet for every Marlovian who goes into the profession, there are half a
dozen who don't. Among the latter is the novelist Margaret Drabble, who
replies to the question 'what does the Marlowe offer people who don't go on
to be Ian McKellen?' that 'it's important for people who go to watch Ian
McKellen . . . It keeps Shakespeare and his contemporaries alive, in a
different way from other institutions by taking young people at the start of
their career and firing them with enthusiasm'.
Its appeal is two-fold. Its emphasis on textual rigour and revival of
classic texts should please the traditionalists while, in a age of
increasing vocational training, it epitomises the virtues of a liberal
education. In Hall's words, 'For those who don't go into the theatre, it
provides a chance to get inside the head of a genius. There are very few
better ways of spending a few weeks than putting on a Shakesperian play.'
And the experience feeds back into academia. Drabble describes how she 'got
a first with distinction when I spent every available moment in the theatre.
Playing Imogen for the Marlowe made me feel a serious person for the first
time.'
Nevertheless the Marlowe tradition is under threat. It is ironic that this
comes at a time when the opening of the Bankside Globe, where it is set to
perform, is poised to bring its work before a wider public. As Mendes says
of the appeal, 'It's like a closed shop; the man on the street won't know
what he's contributing to, but he gets the benefit - whether it's Derek
Jacobi on stage or Griff Rhys Jones on TV.'

ST VALENTINE had a poor showing on BBC radio. Radio 1 gave Stupid Cupid, an

Sunday Outing, for gays and lesbians, mostly in Blackpool. This is not the
place to discuss homosexuality; but I cannot believe that presenters Matthew
Parris and Beatrix Campbell would have been happy among the yelling and
screaming at Blackpool's Flamingo Club.
Saturday night's Radio 4 play, You Choose, written and directed by Jonathan
Myerson, was hard to credit but fair to hear. Zoe (Amanda Root), living with
Greg and about to have a baby and get married, in that order, meets Simon
(Nathaniel Parker), an old flame. He involves her in a plot to stop his
opulent father exporting toxic waste to poor African states. This is the
theme, incidental matters like random murder and spoilt marriage being
treated more casually. Simon is unlikeable, whatever his intentions; finally
we hear he has killed himself, while his father continues his evil
activities. Whose side are we on? Well, the play is called You Choose.
You could choose on Sunday too, between Sherlock Holmes on Radio 4 (Memoirs,
next week, Return) or Radio 5 (a new Unopened Casebook). John Taylor, Radio
5's writer, is not yet Conan Doyle; his tale of the doctor who faked his own
death was too simple to be exciting, even though some of it passed in a
funeral vault. But he has Simon Callow and Nicky Henson as Holmes and Watson
 -not quite the chaps we know, but just as plausible as Conan Doyle's pair
as anyone else.
Clive Merrison and Michael Williams are more familiar figures in the Radio 4
version, though The 'Gloria Scott' this week is an uncharacteristic tale,
with Holmes partly as an undergraduate. The Baker Street talk is more as we
know it in Vincent McInerney's version; and Watson has some of the keenness
that Doyle gave him but actors often omit, even if he got the coded letter
wrong. If you like a change, you can get six Unopened Casebook stories in a
BBC Publication paperback, besides hearing them on Radio 5.
In the World Service's series on South Asia there was a programme on the
Gurkhas that was one of the most exhilarating half-hours of radio I've heard
for ages. No battle-scenes, just talk - talk about routine Gurkha life, from
a young officer, a senior officer, Gurkha officers and NCOs, compiled by
presenter Nick Rankin. The Gurkhas' loyalty to the British, who fought
against them in the Gurkha wars, is one of the wonders of our time. They
also serve now in the Indian army. Those who sneer at colonialism and racial
discrimination could learn much from the story of the Gurkhas. Now we are to
reduce their strength to a mere 2500. The way we chuck our treasures away]
South African Snapshots on Radio 3 confirmed the belief aired in Christopher
Hope's programme last week that less censorship might give South African
writers trouble in choosing themes. Ellen Kuzwayo, writer of Call Me Woman,
spoke mainly of personal problems, with a feminist slant. Sipho Sepumla,
whose novel Rainbow Jamie deals with commercial success, had little faith in
the future; there would be more repression by the new government and no
tolerance for blacks. At least poet-biologist Douglas Livingstone was happy;
he would go on writing poetry about the multifarious life he leads.
In On the Ropes (Radio 4, Mondays), sympathetic John Humphrys interviews
folk with problems that have reached public climax. This week's victim was
David Mellor, but he has been well worked over by the press; next week's
George Walker, of Brent Walker, sounds more promising. After him - how
miscellaneous can you get? - comes Gilbert O'Sullivan.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Arts: Lloyd Webber buys Tissot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN RECENT weeks there have been queues around the Adelphi theatre in London
as punters rush to buy tickets for the next Lloyd Webber, his musical
interpretation of Sunset Boulevard, scheduled for the summer. The show seems
certain to open to box office takings well above Pounds 1m.
This is fortunate, because it seems likely that Sir Andrew has already spent
the money. At Christie's in New York on Thursday a painting by the French
19th century artist, Tissot, of his mistress Kathleen Newton, sold for
Dollars 2.97m (Pounds 2m).
'L'Orpheline', one of Tissot's largest canvases, depicts Newton dressed in
widow's black, with a young girl, the orphan of the title. It was a record
price for a Tissot, beating the Dollars 1.98m paid at Sotheby's 24 hours
earlier for 'The Woman of Fashion'. In 1879 Tissot sold 'L'Orpheline' in
London for Pounds 500.
The buyer this week was David Mason, of Macconnal Mason, the London dealer
who advises Sir Andrew. It is a typical Lloyd Webber picture. He has
extended his collection to take in 19th century ceramics and the odd Old
Master (he paid Pounds 10.12m last year for a Canaletto view of Whitehall,
now on loan to the Tate), but Victorian art remains his great love and he
has the finest private collection in the country.
He is also prepared to out-bid the competition. The estimate on this Tissot
was a modest Dollars 600-Dollars 800,000. Mason had also been busy on his
behalf on Wednesday, paying a record Dollars 800,000 for a work by Sir Frank
Dicksee. 'The Mirror' shows another beautiful woman admiring herself in a
hand mirror.
Almost single handedly Sir Andrew has enthused Victorian pictures, which
have been out of fashion in recent years. Christie's auction of 19th century
art raised Dollars 6.4m and was 91 per cent sold. The most macabre picture
on offer also found a buyer, for Dollars 444,000, a record for the artist,
Alexandre Cabanel. It shows Cleopatra coolly observing the deaths of her
slaves as she tries out various poisons before choosing the asp for her own
exit.
The revival in the American economy has enabled New York to lead the art
market out of recession. Victorian art, which is attractive to new
collectors, is the beneficiary of this regained confidence.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Arts: A them-versus-us motif in Berlin - Nigel Andrews
experiences everything from King Kong to Wittgenstein at the film festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERYTHING perked up with the arrival of King Kong. The natives were getting
restless, and so were the visitors, as the 43rd Berlin Film Festival
floundered through early days. Then came a 60th birthday screening of Kong,
preceded by the raising of a 20-foot effigy atop the festival theatre.
This woke us all up. Cheered by the sight of a chained ape gesticulating
from a cinema roof, we forgot the pain of that interminable Japanese film
about gay street life; of that hectoring Swedish short about feminist fairy
tales; of that fantasy-clotted Competition opener Arizona Dreams, made by
ex-Yugoslavian Emir Kusturica with a cast twinning Faye Dunaway with Jerry
Lewis. And we tried to forget the worst disappointment of all: the sight of
Jack Nicholson with putty-face make-up piloting through David Mamet's
putty-brained script for Hoffa.
This at least brought Danny DeVito to town as co-star and director. Small
and round, DeVito resembled one of those objects marked 'bomb' in
comic-strips. His tongue was the fuse, fizzing away at press conferences to
prove you cannot dampen a Hollywood trouper even when the world dislikes his
film.
If Hoffa was a dull fresco about the postwar American labour movement and
the disappearance of Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa in the 1970s - murdered,
surmises Mamet, by Washington in concert with the mafia - Spike Lee's
Malcolm X and Derek Jarman's Wittgenstein added to the Berlin bio-pic count
and the them-versus-us motif.
Lee's film attempts to combine crowd-pleasing storytelling with radical
politics and fails. (More when it opens in Britain.) Jarman, less
reverently, turns the life of the Viennese-born, Cambridge-naturalised
philosopher into a lantern slide lecture with intervals for wacky comedy.
These last feature, inter alios, Tilda Swinton whooping it up in feathers as
Lady Ottoline Morrell and John Quentin snapping out the Bloomsbury
one-liners as, yes, John Maynard Keynes.
Terry Eagleton's episodic script - should we call it Brechtian? - is clever
but low on dramatic voltage. It needs Jarman's fluidity of staging, turning
a black-backed soundstage into perpetuum mobile of foreground colour and
motion, to provide pace and warmth. This and Karl Johnson's performance as
Ludwig W: a sweet, despair-prone gibberer, in whom passion and pedantry live
like a permanently quarrelling married couple.
But a few bio-pics go a long way. The best two films at Berlin came hot from
the imagination's kiln, complete with colourfully glazed images. From China,
Xie Fei's The Lake Of Scented Souls is a domestic melodrama heated to
tragedy. A village businesswoman, whose sesame-oil factory is eyed by the
Japanese, finds career pressures compounded by emotional ones. Her retarded
son abuses his newly 'arranged' bride; and the mother's own marriage, which
she was sold into at 13, is now crashing on the rocks of a drunken husband
and a lover who is an increasingly ill-kept secret.
Soap opera it could have been. Real opera it almost becomes. The director
blends Visconti-ish verismo in the images - sunsets glow with pain, lakes
sparkle with a sickly, piercing silver - with an overpowering central
performance. Siquin Gaowa as the Madame Bovary of the marshlands, running
through all known emotions and the hell with Oriental inscrutability, should
get a Best Actress nod or there is no justice in juries.
If the Chinese film is verismo, Robert Rodriguez's El Mariachi from Mexico
is opera buffa. This gloriously eccentric action thriller cost Dollars 7,000
to make - one day's cigar money on most Hollywood films - and then burned
giant holes in the Latin American box office. It was promptly optioned by
Tinseltown for an upcoming Dollars 7m English-language remake.
The remake could not possibly equal the original, which resembles a Sergio
Leone Western made with mind-influencing narcotics. A zooming, carooming,
running, jumping, never-standing-still camera follows the hero and villain
around streets and deserts, unwittingly twinned by fate since they carry
identical black guitar-cases. (One contains a music instrument, the other an
arsenal of guns). A screen aflame with shoot-outs, punch-ups and comical
misunderstandings is set further ablaze by the filmmaker's wild ingenuities
of style.
Only one other Berlin film seriously warmed the imagination. Atom Egoyan's
Calendar will win no prizes (not in competition) and may win no British
release (65 minutes of unclassifiable semi-fiction). Yet the Canadian-based
director of The Adjuster here re-visits his ancestral roots in Armenia -
commissioned to take photos for a tourist calendar - and extemporises a
truth-based tale of marital break-up.
Main characters: himself (often a poignantly interrogative voice off
camera), his Armenian-born wife and the local guide who becomes her lover.
While a foreign sun shines on their bilingual imbroglios, flash-forwards
depict Egoyan back in Canada caught in the misery of serial dating. He tries
to snare new girlfriends while the now published calendar glows from his
wall, keeping alive old wounds. This beautifully cunning film about time,
space and emotional paradox is as intricate and many-angled as its own
heraldic leitmotif: the Byzantine churches that gaze timelessly, pitilessly,
majestically from the skylines.
Two other movies deserve nods in the fair-to-enjoyable category. Love Field,
directed by Jonathan Kaplan (The Accused), pushes Oscar-nominated Michelle
Pfeiffer into a black-and-white love story in glorious Technicolor. He's
black (Dennis Haysbert), she's white and they meet in the emotionally
colourful aftermath of JFK's assassination.
Idrissa Ouedraogo's Samba Traore, from Burkino Faso, is a sweetly acidic
village comedy from the maker of Yaaba and Tilai. Berliners complained that
the movie showed signs of Westernisation - good heavens, a robbery in scene
one and more action to come. But storytelling is no crime, and the same
critics were last heard complaining that Ouedraogo's previous films had no
plot. This one is wry, satiric and subtly humanist; and filmed in a burning
Bush that seems at once a godless wilderness and a crucible for godly
miracles.
Elsewhere Berlin has been an assault course of the unbelievable and/or
unendurable. While the Golden Bear scans the horizon for likely winners, a
series of Plastic Bears should be minted for such un-recyclable rubbish as
Japan's Heya, with its minimalist tale of a hitman who never hits; or
Germany's Lilies Of The Bank, proving like Schtonk] that there is no such
thing as German comedy; or Israel's Life According To Agfa. This last is a
sort of Iceman Cometh for the age of Palestinian-Israeli tension, its
one-bar setting squeezed for maximum melodrama by director Assi Dayan, son
of Moshe.
Why does Berlin import these turkeys? Perhaps because Cannes is just around
the corner in early May, offering higher kudos for superior products. Or
perhaps because Berlin is still seeking an identity, now that the fallen
Wall has robbed the event of its political dialectic.
Until 1990 this festival stood by the tennis net of Euro-politics, a
cultural umpire to the game of East versus West. Today the balls whizzing by
come from all quarters, in all shapes, sizes and colours. Hooray that the
Cold War spirit and structure have been swept aside. But Berlin badly needs
a new identity if it not to become merely Cannes the Prequel: situated too
close in time and too far in place, in a frozen North - and Kong is mantled
in snow as I speak - which few will prefer to the sunnier, more
movie-bountiful Cote d'Azur.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Books: Killer king of the Khmer Rouge - The secretive life
of communist despot Pol Pot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BROTHER NUMBER ONE: A POLITICAL BIOGRAPHY OF POL POT by David Chandler
Westview Press Pounds 16.95, 254 pages
AS A schoolboy, he played the violin and was moderately good at basketball
and soccer. As a teacher, he was liked by his pupils. He impressed them with
his gentle, musical style of speaking French. 'He was clearly drawn to
French literature in general and poetry in particular - Rimbaud, Verlaine,
de Vigny,' one of them recalled.
Later he seized power in Cambodia and presided over the deaths of more than
one million of his fellow citizens in one of the most brutal revolutions in
history; one in seven Cambodians died. Such is Pol Pot, the enigmatic Khmer
Rouge leader and former teacher, whose real name is Saloth Sar.
David Chandler is the most scholarly writer on present-day Cambodia, but two
years ago he ended his previous book (The Tragedy of Cambodian History) with
the baffling conclusion that the curtain had fallen on the careers of both
Pol Pot and Prince Sihanouk. 'The times transformed these heroes, without
their knowing it, into those left behind by the tragedy and therefore, in a
sense, into clowns,' he wrote. The wrongness of this earlier assertion makes
Chandler's new biography of Pol Pot all the more welcome.
Khmer Rouge guerrillas loyal to Pol Pot are making a mockery of the 1991
Paris peace accords signed by the main Cambodian factions (including the
Khmer Rouge). They are flouting the ceasefire, refusing United Nations
forces access to their territory and in some cases shooting at UN
helicopters. Khieu Samphan is nominally the Khmer Rouge leader, but the
64-year-old Pol Pot is still believed to be running the organisation from
his headquarters on the Thai border with a view to taking power again.
Prince Sihanouk, meanwhile, wants control of whatever government emerges
after the UN-sponsored elections in May, believing that he is best placed to
unite his country and reconcile the rival political factions.
A biography of the loquacious prince would have been much easier to write.
Pol Pot, a dedicated communist untouched by glasnost, has made a habit of
secrecy. He was identified as Saloth Sar by Cambodia-watchers only when he
made a state visit to China in 1977 - two years after the Khmer Rouge
takeover - and he casually admitted his real name only after being
overthrown by the Vietnamese invasion in 1979.
Yet it is the very scarcity of readily available information that makes it
fascinating to follow, with the sleuthing Chandler, the development of this
'sweet-tempered, equable child' into a man demonised the world over as the
overseer of Cambodia's killing fields. For the general reader, leafing
through Brother Number One is also a more palatable way of absorbing
Cambodia's complicated history than digesting Chandler's earlier and longer
historical work.
We glimpse - or think we glimpse - Saloth Sar, whose cousin was attached to
the royal ballet, hanging around the palace compound as a child in Phnom
Penh. We see him taught at French colonial schools and we watch him leave by
ship with the privileged few for further education in Paris.
In France he apparently joined the French communist party, and was certainly
caught up in the excitement of student politics and the post-war debate
about leftism. There was nothing very remarkable about that, or about his
poor academic performance. After returning to Cambodia and becoming a
teacher in the 1950s, he was apparently never questioned by the police. He
never spent a night in jail. Chandler (a former US diplomat) says the US
embassy had no biographical information on him, although it had files on
hundreds of suspected communists.
What was remarkable was Saloth Sar's will to power. In secret he worked his
way up through the ranks of the local, Vietnamese-sponsored communist
movement, and went into hiding in the bush in 1963. Twelve years later,
helped by the chaotic finale to the Vietnam war and the American withdrawal
from Indochina, Khmer Rouge guerrillas captured Phnom Penh and Pol Pot
emerged at the head of the Cambodian revolution. There followed the
notorious killings, the evacuation of the cities, the abolition of money,
the Stalinist purges and the growth of Pol Pot's antagonism towards his
former Vietnamese patrons, culminating in the Vietnamese invasion of 1978-79
and the return of the Khmer Rouge to guerrilla warfare.
The problems of constructing a biography out of such flimsy material - an
anecdote here, a leaked communist party document there - are obvious, and
Chandler, forced to speculate, is often reduced to such phrases as 'It is
easy to imagine . . .'
But Chandler is not one to leap lightly to conclusions, and he is the first
to confess that the question of what motivates Pol Pot, what drives him on,
has yet to be answered. 'Perhaps,' Chandler writes, 'as he sits at night in
his clearing in the forest, he has a faint perception (or a bleak,
horrifying vision) of the suffering he has inflicted. Perhaps he does not.'
Even a couple of hours of discussion with Pol Pot himself would have helped,
but Pol Pot has not been available for interviews. Until he is, this book is
likely to be the best and most comprehensive biography of him - and one of
the best introductions to Cambodia's tragic history - that we are going to
get.

PLACES OF THE MIND: THE LIFE AND WORK OF JAMES THOMSON ('BV') by Tom Leonard
Jonathan Cape Pounds 25, 407 pages
A MUSICAL concert, said the Victorian poet James Thomson, is 'two and a half
hours of paradise for a shilling'. It was the only kind of paradise Thomson
knew, for his life was singularly 'desolate and Fate-smitten'. It was also
the only kind he expected, because he was a militant atheist who wrote for
the secularist press. But it was not merely the immanence and transience of
paradise that haunted Thomson; his greatest poem, The City of Dreadful
Night, is a powerful description of the human condition as paradise's very
opposite: a 'termless hell'.
Tom Leonard's biography of Thomson is outstandingly good. It will surely
rescue the poet from his undeserved obscurity. It shows that Thomson was not
only a fine poet but a great essayist. His life was tragic; in the hands of
a lesser biographer it would easily make a romantic, even a Gothic, tale of
blighted genius.
But Leonard writes with restraint and exactness, letting the story tell
itself by interweaving sympathetic quotation and paraphrase of Thomson's
work with a superbly realised account of Victorian Britain in the period
between 1830 and 1880.
Thomson's tormented character is allowed to emerge under its own impulsions,
coming clearest into view just as its collapse into Faustian
self-destruction begins. Thomson was Scottish but lived in London from
infancy. Both his parents were religious enthusiasts, his father morbidly
so. At the age of eight, following his mother's death, he was admitted to
the Royal Caledonian Asylum in Islington. Upon leaving it he trained as an
Army teacher, living an itinerant military camp life instructing illiterate
soldiers and their offspring. After eight years he was 'discharged with
disgrace', having accumulated enough black marks for a minor court martial
offence to give the Army an excuse to sack him.
Thereafter Thomson lived chiefly in London. He worked in the City, at one
point travelling to Colorado to purchase silver mines for the company he
served. In his spare time he wrote for journals like Charles Bradlaugh's
atheistic National Reformer, contributing poems, translations from Heine and
Leopardi, and essays. Among these latter were brilliant satires on religion
and the corrupted literary tastes of Victorian England. His pseudonym was
'BV', standing for 'Bysshe Vanolis' in honour of Percy Bysshe Shelley and -
by way of anagram - the German poet Novalis.
Apart from a brief and unsuccessful stint as a war correspondent in Spain,
Thomson increasingly relied on literary journalism for a livelihood. It was
a precarious resource; journals were short lived, their editors unreliable
paymasters. For a time he was obliged to live by researching long propaganda
articles for a tobacco magazine.
In early adulthood Thomson had the Dante-like experience of falling in love
with an enchanting young girl who soon afterwards died. Her identity remains
a point of controversy, and Thomson probably never expressed his true
feelings to her. But the wound of the loss appears fresh in many of his
poems. His life thereafter, despite friendships and some literary success,
was a solitary and immensely painful one.
Such was its agony that Thomson at one point tried, by burning all his
manuscripts and letters, to destroy his past in order to salvage a future.
The task took him five hours. In the immediately following years he wrote
The City of Dreadful Night, an achievement described by Herman Melville as
'massive and mighty.'
The publication of this masterpiece brought Thomson celebrity. It was
admired by George Meredith, Rossetti and Swinburne among others. But the
publication in rapid succession of two volumes of poetry and a collection of
essays came too late. It could not save Thomson from the slide into poverty
and alcoholism which, in the obscure years leading up to the success of
these works, were the price he had paid for writing them - in particular,
for inhabiting the desperate city of which his poetry was the map. Within a
couple of years Thomson was dead, after a final scene of drunken insanity
and dissolution.
Leonard tells the tale with great skill. He does not indulge hypotheses
about Thomson's feelings and motives; he lets the poet speak for himself,
setting his words against a meticulously researched description of Victorian
Britain's wars of religion and the literary and free-thinking alleys of Grub
Street.
This is the kind of biography Francis Steegmuller and others have perfected:
the documentary life, the 'Jackdaw' folder which presents the reader with
material on which to base his own judgment. Yet it makes a gripping story,
and a harrowing one, which shows the cost that the productions of the mind
exact, and how much human agony goes into their making.

NET OF JEWELS by Ellen Gilchrist Faber Pounds 14.99, 360 pages
THE BLINDFOLD by Siri Hustvedt Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 8.99, 221 pages
SUN DIAL STREET by Marti Leimbach Picador Pounds 8.99, 276 pages
RHODA MANNING, the heroine of Ellen Gilchrist's Net of Jewels, is an
impossible young woman. Coming of age in a rich Alabama family in the 1950s,
she is as highly strung as a poodle on Dexedrine, driving her parents,
classmates and lovers to distraction as she seeks to find a place for
herself in the make-believe world of the pre-Civil Rights South.
Everything she does - college, sex, marriage, childbirth - becomes a crisis.
She causes the death of a suitor in a drunken car accident, abandons her
children when they become inconvenient, ingests drugs and alcohol in
fruitless attempts to stay thin and happy, and even undergoes an unnecessary
abortion after an adulterous love affair. For all the storm and strife she
brings to her life, however, her six-year stumble toward womanhood lands her
right back where she started - being provided for in her father's antebellum
mansion.
Gilchrist's novel is a realistic and urbane evocation of that breed of
southern woman often encountered in Tennessee Williams plays. High strung,
pretentious, passionate, painfully self-conscious, Rhoda is like a hothouse
flower that wilts the moment the lights are taken off it. It is a
fascinating character study, delivered with considerable skill and
precision. But the problem with the book is the problem with impossible
women - their manic charm eventually becomes cloying, forcing you to search
out more convivial company.
You sure won't find it in The Blindfold, another story of an emotionally
fraught young woman. Siri Hustvedt's heroine, the anagrammatic Iris, arrives
in New York City with little more than her fragile psyche as she prepares to
study English at Columbia University.
She soon finds herself involved with all manner of weird souls, including a
recluse who hires her to recreate the life of a murder victim on audio tape,
a photographer who takes a strangely provocative picture of her, as well as
the fellow patients in the hospital where Iris is treated for migraines. She
also manages to find the time to engage in a few unsatisfactory love affairs
and, most distressingly, a bizarre relationship with an art critic named
Paris who likes to wear pink suits as he peers into Iris's troubled soul.
Told in a series of episodic, loosely connected chapters, The Blindfold is a
prolonged study in angst and enervation that is hard to read for more than
few pages at a time. This is not to say that it lacks striking moments,
particularly the long, crazed night that ends with Iris grabbing a cop's gun
in a strip bar just to see what will happen. But with little humour or plot,
mood becomes everything, and the mood here is decidedly bleak. It is the
sort of book that should appeal primarily to writing students and people
with monochromatically black wardrobes.
The narrator of Marti Leimbach's Sun Dial Street is not a nervous young
woman, though you feel the book might have been better if he had been. Sam
Haskell is a strangely naive manager of rock bands who travels to LA to
visit the mother and sister he has not seen in four years. Mom has changed
her name and is still a manic depressive, but his sister Ginny is now a
striking young woman. Sam quickly starts playing the protective and slightly
obsessive older brother, especially when it comes to Ginny's relationship
with a seedy club owner, who also happens to be a former lover of Sam's new
girlfriend.
What follows is the stuff of TV movies - a rapid progression of murder,
star-crossed love affairs, irate husbands and illegitimate children. By
making her narrator a man, Leimbach has robbed the slim story of the
emotional power that might have saved it. Sam's voice only rarely rings
true, and his musings about the inner lives of the other characters are
downright annoying. The result is a book that reads like a hasty and
ill-conceived novelisation of a melodramatic film.

THE LEAR DIARIES by Brian Cox Methuen Pounds 15.99, 211 pages
SHAKESPEARE'S PROFESSIONAL CAREER by Peter Thomson Cambridge Pounds 24.95,
215 pages
THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR edited by Jay L. Halio The New Cambridge
Shakespeare Pounds 24.95 (paperback Pounds 4.25), 313 pages
BRIAN COX played Lear in Deborah Warner's production of the tragedy for the
Royal National Theatre in 1990. He doubled it with the part of Buckingham in
Richard Eyre's production of Richard III, Richard being played by Ian
McKellen. There were times on tour when Cox would have to do one role at a
matinee and another in the evening. But he had enough voice left at the end
of most days to dictate into a tape-recorder his thoughts and feelings about
what had been happening to him.
The result - The Lear Diaries - is a spontaneous, highly articulate account
of what it is really like to be a leading man in a national company with the
responsibility of one of the great roles in the repertory bearing down upon
your weary shoulders each evening. We learn not just how the role takes over
your emotional life but also the inroads it makes into your private and
family lives; there were existing difficulties that were exacerbated by a
protracted tour abroad. Throughout a year the National company took both
plays to Madrid, Paris, Hamburg, Leipzig, Dresden, Cork, Tokyo, Cairo in
addition to touring the UK. Cox does full justice to the pains of one-week
stands and official hospitality, thankfully recording a final stop in his
native Scotland.
Above all Cox gives us fascinating insights into the mechanics of
performance. He discusses the pros and cons of having to speak some of
Lear's lines from a wheelchair which was part of the conception, and the
effect upon the whole company's morale of the different venues, audiences
and auditoria. Relations with other members of the company were crucial,
particularly those with his colleagues taking the parts of his daughters and
the Fool. Cox's comments reveal a mutual supportiveness that is miles away
from the picture of chilling hauteur on the part of the star playing Lear in
Ronald Harwood's play The Dresser.
Mind you, there is plenty of griping as well, and a constant complaint at
the way the lesser role Cox was playing in Richard III undermined
concentration on the major one. It was only when they reached Eastern Europe
that he began to see the real point of Eyre's setting of that play in a
1930s fascist mode. The fall of Ceausescu and of Margaret Thatcher provided
unexpectedly relevant topical contexts.
What would an historian of the theatre like Peter Thomson, the professor of
drama at Exeter University and author of Shakespeare's Professional Career,
give to get his hands on a diary of this sort kept by a member of
Shakespeare's company? On, say, Burbage's uninhibited Cox-like comments on
the rehearsal methods of those in charge in 'this wooden O'? Did Shakespeare
and his fellow-actors have anyone comparable to a modern director? The
answers to such questions have to be inferred from fragmentary allusions in
contemporary documents and surviving play-texts. Just how much has now been
reconstructed by a huge army of Shakespeare scholars we gather from
Thomson's book. He gives a most interesting, compact account of
Shakespeare's conditions of work. Thomson sees Shakespeare as a great
accommodator - someone who was always prepared to adapt his genius to
whatever or whoever was available.
A striking illustration comes in the use he made of the comic talent in his
company. Thomson leans here on David Wiles's study Shakespeare's Clown
(1987), and points to the contrast between the parts Shakespeare wrote for
his two great funny men - William Kempe and Robert Armin. Kempe, famous in
his own right for his celebrated dance from London to Norwich, was the
earthy, bawdy, gutsy comedian playing up to the groundlings for laughs in
roles like Gobbo and Dogberry, and bringing down the house with his jig. He
left the company in 1599 at the time of the move to the Globe, an
environment where, it is suggested, his skills might not have been so
greatly welcomed.
Kempe was replaced by the more melancholic, musically gifted player, Robert
Armin. Thomson thinks Touchstone may have been re-written to accommodate
him, and that a role like that of the Fool in Lear was part of Shakespeare's
intuitive response to Armin, Clown turning into Fool. It is a tempting
theory. As for the play itself and its mad King, Thomson sees it as
predicating the transition from the old feudal role of kingship under the
Tudors to the more modern one of the newly crowned James I under whose
banner Shakespeare and his colleagues were working. They now became known as
the King's Men.
Lear was a play about which Shakespeare appears to have had second thoughts
after it had been staged. There are many significant differences between the
text as printed in the quarto and the folio editions, so much so that the
Oxford editors, Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor, in their William Shakespeare:
The Complete Works (1986), printed the play twice, giving both texts in
full. Jay L. Holio, professor of English at Delaware, in his New Cambridge
Shakespeare edition, does not go as far as that. He sticks to the Folio text
where the gains are, to my mind, greater than the losses, but he does give
the chief variations in the notes, which are a model of clarity throughout.
Quotations from Q and F are printed in facsimile so that one may compare the
variant texts in the form in which they first appeared.
The New Cambridge Shakespeare, which 10 years ago set about replacing the
old Dover Wilson edition, and of which Lear is the latest volume to appear,
is now about half way through the canon. It is for my money the best
single-volume edition to have to hand for general use. It started off in
light blue Cambridge livery, but in the late 1980s apostatised to dark blue
Oxford dress with a trendy David Hockney Shakespeare 'portrait' replacing
the earlier C. Walter Hodges design. To anyone who has been collecting the
volumes over the years in the hope of one day possessing the complete set,
this mid-term marketing initiative has given an unfortunate boat-race
appearance to the books on the shelves. Nonetheless one is very glad to have
them.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Motoring: Citroen's Xantia sets standard for its rivals -
This BX replacement is a high-class act
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MONDEO is more than just the car expected to power Ford's recovery; it
is the benchmark against which many of the 1993 models will be judged. This
thought kept occurring as I tried three examples of Citroen's new Xantia
range in Spain last week.
Just as the Mondeo goes beyond being a mere Sierra replacement, the Xantia
steps up half a class in succeeding the BX. It goes on sale in France early
next month, will be available in left-hand drive markets soon afterwards and
reaches Britain with right-hand steering in June.
To begin with, there will be a choice of three petrol engines - 1.8-litre,
103 horsepower; two-litre, 123 horsepower; and a 16-valve two-litre
developing 155 horsepower. Diesels, naturally aspirated and turbo-charged,
follow rapidly and will be on sale in Britain well before the
L-registrations start in August. So will a 1.6-litre, petrol-engined entry
model.
The Xantia is as crucial to Citroen in Britain as the Mondeo is to Ford,
although for different reasons. Ford believes the Mondeo will restore its
fortunes and rebuild market share.
Citroen, meanwhile, seemingly cannot put a foot wrong in the UK. Last month,
it took more than 6 per cent of the new car market, overhauling Nissan,
Renault and Volkswagen-Audi. It also grabbed almost 18 per cent of a record
29,540 diesel car registrations.
Ten years ago, the BX was the car that started to change Citroen's image -
and build its sales - in Britain. Before the BX, Citroens were bought mainly
by enthusiasts loyal to the marque.
They had to be; the only sensible price they could get at trade-in time was
from a Citroen dealer - against a new Citroen, naturally.
The BX changed all that. Although idiosyncratic in styling and suspension (a
self-levelling system using high-pressure gas instead of steel springs), it
was not quirky. People who had never contemplated owning a Citroen bought a
BX and liked it. Soon, it became a mainstream motor car.
Its owners are natural buyers of the Xantia, although the new car might
appeal also to drivers of Sierras, Cavaliers, Nissan Primeras, Peugeot 405s
and Renault 21s looking for a change.
The Xantia is a typical new-generation Citroen. Its wheelbase of 108.3in
(271cm) is the longest in its class; its lean though rounded styling is
distinctive; and it has the unique gas/hydraulic suspension. Inside, there
is plenty of room for four full-sized people to stretch out.
Rear-seat head and leg room is better than the Mondeo's although boot
capacity is the same. The seats, yielding and well-shaped, and the interior
appointments generally are closer to those of the big XM than the BX.
Most of my driving in the 1.8-litre Xantia was on well-surfaced and almost
deserted motorways. It was as comfortable and refined as one expects a car
of the Xantia's class to be.
At what most business motorists consider a normal cruising speed of 80-85
mph (128-136 kmh), I was aware of the engine spinning at 4,000 rpm-plus,
perhaps because wind and road noise were negligible. In a motorway downpour,
the air-flow kept the back window completely clear and dry.
The two-litre Xantia felt a little more urgent. Lower profile tyres
sharpened its steering response, but ride comfort and road noise were
affected less than they were on the Mondeo equivalent.
Citroen's gas/hydraulic suspension was evolved 40 years ago to give
motorists an armchair ride on rough surfaces, and there is still nothing
like it for comfort on a neglected D-road.
Spain's highways have been transformed in recent years, but there are plenty
of fast, uncrowded and ill-maintained minor roads. On their patched and wavy
tarmac and acute bends, the Xantia rode serenely.
Best of all was the 16-valve model. This had XM-style Hydractive II
suspension, which adapts automatically to road surface and driving
technique. Even at silly cornering speeds, it prevented body roll.
The squat - though not at all noisy or hard-riding - Michelin 55 series
tyres, and a small degree of rear wheel steering (like the smaller ZX
model's), combined to make it feel exceptional nimble and safe.
Equipment levels for the UK market have not been decided, nor has the price.
Experience suggests it will cost no more - and probably slightly less - than
its class rivals.
All Xantias have power-assisted steering with a height-adjustable wheel,
remote-controlled central locking and crash protection bars in the doors.
Anti-lock brakes are extra on the cheaper models.
Airbags (which General Motors announced this week had been made standard on
the Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Vectra, just pipping the Mondeo at the post) will
not be available until 1994. By that time, an estate car probably will have
been added to the Xantia range.
If the BX is anything to go by, up to 30 per cent of Xantia buyers will
chose diesels, especially turbo-diesels, which will have the 1.9-litre
engine now used in the ZX. There appears to be enough under-bonnet space for
the Xantia to take the 12-valve, 2.1-litre turbo-diesel used in the Citroen
XM.
A highly-specified 2.1td Xantia with automatic transmission, ABS brakes and
air-conditioning is a thought for Citroen to toy with for the mid-1990s.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Property: Estate agents - if they didn't laugh, they'd cry /
The collapse of the residential market has led to hard times for even the
biggest players
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDI BEVAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASK A residential estate agent how business in the UK has been in the last
two years and you are likely to hear manic laughter.
'It has been the most bloody awful time,' says Roland Cullum, with sardonic
humour. Cullum is a partner of Cluttons, a medium-sized agent with a classy
reputation, and admits freely that the going has been gruelling. A healthy
estate agency business depends on brisk turnover and a percentage of the
sale price - the higher, the better. 'There have been damn-all transactions
and static or falling prices,' he says. It has also been much harder work.
'Sometimes, you have to show a house 30 times before you make a sale.'
The story is the same all over the UK, even in Scotland, which has been hit
least badly in the property recession. 'None of the major chains are
profitable at the moment. We are coping with volumes down by 50 per cent and
much lower prices,' says Peter Rowntree, the managing director of the
260-branch Legal &amp; General Property Services.
Reactions to the common problems of low sales and prices, exacerbated by
rising office rents, include closing branches, cutting overheads,
franchising, and moving into the popular rental market.
Last year, Cluttons decided to pull out of the London market, selling its
well-known Chelsea office to Robin Patterson, a former Barnard Marcus
executive, and allowing him to use the name Cluttons London Residential
Agency. Ann Sturgis, at Kensington-based Malvern's, has been taking on
lower-priced properties which some of the larger firms considered too
time-consuming. She has also stepped up her letting business to make up for
low sales.
Legal &amp; General, having closed 76 offices in the past two years, has
experimented with franchising. The group has around 40 franchise branches
operating under one of its local trade names. 'Franchising seems to be
working because an individual with commitment can turn an unprofitable
branch round, whereas a manager won't put in that effort,' says Rowntree.
These are particular solutions to the national problem of over-capacity at a
time of tumbling volumes and rising rents. At the peak of the property boom
in 1988, the magazine Estate Agency News estimated that there were more than
16,000 estate agency offices owned by about 11,000 firms. There are now
thought to be well under 12,000 offices owned by 6,500 firms, with many
one-man bands having gone out of business or been taken over.
Almost half of all estate agency branches are now owned by the big
institutions - building societies, banks and insurance companies - who waded
into the market during the 1980s, often paying what have proved to be
exorbitant prices. The idea was to use the retail network of estate agents
to market other financial services - mainly mortgages and insurance - to the
house-buyer.
By late 1989, it had become clear that the numbers did not stack up. The
Prudential was one of the first to get out, sending shock waves through the
market by shutting or selling more than 500 branches during 1990 after
announcing losses of Pounds 49m. Most of the other large institutions have
followed suit including Royal Life, which has dropped 243 branches to 517,
and GA Property Services, losing 233 to 390 since 1990. Even assuming the
housing market recovers in the next two years, there is still considerable
over-capacity - estimates vary from 20 to 30 per cent - and all but a
handful of existing offices are running at a loss.
David Perkins, an estate agent turned independent consultant, sees three
clear trends emerging. First, he believes that UK insurance companies and
middle-ranking building societies have no appetite for estate agencies and
may be bracing themselves to get out entirely. Second, the big building
societies, even those which have done well such as Hambro Countrywide and
the Halifax, are no longer expanding.
But the most interesting development, which could signal the bottom of the
market, is that former managers and estate agency entrepreneurs are taking
advantage of low prices to re-enter the sector through management buy-outs,
buy-ins, or franchising.
Not all of these are getting it right. A salutory example is the firm of
Franklin Fox, which bought 51 offices from Northern Rock building society
six months ago and which, because of a shortage of financing, has only a
handful left.
Others hope to do better. After 30 years in the business Tony Snarey,
formerly at William H. Brown - which was taken over by Royal Insurance  -
has bought the right to use the Humberts name and is to open six branches in
the north-east of England this spring. 'I believe that the estate agents
which will do well are those with good local knowledge and an individual
manager who is known and respected.'
Patterson also claims to be making money. 'We have turned the business
round,' he says. 'We have changed the name and culture and, from a loss of
Pounds 250,000, we are now well in profit.' Recently, too, a national
newspaper featured the tale of married couple Donald and May Storrie, who
sold their 32 offices to Nationwide for Pounds 15m in 1988 but became so
bored that they have now started again with one branch.
Despite the over-capacity in the market, new businesses have one big
advantage: the cost of entry has dropped greatly. To buy a branch from an
established chain can now cost only half what it did at the peak, while it
is possible to negotiate keen rental rates from scratch.
The recession has taught everyone the importance of good financial
housekeeping. Upmarket London agent John D. Wood, which recently revealed
losses of Pounds 77,000 in the six months to October 31 compared with Pounds
194,000 for the first half of 1991, still has eight offices in London and
six in the country, although staff numbers have been trimmed.
Cost controls have been paramount. 'One alteration is that we now pass on to
our clients the high cost of advertising and glossy brochures,' says George
Pope, the joint chairman. At Legal &amp; General, Rowntree instigated strict
cost controls in all branches, as has Knight Frank &amp; Rutley.
According to Perkins, agents' fees have risen because of the recession but
most prefer to talk of it in terms of holding firm or passing on costs.
'When the market was very active, our fees were negotiable. Now they are
not,' says Rowntree. Bill Yates, senior partner of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley,
agrees. 'It is easier to get good commission rates now. The rate-cutting
from the institutional firms has stopped.'
And there are signs that things may be improving. John D. Wood reported a
threefold increase in viewings during January compared with November,
although this has yet to come through in sales. Patterson believes that the
number of transactions have risen by 15 per cent in the past two months, and
all agree that there is more interest from potential buyers.
That might be scant consolation in a market which is staggering along on
little more than 1m transactions a year compared with 2m in 1988, but it
does offer hope.
As if life were not tough enough for the battered agent, there is one other
challenge coming along in April when a new law will insist that
advertisements and agents' particulars will be actionable if not totally
accurate. In future, 'Des. res. only 5 mins from Tube' will have to mean
exactly that.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Gardening: Impatient japonicas turn winter into spring -
They're at the forefront of a year when Nature has divided itself into slow
and fast lanes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE AGAIN, the world is running on fast-forward. Almonds are supposed to
flower in March and narcissi ought to wait until spring. You might expect a
snowdrop but it is much too early to be encountering primroses. They are
out, nonetheless, because the year is anticipating spring in winter. I have
just seen a sugar-pink prunus called Okame, smothered with light clouds of
pink flower, in Oxford's botanic garden. Magnolias are about to break into
bud; and against climb-proof paint on railings in London, you can already
see some wisps of yellow Forsythia.
In this accelerated year, there are slow and fast lanes. I think I can see
why. Anything which has to emerge from main roots in the soil is slower to
join the stampede. The ground is still cold, not least after so much wet.
Misleading signals are rather fainter, although there are dark flowers on my
forget-me-nots and on pulmonarias which ought to have waited until April.
Higher up, the story is different, as if mild weather reaches the framework
of buds on a shrub more directly than the roots below a dormant border
plant. Early cherries have leapt from their starting blocks and the winter
honeysuckles have been spectacular. It is all quite mad but, within a week
of Valentine's day, I have just seen flowering quinces (known popularly as
japonicas). They are two months early and well into their show of flowers.
Japonicas have all the sensible virtues: they are completely hardy and
indestructible, even by non-gardeners in the middle of London, and they are
not just plants for difficult walls.
The family falls into two groups, with various colours and a longer season
than most of the catalogues describe. One group is tall, gangling and best
pinned against the wall. In the wild, it grows in central China, but
Japanese gardens have always favoured it and perhaps it once had wild
connections there, too. The botanical name in lists is Chaenomeles speciosa,
but gardeners have developed named varieties, of which three are
characteristic.
Nivalis is the best snow-white for training up a dark wall, even a north
wall. Moerloosii is particularly charming because its flowers look like pink
and white apple blossom and appear slightly later in the summer. It was bred
in Belgium in the 1850s, but it still looks enchanting against a dark
background and it grows quite well when facing east or north if it has
enough light. I have an even softer spot for Phylis Moore, a rather leggy
japonica which flowers in a charming shade of salmon pink. This one is
particularly good against a wall where sunlight brings out the charm of its
colouring.
These Chinese japonicas are great fun to train and prune. From their early
days, they can be fanned out like fingers on a hand and clipped into shape
late in May after flowering: if necessary, clip off any long shoots which
grow forward throughout the season. The stems develop a fairly straight line
if they are fanned in this way, and the flowers are visible on an open
arrangement.
Nothing is ever entirely tidy, and I am being over-tidy by leaving out a
good, bushy relation. Known as Simonii, it must commemorate somebody's Simon
somewhere, but its habit is quite distinctive. It is low-growing and spreads
into an arching bush which is excellent on a sunny bank or in a mass as a
japonica thicket. Simonii does not grow more than 3ft high but the flowers
are a lovely shade of dark red, semi-double and held flat against the
spreading branches.
On the other side of the family, we have garden hybrids known as superba.
They all arise from crossing a wild Japanese and a wild Chinese variety.
Both of their parents grow wild on the slopes of cold mountains; thus, they
are well up to life on the Celtic fringe, even without thermal underwear.
Until recently, I used to believe that the reds were best and that Rowallane
was the best variety of all, especially on a low bank where it spreads to a
width and height of 4ft. I now realise that there is a very fine white
called Jet Trail which is good in the same situation and greatly neglected
by people who like thickets of white flowers before the roses begin.
This year, there will even be a greenish-yellow variety. In 1989, Notcutts
of Woodbridge, Suffolk, developed stocks of a sudden accident which appeared
in a customer's garden. It was named Lemon and Lime and, when I saw it last
year, I thought it had possibilities.
Like Simonii, these superba varieties are excellent shrubs for a low tangle,
a thicket on a bank beside a drive, or as a broad group beside a flight of
bold steps. I defy you to kill them and I also believe that they will grow
in fairly dry summers: the late Russell Page sometimes used big blocks of
them in gardens in southern France which he described to me as very dry.
Gardeners who think of this family only on a wall are missing their best
use. Japonicas will knit together and make a low plantation which excludes
weeds.
Most of the varieties throw off suckers which you can simply cut off with a
spade and replant. Otherwise, all of them will root very easily if you take
the low branches and fix them down on to bare earth so that they make a root
system of their own. Then, you simply cut off these layers and move them to
another place.
The next three or four weeks are the right time to begin this simple
multiplication: with their exceptional goodwill, japonicas are flowering
early in order to remind us to make the most of them.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Property: A fillip for foreigners - A leasehold loophole
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN, Property correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN BUYERS stand to profit from the new Housing and Urban Development
Bill which, when it receives royal assent in summer, will allow many
leaseholders of flats to buy out the freehold.
Many foreign buyers have never fully understood the leasehold concept and,
however much they love London, are reluctant to invest in British 'wasting
assets.' They are buying properties in the UK with some zest already, while
prices are low and the pound devalued. It would not be a surprise to see
them looking soon at those properties that are enfranchiseable or have been
enfranchised, which could even lead to a small rise in prices.
If that happens, though, it will mean little to them compared with the bonus
of added buying power resulting from the collapse of sterling. Prices of
long leases with a few years left should go up. The sudden chance of
enfranchisement gives them the chance of extra value which some vendors will
try to capture for themselves - to the chagrin of the estates - by
enfranchising or starting the process before selling on.
It should also be easier to get mortgages to buy them. At present,
leaseholds with less than 60 or 65 years do not seem to offer the lender
enough security. A freehold is another matter. Yolande Barnes, at Savills,
says the result will be that the estates, to protect their interests, will
stop granting new and shorter (21- to 65-year) leases. Below 21 years the
lessee has no claim; over 65, he might see no reason to enter the
enfranchisement battle.
The uncertainty of the picture, while leaseholders decide if it is worth the
effort to battle potential opposition from the estates, and the estates
re-think their strategy, could be another signal to buyers to start their
moves - but, perhaps, only if they have a contrarian view of markets.
From now on, when you do start looking, check the property thoroughly
against the new rules. If your aim is to buy a flat to enfranchise it, you
must ask early on about the other occupants. How do their leases stand? What
sort of people are they? Will there be the necessary two-thirds majorities?
Will you all get on running the building? Overlook this sort of information
and you could be in trouble.
The agents have well cared-for, attractive properties on the market but you
will not spot them when you walk down the street as billboards are
forbidden. Among whole houses, a typical selection in Belgravia and Chelsea
includes 20 Thurloe Place, SW7 (Knight Frank &amp; Rutley: 63 years to go,
Pounds 400 ground rent with reviews, guide price Pounds 785,000); and 68
Chester Square, SW1 (KFR or WA Ellis, 75 years, Pounds 2,000 with reviews,
guide price Pounds 1.475m).
Far cheaper at Pounds 485,000 are 24 Montpelier Street, SW7 (KFR, 65 years,
Pounds 100 fixed), and 8 Graham Terrace, SW1 (Savills or Friend &amp; Flacke, 52
years, Pounds 750 with reviews). Flats include 26 Cadogan Court, SW3
(Winkworth or Strutt &amp; Parker, 82 years, Pounds 100 fixed, Pounds 650,000);
and 53 Cadogan Square, SW1 (Foxtons or Francis Russell, 30 years, Pounds

FT  20 FEB 93 / Records: Whistling a happy tune - Richard Fairman rounds up
the musicals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS ten years since Leonard Bernstein went into the studio to make a
modern recording of his 1950s hit, West Side Story. The success of that
project started a trend which is still in full swing today. A stream of
other revivals has followed, some going for glitz with all-star casts,
others archive-worthy recordings using all the tools of musical scholarship.
The question is - what makes a musical deserve immortality?
The King and I is one that has never fallen from favour, which is presumably
because it has two crucial ingredients. The story still feels up-to-date, as
it manages to combine both sexual and racial issues, and the score has a
wealth of good songs. Philips's new recording of the show, following on
other Rodgers and Hammerstein favourites given the 1980s treatment, offers
75 minutes' worth of music, which makes it a good deal longer than the
famous old soundtrack with Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner (though not the 1977
Broadway revival album).
Completeness, however, is only half the story. Like most of the new
recordings of the last decade, this one has never been near a stage. At all
those moments when the music should make the listener want to get up and
dance, John Mauceri and his orchestra have their noses in the score, making
sure textures are nicely balanced, rhythms neat, speeds judicious. There is
just not enough showbiz excitement around.
Admittedly, it cannot be easy to remake The King and I without the King.
(Yul Brynner, star of the show from day one, played the part more than 2000
times.) Ben Kingsley would seem a good choice for the role, but in practice
he is tame, lacking the 'controlled ferocity' that Richard Rodgers so
admired when he saw Brynner in audition. The supporting cast includes Lea
Salonga and Peabo Bryson, the latter sounding quite adrift, as the young
lovers who 'kiss in the shadows'. Marilyn Horne makes a guest appearance for
Lady Thiang's big solo. Roger Moore and Martin Sheen, no less, turn up in
bit parts.
The outward impression is of a constellation of celebrities. But, in the
end, there is only one star in it. Julie Andrews had never appeared in The
King and I before this recording, but if ever an actress and a role seemed
destined for each other, it is Miss Andrews and the fair-minded,
well-educated British Governess, always ready to 'whistle a happy tune'. The
voice is still delightful; every word is made to count. For her, at least,
the disc rates high as a comeback album.
Brigadoon is mere escapist fantasy. The interplay between the sexes is pure
1940s romance; and if the clash of cultures experienced by two brash young
Americans stumbling upon a mythical village in the Scottish highlands was
meant to have any political relevance, that has long since faded into the
background. What is left is a gentle love-story cloaked in the mist of
Scottish legend, set to a sentimental score in the most typical Lerner and
Loewe style.
This new EMI recording is also a studio production and by rights should also
have turned out untheatrically flat. Instead, it is a delight from start to
finish. As Tommy and Jeff approach the spot where the village of Brigadoon
is about to materialise for its single day of the century, a choir of voices
is heard in the distance. A haze comes over the sound and the Brigadoon
magic starts to work. Just enough of the dialogue is spoken to allow the
listener to follow the story and the result is a recording which captures
both the letter and the spirit of the musical.
Again, there is more of the score than usual. Neither the original Broadway
cast excerpts (recorded on six 78s) nor the film soundtrack in its current
CD incarnation goes much beyond the half dozen favourite numbers. This
recording includes extra dance material and background music, all woven
carefully together. It has a lovely Fiona in Rebecca Luker and a dreamily
romantic Charlie from John Mark Ainsley, while Brent Barrett's Tommy,
fresh-voiced and eager, is the match of any that has gone before, Gene Kelly
included. Only the Scottish accents give pause for thought: not many of
these would dare to be heard North of Watford.
There is not much social comment to be found in Lady, be good] either. This
was the first success of the George and Ira Gershwin partnership, dating
from 1924, before the brothers were so ambitious as to take on shows like
Let 'em eat cake - topical, satirical musicals, with a message. The term
'musical comedy' might have been invented for Lady, be good], since the book
amounts to little more than a peg of a comic sketch, on which a selection of
typically stylish Gershwin songs are hung.
The original Broadway cast included Fred and Adele Astaire, Ukelele Ike and
a popular piano duo. All needed - and were given - solo opportunities. The
clutch of songs includes, as well as the title song, the duets 'So am I' and
'Hang on to me' and, most famously, 'Fascinating rhythm'. As stars joined or
left the show, other musical numbers came and went. In trying to put
together authentic recordings this Gershwin series has been working
overtime. Lady, be good], which never existed as a single score, poses more
questions than can be answered; but the present CD includes all the major
numbers associated with the show either in the original orchestrations or
new ones as close in style as possible. The show may not add up to more than
a series of party turns - but those are certainly winners.
Scrooge began life not as a musical, but as a film. Instead, a theatrical
version, using the same book and music by Leslie Bricusse but with extra
songs, was playing at Birmingham's Alexandra Theatre. A recording of that
production has since appeared and it is vividly headed by Anthony Newley as
Scrooge, who manages to tread a subtle line between deep-seated misanthropy
and just-pretend grouchiness. The music follows in the traditional line of
British musicals - homely stuff, given a helping hand to lodge in the memory
by the inclusion of a few well-known carols. Jon Pertwee and Stratford Johns
also join in the performance, which has plenty of seasonal energy.
Nine is a Broadway hit from 1982 that never reached London on stage. Like so
many 1980s musicals, it aspired to break new ground. Ostensibly the plot
concerns an Italian film director, who sees himself as 'Christ, Mohammed and
Buddha' rolled into one. Early on, however, the show evolves into a montage
of past and present, reality and hopes, as the director searches for himself
in his latest project (Fellini's 8 1/2 casts long shadows). There is a lot
of artistic naval-studying, accompanied by not very memorable music. But
this recording was taken immediately after a concert performance at the
Royal Festival Hall last year and it catches Jonathan Pryce as the
over-sexed Guido, Ann Crumb and Elaine Page, all at white heat. If only the
revival recordings could muster half its elan.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Records: Potted jazz portraits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PIANIST Stan Tracey OBE got his gong in 1986, but a major record deal has
been longer in coming. His music, learnt with the top big bands of the 1950s
and shaped by a long stint as Ronnie Scott's house pianist in the 1960s, is
a ubiquitous part of the UK club scene. In Portraits Plus, a debut for the
Blue Note label (0777 7 80696 2 1), Tracey takes his regular Octet on a tour
of his favourite influences - Ellington, Monk, Rollins and Gil Evans.
'Clinkscales', which could almost be an onomatopoeic description of his
technique, contains all the characteristic components of Tracey (Mrs
Clinkscales was apparently Duke Ellington's piano teacher). Brisk chorus
swapping between saxophones - Peter King's alto features here - trombone and
trumpet is underpinned by Tracey's idiosyncratic accompaniment and son
Clark's clattering drum fills. Tracey's exuberant arrangement and original
writing fits the Blue Note label perfectly and thanks are due to the Arts
Council whose funds helped put him there.
I wonder if Tracey ever accompanied US altoist Jackie McLean during his time
at Ronnie's? McLean ran with the likes of wayward young Miles Davis and
Charlie Parker in the 1950s and lived to tell the tale. Rhythm of the Earth
(Birdology 513916-2), a disc full of original compositions, shows his
caustic lines and leadership qualities to be undimmed. After a wobbly start
with an overlong title track, McLean's young septet (which features Roy
Hargrove on trumpet and Steve Nelson on vibes - the others are students of
McLean's) digs into characteristically giddy conversation between horns and
rhthym section. The writing, shared by pianist Alan Jay Palmer, is tart and
to the point.
New writing and recording is traditionally outnumbered on the jazz shelves
by re-issues from that golden period of 40 years ago and the firm
establishment of the CD coupled with the onset of DCC and Minidisc will only
maintain the trend. Art Blakey, the electrifying drum force behind the
seething sound of the Messengers, left a huge recorded legacy perfect for
compilation and re-issue. Blue Note's three disc The History of Art Blakey
and The Jazz Messengers (CDP 7 97190 2) is a potted but nevertheless vital
addition which traces the Messengers' make-up through the 40 years from
1947. No small group could swing like a Blakey band, the drummer's
irresistable pulse and cross rhythms drove his distinguished soloists on
(trumpeter Lee Morgan replaced Kenny Dorham, then came Freddie Hubbard and
later Wynton Marsalis): the man's contagious enthusiasm fired new writers
(Horace Silver, Bobby Timmons and Wayne Shorter, most notably).
If it is easy to have a favourite Blakey period, it is less easy to define
Lady Day's most appealing years. Verve's 10 disc box lays bare Billie
Holiday's last years, 1945-59. It is widely held that the slender but strong
voice of the 1930s was the singer's finest and that by the 1950s, only an
emotional cripple could derive any pleasure from her ravaged tone. But this
collection, first released as a limited edition with encyclopaedic notes and
graphics and now available at Pounds 75 in a slightly less luxurious package
(The Complete Billie Holiday on Verve; 517658-2), shows Billie in good and
bad shape, in conversation and in the company of her favourite musicians. It
is a revealing, musically rewarding snapshot of one of jazz music's most
enduring characters.
Those of you with a more limited budget, attention span and emotional
resource could do worse than to try the late Dinah Washington's For those in
love (Emarcy 514073-2), a 'special price' disc from a 1955 session which has
the vocalist riding easily alongside a relaxed octet directed by Quincy
Jones.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Records: Lords of two 'Rings'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE MAY no longer be quite the sense of pioneering achievement in
completing a recorded Ring there was in the heyday of the LP a quarter
century ago, but such events still remain noteworthy. Bernard Haitink's
cycle for EMI and James Levine's for Deutsche Grammophon have joined the
versions by Furtwangler, Solti, Bohm, Boulez, Karajan, Janowski and Goodall
(sung in English) already available on CD and there are more to come: Decca
is planning another with Dohnanyi, based upon concert performances in
Cleveland, while Barenboim's Bayreuth performances in the current Kupfer
production will doubtless appear on disc and video before too long.
Although the choice is already wide, the second halves of the two new Rings
undoubtedly offer a number of first-rate performances, even if they hardly
ever threaten the long-lost Golden Age of Wagner interpretation. They have
serious shortcomings but contain much to admire. That both conductors have
explored the cycle in the opera house while engaged on the recordings,
Haitink at Covent Garden and Levine at the Met, would have been a matter of
course a generation ago; now, with the seemingly unstoppable hegemony of the
recording industry, it becomes a definite, promotable asset.
The strength and good musical sense of the conductors are the most stable
characteristics of all four sets. To generalise dangerously, Haitink's
approach is the more naturally expressive, the fiercer and less compromising
in his approach to texture and pacing; Levine is the more affectionate, more
inclined to go after the lyricism and to highlight it when found. On
average, too, Haitink's pacing seems tighter; the differences may be often
small but the overall effect is considerable. There is always a sense of the
performance leading somewhere with him, of the drama propelling the musical
argument rather than, as sometimes with Levine, being held back by it.
Even in such a relatively straightforward showpiece as Siegfried's Funeral
March from Gotterdammerung Haitink's sense of momentum and unfussy sculpting
gives the music a sense of power and lowering grandeur that becomes just
empty rhetoric with Levine. And at the opposite end of the scale it is
Haitink who invests the chamber textures surrounding some of Siegfried's
quieter reflections with luminous detail; his orchestra, the Bavarian Radio,
is consistently well ahead of Levine's own Metropolitan Opera band in its
refinement and idiomatic phrasing.
Were selecting a Ring just a question of the conductor, then, Haitink's
versions would edge ahead of those of his rival. But singers complicate
matters, and in this case make them anything but clear. In EMI's roster the
men outpoint their female colleagues by a fair margin; for DG the balance is
reversed. In the second half of the cycle at least the presence of James
Morris in both casts is less intrusive; for both conductors his Wanderer in
Siegfried is the familiar mixture of suave good manners and serene
detachment, putting not a note out of place but never engaging with the
material either. He seems one-dimensional alongside Siegfried Jerusalem's
attractive Siegfried for Haitink, better matched to Reiner Goldberg's
performance for Levine.
Jerusalem's intelligent singing is one of the EMI sets' real vocal
strengths; the timbre may not be sufficiently heroic for some, and certainly
it is effortful in the top register, but he comes into his own in
Gotterdammerung with some beautifully sustained quiet singing and a response
to the text that is always far sharper than Goldberg's stolid, four-square
declamation. Jerusalem's exchanges with Peter Haage's Mime in Siegfried are
much livelier than in the equivalent passages for DG, where Heinz Zednik is
unconvincing; when combined with Thomas Hampson's Gunther and John
Tomlinson's Hagen in Gotterdammerung the performance attains a very high
level indeed. Hampson's flexible and lithe singing is unconventional yet
works wonderfully; Tomlinson's baleful performance is terrifying and
genuinely disturbing, where Matti Salminen's Hagen for Levine offers woolly
power and little more.
After that, though, with Haitink the doubts set in. Among the women Marjana
Lipovsek makes an efficient Waltraute, without ever revealing the intensity
she manages elsewhere; Eva-Maria Bundschuhe is an unexceptional Gutrune;
Anne Sofie von Otter is predictably outstanding as the second Norn. In the
equivalent roles for Levine Hanna Schwarz brings much dramatic interest to
Waltraute, and Cheryl Studer is vocally much more alluring than Bundschuhe.
His Woodbird is Kathleen Battle, Haitink's is Dame Kiri; chacun a son gout.
But when it comes to the Brunnhildes personal taste hardly enters into it.
Eva Marton for Haitink hardly utters a phrase in either opera that falls
gently or gratefully on the ear; everything is forced and the tone quality
consistently harsh, with precious little singing below a generous forte. It
turns the final scenes of both operas into tests of endurance. While
Hildegard Behrens is not the most naturally powerful of singers and
sometimes lapses into an alarming vibrato, she does at least produce some
moments of genuine beauty for Levine and never has to resort to
high-pressure bawling. There is an emotional breadth to Behrens'
performance, genuine light and shade, which quite eludes Marton.
For those for whom any Ring cycle stands or falls by the quality of its
Brunnhilde Haitink's will inevitable seem fatally flawed. That is an
enormous pity for there is much to admire for anyone willing to withstand
the intermittent aural assaults. The rewards of Levine are real but less
compulsive; there is nothing to offend or to thrill, just solid workmanship
pervading all aspects of the performances.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Records: Rock back to the '70s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHIL HARDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STYLE gurus tell us the 1970s are back in fashion. But what version of
the 1970s? As the albums below demonstrate, there were more 1970s than we
tend to remember.
Consider Blockbuster] The Sensational 70s (Castle CTVCD 209). This double CD
celebrates a (mostly) platform heeled glitter splattered British pop version
of the decade from the likes of The Sweet (Blockbuster), Mud (Tiger Feet),
David Essex (Gonna Make You A Star) and T Rex (Hot Love). If the very titles
makes you salivate and you wish you hadn't thrown away those loon pants,
then this is the 1970s for you - but not, whatever the style gurus say, for
your children.
Or consider Bill Clinton's 1970s, neatly represented by Fleetwood Mac. The
group not only provided the President with his campaign song, Don't Stop,
Thinking About Tomorrow, but reformed for his inauguration. Witchy,
decidedly bitchy and yet somehow bland, The Chain (Warner Bros 9362-45188-2)
is a four-CD boxed set that neatly captures the group's American heyday with
a mix of bluesy ballads romantic farragoes. Interestingly, the set
oscillates between being a collectors item and a coffee table package. It
has a big booklet, but rather than matrix numbers and biography, this one
consists of lots of photos and handwritten scrawls. Taken together the pair
of albums bookend the decade.
For a cleaner sounding, even more romantic and yet bluesier Fleetwood Mac,
try Albatross (Columbia CD 31569), a budget-priced version of the group's
final days in Britain, which includes most of the classic tracks of the
period.
At the time, Bonnie Raitt's 1975 outing Home Plate (Warner Bros
7599-27292-2) seemed less impassioned than her earlier, commercially
unsuccessful, albums. Listening to it with her recent Capitol mega hits in
mind it seems a natural progression and a good example of her ability to
find virtue in unlikely songs (What Do You Want The Boy To Do?). Equally
revelatory is Ace's Mel &amp; Tim collection, Starting All Over Again (CDSXE
078). They only had a pair of hits, but they represent a wonderful laid back
version of Southern Soul.
More forward looking is Sequel's imaginative The Old School Rap collection
(NXT CD 217), a double CD of Sugar Hill tracks that lays bare the genesis of
rap from Grandmaster Flash and Melle Mel onwards. Far More problematic is
Pete Townshend's Who Came First (Ryko RCD 10246). A hymn to Townshend's
guru, Meher Baba, it remains essentially a private album.
Far more unsettling and powerful is Television's 1977 debut album, Marquee
Moon (Elektra 75559-60616) in which youthful passion and angst are combined
in equal measure. The title track, which signals an end to the essentially
private concerns of the decade almost as forcefully as the Sex Pistols,
remains as powerful as ever.
But the album of the moment must be James Booker: Bunco Partner (Hannibal
1359). This was actually recorded in 1976, but it comes from another time.
Booker offers a surreal melange of classical (Chopin), folk (Ledbetter) and
popular song (On the Sunny Side Of The Street) held together by a firm New
Orleans backbeat. The result is simple, unadulterated pleasure: the sound of
one man caressing the keyboard in private.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Records: Poetry in motion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE WE have become accustomed to the sanitised perfection that the CD
offers, we often long for something a little more human. Poets who record
their own work on cassette often give us just that kind of experience:
something raw, rough-edged, and all too painfully human. This often tells us
more about them and the impulses that have driven them to shape their poems
than any number of purer renderings by a professional actor.
One thing that such a reading immediately tells us is where a poet has come
from geographically, and how the way he hears and speaks his own variety of
native English has shaped his attitudes towards poetry as an art.
Simon Armitage, one of the most lively young poets writing now, was born
near Huddersfield and the sound of his language when spoken - a certain
brutish dourness, a raw honesty in the almost aggressive lack of musicality
in the voice - match perfectly his often chilling narratives. In Zoom and
new poems, he takes a knowing sideways glance at the Northern drugs scene;
in 'Snow Job', a punchily idiomatic and amoral tale, some drinkers argue in
a pub over who should take the most credit for having recognised the car
stuck in the snow, its dead driver slumped against the steering wheel, the
word 'Volvo' printed backwards in his frozen brow.
The language of Armitage's poems is as far removed as it is possible to be
from 'poetic diction'. Idiomatic, breezily colloquial, they sound like
anecdotes overheard in the pub. There are no classical references strewn
about; the heroes belong to our own times: Johnny Weissmuller, for example,
who, Tarzan apart, once held the world record for holding his breath under
water.
Sujata Bhatt was born in India, though she now lives in the West, and the
creative tensions that surface in her reading of Selected Poems testify to
an inner conflict between the claims her childhood language, Gujerati, and
the learned language of her adulthood, English. Bhatt reads her poems
slowly; and the poems themselves are often intense meditations upon the loss
of one's tongue. Such a loss, which she likens in 'Search for my tongue' to
a lizard slipping away, has incalculable consequences: the need to think a
different reality. Bhatt reads with a measured desolation, inching her way
forward, as if her own tongue might trip her up at any moment.
The University of Keele has recently embarked upon a mammoth project to make
available all the extant recordings of the great American modernist poet,
William Carlos Williams. The complete set of 15 cassettes costs Pounds 100,
but those with a more modest interest in the project could start with a
sampler of a single cassette entitled The People and the Stones.
Carlos Williams, one of the great pioneers of modernism, a contemporary of
Eliot and Pound, reads 20 of his best-known poems from all the major phases
of his career in the hectoring populist tone of the barnstorming preacher.
Between the poems we get snatches of interviews, warts and all (car horns
honk; a dog barks) in which Williams proselytizes to the enthusiastic
chuckles of his audiences. The poet resembles that inconspicuous flower, the
saxifrage, he tells us. It may look frail - but, my God, it can break a rock
in half]
Another excellent cassette in the Keele series is a sampler from the
complete recordings of the Scots poet Hugh Macdiarmid, the centenary of
whose birth was celebrated last year. Macdiarmid's greatest poems - the
short lyrics of the 1920s and the much longer meditation upon the destiny of
Scotland and her language, A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle - are often
maddeningly difficult to get to grips with because of the sheer number of
obscure and, to the English, seemingly unpronounceable words. Macdiarmid
helpfully complements this reading of his own Scots originals with glosses
in English. The verbal music alone is quite extraordinary.
Zoom and new poems by Simon Armitage and Selected Poems by Sujata Bhatt:
Pounds 5.95 each, available from The Poetry Business, 51 Byam Arcade,
Westgate, Huddersfield HD1 1ND; The People and the Stones (Pounds 6.50) by
William Carlos Williams and The Scotland of Hugh Macdiarmid (Pounds 5) are
available from Dr Richard Swigg, Department of English, Keele University,
Keele, Staffordshire ST5 5BG, England.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Travel: At Angkor Wat, the heady whiff of danger lingers on
 -Nicholas Woodsworth accompanies two heads of state on a watchful visit to
Cambodia's crowning glory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

LIKE MANY of the people who fly into the little town of Siem Riep on United
Nations' military transport planes these days, I was not strictly on
business. Perhaps half the UN personnel in the aeroplane hold into which I
had climbed at Phnom Penh were in uniform. The others  - soldiers, electoral
officials, policemen, Foreign Legionnaires, interpreters, journalists,
secretaries - were dressed as brightly and indiscriminately as sightseers
anywhere. Given half a chance to visit one of the world's great attractions
for free, the tourist that hides in us all comes bounding out. We were all
taking a little time off to see that architectural wonder, the ruins of
Angkor Wat.
Cut-rate tourism in Cambodia does carry its risks. The night I flew into
Siem Riep, several small groups of Khmer Rouge guerrillas made their way
into town from the thick surrounding forests and began shooting. From the
Grand Hotel, tourists were treated to the spectacle of tracer bullets flying
through the dark from several directions. During the attack, the Khmer Rouge
looted houses and shops and stole a dozen valuable statues from the
warehouse of Angkor Conservation, the body responsable for preserving the
ruins. Three people were killed and about 20 wounded.
No one believed the action had any strategic object. In the smouldering
conflict between Cambodia's four armed political factions, such incidents
occur almost daily. Far more likely, however, was a symbolic value attached
to the operation. Angkor Wat lies at the very heart of Cambodia's collective
consciousness. In an age of social upheaval and chaos, it is material proof
of Khmer civilisation, of a sophisticated, cohesive and artistic people who
created architectural marvels 1,000 years ago. Far more than a tourist site,
it is the one unifying national symbol on which everyone agrees. As Prince
Norodom Sihanouk - head of Cambodia's royal family and the country's
strongest link with the past - has acknowledged, whoever holds Angkor holds
Cambodia.
The Khmer Rouge might not be strong enough to launch a full-scale offensive
against government positions around Siem Riep. But, in mounting such a raid
three days before the arrival at Angkor Wat of that most distinguished of
French tourists, President Francois Mitterrand, they were showing they could
strike anywhere and at any time with impunity.
Forty years ago, travel writer Norman Lewis noted that French colonial
tourists and dignitaries visiting Angkor Wat - the centre-piece of any trip
to French Indochina - felt a certain frisson of pleasure in being
accompanied on their sight-seeing jaunts from the Grand Hotel by armed
guards. They found that a slight whiff of danger and banditry added
immeasurably to the exotic cachet of travel in foreign parts.
The days of luxury travel are over and the Grand Hotel no longer lays on
armed guards. None the less that whiff, somewhat sharpened now, continues to
add a certain thrill when you visit the ruins.
Cambodia's long string of wars and civil disturbances over the past two
decades have had one positive, unintended effect: they have saved Angkor Wat
from gross commercialisation. Had the country been at peace, there would now
be as many souvenir shops and tourist bus-stands sprawled around Angkor as
there are around the pyramids at Giza, the Moghul tombs of Agra, or the
Mayan ruins of the Yucatan. The few visitors that do come to Angkor today
are swallowed up by these vast ruins spread over many miles; on an ordinary
day, you can tramp about for hours without seeing a soul.
Angkor's 100 or so temple sites are in themselves exquisite: complex, finely
detailed, geometric expressions of man's need to place himself firmly and
eternally at the centre of the universe. What makes them more than simply
exquisite, and gives them their ability to inspire mystery and supernatural
awe, is their hard juxtaposition to nature in its rawest and most
undisciplined form.
The impression made by 11,000 bas-relief figures - as you find on the stone
walls of the temple known as the Bayon - is heightened many times over by
the fact that they sit lost in the middle of a tangled, tropical jungle. The
world inside the temples is one of precision, order and the endless
repetition of a limited number of Hindu and Buddhist themes. The world
outside is one of abandon and natural disorder where no two objects - leaf
or vine or slithering insect - resemble each other exactly. It is this
contrast which makes Angkor's magic.
Too much magic can overwhelm the simple soul. After two days of visiting one
mausoleum, pyramid, temple, tower, terrace, pool and funerary complex after
another, I began to feel a deep angst slipping over me. If the monumental
efforts of eastern despots to find immortality - here translated into
millions of man-hours of painstaking labour - now lay in ruin with origins
forgotten and purpose ignored, what was the point of my own paltry efforts?
What was the point of anything at all? I began looking once again at the
temporal and impermanent, and found it just as interesting.
On the day of my arrival, I rented a small motorcycle and began puttering
about the roads linking one far-flung temple complex to another. Life rolled
along in its slow, Cambodian country way. Girls in bright clothing and straw
hats rode by on ancient bicycles. Old men sat by stone-carved friezes in the
forlorn hope of selling coconuts to visitors. Government soldiers at
Angkor's two dozen road-side military posts dozed over their rifles in the
noon-time heat.
On the second day, things picked up abruptly. On the three-mile road leading
from Siem Riep to Angkor Wat, flags and banners were set out in profusion.
The bases of roadside trees were given fresh daubings of white lime. At the
newly renovated Terrace of the Elephants in the dead city of Angkor Thom,
archeologists of the Ecole Francaise d'Extreme Orient hoisted a shiny new
sign proclaiming their work. UN graders smoothed over pot-holed roads.
Experts checked the undersides of bridges and spires of temple gates in case
of mines. There could only be one reason for such a hubbub. Accompanied by
Sihanouk, Mitterrand - the first foreign head of state to visit Cambodia in
23 years - was on his way.
The following morning, four hours before the president was due at the ruins,
I went out to see the sun rise at one of the loveliest of Angkor's temples.
Ta Prohm sits in an isolated spot deep in the forest. Despite its distance
from town, it is one of the most popular of all sites. Left unrestored,
purposely, its slow invasion by the jungle exceeds even our most romantic
image of what a lost civilisation should look like.
I did not, however, see the sun come up over the misty green jungle and grey
stones of Ta Prohm. Two hundred yards from the temple gate, I was stopped by
a lengthy exchange of automatic gunfire that was far too close for comfort.
A minute later, two Cambodian soldiers popped out of the woods onto the road
clutching Kalashnikovs and calling in reinforcements over their
walkie-talkies. 'Pol Pot] Pol Pot]' they shouted, pointing into the woods
and waving me back down the road. I turned my motor-bike around and buzzed
away. Where the Khmer Rouge is concerned, you take little time to heed
warnings.
A few hours later, though, no one would have imagined there was a single
Khmer Rouge villain within 100 miles of Ta Prohm. The entire area was
patrolled by 300 French soldiers. I sat by the temple gate in the company of
half a dozen heavily armed Legionnaires with blue berets on their shaven
heads and bright, tricolour flashes on their shoulders. Armoured personnel
carriers lay concealed in the woods. Military helicopters droned through the
sky. Camouflaged sharp-shooters waited calmly beside trees and on the tops
of temple walls.
Five minutes before his arrival, Mitterrand's communications team arrived
and set up a mobile satellite dish by the roadside. A few seconds later, the
president's personal security men roared up in a white UN jeep.
Only the tell-tale wires behind their ears identified them as such;
otherwise, they looked like fashion-conscious gangsters. They wore dark
glasses, pale lavender or rose shirts, flower-patterned braces, and had
snub-nosed .38s shoved into the waistbands of their trousers. They were
sweaty, covered in dust, and seemed to be enjoying themselves. A Legion
captain blew a whistle. 'Trois minutes, les gars]' he shouted. 'Dans le
vert]' (Into the bush). The sharp-shooters melted invisibly into the
background.
Preceeded by white-uniformed policemen on white motor-cycles, the
president's cavalcade pulled up at the temple gates in a cloud of dust. In
the famous floppy hat he wears on all warm-weather pilgrimages, Mitterrand
stepped from one side of a vehicle flying the French flag, Sihanouk from the
other. He looked happier than the prince as they made their way about the
ruins. Mitterrand chatted casually with straw-hatted Roland Dumas, his
foreign minister, as they examined friezes and dancing temple girls carved
on stone. 'Magnifique] Magnifique]' they murmured to each other.
Sihanouk, looking grim, followed. Not even a return to the source of Khmer
greatness could hide his own frailty and ill-health. Dabbing a hankerchief
to his mouth occasionally, and supported under both elbows, he was led about
by dead-eyed North Korean bodyguards who made the temple carvings look
animated. It was all over inside 15 minutes; as a piece of tourism, it was
something less than spectacular. But Angkor's strange civilisation had once
again served its eternal symbolic purpose. As a security operation and
public relations exercise in an area risky enough to have delighted even
Frederick Forsyth's Jackal, it was, quite simply, magnifique.
As satisfied as the Legionnaires who emerged from the bush to quaff cold
drinks, I hopped on my bike and followed the cavalcade back down the dusty
road towards our own strange civilisation.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Travel Focus: Tripe soup and Colombus, too - Sebastian Hope
treads in the explorer's footsteps as he discovers the Dominican Republic /
Cruising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SEBASTIAN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT USED to be said that on the day the Colombus lighthouse was finished,
President Balaguer would fall - which goes to show that prophesy in the
Dominican Republic is as reliable as the electricity.
Colombus Day last year - October 15 - came and went. So did the pope, who
turned on the beacon and declared the lighthouse open officially. It was the
climax of the celebrations for the 500th anniversary of the discovery of the
Americas. Everyone was more surprised that the lighthouse's lasers, visible
from space, left the capital's fuses intact than to find the blind Balaguer
still in power next day.
The lighthouse is a lump of reinforced concrete in the shape of a cross. It
houses the 'remains' of Colombus and a museum of colonial history, since it
also commemorates the start of evangelisation of the new world.
Turning my back on the lighthouse, I headed for the 3,175 metres of Pico
Duarte, the highest mountain in the Caribbean. It stands in the Armando
Bermudez national park, which contains Hispaniola's last extensiive forest.
The drive to La Cienega, the northern gateway to the park, showed what
happened to the rest.
Every accessible acre was covered with crops and breeds of livestock that
thrive in the mountain air. It was a pretty enough rural scene, but the dry
gulches opening up in old stream beds showed the underlying fragility of
this arrangement with nature. I had fallen in with some young Americans in
Manabao, where we engaged a guide and his mules. Juan met us at dawn at the
park HQ, and we set off across a rope bridge on the three-day walk to the
mountain's top and back. Beyond the river we plunged into forest, palms and
hardwoods giving way to open pine woodland as we toiled upwards. It seemed
that to climb the highest mountain, we also had to climb the second highest.
It took five hours to reach the shoulder, and another hour to the base camp
hut.
We woke before dawn, shivering on dustbin bags filled with pine needles.
Outside, there was a frost on the ground, and golden light was beginning to
spread across the peaks. Lone trees poked through the mist in the valleys.
The summit, not unusually, was a slight disappointment. There is no tree
line and so no feeling of having climbed to a higher, clearer plain. There
is even a bust of Duarte, father of the republic, at the very top. In his
line of vision, a column of smoke rose from the forest. By the following
day, it had become a curtain.
The air in the cane cutters' barracks of Magdelena was thick with magic. The
moon had not yet risen. I had been brought here to see a holy week festival
peculiar to the cane villages. The dancers had red cloths tucked into their
waistbands and baseball caps covered in curls of red ribbon. They blew
whistles and twirled silver batons. The only sign that this was an Easter
occasion was a placard of Jesus, with bleeding heart, on a pole trimmed with
more red ribbon.
The noise, and the violence of the dancing, was unnerving. When I produced a
camera, hands came from everywhere, open for money: hard, cane-cutters'
hands.
We knocked at a door. Presently, the Haitian obeah woman, very black,
appeared, asked for money in a cracked voice, and sent out for rum and
cigarettes. Her altar was a magpie's nest: a bell, a long dagger, pictures
of the Virgin Mary, St George slaying the dragon.
Her actions seemed furious. She slapped some bent playing cards together and
banged them one at a time onto the altar. She said she told fortunes and
sold lottery numbers for a share of the winnings. We were sent away with
potions which looked like shampoo labelled 'luck' and 'life' and 'love'.
Sabana de la Mar comes alive only when a ferry is due. Most tourists pass
through en route to the secluded beaches of the Samana peninsula, on the
country's northern coast. At other times the jetty is dead, and the bay is
left to the pelicans and the fishermen who wade its margins.
It was the nearby Los Haitises national park that had drawn me. Its caves
once were inhabited by the Ciguayo Indians and the shell middens in them
looked fresh. The walls held carvings of long faces. There were drawings of
birds, fish and figures in sharp black lines, the art of an imagination and
way of life long extinct.
After this, Santo Domingo's Zona Colonial, the first city of the Americas,
came to symbolise only past injustices for me when I returned to it. The
first fort, cathedral, university, monastery and courtroom - all built in
the early 16th century - appeared to me as the machinery of genocide. It
made me more comfortable to know that Drake sacked the place in 1586.
Beyond the walls of the old city, there is a low-rise sprawl: apocalyptic,
engaging, even charming - a circus of traders with their goods on their
heads, a supermarket on the move, the streets filled with vehicles. I found
sanctuary at La Llanera Famosa, a bar two streets away from the nightly
gauntlet of prostitutes on Avenida Duarte. It was an oasis of light in the
frequent blackouts, a generator purring outside. Here, I was introduced to
local tastes in food and music, the former including pigs' trotters, beef
shins and conch. I discovered that there is nothing more sustaining at 4 am
than tripe soup.
On my last night, Heracelis, the waitress, arranged for a wandering merengue
band to come and play for me. Three men appeared with accordion, drum and
scraper: instruments of European, African and Indian origin. The plaintive
vocals told of luck, life and love. Heracelis grabbed my arm. Dancing to the
impossibly up-tempo rhythms, everything started to make a little more sense.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Travel Focus: For billionaires who do not own a yacht -
Catherine Stott cruises round the Baltic on Sea Goddess I, a ship on which
even the extremely rich can relax / Cruising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE STOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS nice of Cunard to recreate the life style of a billionaire's private
yacht party; to package it so beautifully for 100-plus guests; and to make
the price so utterly inclusive that money itself is never seen on board.
Cunard has two ocean-going, yacht-style cruisers, Sea Goddess I and II,
which rove the world year-round and, with a draft of only 14ft, insinuate
their sleek prows into the most secret harbours, exclusive marinas and
usually unnavigable rivers.
I joined the Sea Goddess I at high summer in the Baltic and even the
foreplay was exquisite: a uniformed chauffeur at the airport, bowing and
handing me a long-stemmed rose before speeding through Copenhagen in a
limousine to where the Krug of cruise ships, 320ft of pure white, rested
seductively at the quayside.
Fleets of Mercedes disgorged well-heeled travellers. Matching six-packs of
Vuitton and Hartmann baggage were hoisted aboard. Nancy Reagan lookalikes -
size 4 social x-rays - clutched monogrammed jewel cases. Queuing to board,
Charles Beckwith, deeply tanned from one of his Caribbean homes, viewed the
Scandinavian drizzle with distaste and growled that what he was spending on
the cruise could have paid for another Jaguar.
He clutched an alligator briefcase close to his chest. His wise-cracking
wife of 40 years said: 'Charlie keeps his most precious things in there. His
krugerrands and his hair-dryer.'
Piped aboard, we were pressed to accept a crystal goblet of champagne, and
our first scoop of caviar, in a flower-filled lobby where good Oriental rugs
floated on a marble floor. This was the time to evaluate the other guests.
Sea Goddess I, it appeared, is very much a yacht for couples, of whichever
persuasion. There are 58 double cabins. Even the ultra-spoilt professed
themselves impressed by the accommodation, which is designed cleverly. Each
cabin has a picture window, and a long wall of blonde wooden units
concealing enough closet space even for those who like to change five times
a day. There is a safe big enough for your gold bars and a refrigerator
inside a private bar which is replenished constantly.
Everyone was much friendlier than on other cruise ships. Perhaps the rich
are truly relaxed only with other rich people - and with prices starting at
Pounds 3,740 apiece for a week's summer cruise in Europe, it is an
assumption they can, rightly, make about each other. Everyone said they were
'in' something - 'in' medicine', 'in' movies'. One ancient Pennsylvania
billionaire said he was 'in' coffins.
Friendships formed quickly. People would bag you in advance for drinks and
dinner. Otherwise, there was an open seating policy where you filled up the
tables as you arrived. The restaurant was pretty and you could dine at any
time between 8pm and 10pm. Since the officers and crew are Norwegian, the
cuisine tends towards the Scandinavian. The majority of guests were
American, but with a selection of Europeans. Ages ranged from 14 to 80 but
most people were in their 40s and 50s.
The difference between the Sea Goddesses and almost every other cruise ship
is the deliberate lack of entertainment; indeed, there is very little
structured activity on board. I suppose Cunard thinks that if you are smart
enough to have made the kind of money you need for a Sea Goddess cruise, you
probably have your own ideas on how to spend an evening. There is dancing,
however, a little gaming room, and a decent library of books and movies.
Rather unusually, the ships tend to stay in port until midnight so that
guests may dine ashore without hurry. Other, cheaper vessels sail at
sundown, knowing that if their passengers have paid for dinner on board,
they will not wish to pay for another one.
On the Baltic cruise, the American guests were less than impressed by the
first two ports of call. 'No shopping - very frustrating,' said a Floridian
fashion plate as we landed by tender at a speck in the Baltic named
Christiansoe, nothing but a 100-acre rock where raucous guillemots and
razor-billed auks outnumbered the hardy fisher-folk 100 to 1. Nor did they
rave over Bornholm, Denmark's permissive holiday isle, where they complained
that all there was to do was watch a million herrings drying like socks on a
line.
Most did not go ashore in teeming rain in Gdansk and Tallin where we
Europeans paddled about cheerfully marvelling at the medieval architecture;
the tall, gabled houses with brightly tiled roofs; and the radial, cobbled
streets.
The mood lightened on reaching Helsinki, that great white northern city of
the sea, with the architectural set-piece of Senate Square at the centre of
a perfect, 19th-century town plan. The Americans were looking forward, they
said, to buying fur coats and fine china. No one had told them that Helsinki
is one of the world's 10 costliest cities. They bought nothing.
Our long and dismal entry into St Petersburg was accompanied by a humorous
commentary from the Norwegian captain (if that is not a contradiction). On
the first of our two days there, we were driven in the roughest bus most of
these people had ever seen to the Catherine Palace at Tsarskoe Selo.
It was rum to be in the company of heavy-duty capitalists who mistook the
little dachas round about for garden sheds. Seeing a fat peasant woman
cycling with an even fatter pig in her basket just made their day. 'This
will be our first vacation when you haven't bought a house,' joked a Texan
to his wife.
Back in the big city, we had a drama outside the Winter Palace. A New York
dentist, thrilled at his success in haggling over Russian army watches with
a black marketeer - 'Ten for Dollars 100: they sell for Dollars 200 each on
Fifth Avenue: that's all my Christmas presents taken care of' - discovered
his wallet, containing 25 gold and platinum credit cards, had been lifted
during his transaction. For some reason, the collective mood was not one of
unalloyed sympathy.
After St Petersburg, the Sea Goddess I meandered in limp sunshine around the
summer fleshpots of Scandinavia. Both Goddesses have a safe platform for
water sports and ocean swimming. It is used in tropical waters, if calm. In
the chill waters of Lake Malaren, not far from Stockholm, only the hardy
Scandinavian stewardesses took advantage of it.
Catherine Stott was a guest of Cunard. A seven-day Goddess cruise in
European waters costs from Pounds 3,740 a person including flight, meals,
drinks and tips. Details: Cunard, 30a Pall Mall, London SW1 Y5LS. 071-491

FT  20 FEB 93 / Travel: Secret joys of the hidden valley - Off Piste / Ian
Roger learns with an expert in Andermatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN ROGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MY ENGLISH companion in the Gemsstock cable car groaned as I introduced
myself. 'Oh no] You are not going to write about Andermatt, are you?' he
said. Bob, a retired dentist, was depressed by the thought that the ski
resort he has regarded as almost his own for 30 years would become more
widely known.
Andermatt, in the Urseren valley in the middle of Switzerland's Gotthard
pass, has many special qualities. It is one of Europe's historic trade
crossroads, and the town and other villages in the valley retain
considerable historic charm and the natives an unexpected openness. The
weather is frequently wet which makes for unusually good snow cover in
winter.
Andermatt's biggest attraction is that it takes no package tours. During the
week, the valley's villages remain blissfully quiet. No lager louts, no
overly jolly chalet girls, no designer shops. Just a handful of small,
friendly hotels and pensions.
At weekends, a nearby motorway exit makes the resort easily accessible for
Swiss and Italian day trippers, but there are ways to avoid them. Andermatt
is for serious skiers - such as Bob. 'I have tried all the other places, but
this is still the best,' he says.
The ski area is deceptively large, although from lift and piste maps it
actually looks limited, with only the cable car and a couple of drag lifts
on the Gemsstock, a couple more drags on the other side of Andermatt at
Natschen and another at Hospental, by the entry to the Gotthard.
Each of these lifts also leads to a vast expanse of off-piste skiing. In
addition, the cog-wheel train (included in the weekly lift pass) on the
Furka-Oberalp railway runs to the top of the Oberalp pass to the east, and
from there a series of pistes and lifts leads down to Disentis in the upper
Rhine valley. Off-piste routes lead back to Andermatt.
'We like to get in about 30,000 feet vertical on a good day,' Bob said, as I
was panting from trying to keep up with him after only one run. There are
few resorts in the Alps where it would be logistically comfortable to ski
30,000 vertical feet in a day. The top of the 9,714 ft Gemsstock can be
reached in less than 20 minutes. From there, it is an all black run, the
initial portion over a glacier, to the town 5,000ft below. Or, like Bob,
skiers can plunge through powder most of the way.
If all this sounds too macho for the average intermediate, do not despair.
Andermatt is a good place to learn to be a serious skier. The resort has two
specialist off-piste guiding and instructing organisations.
After two outings with Alpine Adventures, run by Canadian John Hogg, I can
confidently say that if there is safely skiable powder to be found in the
region, John will find it. If it is not within reach from the lifts, he will
put climbing skins on pupils' skis and take them up to nearby glaciers to
introduce them to the joys of ski touring.
I joined him feeling a little apprehensive: there had been no fresh snow for
a week and crowds of day trippers could be expected. The well-known
off-piste runs from the Gemsstock had been skied out and most of the rest
had deteriorated into crud.
But John led our group of five up a little-known shoulder of the Gemsstock
and down a steep, untouched chute into the Unteralp valley. For most of the
way, the snow was surprisingly good. Then we went up and down the broad
north face of the 8,500ft Winterhorn above Hospental a number of times
without meeting another skier. The conditions varied mainly from breakable
to unbreakable crust, but every so often we came across some good powder. As
John said: 'If you can ski in this stuff, you can ski in anything.'
An intermediate looking for the next leap may find Andermatt is for them. Do
not tell anyone. Bob would be upset.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Travel: Odyssey through a winter wilderness - Off-piste /
Arnold Wilson takes risks high in the Dauphine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNOLD WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS WE traversed the debris of avalanches beneath the frozen walls of La
Meije, blocks of ice the size of a giant fist glistened at our feet.
They had broken off from the myriad seracs (ice pinnacles) above us, falling
hundreds of feet down the sheer north face. I picked up one of these
diamonds. It was as pure as the wind-blown virgin snow we had skied to reach
this desolate, beautiful 'vallon' (narrow valley). I wanted to take it home
as a trophy of one of the most astonishing day's skiing of my life.
Our small, exhausted but triumphant party skied the final mile of the
rock-strewn path down to the Col du Lautaret. Our skis were trashed but our
spirits soared when the sight we had been waiting for finally appeared: way
beneath us on a shelf was the medieval-looking village of La Grave, lights
twinkling in the twilight, church bells ringing hauntingly, and with the
peaks high above the village still bathed in evening light.
La Grave, a heady 6,500 vertical descent on tough, unpisted terrain, is only
one of many classic, off-piste, ski-mountaineering adventures (reaching
long, off-piste descents by walking, either carrying skis or walking on them
with the help of skins) to be savoured in this part of the French alps: the
Dauphine area around Alpe d'Huez and Les Deux Alpes.
The best base for exploring them is the quaint Hotel Rissiou where Nigel
Purkhardt bases his Ski Peak operation in the picturesque Oisans village of
Vaujany (1,250 metres) - a more pleasant back door to Alpe d'Huez than the
architecturally uninspiring resort itself.
Although it is almost an hour's drive to reach Les Deux Alpes (a mere five
minutes by helicopter), it is not necessary to travel further to find
off-piste itineraries of almost equal quality. There are endless
permutations starting outside your door in Vaujany itself.
Due to a windfall earned from a huge dam and hydro-electric station lower
down the valley, Vaujany has one of the world's biggest cable cars linking
it with Alpe d'Huez. At night it is tethered, like a huge spacecraft, in the
middle of the village, an incongruous sight in such a rustic setting.
Vaujany is not a village you would necessarily seek out while exploring the
local slopes. Visiting it, and some of the other mountain village satellites
that often remain unseen while skiers concentrate on 'motorway' cruising, is
rather like getting off the real motorways in France and experiencing the
joys of the countryside. We skied to two other such villages - St Christophe
en Oisans and then Venosc, locked in an almost claustrophobically beautiful
valley - via the most spectacular off-piste run I can remember skiing
anywhere in Europe: the Vallon de la Selle.
That we did it on the same day as La Grave (the starting point for both is
the Col de la Loze, reached after a 20-minute hike from the top of the Les
Deux Alpes ski area) made it an epic day. While piste skiers were clocking
up endless runs no more than a mile away, our small group, accompanied by
Olivier Laborie, our guide, set off on an off-piste odyssey. Olivier's
rucksack was weighed down with ice-axe, shovel, rope, titanium ice screws,
and karabiner and pulley for possible crevasse rescue.
Throughout the weekend, we were to ski just four descents. But they were
descents of such quality that on the rare occasions that we happened to
cross a piste in transit, it seemed almost hum-drum. What is so spectacular
about such runs is not necessarily the excellence of the snow - which can
change from good to bad to ugly and back again within a couple of dozen
turns - but the near-mystical experience of being allowed into the literally
and spiritually rarified atmosphere of a desolate mountain wilderness.
The Vallon de la Selle is a prime example. From the Col de la Loze, Olivier
skied gently over the shoulder to reveal a seemingly endless, steep
snowfield. A rocky outcrop dominated our route on the left. The steep, wide
chute of the actual run was bathed in sunshine that in an hour or two would
make the snow too difficult to enjoy. Our route disappeared into the shadow
of the narrow valley below.
Skiing a valley like this without a guide would be foolish. Were there any
crevasses lurking beneath the snow? If you fell at the top would the snow
hold you, or was there a cliff lurking beneath? And, on a more positive
note, where was the best snow likely to be?
Usually, falling on such terrain is harmless, if disconcerting. But during
our afternoon descent of La Grave, Olivier had us doing a climbing traverse
to keep above what looked like an innocent slope. It turned out that not
only was there a rimaye (a long snaky crevasse usually found where rock and
glacier meet) lurking below us, but the slope had all the characteristics of
being prone to a slab avalanche.
During a thrilling descent of the Col de la Pyramide, of the Pic Blanc, high
above the Alpe d'Huez/Vaujany ski area, we were warned not to fall because
there were cliffs which were not obvious from above. A skier falling here
could risk serious injury. Indeed, a skier in our party had been saved by
Olivier on an earlier occasion when he 'caught' her, cow-catcher style, at
his third attempt. One must not exaggerate the dangers, but being aware of
them is important.
For those interested in pistes rather than off-piste, the Alpe d'Huez skiing
domaine offers 107 of them (220 km) almost 90 lifts and 325 snow cannon.
My visit to Vaujany was arranged by Ski Peak, Hangerfield, Witley, Surrey,
GU8 5PR. 0428-682272. I stayed at the Rissiou Hotel. Ski Peak also has
chalet and apartment accommodation. Prices for a week (half board) range
from Pounds 300 in January to Pounds 450 in February, including scheduled
Air France flight from Heathrow to Lyon and transfer. Ski weekends (four
nights half board), usually only available in January and April, from Pounds
349.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Travel Focus: A Caribbean floating fantasy - Catherine Stott
joins 16 nationalities seeking fun in the sun aboard a floating resort /
Cruising
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITONS still tend to regard a Caribbean cruise as the ultimate travel
fantasy. While many of the 50-odd islands have become relatively expensive
since being developed, a ship makes them accessible financially as well as
geographically to a broad range of travellers.
With more than 40 ships to choose from year-round in the Caribbean,
standards have risen. I took a one-week cruise which, in spite of the
luxury, cost no more than a week's full board in a middle-of-the-road hotel
in the Med. The accommodation could not be faulted, food was available round
the clock, and the service was good.
The British passengers - mostly young families - had flown to Miami and
spent the night in the French-owned Sofitel before being driven to Fort
Lauderdale. Most seemed to be first-time cruisers as well as making their
first visit to the Caribbean and expectations were high. As 70,000 tons of
gleaming ship filled the view from the bus windows, there was a collective
gasp. Then silence.
Designed by Renzo Piano to resemble 'a dolphin moving through water',
Princess Cruises' Crown Princess was launched three years ago. Although it
comes into the 'floating resort' category and holds 1,600 passengers, it
feels uncrowded even when booked solid, as it was all last year.
Inside, it is luxurious; I have been in worse hotels at twice the price.
Maximum use is made of space, enhanced by full-length mirrors. My bedroom
was light and furnished stylishly with nice fabrics and framed prints. The
good-sized bathroom had a power-shower, plus a vacuum loo that sounded like
cannon-fire, and there was a vanity unit and separate dressing area with 40
hangers and 20 drawers.
Some of the new mega-liners have been described as no more than vulgar
floating casinos, but this one was elegant with shops that were glitzy but
chic.
There were 16 nationalities on board, all determined to have fun. The mix
ranged from a 600-strong teetotal religious group from California to the six
exuberant Mexicans my sleepless companion spotted entering the whirlpool
bath in the middle of the night with a bottle of champagne and a
ghetto-blaster, wearing very little.
Our table for 10 at dinner in the enormous restaurant was fairly jolly. All
the diners were wealthy Americans. Willy, once a Swiss farmer's boy, owned a
gold mine in Alaska. Gary was a psychotherapist-cum-novelist from Phoenix;
his wife was so twitchy, she must have been a patient. Kelvin from Beverly
Hills was chairman of a computer corporation; and Sheldon - well, Sheldon
was the real prize. He said: 'I have taken a suite on a cruise ship every
year since I became affluent.' Sheldon was honeymooning with his brother's
ex-wife. He wore big jewellery and she had big hair.
Mario from Ravenna was a heavy-duty Italian tycoon into heavy hand-kissing.
His wife spoke no English. Together, we motley 10 ploughed our way nightly
through six decent courses of Italian food with an American accent. The wine
was rather expensive but the Americans all drank iced tea. Being at sea
seemed to have made them amorous. There was more nuzzling than eating.
Waking at sunrise on the second day, I saw a flat coral atoll passing my
window. It was Eleuthera in the Bahamas, our first port of call where
Princess Cruises has set up its own watersports resort on a private beach.
Here, we were to unwind and take part in a programme called Adventures
Ashore, including a beach barbecue. At 9am, the first tenders left with the
pirate-clad crew to set up the beach party. How would they move 1,600 people
without chaos? The answer: in 20 minutes and without chaos.
After two minutes, my skin was screaming for more sun-block. It was
unbelievably hot but almost indecently beautiful under the sea-grape trees
and royal palms. On the beach, the Chinese played the Japanese at volleyball
and the Italians smooched on loungers. The Mexicans zoomed around the bay in
rented speedboats while the British fried, sipped pina colada, and read
Jeffrey Archer and Jackie Collins.
Aboard, we were spoilt for choice in ways to pass the time. Should we learn
bridge or blackjack, or how to fold a napkin into a swan, or scuba diving in
the pool? Or join Miss Rhoda Israelove in her seminar on 'How to Protect
Your Money?' At night, there was the casino and Broadway-style music shows.
With San Juan, Puerto Rico, as the next port of call, the ship's TV relayed
endless lectures on where to find the cheapest liquor, gold and diamonds. As
we queued to disembark, I got talking with a woman education officer from
Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, who said she and her companions were delighted
with the cruise. 'Where else,' she asked, 'could four single women see so
much in such comfort and safety?'
Some people had booked 'A hike in the rain forest', hoping to see the
creepie-crawlies. I treated myself to a Pounds 30, 30-minute helicopter ride
over old San Juan, that 300-year-old Spanish colonial masterpiece. At
dinner, the rain forest hikers were glum. 'I'll tell you what happens in the
rain forest,' said the psychotherapist. 'It rains. Very hard. And all we saw
was one small snail. The best sight was the bus back to the ship.'
Sheldon-the-affluent proudly showed off his new and heavy gold bracelet and
admitted to being 'a real male jewellery freak'. His brother's ex-wife
sported a diamond 'tennis bracelet'.
The dress code was 'casual' after a day in port. Mercifully, someone was
expelled from the restaurant for going barefoot, another for baring his
tattoos via a tank top, but these were the only sartorial indiscretions.
'Formal', when most men wore a white tuxedo, was interpreted liberally.
There were lounge suits, sports jackets, even an eccentric in tweed jogging
pants whose pony-tail had been dipped in silver.
Next came St Thomas in the US Virgin Islands where the red roofs caught the
early morning sun prettily. Dolphins escorted us into port, the green and
hilly capital of Charlotte Amalie. Time for an adventure, we thought, and
booked a Pounds 17 catamaran ride to the island next door - St John, a
national state park - just for the joy of watching glorious yachts in full
sail and snorkelling on the reef. On our return to St Thomas, we saw a 3ft
iguana standing at a bus stop. Our friends who had seen nothing in the rain
forest were livid.
Waiting to dock at Nassau gave me the chance to ask passengers what they had
thought of the cruise. The consensus was that it had delivered even more
than it had promised. No criticisms, then? Only, it seemed, that people
found the drinks - at Dollars 3 a cocktail - rather expensive. But they had
solved that problem by buying bottles of rum, at the same price, in Puerto
Rico.
Catherine Stott travelled with Princess Cruises. Caribbean cruises on the
Crown Princess start from Pounds 895 a person for nine nights in an inside
cabin with private facilities, including return flight and a night in a
Miami hotel. Further details: Princess Cruises, 77 New Oxford St, London

provides a guide to the pick of holidays afloat / Cruising

<TEXT>
CRUISING IS the one kind of travel that has continued to get better. It has
become more glamorous and more affordable. Long gone is its image as the
winter pastime of the geriatric rich.
The about-turn came in the 1980s with the launch of a new generation of
ships which, helped by strong marketing, were addressed to quite a different
audience. Now, first-time cruisers are more likely to be young and
fun-loving, often with accompanying children, than rich and old.
Gone (almost) are the gruesome old rust-buckets with shared facilities,
shoe-box cabins and no air-conditioning. Here to stay are, at one end of the
scale, floating resorts of great luxury and, at the other, elitist 'boutique
cruisers' carrying around 200 passengers prepared to pay for the best.
Initially, many people remain cruise-resistant. The most common worries are
feeling restricted, sea-sickness, and being trapped in a holiday camp
atmosphere. The short answers are that if you tend to feel shut in, you will
choose one of the larger ships. Sea-sickness is rarely a problem, since all
cruise ships have high-tech stabilisers designed to reduce roll. If you are
prone to it, acu-pressure wrist-bands and the little patches worn on the
neck prevent most bouts. And all ships' hospitals offer injections to stop
it.
As for the on-board atmosphere, that depends on the style of ship you choose
 -but 80 per cent of people elect to go for another cruise once they have
tried it. There is plenty of choice: there were 120 ships world-wide in
1985; next year, there will be 175.
Cruising offers a touch of romance - besides most places look better from
the sea. It allows less intrepid travellers to reach parts of the globe they
would not otherwise contemplate, in comfort and safety. I sailed around
India recently with several hundred truly timid people who had the journey
of their lives, mostly using the ship as a hotel in different ports -
including Rangoon which is still difficult to visit in any other way.
And you really do get what you pay for, with no hidden charges. All
transport, meals and entertainment will have been settled in advance. Only
(optional) shore excursions, drinks at duty-free prices and tips are extra.
This need not be a worry: all ships set out reasonable guidelines on how
much to give, and to whom. On an average cruise, it would work out at about
Pounds 3 a person per day.
As a first-time cruiser, how do you begin to choose? Answer: set yourself an
honest quiz to find out what you want and what you would hate. The Passenger
Shipping Assocation says it receives only 35 complaints a year out of
200,000 cruisers and an equal number of ferry passengers. 'Complaints are
invariably from people who have chosen the wrong ship and are expecting more
than they have paid for,' says director Ken Page.
Next, decide when and where you want to go. Only the Caribbean and south
Pacific are year-round destinations (although the Caribbean is prohibitively
expensive from December to April if you stay in a hotel, it is cheaper to
cruise there in that period because, curiously, the peak season for
Caribbean cruising is July and August when the weather is far more humid).
Alaska, the present 'in' destination, is navigable only between June and
early September - prime months, too, for the Baltic. The Mediterranean
season runs from late March to early November in the brochures, but seasoned
sun-seekers will know that although prices may be seductively low at both
ends, the weather can be blustery and the waters turbulent at these times.
In the northern hemisphere winter - their summer - South America, South
Africa, Australia and New Zealand have the best cruising weather. And
south-east Asia, an increasingly popular area, is best from October to March
although there can be small rains (as distinct from full-blown monsoons) in
December and January in certain areas.
Closer to Britain, the cheaper traditional winter destinations are the
Atlantic islands (Madeira, Tenerife, Gran Canaria and Lanzarote), and south
to The Gambia and Senegal. These well-trodden paths may not appeal to more
discerning travellers, however.
Sensible first-time cruisers in Britain will acquire a big selection of
brochures from a travel agent displaying a window sticker saying 'PSARA'.
This indicates it has staff trained to advise on cruising; there are 1,000
such agents.
Now it is time to decide on your holiday prioritiies. Cruising tends to be
gregarious. If you are a loner, or a self-sufficient couple, it will not
work unless you can afford the most expensive and smallest possible ship
where the on-board entertainment is negligible and the personal space huge.
Should you regard yourself as a swinger or raver, choose a big, new vessel.
Paradoxically, the largest ships often have the most compact cabins -
cleverly-planned modules that are quite adequate for those who regard their
accommodation as no more than a place in which to sleep before the next bout
of swinging and raving.
If the dimensions of cabins are not given in the brochure, ring the cruise
company and ask. Older ships tend to have a wider range of accommodation.
Prices for newer liners vary according to whether there is a view, a bath as
well as a shower and, increasingly, a veranda.
Next: how many ports do you want to visit? Remember that most shore
excursions leave the ship at 8am; if you were late to bed, this might not be
convenient. Cunard has two ships, one in the Caribbean, the other in the
Mediterranean, which offer a different port each day but most passengers
seem to find one every two days about right.
Seventy-five per cent of the world's cruisers are American. Should you
prefer to sail mostly with Britons, it is easy to book on ships leaving and
returning to UK ports. This market has grown by 1,500 annually for the past
five years - an increase that has led P &amp; O, which already has two ships
sailing world-wide from Southampton to announce plans for a new, Pounds 200m
liner cruising from the UK in 1995.
Cruising for under Pounds 1,200. This category has the most choice. For
excellent Italian food and a cheerful European atmosphere, the Costa
Classica is new, sparkling and good value. You can choose from two Caribbean
routes out of Miami, with a starting price of Pounds 849 for 15 nights
(seven in Miami or Orlando) including the return flight from Britain.
The Crown Princess and Regal Princess, mega-cruisers from Princess Cruises
(part of P &amp; O), offer nine nights in the Caribbean from Pounds 895. The
Song of America, operated by Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, has an
interesting itinerary from Los Angeles south to Mexico, including return
flight, from Pounds 1,175. The QE2, with its vast range of accommodation
across a large price range, has cruises from two to 100 days - good food in
the top classes, 60 things to do each day.
The Norway, once the France, is now Norwegian Cruise Lines' flagship. Taking
2,300 passengers weekly round the Caribbean, it is still very stylish, with
glassed-in decks of shops and cafes. Its range of cabins starts at Pounds
995 a person for a nine-night holiday out of Miami.
Cruises over Pounds 1,800. The Crystal Harmony is a new, luxurious ship from
Crystal Cruises which offers opulence at half the price of some rivals.
There is a choice of restaurants, the biggest pool afloat, marble-lined
lifts and spacious cabins. A 13-day cruise from Tilbury costs from Pounds
2,424. Equally good value on the large-and-luxurious circuit is the Royal
Princess, which has no inside cabins and an unusually high proportion of
full bathrooms and verandas.
Other ships in this category with high reputations are the Royal Viking Sun,
voted consistently as the world's No 1 cruise ship; all the ships of the
Holland America Line; and Cunard's Sagafjord and Vistafjord, which have an
extremely loyal following.
Cruises over Pounds 3,000. The 'boutique cruisers' take around 200
passengers in surroundings of all-inclusive splendour. These luxury ships
have such shallow drafts that they can enter bays, harbours and rivers
inaccessible to most others. They offer virtually no structured
entertainment; the passengers mostly are rich. Vessels include Cunard's Sea
Goddess I and II, the Seabourn Pride and Seabourn Spirit, the Royal Viking
Queen and the Song of Flower. Work on a budget of around Pounds 500 a person
per day and you will not be far out.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Travel Focus: A market with the wind in its sales - Michael
Skapinker analyses the growth in cruising holidays and finds travel
companies forging ahead to their next frontier / Cruising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST time I saw a group of cruisers, they were disembarking on the
Greek island of Hydra. Mostly elderly Americans, they spent an hour or two
in the jewellery shops and then went back on board. I thought it was a
peculiar way to spend a holiday.
The number of holidaymakers who disagree increases by the year. In North
American, 1.4m people took cruises in 1980. Last year, the figure reached an
estimated 4.4m. The UK, the world's second biggest cruise market, is far
smaller. But the 200,000 UK residents who went on cruises last year were a
substantial increase on the 115,000 who did so in 1980.
The large UK travel companies believe they can almost quadruple the number
of British cruise takers by the end of the century. After building an
industry which every year takes 11m package tourists by air to resorts in
the Mediterranean and further afield, British travel companies regard
cruising as their next frontier. They believe that a generation jaded by
Majorca and Florida is ready to try something new.
By the end of the century, Thomas Cook, the travel agents' chain, predicts
that 750,000 Britons will be cruising each year. It thinks the worldwide
figure will be 10m.
Lunn Poly, Britain's biggest chain of travel agents, sold about 15,000
cruises in 1992. This is a tiny proportion of the 1.7m holidays Lunn Poly
sold overall, but the company's cruise sales for this summer are already 144
per cent up on last year.
About two-thirds of Lunn Poly's cruise customers fly to Florida or another
North American hopping-off point and take a boat bound for the Caribbean.
The Caribbean is the most popular UK cruise destination and the one which
companies like Lunn Poly regard as their natural market.
Cruisers in the Caribbean tend to be younger than those who take a cruise
from a UK port. Caribbean cruisers regard their ship as a floating hotel,
which has the advantage of allowing them to wake up at a different island
every few days, instead of being stuck in the same place for two weeks. They
are more interested in having a casino or discotheque on board than a guest
lecturer.
Andy Allwood, Lunn Poly's spokesman, puts it this way: 'The last thing
fly-cruisers who go to the Caribbean want is to be surrounded by water. They
want to be able to see an island wherever they are. The cruiser who leaves
from a UK port is a traditional cruiser - Home Counties, crusty colonels set
in their ways, people who like hierarchy, officers and ranks and all that.
Some of that market is people who like being at sea. They like the idea of
being on a ship surrounded by water,' he says, somewhat incredulously.
As I said, Lunn Poly is aiming at the Caribbean market.
There are plenty of people taking cruises from UK ports, and they are not
all crusty colonels. The Cunard Line says bookings for cruises from the UK
to the Mediterranean are up 20 per cent on last year.
The company says that bookings on the QE2 are particularly healthy. A
110-day world cruise on the QE2 in a cabin with its own lounge and private
balcony can cost Pounds 80,000. But it is possible to take a QE2 cruise for
less than Pounds 300. That will give you two nights on board and take you
from Southampton to Brest, Cork and back to Southampton.
Not everyone in the cruise industry is happy about the level of bookings.
Sissie Chan, marketing director of Swan Hellenic, part of the P&amp;O group,
says she expects to have a difficult year. Swan Hellenic cruises, on the
Mediterranean, the Black Sea and European rivers, last for two weeks and
cost an average of Pounds 2,500. Most of the company's customers are retired
and wealthy. The company is trying to lower its age profile, by which it
means attracting people in their 50s, rather than the under 40s who are
going to the Caribbean.
Swan Hellenic never really recovered after the Gulf War. The recession has
hurt, particularly as the company's retired customers suffer, rather than
benefit, from low interest rates.
What all the cruises offer is security. There is not the worry about
changing hotels every few days and moving your luggage. If you go sailing on
the Cunard Countess in the Caribbean, for example, all you do is turn up at
the airport with your luggage. The next time you see it is on board.
But the variety of cruises on offer makes it essential to choose the right
one. Once on board, there is no way off.
Although the large travel agency chains are keen to increase their cruise
business, they handle a relatively small proportion of current bookings.
This is in sharp contrast to the air charter package market, where the large
chains play a more dominant part. Industry officials estimate that about 25
per cent of bookings are made directly with the companies. About 60 per cent
of the rest are handled by independent travel agents.
Although the industry has worked hard to improve travel agency employees'
knowledge of cruising, it is still a specialised business. When Thomas Cook
carried out a survey four years ago, it discovered that most of its cruise
business was coming through about 50 of its outlets which had decided to
concentrate on cruising.
Because you are stuck with your fellow passengers and the opportunities to
wander off on your own are limited, it is vital you book through an agent
that specialises in cruises.
Eric Flounders, Cunard's spokesman, says: 'There are some ships, not ours,
which are like Butlins afloat. If you didn't want that and you ended up on
it, you'd be miserable.'

FT  20 FEB 93 / How To Spend It: Live a simpler life - throw away those
festoon blinds / These are the brighter, cleaner '90s / A look at ways to
create the uncluttered, personal look of the modern interior
</HEADLINE>

THOSE WHO got their houses all kitted out in authentic 1980s chic may well
find, if they mind about such things, that what once looked so absolutely
comme il faut, today looks more than just a little passe. Eighties chic in
designer-land, you will not need reminding, centred round a sense of excess,
of sumptuousness and opulence. Images in glossy magazines showed us rooms
with not a corner left unmolested by urns or cherubs, with scarcely an inch
of wall left unadorned, no surface left clean and uncluttered.
Nineties rooms are different. Nineties rooms are lighter, cleaner, brighter.
Fashionable walls are often white, or else lime-washed straight onto the
plaster with natural dyes. Where festoon blinds once flourished there are
Roman blinds or even plainer roller blinds. In the place of rich patterns
there are simple muslins, calicos, checks. Furniture is countryfied,
stronger. Chintz has gone into retreat, cherubs into hiding and all those
glitzy bows and furbelows done a bunk.
If your own house or rooms are still a little over-loaded with '80s props a
quick trawl around some of the latest home interior catalogues should offer
lots of ideas of how to simplify and up-date without embarking on massive
expenditure.
A good way to start would be by taking a look at the latest Habitat
catalogue, due out in all Habitat stores from March 5 (price Pounds 2). As
always, the catalogue does more than focus on individual products - it
captures the mood of the times. And the mood, says the catalogue loud and
clear, is natural, sunbleached, weathered. Strength and simplicity are the
'90s virtues.
Fabrics are mainly plain or checked with a few errant florals making a token
appearance from time to time. Furniture is strong and clean-lined with
several pieces that are reincarnations of internationally recognised
classics - the rush-seated Monet Chair (Pounds 39), the Van Gogh chair (in
solid beech with blue-stained finish and a woven rush seat, Pounds 45), the
Chubb Rattan chair (Pounds 75), the Steamer (Pounds 129).
For the kitchen the look is pared-down, practical, sturdy. Look out for the
butcher's range - all in solid beech, there is a table, chairs, a useful
mobile chopping block and storage unit, the trolley (photographed here top
left, Pounds 199) and the console, a side-unit with a hanging rail, knife
rack, chopping surface, rattan drawers and a storage shelf.
For the rest of the house there are big handsome pieces - the Sussex large
cupboard (made to order, the top is Pounds 349, the base, Pounds 399) ), the
capacious Monterey sofa and armchair, (Pounds 1,149), the Bath dining table
big enough to seat eight in comfort (solid pine top, hand-forged steel base,
Pounds 499).
The bedding, always one of Habitat's strengths, offers even more charm than
usual - choose from plain 100 per cent cotton percale Chambray, lots of
crisp stripes and checks, an impeccably plain pure white cotton range and
some patchwork Indian quilts to soften the look. Just as charming is the
handcrafted copper collection of bathroom accessories, sketched right.
This is a simple, classic catalogue with the furniture left to speak for
itself. It is based on the assumption that what the modern home needs is a
series of timeless, constant designs around which personality can be added.
You can add hand-crafted artefacts, loved pictures, quirky lamps, treasured
holiday finds and put together your individual look through the years.
Make sure your big purchases are bought properly and well, is the underlying
leitmotif, then they should last you a lifetime and you can refresh and
revitalise a scheme by ringing the changes in more ephemeral, less expensive
ways.
Jane Churchill is another company worth looking at. It started by offering a
range of pretty, chintzified country fabrics and papers, all of which
co-ordinated in many different ways but since it was taken over by the
Colefax &amp; Fowler group it has blossomed. Its Sloane Street shop offers not
just some exceedingly pretty papers and fabrics but a wide range of all the
smaller accessories that go to make up a 'look'. The photograph, top right,
shows perfectly the new Jane Churchill style  - all crisp checks, in toning
colours and different scales, teamed with strong, simple furniture and
simple woven rush matting. Hand-crafted and one-off are some of the
watchwords of the nineties and at Jane Churchill there is a supply of the
hand-crafted pieces, candelabra or one-off bits of furniture that can add
character and individuality to a classic room. Prices seem to me excellent.
The best place to see the whole look is at Jane Churchill, 135 and 151,
Sloane Street, London SW1 but there is also a concession in Liberty of
Regent Street and another shop at 3, Christopher Place, St. Albans, Herts.
Otherwise all the papers and fabrics can be seen and ordered through
interior decorators throughout the land. Telephone 081-874- 6484 for the
nearest stockist.
Graham &amp; Green also sense the way the decorative wind is blowing and this
year for its annual kilim exhibition (starting on Saturday February 27 and
running until March 27) they are making a point of showing kilims used in a
lighter, fresher way.
Antonia Graham, one of the taste guides behind the shops, has rented a
gallery on the corner of Elgin Crescent and Portobello Road (readers wanting
to go to the exhibition are advised to turn up at 4, Elgin Crescent, London
W11 where they will be directed to the gallery just two minutes away) where
there is lots of wall space and big windows. There she plans to show that by
mixing kilims with plenty of white and cream - creamy sofas, filmy white
curtains, white walls - the look is immediately lightened and updated. As
she rightly points out white walls are anyway the best background for any
interesting works of art, tribal pieces, wall-hangings.
There will be cushions and fabrics from Chelsea textiles - most of the
patterns are taken from 17th-century designs and are so exquisitely done,
using natural dyes and colours, that it is almost impossible to date them.
There will be small Afghan rugs at about Pounds 40 a time, Turkish ones
starting at about Pounds 95, lots to choose from between Pounds 350 and
Pounds 375 and two or three specials costing about Pounds 2,000.
Photographed bottom left are two rugs from the Graham &amp; Green collection -
on the wall is one from Yugoslavia featuring some colourful peacocks (sadly,
sold already) and on the floor is a Turkish kilim (Pounds 245). The
wrought-iron sofa is English, by Stan Pike, and costs Pounds 885 (cushions
extra) and the Indian table, one of a big selection, is Pounds 950.
If you want to update your house instantly there is no need to throw
everything out but there are a few simple things that most of us could
easily do. You could take down the festoon blinds and put a simple white
and, need I say it, natural, fabric at the windows.
Habitat, for instance, is selling a ready-made simple loop-headed curtain
(66 ins by 90 ins, Pounds 39) in handwoven thick white cotton which would
immediately lighten any room. Take down the gilded bows, the bronzed
cherubs, simplify the tie-backs, take off any fringing, cover sofas or
chairs in loose-covers in plain or check fabric and above all, add masses of
white or cream.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Food and Drink: Poor food - it sticks in my throat, but .. /
 ..when top-class restaurants cannot get the basics right,they deserve to be
taken to task, says Nicholas Lander

<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH I have written this column for four years, I still find the obvious
question the most difficult. Should anybody ask me 'Where is the best place
to eat in London?' I mumble and try to change the subject.
It is only when I can move this question on to specifics - area, price, type
of cooking - that I feel more confident, particularly as I am convinced that
not only is the quality of restaurants improving nationally, but so too is
the value they offer.
At least, I thought that until the past fortnight, when two dinners and one
lunch for a total of eight people costing a total of Pounds 360 all proved a
grave disappointment. Normally, I do not review unsatisfactory restaurants
but this sorry sequence, which inadvertently taught me a lot, will be the
exception to this rule.
Although a long-time admirer of Nico Ladenis as a cook, I decided just to
mention his move to the Grosvenor House en passant rather than devote
another article to his restaurant, now known as Nico at Ninety. After all,
Ladenis is now plugged into the effective Forte PR machine. It was the need
to distract a friend whose wife was away that finally provided a raison
d'etre for a visit.
Fortunately, we were all interested in wine because the highlight of the
meal was the knowledgeable British sommelier, who steered us in the
direction of two interesting, relatively well-priced, bottles. But his
enthusiasm was not matched by that of the maitre d', who had to be prompted
into divulging the fish specials and who managed to run the descriptions of
all four into one long convoluted sentence.
We therefore decided to order meat but had difficulty choosing because,
having eaten Ladenis's food before, there seemed to be little new. The
dishes that had been stimulating five years ago were repeated, but at higher
prices (Pounds 42 for two courses) and our own lack of enthusiasm seemed to
be reflected in the kitchen.
Small details annoyed me. The dessert menu, which baldly asked me to pay
Pounds 8 for a lemon tart (albeit in French), was worn and needed replacing.
Out of the corner of my eye I kept spying a waiter, only half hidden by the
kitchen door, swigging from a bottle of Perrier.
Two days later, meeting a fish merchant friend at the new restaurant in
Harvey Nichols, in Knightsbridge, I first surveyed the fish counter in the
food store. Fresh halibut, turbot and glistening red mullet whetted my
appetite.
However, the chef cannot be in touch with the store's fish buyer because the
only fish on the restaurant menu were lemon sole with a crab sauce (half way
through my meal I saw a blackboard in the kitchen which read NO LEMON SOLE)
and an Italian fish chowder which I mistakenly ordered. This was bland and
thin and its only connection with Italy, I felt, was the tomato.
The restaurant will have problems until the relatively inexperienced Henry
Harris, formerly sous chef at Bibendum, eventually finds his feet as a head
chef and their personable general manager, Dominic Ford, stops running
around trying to plug too many holes and concentrates on orchestrating the
service - which is poor in spite of the 15 per cent service charge.
We had to ask for menus, ask again to order, and then our conversation was
interrupted three times by the waiter. But my meal was irrevocably spoilt by
having to sit and watch a single lady diner wait 20 minutes for a bowl of
fish soup. That is no way to treat a lady.
But the head-scratching service at La Semillante, Mill Street, London W1,
made this experience pale into insignificance. Here our meal was barely
salvaged by happy recollections of John Cleese in 'Fawlty Towers,' although
watching a commis waiter walk out of the kitchen with an empty tray, put it
solemnly down on a table, pick the tray up again and walk back into the
kitchen will remain a low point in the career of this restaurant
correspondent.
We went there because I intended to write an article on pastry chefs and I
had been reliably informed that the chef, Patrick Woodside, a graduate of
Tante Claire and Claridge's, was one of the best. Certainly his bread is
first class and he is possibly an inventive, talented chef. However, as well
as being let down by inept front-of-house staff, his talents are hidden by a
menu that contains more past participles than anything I have seen since I
took Latin A level and a kitchen brigade that on the night could not get the
basics right.
A filet of hare came without the crispy rice advertised on the menu; another
dish came with a potato 'fondant' and brussel sprouts that had not been
thoroughly cooked. We were not asked why we had left a good portion of the
meal uneaten.
The overall experience of these three restaurants left me wiser, poorer and
even more reluctant to make recommendations. But there was another cause for
concern. Quite understandably, none of the restaurants uses the large
pretentious silver 'cloches' to cover the plates. But none of the food came
to me, on cold winter evenings in air-conditioned rooms, as hot as I would
have liked. For any reader able to design a suitable cover there is, I
believe, a ready market.

CHARDONNAY at Pounds 2.99? An oxymoron, surely, unless that Chardonnay is
unrecognisable and/or Bulgarian. A white burgundy sort of Chardonnay at
Pounds 2.99? A cruel joke, surely, unless it is the Laboure-Roi Bourgogne
Grand Ordinaire on offer at Majestic wine warehouses from February 23 until
March 21.
The bottle I tasted not only looked worth twice the price, it almost tasted
it too. Majestic has 14 burgundies on special offer over this period, with
such wines as remain being 'on taste' over the weekend of March 6/7. The red
counterpart to this BGO is Pounds 3.99 with the grand Pinot Noir grape
fleshed out with some of Beaujolais' Gamay. Best value in red wines is
Faiveley's 1989 Bourgogne Rouge at Pounds 5.99 - thoroughly serious for
drinking over the next two years.
'In the twenties, we danced,' wrote Dame Barbara Cartland in the foreword to
The Complete Hostess by Giovanni Quaglino. She would have interrupted her
dancing to eat, from La Grande Carte, Tournedos at 3/6d or half a lobster
Delmonico at four shillings, and a bottle of Chateau d'Yquem 1920 at Pounds
2.
The prices will have changed but last week Quaglino's reopened on the same
site in London's Bury Street, SW1 (tel: 071-930-6767) a West End outpost of
the Terence Conran empire. It will be interesting to see whether, for the
first time since Conran appointed Simon Hopkinson as Head Chef at Bibendum,
he has found another chef (this time Martin Webb) whose culinary skills can
match Conran's undoubted eye for design.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Food and Drink: Baffling Belgians in the course of a meal -
Jancis Robinson found more than a few food frontiers to cross when she dined
with some very particular guests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE become very interested in Belgians recently. The French may take wine
and food seriously, but they are babes in arms compared with the Belgians.
I say this with all the authority of one who spent a weekend in Leuwen - or
was it Louvain? - last autumn and who spent far too much of a day recently
being interviewed, in London, for a Belgian magazine. It is rare for the
interviewee to learn more than the interviewer, but I did on this occasion.
The man from Brussels got little out of our encounter, other than
exasperation at my inability to get to grips with his dauntingly
all-embracing instruction: 'Tell me about European wine.' But he had brought
with him a Belgian photographer, a fascinating young man who had been
brought up in a restaurant, his father being a restaurateur. Thus, although
the young Belgian was there in clicking mode, he could not help passing on
various epicureanisms in the restaurant where we met for lunch.
That was my first mistake. I suggested we meet at Clarke's, Sally Clarke's
Kensington restaurant with a California accent on both its food and wine. It
therefore proved rather more difficult than it might otherwise have been to
field the bottles of European wine required for the photograph.
Nor could my two Belgian friends quite believe that the fresh face at the
char grill belonged not just to the chef but to the patronne. While we
waited for our first course, the photographer asked politely where she had
trained. I would have liked a photograph of his face when I told him
California.
Soon after this the wine arrived. Assuming they would be interested to taste
something out of the ordinary, I had ordered a bottle of Au Bon Climat
Chardonnay. The name may be French but the provenance is an old barn in
California's Santa Barbara County. They viewed it rather as one might a dog
with three legs.
The photographer was particularly worried about the means used to cool the
bottle. 'I was taught,' he said, 'that you should never cool wine in a
fridge, only in an ice bucket.'
I can see the logic of this if you are running a restaurant full of
fault-finding Belgians. Wines, especially fizzy ones, left for more than a
few days in a fridge can lose their fruit, and stock rotation is much more
difficult in a restaurant than at home. But my photographer friend clearly
thought that wine itself is capable of sensing by which method it is being
transformed from temperature A to B, and of reacting accordingly.
'Excuse me,' he then asked politely over the first course, 'but would you
normally drink wine with soup? I was taught you never should.'
An interesting point that, and one we discussed at some length. It is true
that since soup slakes thirst, there should be no need to drink anything
with it, but I could not convince the photographer that there was nothing
about the flavour of soup per se that was inherently inimical to wine.
However, in Belgium you do not serve wine with soup. I felt bad about making
him party to this solecism.
Then we discussed corkscrews. The Belgians were horrified by my enthusiasm
for the Screwpull Lever model, which has transformed my life, involving as
it sometimes does the extraction of more than 50 corks a day. But, they
pointed out in unison, there is the possibility that the point of the screw
might emerge below the cork and push a particle of said cork into the wine.
So what? I said. The interviewer scribbled madly. 'We've got a right
revolutionary here,' said his furtive look to the photographer.
All this instructive observation of assumed national behaviour had been
presaged by my Belgian weekend, where a group of us wine tasters had our
knees under some table or other almost every waking hour (although we did
spend a lot of time snoozing in the back of cars between meals).
Tastings would be punctuated by little platefuls of truffle or foie gras and
every glass was religiously rinsed with the relevant wine, even precious
Yquem, before being used for tasting - and we must have tasted at least five
dozen wines during the weekend.
Wine thermometers were much in evidence. Our host's son had driven 500 miles
(800 kilometres) to Epernay to buy the right sort of beef for Sunday lunch.
Whenever a course was served it was fallen upon and ravished in a noisy -
though wordless - food-dedicated interval before the upright position and
conversation could be resumed.
But the most riveting sight, the one that convinced me that a Belgian's
vocation is to eat and drink, was of a piece of gastronomic equipment which
I have never encountered elsewhere but which raised not an eyebrow in
Belgian company. Just before each meal, the really keen members of our party
would take from their pockets or handbags a small chain about a foot long
with an ornamental clip at each end. They would reverently arrange this
chain around the back of the neck before using them to clip their napkins
neatly up to the chin.
The ritual unclipping was invariably accompanied by a sigh of sated
melancholy.
For a thoroughly Belgian antidote to all this reverence, Londoners should
head for the impressively, jokily, spartan Belgo restaurant in Chalk Farm
Road, NW1. Great value for moules, and beers to turn the head of the most
convinced wine lover.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Cookery: Super soups to stir the most jaded palate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN I was a child, my father often told me the tale of a menage a trois
remembered from his boyhood. The co-habitants were a domestically-minded
trio - une feve, un saucisson et une petite souris grise - whose innocent
lives centred on the tasks of cooking, shopping and cleaning their little
house.
They all noticed that the soup always tasted best on days when the sausage
was cook. The mouse kept asking why. Eventually, the sausage divulged his
secret: he jumped in and out of the soup pan when no one was looking.
The mouse was excited by this culinary revelation. When next on kitchen
duty, he tried to imitate the sausage, dived into the soup pan and drowned.
The bean, heartless old thing, laughed so much that he split his sides - and
every bean has a split in its back ever since . . .
I was reminded of this tale when thumbing my way through two new books
published this month, both on the same subject. The Soup Book, by Brigid
Allen (Papermac, Pounds 9.99) is not helped by its cover. A Celebration of
Soup, by Lindsey Bareham (Michael Joseph, Pounds 16.99) has far greater
instant appeal. The title is more joyous and the cover photograph is
seductive in a restrained sort of way. While Allen is lumbered with a
worthy, stuck-in-a-time-warp wholefood image, Bareham's bowl of soup has a
zesty, contemporary freshness.
Bareham has made her mark on the comfort food corner of the cook-book market
already with an excellent volume on the potato. This new offering is liable
to win her even more friends. It is a rich source of inspiration, a whopping
compendium of soup recipes for every occasion, and a mass of information on
all aspects of making and serving soup. The recipes are her own, her
adaptations of other people's, and some offerings direct from such names as
Simon Hopkinson, Shaun Hill and Nico Ladenis.
A large section, enough to make a book in its own right, is devoted to
garnishes and embellishments. There are breads, of course, and such fun
ideas as spooning a cheese souffle mixture on to toast to float on soup to
be heated in the oven; plus the latest visual shock tactic in foodie
circles: sprinkling gold dust on home-made noodles and floating squares of
gold leaf on soups.
Bareham believes stock is 'the body and soul of most soups . . . invariably,
the secret ingredient that makes so many soups rich, complex in flavour and
full-bodied.' Accordingly, a hefty chunk of the book is devoted to a
comprehensive run-down on stock-making and a mind-boggling diversity of
stock recipes. Cooks, she says, 'divide into those that do and those that
don't make stock.'
Allen acknowledges that good stock can be valuable in soup-making but she is
wary of the stock-pot as a potential tyrant. She points out that the
dominance of stock in soup-making is rooted in the meat-based diet of
earlier generations, and in household economies geared to the extraction of
every last drop of goodness from a carcass.
Joints figure relatively rarely on our menus today, They tend to be much
smaller and may be boned-out. For earlier generations, maintaining the
stock-pot was a sacred duty. Today, it might involve a special trip to the
butcher. We are, she argues, more orientated towards vegetable cookery.
I would guess that fewer than half the recipes in Allen's book depend on
stock. They are grouped under such unusual chapter headings as soups using
avocado pear, soups using roast garlic, curried soups, and so on. Recurring
flavourings include ginger and chilli. Many mentions of lovage, sorrel,
spinach and chard highlight the appeal of the book to cook-gardeners, and
there is a useful section on breads.
SCALLOP AND POTATO CREAM WITH CORAL (Bareham's recipe. Serves 4)
Ingredients: 4 large scallops (cleaned weight about 12 oz); 1 lb potatoes,
peeled and diced; 2 small shallots, chopped finely; 2 oz butter; 1 pt hot
fish stock;  1/2 pt milk; 2 egg yolks; 3 fl oz double cream; 1 tsp snipped
chives.
Method: Soften the shallots in 1 1/2 oz butter. Stir in the diced potato,
add  1/2 tsp salt and some pepper. Cover and sweat for 15 minutes, stirring
thoroughly after the first five minutes. Pour on the hot fish stock, stir,
cover and simmer for 10 minutes or until the potatoes are soft. Puree the
contents of the pan and sieve it into a clean pan.
Separate the white scallop meat from the corals. Dice the white meat and put
it in a pan with the cold milk and a generous pinch of salt. Bring to a bare
simmer and cook for a couple of minutes, then whisk the contents of the pan
into the potato puree. Bring back to a simmer, adjust seasoning and remove
the pan from the heat.
Beat the egg yolks into the cream, add a ladleful of the soup, then another,
then stir the liaison into the pan. Return the pan to the heat and warm
through without boiling.
Just before serving, melt the remaining  1/2 oz butter and gently saute the
scallop corals, either whole, halved or chopped. Pour the soup into warmed
bowls and garnish with the coral and chives.
RED PEPPER SOUP WITH MUSSELS (Allen's recipe. Serves 4)
Ingredients: 2 lb mussels; 4 large red peppers, deseeded; 12 medium-large
garlic cloves, peeled; 2 tablespoons olive oil.
Method: Clean the mussels and put them into a cast-iron casserole to stew,
covered, in their own juices for 15 minutes. In another pan, soften the
chopped peppers and sliced garlic in the olive oil, stirring occasionally to
make sure they do not brown.
After 10-15 minutes, pour on the mussel juices and simmer the peppers and
garlic in them for about another 15 minutes, adding 1 1/2 pt water and 1
teaspoon sea salt as soon as the peppers and garlic have begun to absorb the
mussel juices.
Keep the mussels warm in their shells by leaving the lid firmly on the
casserole in which they were cooked. Liquidise the soup either before or
after you shell the mussels into it, or eat them separately.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Sport: An Olympian who is playing for more than a pile of
gold - Olympics Keith Wheatley meets sports power-broker Craig Reedie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMETHING strange is happening around Manchester. Craig Reedie, the new head
of the British Olympic Association, has been repeatedly caught in full vocal
and physical support of the odd notion that Britain, and this northern city
in particular, should host the Olympic Games in 2000. He is well aware that
such muscular advocacy is hardly the recent heritage of the BOA.
'I was always more committed to the Manchester bid than my predecessors,'
says the chatty Scotsman who became chairman last autumn. His election was a
signal to the sporting world that the BOA intended to punch its weight and
cease being just a quadrennial umbrella for sporting toffs.
Reedie has ended Britain's carping isolation from the International Olympic
Committee's base in Lausanne. Juan Antonio Samaranch, the IOC's autocratic
but effective head, no longer has cause to feel that Britain is a sniper's
base for those who lament the involvement of the Olympics in big money and
big business.
'One might not like everything about it but you're either on the train or
off it, and I intend that Britain stays on it,' says Reedie, 58, a partner
in a Renfrewshire pensions consultancy.
He is a consummate sports politician, with a lifetime of international
contacts garnered in the service of the international badminton federation
(he was no mean competitor and as a golfer plays off a one handicap).
Recently, the Princess Royal paid a private visit to Manchester in her
capacity as BOA president and an active supporter of the 2000 bid. She is
notoriously not the easiest of companions, but she was in chatty good humour
as she bantered with Reedie on a coach ride through the various Manchester
building sites that may become venues.
The Princess is one of the 92 IOC members who will vote in Monaco on
September 23 on the city to hold the millennium Games. Few know this quirky,
independent and idiosyncratic electorate as well as the Princess and Reedie.
Their joint analysis of what the IOC wants from a candidate city is proving
invaluable to Manchester's indefatigable bid chairman Bob Scott. What, for
example, is likely to be the extent of any moral opposition to the Beijing
bid, currently seen as favourite to win?
'You can gauge the IOC's stance on human rights and moral nuance pretty
accurately by the fact that over half of them attended the Asian Games in
Beijing, less than a year after Tiananmen Square,' predicts Reedie. 'I just
don't think it will be an issue.'
If it isn't, that will notbe the fault of the other front-running candidate,
Sydney. Phrases such as 'mopping up the blood of the massacred with the
Olympic flag,' have been heard from the Australian bid chairman. 'It's a
startling phrase but I wouldn't want you to hear it from my lips,' said
Scott.
Worries that the British bid would founder if it were seen as the Bob Scott
roadshow - certainly a weakness of the 1996 bid - have been assuaged by the
arrival of Reedie. The third member of the new 'Bob 'n' Craig 'n' John'
triumvirate is even more powerful if only because he holds the nation's
cheque book.
Since mid-1992, John Major, the prime minister, has become a central player
in the Manchester bid. Wednesday's Downing Street news conference announced
a total of Pounds 75m towards stadia and infrastructure. This represents,
according to the Department of the Environment's Jeff Jacobs 'by far the
biggest single city urban regeneration package Britain has ever seen'.
Major has done far more than simply order the Treasury to pay up. He visited
the Barcelona Olympics, showing an unprecedented interest in sport for a
British prime minister. Next month he goes to Lausanne to spend two days
with Samaranch at whose court Major's name is spoken with increasing warmth.
Samaranch, according to Reedie, has told intimates that a British
government-backed bid is a serious play. Margaret Thatcher never more than
tolerated Scott and his audacious plans.
An even bigger coup would be to have the 'Bob 'n' Craig 'n' John' show make
the final presentation to the IOC election meeting in September. No one is
discounting the likelihood of that. After the magic of Barcelona and the
oomph it gave to the entire Spanish-speaking world, it would be a brave
Prime Minister who did not attempt to break the gloom of the recession by
trying to bring the Olympic circus to Britain.
This involvement of Downing Street could have even bigger and more tangible
pay-offs for Reedie and British sport in general. The Olympic bid is an
interesting long shot that may, or may not, come off.
What is certain is the desperate need for structural reform within the
grant-receiving bureaucracy of British sport. Hands up those who comprehend
the different roles of the Sports Council (in all its regional and
sub-national guises) and the Central Council for Physical Recreation,
umbrella of the governing bodies. Their powers overlap and this has caused
endless confusion, even among sports officials, and bitter battles. Reedie
has long been impatient for change and he has now got his vehicle alongside
the politician who could provide it. As a self-professed sports fanatic,
Major's eyes will not glaze over when the subject comes up.
'We are the only independently funded body among the ones you're discussing
and it can be an advantage when one gets into these sorts of debates about
long-term structure,' says Reedie.
In each Olympic cycle the BOA goes out and raises its own funds in a strong,
businesslike way. It has bred a sturdy culture distinct from the hand-out
dependent operations of the Sports Council and the CCPR.
Of course, budgets of the size wielded by the Sports Council - approaching
Pounds 200m a year - are quite different from the Pounds 5m or so the BOA
spends in an Olympic year. Nevertheless, with the national lottery about to
start disgorging huge sums for sport, Whitehall is known to be looking
around for new role models.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Rugby Union: Awkward Norster puts his expertise on the line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LION-HEARTED defence by Wales in their Five Nations rugby union victory
over England two weeks ago has overshadowed one important aspect of the
game. The Welsh line-out work was superb. A supposed weakness was turned
into a strength.
This was a surprise, to put it mildly. Not long ago, Wales won only two
line-outs in an entire game against Australia, prompting one journalist to
write: ' . . . in the first half Wales won a line-out and in the
second-half, just to prove it was no fluke, they won another.'
The improvement is due mainly to Robert Norster, the Welsh team manager who
was one of the most effective line-out forwards in Europe during the 1980s.
He was awkward and thoughtful, determined and courageous, and these
characteristics helped him overcome a lack of inches. He is 6ft 5in and Wade
Dooley, England's big lock, is 6ft 8in - yet, in their meetings, it was
always Norster who came off better. Now he is passing on to his team what he
learned then.
The key to Norster's success as a player, and Wales' line-out performance
against England, is attention to detail. 'The line-out is a team
performance,' he says. 'It is not just about who jumps highest. You need a
bit of skill, accuracy and team-work. You have to work as a team, and we
did. I am happy to say that we won more than 80 per cent of our own ball
against England.'
There is much preparation before Wales play an international these days. The
technical department of the Welsh Rugby Union records each of their team's
games and those of future opponents. (A camera will be at Lansdowne Road in
Dublin this afternoon filming Ireland against France, to help Wales prepare
for their remaining matches in the Five Nations championship). Then,
sections of each match are compiled and sent to the players concerned.
Before the England game, the Welsh line-out forwards were sent clips of
England's line-out performances against Canada, South Africa and France
earlier this season. Then, at practice, Norster urged them constantly to try
new techniques and refine old ones.
He stressed variety and surprise. He made them rehearse their line-out
calls, routines and support systems. The result was that Gareth Llewellyn,
the big Neath lock, had his best game yet in the line-out for Wales and
fellow-lock Tony Copsey turned in a good performance, too.
It was typical Norster, who says self-mockingly: 'Even my friends would say
I am a bit over-regimented.' Derek Quinnell, the former British Lion who now
manages the Wales A team, adds: 'As a second-row forward, Bob was forever
organising people around him so that he could give of his best. He would
analyse his opponents and work out how best to counter them.
'He would sometimes make his opponents move forward to compete with him for
a ball, and sometimes make them go back. His style was to stand out of the
line-out and leap into it. He was very agile for a big man, spring-heeled, a
genuine leaper.'
Norster grew up in a hard school. Born in Ebbw Vale in 1957, his first rugby
experiences were with Abertillery; and he joined the famous Cardiff club in
1978, the year after he became a member of the Welsh national squad. Norster
did for his country in the '80s what another Lion, Delme Thomas, had done in
the '60s and '70s. Both won priceless line-out ball, often against bigger
and stronger men. In theory, neither was quite tall enough; but they made up
in technique what they lacked in physique. Both recorded outstanding Sargent
jumps, the method used to measure a standing jump.
As he developed, Norster acquired an uncompromising hardness. He needed it
in New Zealand when he played in two Tests for the Lions in 1983, and again
in one Test against Australia's Wallabies in 1989, as well as in 34
internationals for Wales between 1982 and 1989. He needed it, too, when
Wales beat England in the 1987 World Cup and, against the odds, at
Twickenham in 1988 - after which England coach Roger Uttley said ruefully:
'A player like Norster will always give you trouble.'
Most of all, Norster needed his hard-nosed attitude against Ireland in
Dublin in 1988 when chasing the Triple Crown (victories against all three
home countries in the Five Nations championship). Wales were up against it
and so was Norster, who had trapped a shoulder nerve after catching a
line-out ball and was in constant pain. Yet, he turned in a performance of
such courage that Stephen Jones was moved to write in the Sunday Times that,
in the second half, 'Norster grabbed hold of Wales and simply flung them at
the Triple Crown.' Wales won 12-9, sneaking home in the dying minutes, and
went on to win the Crown.
Even in rugby union's new professional atmosphere, it might surprise many to
learn that the Welsh players are backed up by their coaching staff, a
selection committee and selection adviser, two doctors, two
physiotherapists, a fitness adviser, a sports scientist, a match analyst and
a dietician. But it all tallies with Norster's philosophy. 'Attention to
detail has always been, and always will remain, an essential ingredient in
our preparation,' he wrote in the programme notes for the Wales v England
game.
At Murrayfield in Edinburgh this afternoon, we will see what ploys Norster
has thought up when Wales face the strong line-out threat posed by the
Scots. But you can be sure of one thing: like Baden Powell and the Scouts,
Norster will be prepared.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Soccer: Last amateurs keep faith in empty temple
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL MATHESON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'MAYBE IT'S an old-fashioned ideal,' says Martin Smith, chairman of Glasgow
club Queen's Park, 'but I believe that money should not be part of sport.
Football should not be about buying your way to success but about bringing
up your own players and making the most of their effort and ability.'
Queen's Park, nicknamed the Spiders, are Scotland's oldest and most
traditional side. Smith readily admits that they are 'a bit of a strange
entity.'
Queen's Park, who own Scotland's huge national stadium Hampden Park, are the
only truly amateur team playing in a senior, professional league anywhere.
This season's lavish 125th birthday celebrations have been held as the club
bumps along the bottom of the Scottish second division. There is no
relegation from the division but the position is galling for a team that
started at the top.
The Spiders, founded in 1867, were once kings of Scottish soccer. They
supplied the entire home team for the first Scotland v England international
in 1872. In 1884 and 1885 they were finalists in the FA Cup in England and
once went seven years without conceding a goal.
The more commercial soccer has become, the more Queen's Park have fallen
behind. In the last 50 years, they have failed to supply a single senior
Scottish international player but former Queen's Parkers include managers
Andy Roxburgh, Alex Ferguson, Bobby Brown and Ian McColl.
Hampden Park, which the club built in 1903, is not only an impressive status
symbol for a second division team but also a guarantee that Queen's Park
will stay afloat.
The club sub-lets the ground to Scottish soccer's ruling bodies for
internationals and cup matches and the income, 20 to 25 per cent of net gate
receipts, ensures that upkeep costs (Pounds 500,000 but likely to rise) can
be met. Last year, work started on a Pounds 12m programme - paid for mainly
by the Scottish Football Association, the Scottish Football League and the
Football Trust - to turn Hampden into an all-seater, Taylored stadium with a
45,000 capacity. This is due to be finished in April 1994.
International games have been transferred across the city to Ibrox, but the
building work does not impinge on second division games, when an average
crowd of about 600 finds itself sprinkled round the ageing South Stand. The
mood is low-key, except when the Tannoy (designed for 100,000) blares,
shaking the fans in their seats. The famous Hampden Roar is down to a
whisper.
Behind the scenes, the Queen's Park ethos is equality. The players are not
employees, many are club members, technically 'shareholders', entitled to
vote at the AGM. The boardroom is no launchpad for the personal power of the
moneyed and ambitious. Even the chairman is democratically elected.
The Spiders remain sticklers for tradition. They play in a '60s-style strip
with black and white hooped jerseys rather than the computer-generated
polyesters favoured by opponents. Queen's Park players must wear shirts
outside shorts in spite of a FIFA ruling to the contrary.
The Corinthian spirit was always a privilege of the upper classes and so it
used to be at Hampden. Queen's Park were the Gentlemen's Team. Smith, a
lawyer, says: '50 years ago, if you were from the professions, as most of
them were, it would have been frowned upon to accept money to play football.
Just wasn't the done thing.'
Coach and ex-player Eddie Hunter - a man famous for claiming that seeing
Queen's Park score is better than making love - has been with the club for
34 years. He used to go to training in his overalls after a day's work as a
plumber and step into a dressing room full of men in pinstripes.
'When I came to the club as a youngster in the late '50s, it was very much
bowler hat and brolly and I didn't feel part of that.
'But the barriers have come down. We now have players from across the whole
spectrum, university people, bankers, lawyers, labourers, the unemployed. It
used to be them and us but Martin Smith has brought the club into the '90s.'
It has been more difficult to bring team performance up to date. Smith says
the problems of finding good players have grown. 'It used to be football,
football, football here in the west of Scotland but now people have other
things to do. We run five teams but every year it becomes harder to find
players of good enough quality to play.
'Professional clubs now sign players at 13 and 14, so it often follows that
if you find a boy of 19 who is still amateur it's because he was never good
enough in the first place.'
Queen's Park's rigorous interpretation of amateur status is perhaps their
greatest handicap.
Not only must their players be amateur but they must never at any time have
accepted money for playing football. Thus the boy, who signs for Aberdeen at
16 and does not make it, and who then becomes a reinstated amateur, no
longer qualifies.
There is talk among members that the club should look at the rules again.
Graeme Elder, club captain for six years, says: 'The club has become a
staging post for people turning pro. Players have been moving on too
quickly, for their good and for ours.'
But he adds: 'Queen's Park's is a happy dressing room. There's not the same
bickering and back-stabbing that you get elsewhere. Players I know that have
moved on to other clubs become disillusioned. They soon discover that
professional football is a dirty, dirty game.
'The way things are here, everyone is in it for the good of the club. If you
make a mistake in a professional team, you could be losing your mates a win
bonus. Here the slate is wiped clean after a game. Money isn't a pressure.'

FT  20 FEB 93 / Country Notes: Walks with stray dogs and roe deer:
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE THERE are several good reasons I do not have a dog, from time to time
a passing pooch will try to rectify this by adopting me. Pleasant though
this can be, there have been times when the consequences have been
embarrassing.
On one occasion, a farm dog left his post to accompany me on a walk to the
beach, losing interest only when he discovered a family picnicking. He leapt
with enthusiasm into the middle of their carefully-laid meal.
As they drove the animal away and I fled, I could hear loud and angry
protests to the effect that owners who could not control their charges
should not be allowed to keep dogs.
Sometimes, though, the results have been more positive. When a perky little
terrier joined me for a walk one June, I welcomed his cheerful presence as
he ferreted through the undergrowth and returned to me, grinning, from time
to time. We climbed through a local wood and into an area of scrubby gorse,
where he disappeared.
A couple of minutes later, there was a commotion accompanied by frantic
barks. I was about to creep away when the dog emerged, pursued by a
determined female roe deer.
I helped her to drive away the dog but she hung around, peeping out from
behind various bushes. After searching for a few moments, I discovered why:
a tiny, spotted kid, still too young to forage, lying motionless but
unharmed at the base of a gorse clump.
The roe is a surprisingly small deer and, with its glossy chestnut summer
coat, can often resemble a red setter at a distance. Certainly, it is an
animal skilled at hiding in the sparsest of cover.
Badger-watching one evening, I remember seeing a roe rise suddenly from a
tiny patch of stinging nettles between me and the sett. It looked around,
sniffed the air and wandered slowly into the woods, nibbling a bit of
bramble here and there.
The reference books generally portray roe as solitary deer, meaning that, in
Britain, they do not form herds. In the summer months, it is often the case
that a female will be accompanied by her kid or kids (for they often have
twins), and she could have a buck in attendance, too.
In winter, roe will be seen feeding in groups at a good food source but, if
disturbed, they tend to scatter and flee rather than bunch up and stay
together, as herd deer will. In areas where they become numerous, their
paths are well worn and marked by their slots, or hoof prints.
Roe deer appear to be spreading. At present, they are common throughout most
of Scotland and the north of England. Further south they occupy much of the
area between London and Cornwall and parts of East Anglia.
According to the Handbook of British Mammals, they are spreading northwards
into Gloucestershire and westwards into the Midlands from these strongholds.
And although absent previously from Wales, roe deer have been recorded
recently around Llandrindod Wells; one wonders how they have popped up in
such a central area of the country without previous detection.
Their spread will be greeted with delight by many who enjoy glimpsing these
graceful little animals during walks in the country. And if the nesting
habits of our local blue and great tits are anything to go by, there will
rejoicing in that direction, too.
Roe deer moult just as these birds are building their nests, and every one I
find contains numerous roe hairs gleaned by the builders from the tufts shed
on the woodland floor while the deer are sleeping.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Minding Your Own Business: A classic strategy - The
publisher which revived Everyman's Library
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOVE A pornographic magazine shop in London's Soho, one of the most
startling publishing stories of recent years has unfolded, to the surprise
of the publishing establishment.
Three men have spent little more than two years resurrecting the nearly
defunct Everyman series of hardback classics. In the process they have
created a substantial market in the US, introduced the newly-designed tomes
into almost every good bookshop in the uk and, from scratch, sold 750,000
volumes in spite of the worst retail conditions for 20 years.
In the first nine months of trading, David Campbell Publishers, new owners
of the Everyman's Library with its hard back rights to 1,200 titles, racked
up a turnover of Pounds 2.4m. It surprised itself by making a pre-tax
profit, one of Pounds 120,000. For the current year to July, the tiny
company is on course to make Pounds 500,000 pre-tax on sales of Pounds 3.9m.
'Everyman, I will go with thee and be thy guide' is scrolled into every one
of the 60m books published in Everyman's Library since production started in
1906. The problem was that the company lost its guide some time in the
1940s. In spite of owning rights to a vast range of works from translations
of Aristotle to Conrad and Dickens, the company fell into decline. During
the 1980s it changed hands twice, ending up in the Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson
stable and with a yearly turnover of only a few hundred thousand pounds.
'I had been tracking it for a long time,' says David Campbell, who was then
a senior manager at the Hachette publishing company in France. 'I could
never understand why there was no hardback series of the world's greatest
books in English. There is even one in Norwegian for goodness sake] Everyman
was a great brand name and brand names are very rare in publishing. It was
also a good business idea.'
That idea was to produce high quality hardbacks, cloth bound rather than
glued and with acid free paper that would not brown. 'I thought that if we
could produce such books for only a few pounds more than a paper back we'd
have a market.' The target was the gift trade and readers who wanted
affordable books in 'permanent' form.
Campbell spent three years trying to raise the cash. In 1990, the venture
capital arm of merchant bank Robert Fleming provided capital of more than
Pounds 1m to cover the (much lower cost) purchase price and working capital.
For this the bank obtained a quarter stake in the new company. The bulk of
the shareholding is held by Campbell, Mark Bicknell, a 38-year-old former
investment banker, and Alewyn Birch, a man with a long career in publishing.
Campbell and Bicknell, who run the company, together put in a little over
Pounds 100,000.
'That's enough to hurt but not to take the roof away,' says Bicknell.
After the purchase it took a year to get the business running. Some of this
time was taken signing up a printer - Bertelsmann of Germany which produces
all the new Everyman books (retailing at Pounds 7 to Pounds 16 and averaging
Pounds 10) - and Random House, the US publishers, which handles all
marketing and distribution.
'You can be well managed, inventive and quick on your feet but no matter how
clever you are you need firepower and small companies don't have firepower,'
says Campbell.
'We were very fortunate that the US deal provides up front cash flow,' says
Bicknell. 'That gave enormous comfort to our printers.' On each print run
the little company is paid in advance about one third of what it is
eventually due.
David Campbell Publishers operates with small overheads, paying Pounds
18,000 a year for a three storey office in Soho and employing just four full
time staff. Currency movements have made a large contribution to profits.
The rise of the D-mark against the pound has not been beneficial but the
strengthening of the dollar has generated a windfall.
'We bought the company when it was Dollars 1.60 to the Pounds 1,' says
Bicknell. 'It then went to Dollars 1.90 and is now down to just over Dollars
1.40. If it had stayed at Dollars 1.90 making a profit would have proved
very difficult. We are making a margin of 5 per cent and currency movements
could wipe that out. I spend an hour a day talking to foreign exchange
dealers.'
The company's success nevertheless reflects its publishing nous. Of the 128
titles so far printed, 40 were not in the Everyman stable.
'Of the 1,200 titles we could plunder a good quarter we would not want to
publish,' says Campbell. Not surprising perhaps when they include
obscurities such as F W Robertson's Sermons on Christian Doctrine or The
Channings by Mrs Henry Wood. Instead Cambell has been buying hardback
reprint rights to 20th-century authors outside the Everyman stable,
including Orwell and Hemingway.
The company has also launched a series of children's books. 'I thought there
was a market for proper reading books with nice illustrations.' Alice in
Wonderland in smart, heavy duty binding sells for Pounds 7. Treasure Island
comes with drawings by Mervyn Peake.
The company has relaunched and repackaged a publication called Your
Birthday, 80 pages of historical events and famous birthdays - now being
published by W H Smith. Everyman hopes the little books, retailing at Pounds
3, will prove a cash cow. The company has also acquired the English language
rights to a new travel series by a French publishing house, the books
containing up to 2,000 illustrations in seven colours.
One trend that has helped is a readership swing towards the classics. 'I
think one reason is that there are 125,000 new titles in the English
language every year and that is far too many. Booksellers are all clogged up
and the man on the Clapham omnibus doesn't know what to take.'
One consequence is what has been termed the classics wars. Other publishers
are churning out volumes at a rapid rate of knots though all of these, from
Penguin to World Classics and Oxford are in paperback. One publisher,
Wordsworth, sells its paperback classics for Pounds 1.
Some in the publishing industry who thought Campbell was mad to buy Everyman
think Campbell could catch a cold from these new low-cost books. He
dismisses the suggestion. 'We have no competition. Wordsworth will hurt
Penguin. The more razzamataz in the market for classics the better.'

FT  20 FEB 93 / As They Say in Europe: Power to the people - a heated debate
/ France's generation gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOOKING out at Germany from an aeroplane as I did on Tuesday I was struck by
its size - a mere two-thirds that of France with some 20m more people. It
has borders with nine other countries. No wonder things get a bit heated
down there.
This reflection was provoked by the memory that it was three years to the
day that I had attended a somewhat tense event which confirmed to me that
the removal of the Berlin Wall was not going to do much good.
In February 1990, I went to a student meeting that turned rowdy in what was
still East Berlin to listen to lectures on the 'social market economy'. The
West German government had shipped in lavish pamphlets and politicians whose
job it was to demonstrate the delights that awaited the hitherto luckless
locals. It would take six months or a year to get things right, people would
fall into the new jobs in the service sector and with their high wages and
new deutschemarks at one-to-one, the old GDR would boom. The students
rightly did not believe it.
A couple of months later my employers arranged a seminar on the new Germany
where I said the whole thing would be a complete bust and eastern Germany
would be a burden to the west, and everybody else, until about 2010.
I mention this not because it demonstrates any great forecasting gifts, but
because it was obvious to anybody who spent a few days in the country asking
people how it worked and finding out that it did not. At the Lindenhof
restaurant on Leninstrasse in the Calcutta-style industrial centre of
Bitterfeld I asked for a menu at one o'clock and the waitress said, 'Not
now. We're having our lunch.'
Sitting above Europe at this moment I thought I would have a look at the
shape of another ghastly thing to come.
In Britain there has been a huge public debate on energy policy. This has
touched on the question of French nuclear power which is cheap and when
imported into Britain leads to the closure of coalmines. But one interesting
thing that emerged from the privatisation of power generation in Britain was
that it was impossible to sell nuclear plants to investors because the
discounted costs of owning a nuclear plant were greater than the income to
be derived from them. In other words, nuclear power is uneconomic and the
plants are worthless because of the decommissioning costs.
So today Britain has to subsidise its nuclear power in order to sell any.
Since there is such a subsidy to domestic supplies, it has to be granted to
already cheap French power as well - European Community rules permit no
discrimination. (The consequent closure of British coalmines is deplored by
large numbers of worthy people who only six months before were demanding
that the British government take the initiative at the Rio Summit on the
environment by demanding the elimination of greenhouse gasses. Such are the
penalties of living in a country where public policy debate is ubiquitous,
unceasing and uninformed.)
No energy economist has explained to the British public why it is that their
nuclear power is too expensive while the French is too cheap. The answer
could provide the clue to the next European economic disaster.
France relies on nuclear plants for three-quarters of its power generation.
This has happened because France is the one working command economy the
world has seen. It is organised by graduates of the so-called grandes
ecoles. They are brilliant, they possess technical skills of the highest
order, they think the same way and they control almost everything. It may
sound like a recipe for disaster but the system has worked wonders. Nemesis
may emerge in the nuclear power industry where, I assume, electricity is
produced cheaply because decommissioning costs have not been included in the
price structure.
The 80-odd nuclear power stations were built by Electricite de France on
borrowed money. The debt stands at FFr195bn (More than Pounds 24bn). The
worry is not that there will be a Chernobyl, but that there will be a rumour
of one, or something will go a little bit wrong. That would cause hysterics
in Germany or Switzerland and even make some Frenchmen doubt the perfection
of the original choice.
If that happens many will wonder about EdeF debt, which is backed by the
state, and think seriously about an investment that cost zillions and might
have to be decommissioned and replaced at a cost of tens of zillions. There
will be meltdown problem, not nuclear but financial.
Maybe there is a simple answer as to why the economics of the French nuclear
power industry are totally different from those of the British but nobody
has told me. I tried on several occasions to talk to someone at EdeF about
this but nobody answered the phone.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: All the news fit to hear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HARRY HOPKINS

<TEXT>
THE VOICE from my bedside radio informed me: 'Wedding-related stocks seem
likely to rise.' It was 5.45 am and the report came from Tokyo, where the
engagement of Japan's crown prince had just been announced. I had discovered
Dawn Traders, the 5.30-6 am weekday financial news programme on the London
radio station LBC.
There followed, in an intriguing variety of accents, the latest market
reports direct from Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia - with footnotes on the
'Kiwi dollar' - New York and, in a suitably sepulchral voice, the latest on
crude oil stocks and the prospects for the oil price from Chicago.
Not so long ago, business and financial programmes were rare on the air.
Now, they stream from our television and radio sets round the clock,
offering much of value to the alert private investor.
Hard on the heels of Dawn Traders now comes BBC1's substantial and
wide-ranging Business Breakfast. A recent report on America's way offshore
island Puerto Rico, the 'pharmaceutical capital of the world,' was a
revelation.
An earlier programme illustrated sharply the problems the European common
market may bring to at least some branches of British industry by
interviewing a veteran Midlands flower-grower, obliged to turn to
poinsettias (because they do not travel well) while his Dutch competitors'
flower-laden lorries were radiating all over Europe.
The advantage of television is that it offers the big close-up. Investors
who prefer the testimony of eyes and lips to faceless statistical
'indicators' will welcome the programme's Tamworth Barometer in which
manufacturers, retailers and others from this sample town in Staffordshire
are interviewed in situ on how things are going.
No sooner have the last crumbs of the Business Breakfast been swept away
than, for Greater Londoners, LBC is back shortly after 8 with the first
company results and market indexes of the day, repeated at hourly intervals
with the odd 'share on the move' and the prices of what they call 'the top
20' at 9.30 am and 4.30 pm. This leads to a round-up of the day around 6.35
pm.
Listeners to BBC Radio Four, presumably excused Dawn Traders, have to wait
for their 15-minute Financial World Tonight until the advanced hour of 9.45.
The most useful feature of these evening round-ups is that, quite often,
company chairmen or directors offer themselves for cross-examination when
their annual results are announced.
The questions are more pointed than at most AGMs and, in the intimacy of the
studio, the voice gives away more than it says. You can pick out the men
committed to their jobs. The enthusiasm of Whitbread's chief executive over
the brewer's catering innovations was obvious in an LBC interview.
On Financial World Tonight, shareholders in Airtours or Owners Abroad were
able to hear both Airtours' chairman, David Crossland, and the retired
package holiday champion, Harry Goodman, on the very eve of the bid that
made so many headlines. Goodman pronounced the deal 'dangerous' for
competition but said he admired Crossland for making it and would have done
the same.
Sunday has long been the day for BBC TV's old flagship, the Money Programme:
40 minutes, two or three topical items, and an economist talking head.
Investors in locomotive engineers and train-makers no doubt took note
recently when, in a report on privatisation plans for British Rail, they
learned - from the horse's mouth - that these could well kill train
manufacturing in the UK.
ITV's rival Sunday City programme was scuppered by the management. But
Channel 4 has produced a worthy Sunday rival in High Interest: 45 minutes
devoted to a single subject, which gives great advantages in
comprehensiveness and quality. A recent programme on the big three
supermarket companies - Sainsbury's, Safeway and Tesco - amounted to a
managerial seminar on this massive and central industry.
Chairman David Sainsbury, standing in one of his supermarkets, explained
frankly their shadow-boxing techniques. 'We watch each other like hawks, and
the speed of response is such that no one is very much out of line.'
But although he told us that market saturation would not come before the end
of the century, the plans of the three giants seemed relentless and it was
not difficult to agree with the analyst who warned that now was not the time
to buy supermarket shares.
The week that opens with Dawn Traders ends at 11.25 on Friday nights with
Radio Four's The Financial Week in which Heather Paton, rising high above
the market chatter, coolly consults two or three or four economists,
analysts, bankers or financial journalists (they are always
'distinguished').
This is a programme that should carry a mental health warning. The private
investor who over-indulges in it might never again be able to make any
decision on whether to buy or sell.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: CGT allowances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TABLE shows capital gains tax (CGT) allowances for assets sold in
January. To use it, multiply the original cost of the asset for the figure
shown for the month in which you bought it.
If you subtract the result from the proceeds of your sale, the result will
be your taxable gain or loss.
Suppose that you bought some shares for Pounds 7,000 in February 1983 and
sold them in January 1993 for Pounds 17,000. Multiplying the original cost
by the February 1983 figure of 1.662 gives a total of Pounds 11,634.
Subtracting that from the proceeds of Pounds 17,000 gives a capital gain of
Pounds 5,366, which is below the 1992-93 CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800. If
you realised no other gains during the year, the profits should be tax-free.
If you sell shares bought before April 6 1982, you should use the March 1982
figure. The RPI in January was 137.9.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Beware of the IHT trap when selling
your home - You can end up paying tax at 40 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE GARNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOUR HOME might be special to you and your family but that does not make it
exempt from inheritance tax. And although the excitement has gone out of the
housing market, you might still need to consider what, if anything, can be
done to mitigate this swingeing levy.
The first thing is to add up your net worth. If it is below Pounds 150,000
and you have not made substantial gifts within the previous seven years,
your estate is likely to escape IHT. But if it is worth more than Pounds
150,000 when you die, IHT at 40 per cent must be paid on the excess.
The next thing to consider is whether you mind paying this. There is an
exemption for gifts between husband and wife, so IHT need be paid only when
the surviving spouse dies. And there are many who prefer not to leave
substantial sums to their children for fear of spoiling them; thus, they
accept paying whatever tax is due.
The third thing to appreciate is that in order to mitigate IHT there will,
at some time, need to be co-owners. Whereas co-ownership between husband and
wife does not usually cause problems, the same is not true where the
ownership is split between parent and child.
If, say, a parent wanted to move to a smaller house and sell the property,
the child might insist on being paid his share - in which case, the parent
could be left with too little money to re-invest in another property. There
is also the risk of the child's interest being brought into account if he
gets divorced or made bankrupt.
IHT, however, is not payable only when you die. It is also chargeable on
substantial gifts made within seven years of your death, and on all assets
which you no longer own but continue to enjoy. Suppose you give your house,
worth Pounds 300,000, to your two children and continue to live there. When
you die, its value will be added to your estate and IHT charged on it.
If your children sell the house after your death, they will have to pay
capital gains tax on any increase in the property's value since you gave it
to them (assuming the house is not their main or only residence). Your tax
planning will, therefore, result in an increase in the total payable rather
than a saving.
Just because you can be taxed on gifts you continue to enjoy does not mean
you cannot save tax on your home. But the schemes under which you can do so
are complicated.
If, for instance, you are fairly certain that you will not live as long as
your spouse, you can create a will trust giving them a revocable life
interest. When you die, the trustees then exercise their power of revocation
over 90 per cent of the value of your house in favour of your children.
In this way, it is possible to save IHT and CGT - so long as your spouse
survives you by seven years and continues to use the house as a main or only
residence.
The only drawback here is that the spouse cannot be a trustee and might
object to having so little control over the family home after your death.
You could also find that the trustees want indemnities from the children if
the surviving spouse is not to be charged rent for occupying the 90 per cent
owned by the trustees on their behalf.
If you have children but do not have a spouse (for whatever reason), solving
the problem of IHT on your main and only residence is a little more
complicated.
It is possible to carve out a lease for yourself on the property and give
away your remaining rights in it to the children as a reversion - subject to
the lease. It would be structured so that its value would fall within the
IHT nil rate band (up to Pounds 150,000); thus, no tax would be due when you
die.
In the meantime, the longer you survived, the more the value of the
reversion would increase. Although theoretically straightforward, this
scheme has difficulties. One is that the gift of the reversion could be
taxed if you died within seven years.
It is not possible to grant a lease to yourself without an elaborate legal
structure; but even if you do, beware of falling into the tempting trap of
granting yourself such a lease for life - a move that would bring the value
of the property back into your estate.
This means you must have a fixed term, which raises the problems of either
outliving your lease or dying too soon. All these and other difficulties are
not insurmountable, but this scheme is not for the faint-hearted nor the
foolish.
There are other ways to mitigate IHT on your main or only residence, but I
know of none that is either straightforward or certain because of the
complexity of IHT and CGT laws. Thus, many people decline to carry out any
IHT mitigation scheme using their own home unless enough tax is at stake to
make it worthwhile taking good advice to steer them through the
complications.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Ombudsman faces battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISCORD between the insurance companies and Dr Julian Farrand, the ombudsman
they sponsor - voluntarily - is expected to increase on Tuesday when he
releases his latest annual report. For the first time in the 12 years of the
scheme, the report has not been submitted for comment, and possible
amendment, to the board of insurance company delegates which determines
financing of the ombudsman's bureau.
Farrand said this week he had dispensed with this consultation, and had also
given the council of consumer representatives less time to mull over the
draft, so that publication could be brought forward by about a month.
He declined to discuss the contents but the publication notice from the
bureau sets out particular issues examined, with 'Questions over his
Jurisdiction' heading the list. Almost certainly, this relates partly to a
dispute over Farrand's authority to handle complaints about home income
plans.
Last year, bureau spokesman Peter Tyldesley revealed that one insurance
company had rejected Farrand's matter-of-form request for permission to
review a home income plan case. Tyldesley said at the time that this would
not stop the ombudsman dealing with it. Since the new year, however, lawyers
engaged on home income plan cases say a company has sought counsel's opinion
on whether the ombudsman has the power to deal with these.
The company is now believed to be thinking of sueing him, having apparently
received backing from counsel for its view that the ombudsman has no
jurisdiction over mortgages and, therefore, none over the
mortgage/investment bond package making up a home income plan.
While the ombudsman is on record as conceding that he has no jurisdiction
over mortgages, he has always maintained that if the tied agent of an
insurance company is selling an investment closely wrapped up with a
mortgage, the company should be responsible for all of it.
This is not the first time Farrand has clashed with companies. In an article
written last year for the insurance trade publication Post Magazine, he
quoted extracts from letters written by sore losers.
One unnamed company accused him repeatedly of unfairness, writing: 'I have
received your letter of . . . I will not thank you for this as it merely
reinforces my view that you seem determined to treat us unfairly on this
case . . .'
Coinciding with this latest probable conflict between Farrand and at least
one member company is a change in the chairmanship of the board of insurance
company delegates. Tom Roberts, who retired from General Accident at the end
of 1992, will continue as chairman until June. But the person originally
identified as his successor has withdrawn, according to board secretary
Michael Briggs.
Briggs said that the candidate's withdrawal was due to an unexpectedly heavy
workload, and stressed there was no question of any potential conflict with
the ombudsman.
He added that possible disputes between a company and the ombudsman would
not affect considerations on who should become chairman. 'It would be the
person who would be nominated, not the company,' he said.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: IHT and paperwork
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME WEEKS ago, you printed a letter from an elderly widow headlined 'What
can I pass on?' in which she asked several questions about inheritance tax.
Could you add a footnote to your answer giving details of the documentation
needed when the annual exemptions for IHT are used? Is it in any way similar
to the declarations made for CGT?
You asked for the necessary documentation regarding annual gifts to utilise
the annual exemptions. It is normally sufficient for you to make the gifts
together with a covering letter.
For example, if you propose to make the gift utilising the Pounds 3,000
annual exemption, you should merely keep a record of the gifts you make and
the copy of the covering letter, together with the cheques.
If you wish to make use of the gifts out of income, then it is important to
show that the gift is of a regular nature and, therefore, any letter
accompanying the gift should state the facts of the case.
For example, if you are to pay an amount each year for the next four years
under a deed of covenant, then the covenant form would be evidence of the
regular nature of the payment. Alternatively, the letter should state the
regular nature if this is what is proposed.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Unhappy returns
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR SEVERAL years, I have submitted my tax return through an accountant. I
decided that as my 1992/93 return should be less complicated than previous
ones, and accountants' fees had soared, I would submit it myself.
In the past, I have always received notification of my tax code well before
the start of the next tax year. This year, though, I got no communication.
I made enquiries by phone and was told the Revenue had received my return,
it appeared all right, and my code would be unaltered. They said they could
not afford to reply to people in my situation.
Under the circumstances, do I have a right to receive official notification
of my code and, equally important, that the details of my return are in
order and have been approved?
Regulation 9 of the Income Tax (Employments) Regulations 1973, as amended,
says: 'After the inspector has determined the appropriate code for any year,
he shall, if the code so determined is different from the code for the
preceding year, give notice of his determination to the employee; provided
that no such notice need be given when the change in the code is due to an
alteration or alterations in the rates of any of the personal reliefs
allowable under section 257 or section 259 of the Income and Corporation
Taxes Act 1988 or in the tax tables, but the other matters referred-to in
regulation 7 are not different from those for the preceding year.'
You have the right to require a formal schedule E assessment to be made for
each year, by virtue of section 205(3) of the Taxes Act: ' . . . an
assessment shall be made in respect of the income of a person so assessable
for any year of assessment if the person assessable requires an assessment
to be made by notice given to the inspector within five years from the end
of the year of assessment.'
This is not a right which you should exercise without forethought: it could,
for example, provoke a demand for a modest amount of underpaid tax which
would otherwise have been written off as not justifying the expense of
making a formal assessment.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax on empty home
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY BROTHER and I own a property jointly as tenants in common. It was the
home of our mother, who lived there rent-free. She became ill and in
November 1991 had to go permanently into a nursing home.
Her furniture was sold or otherwise disposed-of, so the property has been
unfurnished since November 1991. It has been empty and for sale since that
date.
1. Community charge. Is there any liability from November 1991 until when
the community charge stops on April 1 1993? I have been informed that the
standard charge might be levied. Is this correct?
2. Council tax. Is there any liability from April 1 1993? If there is
liability, does the six-months-empty property exemption run from April 1
1993? It can hardly start running before the tax comes into being - can it?
1. Community charge. Your mother will have ceased to be subject to the
charge on going into residential care, and an adjustment will fall to be
made, either by way of refund or by payment of what was due to the date of
her ceasing to be resident at the property. You may be liable for the
balance of the year at the standard charge.
2. Council tax. You will be liable, as owners of unoccupied property, from
April 1 1993. There is no equivalent of the rating exemption for empty
property.

Scheherazade Daneshkhu investigates the mysteries of APR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORTGAGE-seekers attracted by an Abbey National advertisement on February 10
for its fixed rate of 5.99 per cent - 'our lowest fixed rate ever' - might
have wondered what an annual percentage rate (APR) figure of 8.2 per cent
was doing alongside it.
Most people tend to ignore the APR figure which banks and building societies
are obliged to quote. But it is meant to reflect the true cost of the
mortgage so that customers have a fair basis of comparison.
The mathematical calculation itself is based on a formula set out in the
Consumer Credit (Total Charge for Credit) Regulations Act 1980. It takes
into account all payments made throughout the life of the mortgage, when
they are made and includes a number of the lender's costs. For instance, the
Halifax building society's assumed charges on a Pounds 50,000 loan,
completed on April 16, include:
Valuation fee of Pounds 125.
Conveyancer's fee of Pounds 117.50, which is the legal cost to the lender of
arranging the mortgage.
Mortgage indemnity premium of Pounds 500, which is insurance protecting the
lender against losses if you were to default. Halifax charges it on loans of
more than 75 per cent of the purchase price of the property or valuation,
whichever is lower.
Mortgage discharge fee of Pounds 40 and a Pounds 15 charge for despatch of
the title deeds on repayment of the loan.
If the mortgage was a fixed or capped rate loan, its fee would also be
included.
Because these costs are included, the APR will be higher than the quoted
rate. Most lenders with a 7.99 per cent variable rate are quoting an APR of
8.5 per cent on a repayment mortgage and a slightly lower rate, 8.3 or 8.4,
on an endowment.
Abbey National has an 0.1 percentage point difference between the two types.
Abbey's Richard Bolton says this is because, 'You are paying down the loan
throughout the year with a repayment mortgage. But that is not reflected in
our calculations until the year-end, so you are implicitly being charged a
slightly higher rate of interest.'
Although APRs are meant to make life easier for the consumer, they can be
misleading because they are based on a set of assumptions about the size of
loan, the time it was taken out, the length of its term and the cost of the
charges, all of which are variable. Moreover, assumptions vary from lender
to lender. 'Our concern is the lack of clarity regarding the assumptions,'
says Michael Coogan, of the Building Societies Association. 'Some members do
one thing and some do others. No one understands what the law says.'
One thing lenders have done is to assume a fixed rate will apply throughout
a 25-year mortgage term, thereby arriving at a much lower APR. But the
trading standards department of Devon county council has been active in
prosecuting lenders for an abuse of the standards of fair trading.
Bob Imrie, from the trading standards department, says lenders now have
accepted that a fair basis on which to calculate the APR is to assume that
today's standard variable rate should apply after the fixed-rate period.
The Abbey National fixed-rate loan at 5.99 per cent lasts only until the end
of May 1994, leaving more than 23 years at the variable rate. This means the
APR on the fixed-rate mortgage is 8.2 per cent, only slightly lower than the
8.4 per cent APR which applies to an endowment mortgage taken out at Abbey's
standard rate of 7.99 per cent.
Coogan would like to see lenders follow the practice in Europe and include
the cost of a life policy - such as an endowment - in the APR figure.
When you go to a lender for a mortgage, do not be surprised if the APR
figure is not quoted. Earlier this year, branches of the National &amp;
Provincial, Barnsley, Nationwide, Alliance &amp; Leicester, Bradford &amp; Bingley,
Leeds Permanent and Halifax societies all were fined by Doncaster
magistrates for giving misleading quotations, which included either failing
to quote an APR figure or quoting an incorrect one.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: The dangers of success - Investment
Trusts / A look at the rise and rise of Fleming Claverhouse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TRUST that pays quarterly dividends, aims to invest in UK blue chip shares
and has a good long-term performance record might sound just what many
private investors are looking for. So it has proved for Fleming Claverhouse.
Private investors now own more than 60 per cent of the share capital,
compared with 27 per cent in 1985.
Its record places it second (out of eight) trusts in the UK general sector
over the 10 years to February 1, with a rise of 576.9 per cent (mid-market
to mid-market with net income reinvested, according to Micropal). Over five
years, growth has been 96.2 per cent, placing the trust third in the sector.
But there are problems associated with success. The shares now stand at a 6
per cent premium to net asset value. This means that those who buy
Claverhouse shares are, effectively, paying 106p to get 100p of assets.
There is an element of paradox about this situation. Because private
investors have been attracted to the trust, the shares have been pushed to a
premium (in short, demand for the shares exceeds supply). But whether all
those private investors appreciate the dangers associated with buying shares
at a premium is open to question.
If the premium disappears - or, worse, if the shares drop to a substantial
discount - then private investors could see the value of their holdings drop
sharply, even if the stock market is stable. But if private investors do not
realise the danger, the premium could well stay in place.
This is not, of course, a problem unique to Fleming Claverhouse. Like many
of the other trusts in the same situation, it has taken power to issue new
shares to savings plan-holders. A rights issue could be required at some
point.
Claverhouse was founded in 1963 and was named after 'Bonnie Dundee,' later
the 1st Viscount Claverhouse, who led a rebellion against William &amp; Mary in
1689 and was killed at the battle of Killiecrankie. The name was chosen
because of management group Robert Fleming's links with Dundee, where the
firm had its origins in 1873.
The trust aims to invest in blue chip shares, although this definition
includes many medium-sized companies - only 50 per cent of the portfolio is
in FT-SE 100 stocks. Claverhouse's 10 largest investments at the end of 1992
contained many names that would be familiar to the private investor: Glaxo,
British Gas, NFC, Tate &amp; Lyle, Shell, BT, East Midlands Electricity, Severn
Trent Water, Allied-Lyons and Unilever.
In terms of sectors, the portfolio includes shares in the consumer group
(38.5 per cent); financials (14.7 per cent); capital goods (10.4 per cent);
oil and gas (9 per cent); others (26.8 per cent); and investment trusts (0.6
per cent).
Claverhouse has debenture borrowings of around Pounds 15m, equal to gearing
of 18 per cent, which it took out in tranches in January 1988 and December
1990. That level of gearing leaves it exposed to downturns in the market,
and Claverhouse actually used a put option to hedge its exposure in
September 1991.
The trust has been managed for the past two years by 39-year-old Anthony
Nutt, who worked previously for TSB Investment Management and broker Foster
&amp; Braithwaite. Lewis Aaron of SG Warburg Securities, says that the departure
of respected former manager John Redwood does not seem to have dented the
trust's performance.
In picking stocks, Nutt is able to call on Fleming's 15-strong team of
analysts. He says the trust looks for stocks which can provide dividend
growth rather than those with a high initial yield. That means it needs an
exposure to convertible stocks (now 15 per cent) to push the yield up to 3.6
per cent.
Even so, given the existence of additional plan charges, such a small yield
might not seem the most obvious Pep choice for income-seeking investors. But
as the graph shows, the trust has a good record for increasing dividends,
which have nearly trebled over the past 10 years. And quarterly payments are
undoubtedly an attraction.
The trust's long-term performance has undoubtedly benefited from its limited
exposure to small company shares, which have suffered over the past few
years but may be due for a revival. The share price return has also been
bolstered by the move from discount to premium, a factor which cannot now be
repeated.
So, the trust will face some interesting challenges over the next few years,
some of which have, ironically, been caused by its popularity.
Key facts.
At the end of 1992, the trust had gross assets of Pounds 92m and net assets
of Pounds 77m. On February 18, it had net assets per share of 375.5p and the
shares were trading at 399p, a premium of 6.1 per cent. The yield was 3.6
per cent and the market capitalisation was Pounds 80m. Fleming has a
two-year management contract, for which the annual fee is 0.5 per cent of
assets.
Board. Fleming Claverhouse has only a four-man board, chaired by Lord Mark
Fitzalan Howard, a director of Robert Fleming. The other directors are Sir
Timothy Raison, MP for Aylesbury and a former minister of overseas
development, John Redwood, a former manager of the trust, and Professor
George Stout, a director of XCL Sunrise.
Savings plan and Pep details. The minimum monthly investment into the
savings scheme is Pounds 40, and Pounds 400 for a lump sum purchase. There
is a 1 per cent charge on purchases, with a minimum of Pounds 1 and a
maximum of Pounds 50; on sales, the charge is also 1 per cent, with a
minimum of Pounds 10 and no maximum.
On Peps, the minimum monthly investment is Pounds 100, or Pounds 1,000 for a
lump sum. The initial charge is 1.5 per cent plus VAT, and there is an
annual charge of Pounds 25 plus VAT. There is also a dealing charge of 1.75
per cent plus VAT.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Sell-out for BES issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS continued to put tax-shelter money into the business expansion
scheme this week. Johnson Fry's N&amp;P Multiple Choice Growth scheme, which
raised money to rent out properties repossessed by the National &amp; Provincial
building society, raised Pounds 50m within 36 hours of opening and is now
sold out.
The company intends to follow up with an identical scheme for the Bradford &amp;
Bingley building society. This will involve non-recourse loans being offered
at the rates of 74p per Pounds 1 invested after six months, 78.31p after one
year, 87.71p after two years and 98.24p after three years.
There is no fixed repayment price after five years. Minimum investment is
Pounds 3,000 with a maximum of Pounds 25,000.
Close Brothers' BESSA Bristol and West scheme is likely to close on Monday.
Its target subscription is Pounds 45m.
Another non-recourse loan scheme, St Annes Residences, sponsored by Neill
Clerk, will raise money for St Anne's College, Oxford. The six-month loan,
underwritten by Barclays, is 73.5p per Pounds 1.00 invested.
Several advisers, such as Nick Mercer of Hill Martin, are nervous about the
non-recourse loan schemes. They point out that these offers are on
favourable terms for the banks.
Although the annualised returns on a non-recourse loan look attractive
(Johnson Fry quotes 49.93 per cent over six months), over five years a
higher return should be available by leaving the money in a BES company.
Neill Clerk has launched three unusual offerings. Airways III will buy
accommodation for the British Airways Housing Association. The association
has placed money on deposit so that, after five years, it aims to pay Pounds
1.17 for every Pounds 1 paid now.
Uncapped Growth is a hybrid, with an undertaking from a property developer
to pay Pounds 1.25 per Pounds 1.00 after five years, although this does not
have a full bank guarantee. There is no limit on the upside.
Reversionary Gains IV will buy home reversions from the elderly and aim for
a profit.

<TEXT>
THE SALE of shares in financial services group Jupiter Tyndall by chairman
John Duffield, deputy chairman John Craig and managing director Michael
Heathcoat Amory all took place at 143p. Following these transactions,
Duffield and Heathcoat Amory retain sizeable holdings. Craig's sale of
40,000 shares represented almost half his stake.
Shares in Southern Business Group have been performing well over the past
year and have risen 20 per cent relative to the market. Following this
chairman David McErlain sold more than 700,000 at 134p; he retains almost
3m.
Directors of Lister, the textile group, have been buying since the second
half of last year. Most recently, Victor Segal, a non-executive director and
Norman Smith, the chairman, bought shares at between 25p and 31.5p. These
transactions increased each director's holding substantially.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Cutting the tax bill on foreign
income - Expatriates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DONALD ELKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW DO you exclude your overseas income from liability to British tax? The
answer, in the jargon, is to be classed as not resident and not ordinarily
resident in the UK. That is the rule. But as for most rules, particularly
tax rules, there are exceptions.
One of these is when some of the duties of your overseas employment are
performed in the UK. That could result in having to pay tax on part of your
pay - but not necessarily, since UK duties which are 'merely incidental to
the performance of the other duties outside the UK' can be ignored for this
purpose.
Work done by an overseas representative when he comes to the UK to report
and get new instructions will certainly fall into the 'incidental' category.
So will visits for training which involve no directly productive work.
In both cases, the UK duties are inherently subordinate to those carried on
overseas. The test as to whether duties are to be regarded as incidental is,
therefore, concerned primarily with their substance, rather than the time
they take.
Nevertheless, UK duties extending beyond three months in a tax year will not
normally be accepted by the Inland Revenue as incidental.
Some of the work carried out by expatriates in the UK is, however, too
important in itself to be treated as incidental. The duties performed by
directors when attending UK board meetings, and by seamen and aircrew when
bringing their vessels and aircraft into UK ports, all fall into this
category.
In all of these cases, what is done is a fundamental part of the employee's
work. Furthermore, to determine what part of their remuneration is taxable,
some duties are deemed to be performed in the UK when actually they are not.
As civil servants know to their cost, their salaries are always chargeable
to UK tax whatever their residence status might be. Aircrew and seafarers
also come in for special treatment since, if they become residents of the
UK, they are treated as performing there all of the duties relating to any
journey, or leg of a journey, which begins or ends in Britain.
Unfortunately, such liability is the least troublesome of the disadvantages
which can arise from performing duties of substance in the UK. Of much
greater significance is the fact that doing so can change your residence
status and, hence, the whole basis of your liability to UK tax.
Many expatriates retain accommodation for their use in the UK. Visiting the
country in such circumstances gives rise to a resident status for the tax
year concerned unless (a) there exists at the time a full-time overseas
employment (or business); and (b) all of the duties of that employment are
carried on outside the UK. This is the rule which often results in working
husbands and non-fulltime working wives having a different residence status.
Unfortunately, if you perform duties of substance in the UK, you must
necessarily fail test (b). As a result, you will be resident for any year in
which you visit and, should you do so regularly, ordinarily resident too.
This means that if you remain a UK domiciliary, as the great majority of
British expatriates do, you will be subject to UK tax on your worldwide
income and gains on the same basis as a permanent resident.
Well, not quite. Your salary at least might be excluded from liability as a
result of the foreign earnings deduction. This applies to employment which
is carried on wholly or partly outside the UK in the course of a qualifying
period which exceeds 365 days.
'Qualifying period' is defined as any days spent outside the UK (whether
working or on holiday) and, in addition, intervening days when you are in
the UK - provided that no visit exceeds 62 consecutive days.
Nor should the total of them be more than one-sixth of the days in the
period. (For seafarers, the limits are 183 consecutive days and one half of
the days in the period).
The foreign earnings deduction, and particularly the one-sixth requirement,
should be approached with caution. The rules are very complex.
So, if your employment looks likely to involve you in performing duties of
substance in the UK, careful consideration of the tax implications is
essential. But if, as a result, you become resident and ordinarily resident,
there might be compensating advantages.
Foremost among these is the ability to pay personal pension contributions
attracting an Inland Revenue subsidy of 25 per cent, whether you pay tax on
your salary or not.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Blow for US expats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN expatriates in London will be examining their pay packets with
concern this weekend after President Clinton's State of the Union message.
Many can expect substantial increases in their taxes and health care
contributions because of the new administration's proposal to gather extra
income from the middle classes and the rich.
Expatriates tend to be higher-paid staff. Most based in the UK are paid by
their companies on the so-called 'tax equalisation' or 'tax-at-home' basis,
with tax deducted as though they were still resident in the US.
Any individual earning above Dollars 155,000, or a couple earning above
Dollars 140,000, a year after deductions would see their income tax rise to
36 per cent. Those earning above Dollars 250,000 a year would also face a 10
per cent surtax. Equally important, all these groups could expect their FICA
contributions - the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, covering medicare
and social security payments - to jump following removal of the present
Dollars 135,000 ceiling. Employers would also face an increase in FICA
contributions on behalf of employees.
Grady Townsend, of Price Waterhouse expatriate tax services in London, has
calculated two scenarios. For a married expatriate with two children on a
base salary of Dollars 75,000, with housing, cost of living, education and
car allowances worth another Dollars 120,000, present tax is Dollars 16,494.
That remains unchanged under the Clinton proposals, but their employer's tax
bill on their behalf would rise by Dollars 5,640 to Dollars 12,403.
For an expatriate on a base salary of Dollars 300,000, with allowances on
the same items totalling Dollars 190,000, the tax charge rises from Dollars
89,136 to Dollars 100,794. Their employer's contribution would increase from
Dollars 20,979 to Dollars 33,268.
But Bruce Lassman, head of the US tax desk at accountants Ernst &amp; Young,
points out that the expatriates would be paying at a lower rate than the 40
per cent upper tax band imposed on UK citizens.

IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the UK's largest manufacturer, reports its
preliminary year-end results on Thursday and grim reading they will make.
Hoare Govett expects ICI to report fourth-quarter pre-tax profits of only
Pounds 27m, making a total of Pounds 550m for the year. That compares with
Pounds 843m in 1991 and the peak of Pounds 1.5bn in 1989. But the poor
results will be immaterial compared with the announcement of the board's
decision whether to split ICI in two. The aim is to make Zeneca, the
pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and specialities subsidiaries, into a
separately quoted company.
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American drugs and consumer products company,
reports preliminary year-end results on Tuesday. Analysts expect pre-tax
profits to increase up to 13 per cent to between Pounds 1.11bn and Pounds
1.125bn, against Pounds 1bn a year earlier.
British Aerospace expects to see a revival in 1993 following a year in which
its performance was undermined by Pounds 1bn of provisions. Hopes for a
return to profit, however, will do nothing to soften the impact of its
preliminary results on Wednesday. These are likely to show losses of about
Pounds 1.1bn compared with losses of Pounds 81m a year earlier.
Restructuring charges of Pounds 950m in the regional aircraft division have
been blamed largely for the hole, although prospects look brighter following
last month's Saudi order for Tornadoes.
The mild weather and new regulatory regime imposed by Ofgas is likely to be
reflected in the final results for British Gas. The company is expected to
announce on Thursday that profits have slipped to around Pounds 900m
compared with a Pounds 1.16bn last time.
Increased competition and lower prices for domestic gas sales may also
reduce the company's scope for a substantial increase in dividend. A pay-out
of about 14p is expected, against 13.4p last year. The company's shares,
meanwhile, are likely to remain under pressure while the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission carries out a wide-ranging review of its business.
Royal Dutch Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil company, will report its preliminary
year-end results on Thursday when a small increase in profits is expected of
up to Pounds 3bn compared with Pounds 2.89bn for 1991. The company is likely
to raise its dividend in line with inflation to about 22p from 20.9p last
time.
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group, is expected to
report on Tuesday that pre-tax profits for the full year burst through the
Pounds 2bn barrier, an improvement of about 13 per cent on the previous
year's Pounds 1.79bn. Although flattered by the impact of sterling's
devaluation in the final quarter, the results are likely also to reflect
strong progress in south east Asia and parts of Latin America, and a
recovery in North America after a poor performance the previous year.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Private investors prepare to jump on
the bondwagon / A look at the renewed appeal of fixed-interest securities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BONDS ARE back in favour. A gradual shift towards fixed-interest securities
by British institutions before the UK left the European exchange rate
mechanism has now turned into a flood of marketing directed at private
investors.
The trend shown in the graph might make this seem strange. The effect of
Black Wednesday was to force down yields on gilts - bonds issued by the UK
government - across the board. But the 'yield curve,' one of the investment
world's more Byzantine constructions, has shifted in ways which allow small
investors some opportunities - along with more risks.
Long-term bonds now offer higher yields than short-term cash deposits. This,
together with the 'certainty' they offer - most pay a fixed rate of interest
and have a set repayment value - explains their appeal to the small
investor.
This return does not come without dangers, though - bond prices could fall,
leading to a loss of investors' capital in nominal terms - or inflation
could rise again, which would mean a capital loss in real terms.
In some cases, holding bonds until they are redeemed guarantees a capital
loss.
Private investors can buy bonds directly, but many may find the task of
selecting the right issue too daunting. That is where the financial services
industry steps in, with a range of funds designed to take the hassle out of
bond investing.
GILT UNIT TRUSTS
These were among the fund management industry's star performers of 1992. UK
gilt and fixed-interest unit trusts logged net sales of Pounds 128.2m. The
industry's own marketing has a lot to do with this, but more important is a
pervading sentiment that inflation will be low throughout this decade.
The advantages of buying into a large, professionally-managed portfolio were
displayed by the convulsions of Black Wednesday.
As Will Hay, the head of fixed interest at Standard Life, explains, some
issues maturing in 2002 are priced at 112p and will be redeemed at 100p - so
buying the issue for its attractive yield means buying into a capital loss.
Unit trusts can aim to deliver a high yield while selling in time to avoid
capital losses.
Bond funds can, however, have different aims. Traditionally, gilts are used
for income, and present yields justify this. By buying three unit trusts
which pay out quarterly, it is possible to arrange for monthly income,
providing each pays its income in different months.
The table shows figures for all the gilt unit trusts with a track record of
at least five years which pay out quarterly.
Some funds have exceptionally high yields, which is a sign that they are
turning capital into income. This could appeal to some investors, but only
if they are sure they can afford to lose some capital.
But some funds may aim for a total return (judged in terms of income and
capital gains combined). The figures for growth, which assume that income
has been re-invested, show that gilts have not delivered this reliably.
A further crafty device, pioneered by Mercury, is to hold enough overseas
bonds to qualify for the capital gains tax indexation allowance. The fund
aims for income, and makes a loss in capital terms after indexation. This
loss can be offset for CGT purposes against gains elsewhere in the
portfolio.
Rather more tax-planning opportunities are available offshore. Advice from
an accountant is needed before attempting to take advantage of them.
'Roll-up' funds do not distribute income; instead, this is allowed to
accumulate tax-free within the fund. Tax is payable only after the
investment is redeemed. Distributor funds pay out income gross - very
attractive at present yields - and tax does not need to be paid until later.
Guinness Flight stresses that going offshore only defers tax.
If you are aiming for income, then the present yield is what you will get.
What are the chances for total return?
According to Hay, a decision on whether to buy bonds hinges on your
prediction for inflation. 'If you believe inflation has been squeezed out of
the UK system, we will see a good performance on the gilts market. You may
see the total return performance deteriorate over three to five years if
inflation picks up.'
He considers gilts a very attractive investment in the short-term, but he is
less confident over a medium term of three to five years because of the risk
of accelerating inflation. Hay is also anxious about the possibility that
gilts will be in over-supply.
Simon Briscoe, UK economist at Midland Montagu, is more confident than most
about inflation. He forecasts that roughly 1 percentage point will be shaved
off all gilt yields by the end of this year, and adds: 'We would be looking
for the longest-dated gilts to yield 7.75 per cent by the end of this year,
and they are now on 8.6 per cent. That would give a healthy return.'
Midland Montagu is backing gilts to outperform equities this year, with
inflation staying between 2 and 4 per cent for the next three years - making
8.6 per cent look good.
INTERNATIONAL BOND UNIT TRUSTS
The best way to buy international bonds is via a fund. The minimum units in
which they are traded, and the costs of transactions in foreign markets,
make frequent trading in international bonds impracticable for a small
investor.
International bond funds are also in favour, with net sales last year of
Pounds 191.9m. Mercury's international bond fund, launched two years ago,
now has Pounds 217.3m.
People who bought at the beginning of last year have done well so far. The
funds come with an added currency risk, which delivered very strong
performance for them last year as sterling devalued - average total return
for the sector over the half-year to the beginning of this month was 17.75
per cent, according to Micropal.
European bonds, in which Barclays Unicorn launched a specialist fund last
month, are attracting particular interest from analysts because base rates
are still high, in line with the German Bundesbank's high interest rate
policy. Once they fall, European bond markets should rally, delivering a
capital gain.
Peter Oppenheimer of Hambros, which manages the offshore EMMA umbrella fund,
says: 'We see European bonds as offering more value than gilts because the
potential for base rates to come down is greater. French rates, in
particular, are unsustainable.'
Again, the table shows only those funds with a track record of at least five
years which pay income quarterly. Yields arelower and managers, particularly
in funds specialising in European bonds, tend to aim for a total return -
income and capital gain combined - rather than income alone.
CHARGES
Initial and annual charges are more variable than they are for most of the
industry. Some funds impose an initial charge of 5 per cent and an annual
charge of 1.5 per cent, but annual charges nearer 0.75 per cent, and initial
charges of between 3 and 4 per cent are common.
Gilts are cheaper to manage than equities and several companies have cut
charges in the past year. They include Abtrust, which has two unit trusts
with no front-end charge at all, Fidelity, Guinness Flight and INVESCO MIM.
Now that companies are competing on price, look around for the cheapest
option.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Court rejects payout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEOPLE who lost money on investment bond home income plans because they
followed bad advice from commissioned sales agents were defeated this week
in their attempt to get extra compensation from the Investors Compensation
Scheme.
The plans were sold late in the 1980s, mainly to elderly people, as a 'safe'
way of releasing income from their homes. In fact, the schemes involved
taking out a mortgage and investing in equity-linked bonds. But the value of
the bonds fell as interest rates rose and house prices dropped, pushing many
people into debt.
Investors bought such things as holidays, believing they were spending
interest earned on their home's capital. But they were actually consuming
the capital itself.
The case against the ICS was brought in the High Court by solicitors Barnett
Sampson, which argued that the ICS had interpreted its rules irrationally in
deciding compensation. Barnett Sampson claimed the ICS should include money
spent mistakenly by clients because of wrong advice, and that victims should
get damages for distress and anxiety.
These arguments were rejected but the claimants did win one significant
victory. The court allowed a relative or 'personal representative' to bring
or pursue compensation on behalf of a victim who had died. The ICS had
refused to consider claims brought by relatives after a victim's death, or
to pay compensation if the victim died before an offer had been made. This
seemed particularly unfair, since victims are mostly elderly and the
compensation process lengthy.
The case illustrates the arbitrary nature of the compensation process. If
the home income plan was sold by a direct salesman or tied agent of an
insurance company, the victim is arguably in a better position than anyone
who dealt with an independent financial adviser. Large insurance companies,
mindful of their reputations, have the resources and incentive to settle a
claim in full. But independent advisers, authorised by Fimbra, usually are
small companies with fewer resources and no national reputation to
safeguard. If the adviser collapses under the weight of claims, investors
can turn only to the ICS, which has different rules.
Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the insurance industry, requires a
company to return people to the position in which they would have been had
they not invested. But the court ruling means the same does not hold true
for those getting compensation from the ICS. Its maximum payout per claim is
Pounds 48,000 and it has awarded Pounds 5.5m to 327 of an estimated 1,650
claimants.
Barnett Sampson is appealing against the ruling.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Markets: Wisdom and foolishness - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Do the Seven Wise Men, the government's panel of independent economic
advisers who reported this week, owe their name to the Three Wise Men in the
bible or the Five Wise Virgins?
I plump for the latter. While waiting to greet the bridegroom, the wise
virgins armed themselves with reserve supplies of lamp-oil. When the
bridegroom arrived, their five foolish sisters had run out of oil, and
begged for help.
'But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and
you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.'
This clear preference for market solutions is strong evidence for the link
with today's economists.
The connection is closer still: by the time the foolish virgins had found
their fresh supplies of oil, the bridegroom had arrived and barred the door,
leaving them out in the cold. Like much economic advice, that of the Five
Wise Virgins proved theoretically impeccable but practically useless. It
remains to be seen if the Seven Wise Men do any better.
Their first dollop of advice, published yesterday, included a call for a
two-point cut in base rates 'in the next few months' from Gavyn Davies of
Goldman Sachs.
He is unworried by the threat to sterling that a big cut in interest rates
might pose, and adds: 'Incidentally, if the underlying inflation rate moves
above the top end of the 1-4 target range this year, it should be ignored .
. .'
This was greeted with wry smiles by those who remember that immediately
after sterling's exit from the ERM in September he warned against the
foolish temptations of just the policy he is now recommending.
Well, times change. Perhaps inflation is yesterday's story, as Tim Congdon,
the other City forecaster on the government's panel, argues. He is expecting
underlying inflation in 1994 to be only 1 per cent, and can envisage prices
actually falling in the mid-1990s.
Since these two economists rarely agree about anything, their lack of
concern about inflation is striking. Investors share this view. Gilts
continued their rally during the week, with the yield on 10-year gilts
dropping to 7.85 per cent, a drop of a quarter-point in a week. Issuers seem
to be viewing this as a not-to-be-missed opportunity to lock in cheap
long-term money: Argyll issued a Pounds 150m sterling bond on Wednesday, and
there are more to come.
Even the first of the Bank of England's quarterly inflation reports, also
published this week, failed to dent the bond market's optimism much - though
the Bank was noticeably more concerned about inflation than Davies and
Congdon.
The report also contained the chart on the right. It shows the slide in
export margins, which is probably already starting to reverse as a
consequence of sterling's devaluation. As the chart on the right showed, the
squeeze on exports coupled with the slowdown in retail sales has had a
crippling effect on manufacturing output.
Just as interesting, however, is the fact that import margins have been
under pressure even while sterling was over-valued in 1991 and 1992. As the
Bank points out, this may mean that importers have little scope for
sacrificing profitability to preserve market share.
That is potentially good news for domestic producers - especially as this
week's January retail sales figures, a rise of 2.3 per cent compared with a
year ago, confirm the steady upwards trend in the volume of goods sold.
Though the stock market had a setback, in sympathy with Wall Street, on
Tuesday, the FT-SE 100 index ended the week at 2840.0 down only 3 points.
Companies making rights issues or acquisitions were viewed in a remarkably
benign light, always a sign of general bullishness.
Bowater asked for Pounds 295m for an acquisition in the US, and its shares
ended the week at 517p, up 33p. Bellway, a medium-sized builder, sought
Pounds 33.6m; its shares fell only 14p to 382p.
RTZ was also given the benefit of the doubt, even though its Dollars 470m
purchase of US coal assets is the sort of foray into an untapped field that
in more pessimistic times would have caused ripples of fear. Its shares
closed the week at 646p, down only 15p. Kingfisher, announcing the Pounds
560m price of its acquisition of Darty in France, was also greeted warmly:
its shares closed the week at 576p, up 49p.
The market seemed in two minds, however, about what was possibly the best
corporate news of the week: a 16 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits at
Glaxo, and a strong hint that it was not planning the bid for Warner-Lambert
of the US that traders had feared. Glaxo shares, under pressure for much of
the week because of worries about what President Clinton's health care
review would do to drug prices in the US, bounced sharply on the news in
very heavy volume. The downtrend resumed on Friday, however, and the shares
closed the week at 666p, down 38p. It was enough to make the wisest virgin
feel foolish.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Markets: President hits the big players where it hurts -
Wall Street

<TEXT>
IF PRESIDENT Clinton is looking to the US bond market for an endorsement of
his plan for the nation's economic revival, he is looking in the wrong
place. Stung this week by the stock markets' negative reaction to the
announcement of widespread tax increases in his first budget, several times
the President turned to the treasury market for comfort. He argued that
surging bond prices proved that at least some people in the financial world
understood the implications of his attempt to alter radically the direction
of US economic policy. Unfortunately, the bond market's analysis of how the
Clinton fiscal package will affect the economy is poles apart from the
president's own thinking on the matter.
Treasury prices have risen sharply this week - sending the yield on the
benchmark 30-year bond down to below 7.1 per cent, the lowest level in the
issue's 16-year history - because fixed-income investors believe the mixture
of big tax increases, spending cuts and selective government 'investments'
will do more to hinder, not help, the economic recovery. Such a prospect
appeals to the bond market because anything that slows economic growth also
slows the rate of inflation, which is good news for investors with assets
like government securities that earn a fixed rate of return.
True, bond prices also rose this week because investors were pleasantly
surprised by Clinton's tough stance on cutting the deficit, and because of
speculation that the government will cut future issues of the long bond in
an attempt to reduce the cost of financing the federal deficit. These,
however, were side issues. Ultimately, the bond market gave the Clinton
package the thumbs up because it felt the impact of its contents would be
thumbs down for the economy.
Stock market investors agreed, which is why the Dow has fallen 4 per cent
from the all-time high it reached just two weeks ago; why the Standard &amp;
Poor's has dropped 3.5 per cent from its record high; and why the Nasdaq
composite of secondary stocks has tumbled 6.5 per cent from its recent peak.
Of course, there was a personal element to Wall Street's chagrin. Most of
the brokers, market-makers and institutional money managers who make up the
big players in today's equity markets will be among those hardest hit by the
planned increases in personal income tax. The firms which employ them will
also suffer from many of the new measures, including higher corporate taxes,
lower deductibles on business entertainment expenses, a possible tax on
securities transactions, and the elimination of deductions on 'excessive'
(Clinton's word - not Wall Street's) pay packets.
Investors also were unhappy about what the president did not include in his
fiscal package: namely, more spending cuts. The stock markets always adopt a
conservative approach to economic policy and, like Clinton's Republican
critics on Capitol Hill, they believe the best way to cut the deficit is to
reduce spending, not raise taxes. While the president did announce a range
of spending cuts, they did not go far enough for the markets' liking.
Although everyone's attention this week was focused on economic policy,
there were technical factors at work that contributed to the declines in
stock prices. Early this month, all the main market indices posted record
highs, with the Dow advancing more than 120 points in just three days. At
the time, the surge was put down to rising confidence in the economic
outlook but, to many observers, the new highs looked unsustainable. The
markets, as analysts love to say, were looking 'frothy' - driven too much by
speculative buying and bandwagon jumping, and not enough by economic or
earnings fundamentals.
Typically, sudden increases in share prices can be difficult to retain.
Often, they are followed quickly by equally sharp declines as investors take
the opportunity to book some fast profits. Clinton's tax proposals, first
outlined on Monday night, provided the perfect excuse for this week's
profit-taking.
So where are share prices headed now? In all likelihood, nowhere fast. Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve and keeper of the markets' faith,
told Congress yesterday that while the economy was gaining momentum, the
outlook for growth was fraught with 'considerable uncertainty' because of
the changes in fiscal policy.
So, while the president spends the next weeks, and probably months, haggling
with Congress over his budget plan, the stock markets are likely to tread
water at least until the next flood of quarterly corporate earnings - which
means, not until spring.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Markets: Consider the options . . . - Serious Money /
Examining a new Pep
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PERSONAL equity plan which invests mainly in blue chip shares and offers a
monthly income, after charges, of 10 per cent a year sounds like a wonderful
deal.
Indeed, it seems so attractive that investors should reach automatically for
their two guiding principles: 'greater reward means greater risk' and 'if an
offer sounds too good to be true, it probably is.'
Furthermore, this new unit trust from Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial, called the
Higher Income Plan, is fiendishly complicated. Another rule for savers is
'never invest in anything which you don't understand.'
How does it work? Around 55 per cent of the portfolio is in the form of blue
chip shares, which will provide a modest income (equivalent to 2-3 per cent
on the total portfolio). The rest of the portfolio is invested in
'debentures' (of which more later), money market instruments and cash. These
provide interest income which pushes up the yield.
But the extra income - the portion which pushes the return on the Pep above
that on most alternative plans - comes from options. An option gives the
buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a commodity at a
given price over a given period. In return, the buyer pays a premium to the
option seller (or 'writer' in the jargon).
There are two kinds of option - a 'call,' which gives the purchaser the
right to buy a commodity; and a 'put,' which gives the right to sell.
An example might help. On Friday morning, it was possible to purchase a call
option on BT shares, giving you the right to buy them at 420p before May.
The BT price then was 402p and the option carried a premium of 11p.
So, if the BT share price rises to 450p before May, the buyer can exercise
the option and buy shares at 420p. He will then have a profit of 30p for an
initial outlay of 11p. If the BT price stays at 402p, the buyer will let the
option lapse and will have lost the 11p premium.
Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial's new unit trust will write both call and put
options against the shares it owns. The premiums it earns by writing the
options will boost the yield on the trust up to 10 per cent (after charges)
for those who hold the trust in Pep form. (Since the rules do not allow
trusts to pay out option profits as income, Hypo F&amp;C has arranged a clever
deal whereby the 'debentures' incorporate the options.)
One further twist is that the trust will buy a put option on the FT-SE 100
index, which will give it protection against a sharp fall in the stock
market.
The trick underlying all this complex detail is that Hypo F&amp;C has found a
way of converting capital into income. By writing call options, the unit
trust will not benefit from any sharp rise in the stock market (since the
option buyer will exercise his rights). Hypo F&amp;C says that over the past 15
years, stock market return has been 15 per cent a year  - in the form of 10
per cent capital gain and 5 per cent income. Its new unit trust will aim for
the same return, but in the form of 10 per cent income and 5 per cent
capital growth.
The concept is not entirely new; similar funds are available in the US. It
will be interesting to see how the fund works in practice in the UK. But I
do not think that anyone planning to invest in it should expect any capital
growth at all (and they could make a capital loss). The stock market might
well not produce the same levels of nominal return that have been achieved
over the past 15 years. Indeed, it could take a while for the investor to
earn back the 5 per cent initial charge.
Nor will there be the same prospects for income growth as other Peps; option
premiums do not grow in the same way as company dividends.
It is tempting to seize on any product which offers such a high yield,
relative to the rest of the market. But this is a product which needs a lot
of thought, and investors ought to take independent financial advice before
parting with their cash.
*****
So, farewell then, best advice. New guidelines from Fimbra, the regulator
for financial advisers, are headlined 'giving investment advice' and replace
the 'guidelines on best advice' issued in 1988.
One's suspicions are aroused automatically by such a change. Admittedly,
best advice is difficult to define - it is easier to say when it does not
occur than when it does. Nevertheless, dropping the word 'best' hardly seems
a triumph for consumer protection.
There are, however, some encouraging words for consumers in the new
guidelines. Under a section headed 'Exercise of judgment,' Fimbra says:
'Members must take care to ensure that their recommendations are made on the
basis of the client's best interests and not on the basis of the income
generated for the member. For example, the 'best' investment for a client
who is particularly risk-averse might be National Savings certificates or
gilts which do not generate any commission (although the member may charge a
reasonable fee for his advice) . . . The benefits of the investment to the
client must in each case be balanced against its costs.'
If Fimbra members can live up to those injunctions, the consumer will be
well served.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Markets: Glaxo fights for global crown - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pity Glaxo. Europe's largest drugs group is vying with Merck of the US to be
the world's number one pharmaceuticals group. The company markets Zantac,
the world's best-selling drug. Its underlying earnings growth in the six
months to the end of December was 13 per cent - a performance that almost
all companies during a recession would envy.
Glaxo appears to be doing everything right. Yet its shares have fallen from
814p last September to as low as 662p this week.
For the most part, the problems faced by Glaxo are those shared by the rest
of the pharmaceuticals industry. US investors, noting the pick-up in the
American economy, have been dumping defensive drugs stocks capable of
generating consistent earnings growth during recession. Instead, they have
been plunging into cyclical companies hit by the slow-down but capable of
impressive growth during a recovery.
The swing against drugs stocks has been exaggerated by fears about the
political outlook in the US for pharmaceuticals companies. The Clinton
administration has pinpointed healthcare as a key agenda item. Drugs
companies, many of which in the past have increased prices well above
inflation, are directly in the administration's sights.
Dr Ernest Mario, Glaxo's chief executive, admitted this week that the
outlook in the US looked extremely uncertain. Everything, he said, remained
up in the air.
Glaxo is in a better position than many to withstand the Clinton
administration. Glaxo has recently limited its US price increases to below
the rate of inflation. At constant exchange rates, only 1 percentage point
of its sales growth came from price increases compared with 12 percentage
points from volume. In addition, the group does not manufacture medicines in
Puerto Rico, so it would be less exposed to moves curbing the island's tax
haven status.
Nevertheless, doubts remain about Glaxo's continued ability to drive
double-digit earnings growth. Nearly half of its operating profits growth in
the first six months was generated by Zantac, the ulcer treatment. After
yesterday's results Goldman Sachs upgraded its 1995 sales forecasts for
Zantac to a massive Pounds 2.6bn. However, the better-than-expected growth
of Zantac underlines Glaxo's dependence on the drug. Glaxo faces challenges
to Zantac's American patents, which protect the drug from generic
competition up to 2002. If Glaxo loses, the drug could face such competition
by 1996.
Zantac faces an earlier threat, too. Its main rival SmithKline Beecham's
Tagamet is coming off patent next year. Cost-anxious US healthcare managers
may insist doctors prescribe cheap generic versions of Tagamet rather than
the more expensive, patented Zantac.
Glaxo's double-digit earnings growth is also becoming hindered by the
company's very size. If its new drugs turn out to be only moderately
successful Glaxo could face difficulties maintaining its growth. Goldman
Sachs believes earnings per share growth may slow to under 10 per cent
beyond 1995.
Glaxo's new drugs, such as its migraine treatment Imigran and its asthma
drug Serevent, are still in the balance. They have not yet, or have only
just been, launched in the US, Japan, Germany or France. Dr Mario warned,
however, that Imigran's growth would not be explosive.
Glaxo's shares could be boosted next Friday if a Food and Drug
Administration advisory committee review of Serevent is favourable. Also,
Dr Mario has calmed immediate fears about a rights issue to fund the
acquisition of a big company in the US over-the-counter, non-prescription
drug market.
The main problem Dr Mario faces is not persuading investors Glaxo is a
quality drug stock - it clearly is. Rather, he must convince investors to
plunge further into defensive stocks when the US and UK economies appear to
be recovering from recession.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Extermination in Eden: Christina Lamb visits uncharted
Amazonia where the last Stone Age tribe is threatened by starving
gold-seekers

'THOSE WHO have already died will have their revenge. They will cut the sky
into pieces so that it falls all over the land.'
 - Davi Kopenawa Yanomami
UNDER THE pounding glare of the Amazonian sun, a few wispy clouds throw
their shadows onto a carpet of green treetops covering mountains and chasms
as far as the eye can see. Stencilled through the heart of this dense jungle
is the flashing ribbon of the Macujai river. Along its banks, the occasional
clearings for a maloca (a conical woven hut) are the only signs of human
presence.
The US aviation map of the north-western reaches of Roraima, Brazil's most
northern state, warns intriguingly that the area is 'largely unknown'. The
depths of the Amazon basin near the Venezuelan border was the setting for
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Lost World. Progress has not yet arrived and,
almost 500 years after Pedro Cabral discovered Brazil, this stretch of rain
forest remains untouched by the highways, hydro-electric projects,
wood-cutters and settlements that have devoured much of the Amazon. It is
home to an estimated 9,000 members of the world's oldest surviving isolated
Indian tribe - the Yanomami.
The Yanomami are believed to have been there for thousands of years. They do
not read or write, and use bows and arrows. Female children are often killed
at birth and names are never spoken. After a death, the body is left in the
trees for a week before burning, and the ashes are then eaten with banana
paste. They subsist on hunting and fishing and precarious agriculture. The
land is poor so the population is sparse and moves often.
The Yanomami reserve is accessible only by small plane after a laborious
process of government authorisation. It has a tranquillity for which I could
easily renounce urban living. The nearest road linking Roraima to the rest
of Brazil starts 300km away. It was built in 1977 and has yet to be paved.
Bulldozers and four-wheel drive vehicles are unknown. The somnolent day is
interrupted only by the shrieks of parrots, unidentifiable whoops and calls
from the bushes, and the chatter of monkeys in the trees.
Until 1987, the Yanomamis' only contact with whites was the occasional
missionary. Five years ago it was discovered that these Stone Age people
were sitting on one of the world's richest mineral deposits replete with
gold, tin, diamonds and uranium. The result was a flood of 45,000
garimpeiros, or wild-cat gold miners. They brought guns, rum and diseases
which, in three years, wiped out 10 per cent of the Yanomami population in
what human rights' groups called genocide.
The international outcry prompted three operations to remove the
garimpeiros. The first official trip by image-conscious President Fernando
Collor in 1990 was for the widely televised destruction of 84 clandestine
airstrips. Last year, amid more grand publicity, he created a 9.4m sq km
reserve (the size of Portugal) for the Yanomami to win points at the Earth
Summit and reverse Brazil's reputation as an eco-villain. Now Collor is in
disgrace, the Earth Summit forgotten and the garimpeiros are back - 12,000
since November.
Once more, Yanomami are dying: 200 in the past 12 months. The Homoxi region,
under the shadow of the Surucucu mountains, has been mutilated by airstrips
slashed out of the jungle. The Macujai river has been choked with silt,
polluted with mercury used to extract gold, and diverted in the frantic
search for the precious metal.
From above, you can see tiny figures working Heath Robinson-type sluice
contraptions, digging craters where fetid water gathers, breeding mosquitoes
which carry malaria lethal to the Yanomami. Charlotte Sankey from Survival
International, a London-based organisation active in the fight to preserve
them, says: 'If we don't do something, we will see another people wiped out
 -forever.'
Although the 1988 constitution guarantees that all 180 remaining Indian
tribes in Brazil will be granted their traditional lands by October - a
total of 90m hectares in 510 reserves - powerful interests threaten the
extermination of the Yanomami like so many others before them. Since 1500,
Brazil's Indian population has fallen from 5m to 220,000. The 'noble savage'
has been seen as a barrier to development. Fernando Ramos Pereira, then
governor of Roraima, said in 1979: 'We're not going to let half a dozen
Indian tribes stop progress.'
The constitution is to be reviewed this year. Bishops, mining companies,
politicians, land-owners, the military, environmentalists and garimpeiros
are battling over the mining of Yanomami land. This would provide work for
thousands of poor Brazilians and revenue for the government - but probably
destroy the tribe.
In Homoxi, Funai, the national Indian agency, and Medicins Sans Frontiers, a
medical aid organisation, have a post tending to the 48 Indians living
nearby. At the sound of the plane, several emerge from their maloca, naked
except for small knotted tangas, with red body paint and straws protruding
from above their upper lips. Like children they come forward, touch and
stare, chatter and giggle to themselves. Bored quickly, they go back to
their hammocks where they loll listlessly, their stick-thin limbs and
distended stomachs no advertisement for the natural life. Suddenly, they
begin jabbering. Zelia, the Peruvian nurse, says they want to know if we
have come to remove the garimpeiros.
At the other end of the short runway, makeshift huts covered with blue
plastic sheeting show how close the invaders have come. Eight planes a day
unload more, along with such diseases as influenza, malaria, tuberculosis
and syphilis - against which the Yanomami have no defence. The pollution of
the river has killed the fish and the noise of the planes has scared off
animals. To appease the Yanomami, the garimpeiros gave them flour and rice -
but their plantations have been left to wither and die. In their brutal
introduction to western civilisation, they were given rum and the women were
seduced. According to Zelia, two-thirds of the Homoxi Yanomami have had
malaria. On the morning of my visit, three more sorry sufferers came in.
The garimpeiros do not look like villains. They are well-armed and sport
gold watches or nuggets, but most have hollow cheeks, dull eyes and dirty
shorts. All I met were from the poverty-stricken north-eastern states of
Maranhao and Bahia. They had been forced out by drought, and all asked for
food. Many have no alternative but to move from place to place, following
the latest fofoca (rumour about a gold discovery). 'I will only leave dead,'
said Vajel, who has been a garimpeiro since he was 15. 'On a good day, you
can get 20 grammes of gold - that's five months' minimum salary,' said
Raimundo. 'If they push us out again, we'll come back. We've got no other
option.'
Some 5,000km and several ages away in Brasilia, a bearded man with furrowed
brow paces a government office in heavy hiking boots and khaki shirt. Sidney
Possuelo is charged with protecting Brazil's indigenous people as the head
of Funai. He is angry. He feels powerless and worried that Brazil's new
president, Itamar Franco, will succumb to pleas to open up the reserve for
mining.
'I'm a malandro (scoundrel), not a politician,' he says as he fires off a
letter to the army chief complaining about the arrest of a French nurse in
the Yanomami reserve.
At Possuelo's offices the lift is out of order, the 'phones are sometimes
cut off and few lights are on. The government cash crisis has left Funai
with no money to monitor the 272 existing reserves, or to demarcate the 238
outstanding. Last year, Possuelo received less than 10 per cent of his
budget. So far this year, he has received nothing. None of Funai's nine
planes is working.
The Collor decree, overriding military protests to create the Yanomami
reserve, should have been a victory but, without funds to enforce it,
Possuelo now suspects it was a mere marketing stunt.
'It's not enough to create a reserve when, inside, you have riches and,
outside, marginalised people,' he says. He accuses his opponents of
distorting the picture. 'What we're talking about is not maintaining the
Yanomami as they are, like some museum piece for the benefit of
anthropologists, but of giving them the option of staying as they are or
joining the world around with time to adjust.'
Over in the flying saucer-shaped Congress building, Senator Joao Fagundes
says is having none of this. 'We never felt we needed to keep the Vikings
preserved in cages. It's no good saying that the Yanomamis' ways are lovely,
let's keep them. What was good 200 years ago is not now.'
He favours the solution of the former Sarney goverment, which demarcated 19
islands of 2.4m sq km to the Yanomami but gave garimpeiros or mining
companies access to the rest. 'The Yanomami land takes up 40 percent of
Roraima. That's 10 sq km per person - no people in the world has that kind
of land,' says Fagundes.
Davi Kopenawa Yanomami, the tribe's Portugese-speaking representative, also
visited Brasilia that day to present a bow and arrow to President Franco.
'I will tell Great White Chief that Omame (a Yanomami god) put minerals
beneath the earth because it is cold. When these are taken out, they spread
hot air and venom which causes many illnesses. We have tried to tell the
whites but they don't listen.'
To Possuelo's surprise, Franco did listen and agreed to a Dollars 2m (Pounds
1.4m) operation to remove the garimperios.
In the Funai office in Boa Vista, the capital of Roraima, Wilk Celio, the
co-ordinator of the removal programme, is sceptical. 'It's useless - the
garimpeiros will keep going back. There are 100 garimpeiro planes operating
in this area while we don't have one. The only answer is constant monitoring
and that means funds. Last year, we didn't get a cent.' His colleague,
Manoel Reginaldo Tavares, gestures at a wall map of the state showing the
location of its 24,970 Indians of eight different tribes, and laughs. 'Our
resources are not even enough to run a creche of 100 children, let alone
25,000 Indians.'
Tension is high in Boa Vista. Roraima state depends on federal handouts but
would be rich if allowed access to its minerals. The population has tripled
to 230,000 in 10 years because of the influx of garimpeiros, and not just
from Brazil. A Londoner has just arrived from Mile End and a Scot, John
Boyle, runs the Bay Bar and nightclub after eight years as a garimpeiro.
Prices are in grammes of gold, and everyone seems to have a stake in the
garimpeiro-Yanomami struggle. The headlines in the local papers are about
murders. People mutter of mafia-like activities and aid workers tell of pet
dogs slaughtered in their gardens. Celio gets constant threats and lives
between his office and hotel. 'I'm a prisoner,' he says, and talks of going
on holiday and not coming back.
The centrepiece of the giant main square is an enormous concrete statue of a
garimpeiro. This is overlooked by the state assembly, where all 24 members
are against demarcation, and the governor's palace. His spokesman, Francisco
Netto, says: 'The federal government can keep on spending more and more but
will never succeed in taking out the garimpeiros. The only answer is to
create mining reserves and allow in companies so that we can collect taxes.'
Elton Rohmelt, the head of the state energy department, has no doubt that
day will come. He is one of the main garimpeiro bosses, with a fleet of four
'planes and a helicopter. Rohmelt says: 'No one knows the Amazon better than
me.' He is so fat that his jowls quiver as he speaks and the buttons strain
on the patterned shirts he buys in London. Rohmelt decided to lie low when
Collor took office. 'I saw he was mad, so I took up the governor's
invitation to run the state energy department.'
He is using his position to put in place the infrastructure for his future
mining operations. Here a hydro-electric project, there a road to Venezuela
and the port. His company, Goldmazon, has more than 60 claims in the
Yanomami areas. He says: 'Refusing access to this is a crime for a poor
country like us. I'm absolutely sure that, within the next few years, mining
in Yanomami areas will be allowed - and I'm ready.'
His great rival, the ebullient Ze Altino, a media-loving representative of
the garimpeiros' union, Usagal, is more careful to play down his personal
interest. He says: 'What's the point of blowing up airstrips if, six hours
later, they are rebuilt.' He points out that there are 1m garimpeiros in
Brazil, of which 400,000 are 'professional'. He adds: 'They say garimpeiros
are illegal, but there are more garimpeiros in indigenous areas than there
are Indians in Brazil. Don't they have rights, too?'
Haroldo Eurico dos Santos, the state planning secretary, is a former
professor who used to advise governments to burn down the Amazon. He is busy
drawing up mega-plans for Brazil's poorest state.
Above the noise from roaring, clanking pipes, he shouts: 'This state is
basically unviable. We generate only 16 percent of our expenditure and our
only potential economic base is either demarcated or will be. Ninety-nine
per cent of the population are against demarcation. The only ones in favour
are the church, communists and some Indians.'
The most vitriolic opposition is on Rua do Ouro (Gold Street). There, many
of the gold shops are boarded up, the stores full of mining utensils
deserted, and clutches of garimpeiros sit miserably at bars, biding their
time, comparing the number of times each has had malaria (one man has had 34
bouts). They recall the days when they could make a good living just from
the end-of-day sweepings outside the gold shops.
Most of the gold is smuggled out of the state to avoid taxes, so figures for
the amount produced are vague. According to Altino, production reached 12
tonnes in the peak year of 1990, plus 500,000 kilos of diamonds. Even then,
few got rich apart from the bosses, the Rohmelts and Altinos, who run
airstrips, planes, bars, brothels, and rent machinery at inflated prices.
In Gold Street, the blame for the latest crackdown is laid on everyone from
the Americans ('they are scared of Brazil becoming a great power') to the
padres for their defence of Indian rights. So unpopular is Dom Aldo, the
bishop, that a petition was mounted last year to get him out. One man told
me: 'I'd like to have his kidneys on a barbecue fork.'
After 17 years in Boa Vista and overseeing a Yanomami mission, the fire
seems to have gone out of Dom Aldo. Wearily, he tells me: 'People say we are
working for gold or trying to create another nation, but that's a lie. Nor
are we trying to convert them (the Indians). They don't yet have the
terminology for catechism, so it's very hard to explain our Christian
concepts.
'People get angry because we tell the Indians their rights. It's a war
between economic interests and human rights in a country where the powerful
always win.'
Among so many voices, the only ones not to be heard are the Yanomami.
Experience from other tribes suggests that Indians are keen to have the
badges of progress such as televisions, speedboats and ghetto-blasters. Some
of the more acculturated Amazonian tribes, such as the Kayapo and Xingu,
have organised and demand royalties for prospecting in their areas. But
along the river Branco from Boa Vista, at Fazenda Sao Marco, a community of
Macuxi Indians lives in pitiful squalor. White contact has robbed them of
their old ways without equipping them to find a substitute. For the
primitive Yanomami, the future looks bleak.

FT  20 FEB 93 / The Long View: Gilts buck the odds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT A lot of people know this because, unlike new stock market highs, it
does not make headlines - but the yield on long-dated British government
securities dropped this week to near 8 1/2 per cent, the lowest level for 21
years. Far from being demoralised by the prospect of massive government
funding at the rate of Pounds 1bn a week over the next year, the gilt-edged
market is hitting back.
It would be nice to think that the reason was the rising credibility of the
British government's economic strategy, but a glance at the rest of the
major bond markets around the world reveals a general trend. The US long
treasury bond yield, for instance, has declined from 7.5 to 7.0 per cent
since early December, and only junk bond markets such as that of Italy -
where 10-year government bonds yield over 13 per cent - have really stood
out.
It would seem, therefore, that falling bond yields are primarily the
consequence of the global recession. There is a check on this in the UK
gilt-edged market, in the gap between the nominal yield on fixed coupon
issues and the real yield on the index-linkers. This gap, which is a
rough-and-ready measure of long run inflation expectations, has stayed
steady at around 5 per cent so far. It is the real yield that has fallen.
Now, there are no absolutely simple explanations for global trends and
something more has to be said about the US, where there appears to be an
economic recovery under way. President Clinton's tax threats this week, and
his promises of a 40 per cent cut in the US budget deficit to just over
Dollars 200bn by 1997, have had something to do with the bond market's
cheeriness. At the same time, the US stock market, which has existed for
many months on hope and hype, was jolted by the implied constraint on
economic growth.
It is unusual for the bond market and the equity market to move in different
directions. In the classic stock market cycle, bond prices rise first but
stock prices soon follow - albeit with a time lag of around six to 12
months. Market strategists monitor closely the ratios between fixed interest
and equity yields, and they do not expect the relationship to change very
much over time.
But we are not dealing with a normal business cycle. This week's bumper
batch of British economic statistics included confirmation of the third
successive annual fall in manufacturing output, the first time this has been
seen since the beginning of the 1930s. What is happening is something
outside the experience of post-war economic fluctuations, but fits in with
notions of a long-term Kondratieff cycle.
Normally, a rising bond market would be expected to carry the stock market
along with it. But the yield ratio has now dipped below 2, a figure which it
has exceeded consistently - averaging perhaps 2.3 - during the past 20 years
while sterling has been floating (although it also fell below 2 while the UK
was in the European exchange rate mechanism). Such a fall in the ratio says
something about pessimism over dividend growth, and also something about
optimism over low inflation.
On Tuesday, the Bank of England published its fascinating first quarterly
Inflation Report, in which it warned that the government could have
difficulty in holding underlying inflation below 4 per cent over the next
two years. My own feeling is that there is a necessity for a certain amount
of inflation in the sterling prices of traded goods so that British
manufacturing industry will gain the incentive to reverse the disturbing
trend in the balance of payments. But how can this imported inflation be
prevented from triggering pay rises?
Real incomes of those in work have continued to rise steadily during the
recession, as a red line on a Bank of England chart displays neatly. But
unemployment has passed 3m and, even on the official definition, it will
soon also be at levels not seen since the 1930s. Will employees at last grit
their teeth and submit to a cut in real pay?
In the 1930s, the inflation rate rose by around 6 percentage points after
the pound was devalued in 1931, but retail prices still increased by only
about 2 per cent a year because they had actually been falling by 4 per cent
annually from the late 1920s. Cheap money, cheap labour, cheap property and
gently rising prices permitted reasonably vigorous economic growth.
Gilt-edged yields subsided from 4.5 per cent in 1931 to about 3 per cent by
1936, and equity dividend yields fluctuated between about 5 and 3.5 per
cent; shares, being riskier, had to yield more than government bonds.
Such bond yields seem unbelievable to us today, but remember that they are
already reappearing in Japan where 10-year bonds return about 4.1 per cent.
In the UK, the most recent period of really low inflation was a six-year
spell between 1958 and 1963 when it averaged 1.9 per cent a year (including
nil in 1959).
In those conditions, gilt-edged yields held at 5 to 6 per cent and the yield
ratio was little over 1; indeed, it was in the 1959 bull market that the
phrase 'reverse yield gap' emerged. The reverse gap initially reflected
rapid growth in the economy and, therefore, in dividends, but later mainly
reflected inflation.
This week, the stuffy bankers of the IMF told the British government to
raise taxes and cut spending, the early 1930s' recipe. On the other hand,
the government is perceived generally to have an incompatible duty to keep
an overpaid and underproductive British work-force in jobs. For its part,
the government is enthusing thoughtlessly over the surely dangerous
combination of rising retail sales and stagnant industrial output.
To believe in British government bonds yielding 8 1/2 per cent, you have to
believe that the hidden hand of Kondratieff is imposing inevitable
deflation. It is no longer looking such a silly idea.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Yeltsin calls for sacking of political adversary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE for Russian political supremacy intensified yesterday when
President Boris Yeltsin called on parliament to sack his chief rival,
parliamentary speaker Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov.
Efforts to effect a truce between the two men seemed close to collapse after
Mr Khasbulatov, canvassing for support among local council leaders in
western Siberia, mocked President Yeltsin for playing games with the fate of
Russia.
In a highly personal attack, Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, Mr Yeltsin's spokesman,
urged parliament to consider firing its speaker. Mr Khasbulatov had broken a
gentleman's agreement to refrain from public polemics while the two leaders
tried to negotiate a constitutional truce, the spokesman said.
'It is becoming clear that Khasbulatov is increasingly discrediting himself
as a party in negotiations, as a politician one can do business with in
Russia.'
Mr Kostikov also accused Mr Khasbulatov of currying favour with
arch-conservatives and said he was responsible for the country's
constitutional instability.
The latest exchange confirms the near impossibility of the two former allies
resolving what has become an intensely personal struggle with deep
significance for the entire country.
Mr Yeltsin is fighting to stop the erosion of his powers by parliament. The
two rivals agreed on Tuesday to seek a formula for dividing power between
the executive and legislature.
Mr Yeltsin appeared on television proposing a division of powers that would
confine parliament to examining and passing legislation and give the
executive the freedom to take executive decisions, but Mr Khasbulatov
rejected the proposal.
He stressed that under the still-functioning communist constitution, the
parliament was 'the highest organ of power' and that any successor body
should remain so.
At yesterday's meeting in Novosibirsk, Mr Khasbulatov attacked the president
for threatening to press ahead with a constitutional referendum.
'I regret we haven't seen any concrete proposals from the president. . .
it's time to end this game. If he wants a referendum, then let's have one.
If he doesn't want one, he should say so.' The president's frequently
expressed opinion that the full parliament, the Congress of People's
Deputies, was incapable of adopting a new constitution was a 'primitive
conclusion'. He also said the country did not urgently need a new
constitution.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Greenspan backs Clinton's plan to deal with US deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton won important backing for his economic programme
yesterday when Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board chairman, praised
the plan as a 'serious proposal' to deal with the US budget deficit.
Mr Greenspan, who annoyed some Republicans by sitting next to Mrs Hillary
Rodham Clinton during President Clinton's presentation of his programme to
Congress on Wednesday night, commended Mr Clinton for proposing specific
spending cuts and tax increases in-stead of the vague caps on programmes
proposed in the past.
The Fed chairman's support gave Mr Clinton a helping hand as he travelled
across the country to drum up popular support for his proposals.
Delivering his Humphrey-Hawkins monetary testimony on Capitol Hill, Mr
Greenspan was pressed by Democratic senators to support the Clinton plan
with 'complementary' monetary policies.
However, Mr Greenspan refused to commit himself to lowering interest rates
to offset an negative impact on growth from cuts in the deficit.
The Fed 'could not specify in advance what actions might be taken in the
presence of particular fiscal policy strategies'.
It was crucial to reduce the deficit which would otherwise 'increasingly
threaten the stability of the economic system'.
However, he warned against relying too heavily on tax increases.
Since many programmes were growing faster than the tax base, stabilising the
deficit by this route would require 'ever increasing tax rates'.
There was thus no alternative to much slower growth of spending.
'I trust the president's endeavour to rein in medical costs will contribute
importantly to this goal,' he said.
In Chillicothe, Ohio, Mr Clinton said he was trying to present a balanced
programme. 'Congress will decide to vote for it in part based on whether
people in towns like Chillicothe all over America think it's a good deal,'
he said.
The administration might have to look at the introduction of a national
sales or value added tax in the years ahead, Mr Clinton said, but he did not
want to confuse the need to reform the US tax system with the more immediate
imperative of reducing the deficit.
'I mean, there's only so much change a country can accommodate at one time,'
Mr Clinton said.
The Clinton plan would raise Dollars 246bn of new taxes in 1994-97, mostly
from higher income taxes on the wealthy and from a new energy tax, with
Dollars 247bn of spending cuts.
This would be offset by spending increases and tax breaks totalling Dollars
169bn over the same period, but would still reduce the expected 1997 deficit
to Dollars 206bn, Dollars 140bn less than the current projection.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Bank probed in Britain and US: Islamic Pan American Bank at
centre of alleged Salvation Army fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, JIMMY BURNS and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ALLEGED fraud that cost the Salvation Army Dollars 8.8m (Pounds 6.2m) is
believed to be part of a much wider international fraud involving a
mysterious Argentine bank under investigation by police and regulators in
the UK and US for more than 18 months.
The bank, Islamic Pan American Bank, has been the subject of British police
investigation since the summer. The Federal Bureau of Investigation in
Dallas, Texas, investigated the bank in July 1991 in connection with an
insurance fraud which has since resulted in the conviction and jailing of a
financier.
The US Comptroller of the Currency, the regulator of US banks, said
yesterday it had issued a formal warning on October 16 1991 that Islamic Pan
American and an affiliate, identified as Eastech, may have been operating a
banking business from Dallas, Texas, without authorisation. Both remain on
the Comptroller's warning list.
The Salvation Army - which has an income of Pounds 80m a year, of which
Pounds 12m comes from public donations - filed a fraud complaint in relation
to the loss of funds with the Metropolitan and City Police Company Fraud
Squad.
One of the most successful religious fund-raisers, the Salvation Army has
remained silent on the affair as investigations have deepened, although it
said one of its officers had been suspended on full pay. The affair only
came to light when, earlier this week, the Salvation Army issued a writ to
recover its money.
The Salvation Army, in its writ, seeks the return of Dollars 8.8m from bank
accounts which, it claims, were intended to be used in the purchase or sale
of standby letters of credit.
The writ to recover missing cash names the Islamic Pan American Bank,
nominally headquartered in Buenos Aires, as one of a number of international
banks and companies possibly holding its funds.
A standby letter of credit is a guarantee from a bank to a customer that it
will honour that customer's trade debts to a third party. They can be used
as collateral to borrow funds or be traded.
It is understood that the Islamic Pan American Bank was at the centre of a
police inquiry begun after a UK importer, claiming funds under standby
letters of credit provided by Islamic Pan American, found no trace of the
bank. The importer had tried to collect the funds after a shipment of goods
failed to arrive.
Regulatory authorities in the UK and the Argentine police, through Interpol,
were aware of the investigation.
According to the July 1992 edition of the Bankers Almanac, Islamic Pan
American is based in Buenos Aires with US offices at 6510 Abrams Road, Suite
300, Dallas, Texas. The telephone number for the address was contacted by
the Financial Times. It was answered by a Mr Jim Burch of commodity traders
Interfin. Mr Burch said he had lost Pounds 15,000 in a transaction involving
an individual claiming to represent Islamic Pan American Bank.
The Almanac says the bank has Dollars 286m capital. However, a regulator
said: 'We do not believe all the information in the Almanac.' The Almanac
also says that Price Waterhouse, the accountant, is the bank's auditor.
PW said last night that Islamic Pan American Bank was not a client of either
its Argentina practice or any other member firm in South America and that it
would be investigating the connection claimed by the bank.
The Buenos Aires address given in the Almanac appears to have been occupied
by Arab News Agency, which is listed in the Almanac as a subsidiary of
Islamic Pan American. Pinned to Arab News Agency's door is a notice saying
that the office was closed down by judge's order on 17 October 1991.
The solicitor acting for Mr Stuart Ford, one of the defendants in the
Salvations Army's civil case to recover missing funds, said yesterday that
Mr Ford denied any wrongdoing: 'His view is that everything will be sorted
out to the satisfaction of the Salvation Army on his return (to the UK),' Mr
Jim Crocker, of solicitor Howell and Co, said.
The Salvation Army's writ accuses Mr Ford, Tilen Securities and Mr Gamil
Naguib of 'fraudulently representing to the Salvation Army that they
proposed to invest and/or had invested Dollars 10m . . . and/or the sum of
Dollars 8.8m . . . in the purchase and sale of standby letters of credit.'
The three are also accused of 'misappropriating' the Dollars 8.8m and using
it for their own purposes.
Mr Ford made at least two property transactions and it was these which led
to the involvement in the affair of Edge &amp; Ellison, a leading Birmingham law
partnership. Between three and four weeks ago, Edge &amp; Ellison received a
telephone call from the Salvation Army, alleging that Mr Ford had absconded
with its money. Edge &amp; Ellison acted for Mr Ford in the purchase of
properties in Scotland and England.

<TEXT>
In its predictably sniffy way, the Bundesbank was quick to stress the
distortion in January's 2.3 per cent fall in M3 money supply. It has a case.
The base on which the figure rests is the average money supply for the final
quarter of last year when it was bloated by currency intervention. In
January, some of that excess drained out of the money market. That creates a
ready excuse for not bringing forward any official rate cuts. Equally,
though, the bank is running out of reasons for holding tight much longer.
The year has started off with such a fall that money growth will probably be
below target for two or three months at least.
Excessive growth of M3 was a useful justification for tight money when the
Bundesbank was also worried about the budget deficit and wage growth. Its
anxiety about the former is unlikely to abate much in the foreseeable
future, but with the real economy weakening rapidly, pressure for lower
rates is increasing. One by one, the arguments against are falling away.
The threat to German import prices of a stronger dollar looks less after
yesterday's congressional testimony by Mr Alan Greenspan. He showed no sign
of putting up US interest rates again. Next week could see German consumer
price inflation drop as February figures become available from the regions.
Even so, the Bundesbank may wait to see a trend. To emphasise its caution,
it also chose to downplay January's sharp year-on-year deceleration in bank
lending to the private sector. Instead, officials point to total bank
lending growth of 8.5 per cent in the six months to January. They seem
determined to hold out till the last.

FT  20 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Airtours/Owners Abroad
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Office of Fair Trading has been taking an uncommonly long time to decide
whether to refer Airtours' Pounds 221m bid for Owners Abroad to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission. This is surprising, given there is such a
strong prima facie case for examining the competition issues. Consumer
groups believe the acquisition would accelerate the trend towards vertical
integration, hurting small operators. Even Airtours was arguing this line in
its 1991 annual report before the bid. It boasted about the advantages of
integration which it claimed was making it difficult for new entrants to
distribute their products.
A referral would theoretically leave Owners free to pursue its preferred
strategic alliance with Thomas Cook. Shareholders might reject that
proposal, however, if they thought there was any chance of Airtours
returning to the fray. To date, Airtours has not said whether it will bid
again if its offer is cleared. But it might do so, considering its arguments
appear to be winning over the City.
Owners has a lacklustre record. This week's annual report, containing some
worrying contingent liabilities, have not improved shareholder loyalty. A
cash sweetener from Airtours could well seal its eventual success. But those
investors who regard tour operators with suspicion have been given further
reason to shun the sector. Owners' focus on Airtours' vulnerability to price
wars will have only reinforced their prejudice.

FT  20 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Aircraft orders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Boeing's decision to reduce its workforce was inevitable after last month's
announcement of production cutbacks. While the scale of redundancies may
have been unexpected, it only underlines the miserable state of the aircraft
production industry. Output by the three main producers, which reached 860
airplanes in 1991, may fall below 500 next year. The North American market
is particularly poor, with fare wars pushing many carriers into the red and
forcing them to cancel aircraft orders.
That has hit Boeing in its home market. Airbus has a better geographical
spread of customers, notably in the growing Far East market, but the
European consortium is hardly immune. Airbus had hoped to expand production
substantially as its new A330 and A340 aircraft came on stream. Now it is
having to cut. Indeed, with both manufacturers determined to avoid large
numbers of unsold airplanes sitting on the tarmac, output will fall faster
than in previous recessions. Airbus has already slowed production once and
may have to cut output by a further 10 per cent in the next few months.
Leased aircraft may also prove a problem. Some carriers, can return
airplanes to the manufacturers at very short notice. At least 25 Airbuses
currently leased by American Airlines could be returned. The consortium
members, including British Aerospace, would have to carry the financing cost
of such aircraft. While the problem is not as severe, it is an unpleasant
reminder of the financing debacle in BAe's regional jet business.

FT  20 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Taxing time for shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street's 83-point fall on Tuesday was a sharp reminder of what can
happen to equity markets when governments decide to take decisive action on
budget deficits. It remains nervous even though investors quickly remembered
that the tax increases would actually have to be passed by Congress and that
the measures would, in any case, have little impact on growth this year.
London is not trading on quite such a high multiple, but UK share prices
could also become sensitive to the threat of fiscal discipline on March 16.
All the more so since the government has talked itself into such a corner
that hopes of lower interest rates are fading.
Indeed, the equity market is starting to look bereft of supportive
background factors. With over Pounds 2bn in rights issues so far this year,
institutional cash is getting rather tight. That could explain why
unfashionable stocks find it so difficult to attract support. Glaxo, for
example, fell a further 3 per cent yesterday, despite Thursday's favourable
results.
At least the first report of the seven wise men is some consolation, though
its policy impact remains uncertain. By choosing a panel of such widely
varying views, the Treasury has left itself a wide degree of latitude. But
none of the experts expect tax increases of more than Pounds 4bn in this
budget. Six of them think no tax increases at all should take effect in
1993. It would be difficult for Mr Lamont to announce any significant
tightening without explaining why he has rejected the panel's advice.

FT  20 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Late demand surge firms up
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
A DIFFICULT week ended with US markets in a calm, if still slightly nervous,
mood, although the leading stock indices finished notably firmer due to a
late surge of demand linked to options expirations, writes Patrick Harverson
in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 19.99 at 3,322.18, at
its high for the day. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 also ended
strongly, finishing up 2.30 at 434.20, while the Amex composite closed up
0.10 at 402.38, and the Nasdaq composite up 1.17 at 663.62. Trading volume
on the NYSE was 309m shares, and rises outnumbered declines by 1,260 to 671.
After the tribulations of Tuesday and Thursday, when share prices gyrated
wildly and posted big losses following news of President Bill Clinton's
first budget plans, share prices spent most of the morning session trading
narrowly on either side of opening values.
Underneath the a calm surface , however, there were various undercurrents,
most of them created by trading related to the monthly expiration of
stock-index options, an event which, despite threatening to create
considerable volatility in the afternoon session, passed uneventfully.
Some investors and analysts drew comfort from the market's ability to hold
its own late on Thursday (when the Dow bounced back from a 44-point deficit
to end just 10 points lower), and again yesterday, in the wake of the heavy
selling earlier in the week.
Among individual sectors, bank stocks roared ahead, buoyed by low interest
rates, and comments from Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve,
who told Congress that, as the economic situation improved, banks and thrift
companies were ready to meet increased loan demand.
Citicorp rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 26 1/4 , BankAmerica added Dollars 2
1/8 at Dollars 52 1/8 , Chemical firmed Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 41, Banc
One rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 51 7/8 , Wells Fargo jumped Dollars 2 3/4
to Dollars 92 7/8 , and Chase Manhattan climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 30
3/4 .
Drug stocks, however, once again tumbled, still troubled by fears that, as
part of healthcare reforms, the president will impose restrictions on
pharmaceuticals prices.
Pfizer led the way lower, dropping Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 54 1/2 in volume
of 3.7m shares, followed by Merck, which fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 36 7/8 in
volume of 3.3m shares, Schering-Plough, down Dollars 3 at Dollars 53 3/4 ,
and Bristol-Myers Squibb, Dollars 1 1/2 weaker at Dollars 54 5/8 .
Canada
TORONTO closed higher in moderate trading, as a modest late-afternoon rally
helped the market end the week on a strong note.
The 300 composite index rose 16.89 points, or 0.50 per cent. to close at
3,426.31. On the week, the index fell about 19 points.
All 14 sub-indices closed higher on the day, led by real estate, up 2.0 per
cent on news that the last of Bramalea's creditor groups approved the
company's restructuring plan. 'A' stock of Trizec, which owns 67 per cent of
Bramalea, rose 0.20 to 2.65, while Trizec 'B' climbed 0.30 to 2.80.

FT  20 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Utilities gain ground on
higher yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices moved up marginally in quiet trading ahead of the weekend as
most investors remained inactive after another day of volatility on the
currency market, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225-issue average gained 27.89 to 17,010.03 on last minute,
arbitrage-related buying, leaving it 0.9 per cent higher on the week. After
moving within a narrow range in the morning, the index fell to the day's low
of 16,887.53 in the afternoon before rising to a high of 17,023.58 just
before the close.
Volume fell to 220m shares against 250m. Losers led gainers by 477 to 420
with 228 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
gained 0.94 to 1,294.06 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.18 to
1,035.99.
The Nikkei index has fluctuated within a 343 point range during the week and
many traders expect the market to remain around 17,000 with buying by public
funds preventing a heavy fall. Mr Alan Livsey at Kleinwort Benson said that
the bear market seemed to have ended but that little would happen for the
next month or so.
Electric utilities, which depend on debt to fund capital investment, gained
ground on the higher yen and lower bond yields. Tokyo Electric Power
advanced Y10 to Y2,570 and Tohoku Electric Power added Y50 to Y2,540.
Steel issues were higher on buying by institutional investors, trying to
take advantage of the stocks' dividend potential ahead of the March
book-closing. Nippon Steel put on Y3 to Y298 and NKK appreciated Y3 to Y259.
Sony lost Y100 to Y4,000 after the company announced a 62 per cent fall in
consolidated pre-tax profits for the three months ending in December. Some
investors fear that the current strength of the yen will depress Sony's
profits further.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 34.27 to 18,385.54 in volume of 62.6m shares.
Selling was centred around high-technology issues, while pharmaceuticals
were also weak on profit taking.
Roundup
A GOOD week for the region, particularly for Hong Kong, ended relatively
quietly. Bombay was closed for a Hindu holiday and will reopen on Monday.
HONG KONG ended a nine-day rally, but political optimism lingered on as
profit-taking pushing the Hang Seng index down by a token 16.85 to 6,170.09,
5.3 per cent higher on the week and 7.4 per cent better on the past ten
trading days.
Turnover rose from HKDollars 3.73bn to HKDollars 3.90bn. There were still
buyers in some senior blue chips with the most active stock, HSBC, gaining
HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 64; but the second in line, Jardine Matheson fell
HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 49.25.
AUSTRALIA reflected a spate of selling orders in afternoon trade, the All
Ordinaries index closing 12.6 down at 1,594.7, 0.5 per cent down on the week
in turnover of ADollars 263.5m.
BHP fell 14 cents to ADollars 14.10 in spite of a favourable January
production report, but John Fairfax closed three cents higher at ADollars
1.89 after announcing interim net profits.
NEW ZEALAND took its third successive tumble, the NYSE-40 losing 18.4 at
1,572.53 after a heavy gain on Tuesday when Telecom announced heavy
reductions in its workforce. TAIWAN's weighted index ended 48.83 at 3,912.67
on profit-taking, still 3.6 per cent up on the week.
MANILA remained positive with blue chips providing support to the market.
The composite index gained 14.98 to 1,473.24, a rise of 4.8 per cent on the
week. Turnover was strong at 737m pesos from 610m pesos.
SINGAPORE closed off the day's highs as investors took profits and the
Straits Times industrial index rose 6.91 to 1,639.04, up 1.6 per cent on the
week.

FT  20 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Milan ignores politics in Fiat-led
euphoria - This week's rally in equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sentiment, rather than fundamentals, has been driving Milan forward this
week. In spite of growing political uncertainties, reinforced by yesterday's
resignation of two cabinet ministers, a gloomy economic outlook and
distinctly poor corporate earnings, the buying bandwagon has been enough to
push the Comit index up 2.3 per cent on the week.
The motor for this rally has been Fiat, Italy's biggest private-sector
company, which on two separate days this week rose by some 10 per cent,
closing yesterday at L5,360. The massive buying of its shares has been
enough to trigger a general re-appraisal of Italian blue chips.
There are legitimate grounds for greater optimism about Fiat. Ms Dagmar
Bottenbruch of CSFB in Milan has recommended the stock as a 'buy' after
lengthy scepticism. Among the reasons she identifies as advantageous for the
group are the lira's departure from the ERM and last summer's agreement to
abolish the 'scala mobile' wage indexation system.
While the cheaper lira and lower wage growth will help the company improve
its margins, a wave of new models will refresh its ageing line-up; and
expectations of sales of subsidiaries such as Rinascente, Toro or
Cogefar-Impresit will also provide big extraordinary gains to help tide the
group over its current heavy investment phase.
Such prospects, echoed by some other analysts, have been enough to trigger a
general reconsideration of Fiat's shares, especially by foreigners, who have
pared Italian holdings to the bone. Early buying turned into a wave this
week as rumours of imminent asset sales or a tie-up with another car group
swept the market.
The realities are appreciably different: the company has repeatedly denied
that it is talking to either Peugeot or Toyota - the two most-tipped names -
and, indeed, the French and Japanese companies have issued denials of their
own. Fiat has also maintained that negotiations on asset sales are not under
way, although admitting that it has had some approaches.
Even the industrial outlook hardly warrants this week's euphoria. Recession
in other European car markets has now reached Italy, where demand fell by
almost 14 per cent in January. Competition from foreign manufacturers,
especially the Japanese, also remains acute with Nissan, in particular,
increasing its penetration.
Two other factors have contributed to the buoyant mood. The weak lira makes
Italian shares look cheap for foreign investors and domestic institutions
have been coming back into the market as a result of interest rate cuts. A
statement by Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, that promised
incentives to buy shares would be pushed into law more quickly than expected
provided an additional tonic.
'The market has decided to interpret all the news positively,' says Mr
Marcello Sallusti, an analyst at Gemina. 'And bad news has been largely
ignored. So shares have been moved by speculation and the fact that many
portfolios have been very underweight in Italian equities.'
The buying, however, has been somewhat unselective. While purchases,
especially from abroad, have focused on blue chips, prime companies such as
Benetton, Parmalat, Italgas or Edison, seen as among the biggest
beneficiaries of the lira's decline, have not risen as strongly as many
others.
Many analysts struggle to justify buying big corporates such as Olivetti or
Montedison, given the poor outlook for both; and the heavy buying of
utilities such as Stet and Sip seems to be based as much on liquidity in the
shares - making it easy to sell quickly if necessary - as on more
fundamental factors.
For those still interested in fundamentals, there is little to commend the
bourse at present. 'The market has gone beyond fundamental values,' says Ms
Paola Bergamaschi of Goldman Sachs. 'It's a real trading market in the short
term. You either buy and then sell quickly, or hold the stock long-term in
expectation of a better political and economic climate.'
The risks are high. Politically, the coalition government of Mr Giuliano
Amato is looking increasingly fragile, more so after yesterday's
resignations of Mr Giovanni Goria, the finance minister, and Mr Francesco De
Lorenzo, the health minister. The resulting uncertainty has had the effect
of depressing the lira exchange rate, with the currency falling to around
L950 against the D-Mark.
Economically, the recession is deepening, with rising unemployment and
slowing output. Meanwhile, the outlook for corporate profits remains gloomy.
Very poor 1992 earnings, which will begin to be announced from next month,
have already been discounted. Many analysts admit prospects for this year
are little better.
Some point to 1994 as the year of recovery. But even if there is light at
the end of the tunnel, it is too far ahead to warrant the current euphoria.

FT  20 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses little changed on
German M3 drop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SURPRISE contraction in German money supply in January did little for
bourses yesterday, especially for Frankfurt itself, writes Our Markets
Staff.
At 16.30 in London the FT-SE Eurotrack index was only 1.85 higher at
1,134.80. Dealers said that the M3 figures were another step towards the
next cut in German interest rates, but they did not think that the next cut
was imminent.
FRANKFURT saw the DAX index up 5.13 to 1,677.39 over the official session,
up 1 per cent on the week, and an estimated six points more in the domestic
post-bourse, but by late afternoon in London the extra gains had virtually
disappeared.
Individual equities and sectors extended the themes of the week. Car stocks,
already relatively weak, were dragged down by Volkswagen. VW fell DM8.60 on
the day, DM18.90 on the week to DM278.80; it had been suffering from a
downgrade by DB Research just over a week ago, and yesterday it was more
sensitive than its competitors to January registration data which showed a
27.5 per cent fall from last year and a drop of 18.3 per cent from a record
December.
Like VW, the other main theme stock, Bayernhypo, might also have been
affected by expiration of options contracts on the Deutsche Terminborse,
reflected in a surge in German equity market turnover from DM6.5bn to
DM9.4bn. It has also been a major play on interest rates, rising DM6.80 on
the day, and DM18.80 on the week to DM434.80.
Some stocks moved on a lack of news. Lufthansa, seen as a turnround
situation and one of the strongest performers in the DAX this year, rose
another DM5.50 to DM124. Schering, in pharmaceuticals, put on DM19 to
DM742.50 for a rise on the week of DM34.50.
PARIS took some motivation from the German data but generally activity in
the market was concentrated in second-line stocks. The CAC-40 index rose
10.60 to 1,937.17 in turnover of FFr3.7bn, up 1.3 per cent on the week.
With an easing in domestic short-term interest rates this week, some
analysts expect France to make a gesture towards further easing in the
short-term, particularly as next month's elections approach. This, they
argue, will feed through into the market with the CAC able to break through
2,000.
Among blue chips, financials firmed while reports of a bullish broker's
research document on insurers helped Axa to a gain of FFr14 to FFr1,158.
Societe Generale went against the trend, down FFr1 at FFr634, on reports
that it had lost money on options trading.
LVMH eased FFr60 to FFr3,330 as the group denied rumours, active on
Thursday, of restructuring plans. Other elements of Mr Bernard Arnault's
group rose: Christian Dior up FFr12.10 at FFr256.10 and Bon Marche FFr9
higher at FFr563.
ZURICH declined on profit-taking, especially in the chemicals sector, the
SMI index falling 14.6 to 2,117.3, 0.9 per cent lower on the week.
Among chemicals, still shaken by healthcare reforms in the US, Roche
certificates fell SFr40 to SFr4,090 and Sandoz SFr90 to SFr3,060. Meanwhile,
a slight increase in money market rates discouraged buying in the insurance
sector, where Zurich and Winterthur were both unchanged at SFr2,200, and
SFr3,210 respectively.
AMSTERDAM was stronger on options expiry, in the absence of corporate news.
The CBS Tendency index rose 0.7 to 99.7 fora gain of 0.8 per cent on the
week. Ahold was one of the day's main exceptions, Fl 1.60 lower at Fl 91.60
as finance stocks showed broad gains, with Amev up Fl 1.10 at Fl 67.90 and
ING Fl 1.20 firmer at Fl 62.60.
STOCKHOLM saw Astra fall SKr7 in the B shares to SKr694 ahead of Monday's
results. The Affarsvarlden General index climbed 3.07 to 987.97 in high
turnover of SKr1.14bn, up 0.7 per cent on the week.
S-E Banken continued to weaken following its announcement on Thursday of
heavy losses and the C shares eased SKr1 to SKr11.
OSLO was encouraged by falling money market rates and the all-share index
gained 3.01 to 401.75 in turnover of NKr450m.
Among the actives, Norsk Hydro and Kvaerner both gained NKr1.50, to NKr164
and NKr164.50 respectively.
TEL AVIV fell in a second consecutive day of sharp losses as the market
reacted to more comments by politicians, who said that institutional
investors are manipulating share prices, dealers said.
The blue chip shares index lost 7.95, or 3.9 per cent to 194.63.

tie-up between Queens Moat Houses and Bass sent shares in both group smartly
forward yesterday. However, sources close to the negotiations, which have
been continuing since the autumn, suggested that only a limited deal would
be announced, squashing rumours that Bass was considering taking a stake in
Queens Moat in return for the latter taking a leading role in running Bass's
European Holiday Inn operations.
The indications are that only a handful of hotels will be involved in the
deal, with Queens Moat taking the Holiday Inn franchise for these in return
for a small percentage of each unit's turnover. But the hints of an
agreement lifted sentiment in both stocks. Queens Moat, Britain's second
biggest hotelier, put on 3 1/2 to 54p in turnover of 5.9m. Bass jumped 19 to
604p in 2.7m traded.
Land Secs. active
Further evidence emerged yesterday of the growing liquidity in the moribund
commercial property market as Land Securities said it was in negotiations to
sell one of its office developments in a deal thought to be worth around
Pounds 70m. The news added impetus to the group's shares which have
strengthened in recent weeks on the back of falling interest rates and
growing investor interest in the sector. After rallying, they later slipped
back to close 1 1/2 up at 474p.
In the deal, Land Securities, the UK's biggest property group, would swap an
office block in the City of London for the St David's shopping centre in
Cardiff owned by Coal Board Investment Nominees. Details of any cash
differential are being discussed.
Earlier this week, Hammerson announced a Pounds 21m office disposal, while
the receivers of Mountleigh, the property company that failed last May, sold
the group's largest UK asset, for Pounds 128m to Chelsfield. Hammerson
shares rose a penny to 294p.
Alert at Lasmo
Bid speculation, a more positive outlook on the dividend, and a single large
buyer of the shares helped make Lasmo a strong feature. The shares closed 7
up at 179p, as volume rose to a healthy 6.4m, with some of the buying said
to have come from the US.
Suggestions that the company is a takeover target returned with British Gas
and Enterprise Oil named as likely suitors. Several brokers have recently
turned more positive on the dividend outlook ahead of the results due at the
end of March and Smith New Court have recommended the stock.
However, analysts at Strauss Turnbull remain cautious and said that'the
financial problems at the company are well recognised and the problem is
unlikely to be resolved this year unless we see a dramatic rebound in oil
prices which we think is unlikely.'
British Gas fell 4 to to 287 1/2 p, on turnover of 4.6m, while Enterprise
eased 1 1/2 to 453p.
A badly-handled sale order and nervous trading ahead of Tuesday's figures
hurt Sedgwick, the insurance broker, and the shares gave up 9 to 169p. In
the life sector, United Friendly put on 20 to 600p after overnight trades
were executed at the 600p level.
Among other oil related stocks, a squeeze in Ramco Oil sent the shares
climbing 17 to 126p, while profit-taking was said to have been the reason
for the fall in Pittencrieff which lost 14 to 360p, after a presentation to
analysts on Thursday evening. Shell Transport eased a penny to 581p in
nervous trading ahead of figures next Thursday.
Suggestions that Allied Lyons was about to sell its Chateau Latour business
to French luxury goods group LVMH were strongly denied by its crossholding
partner Guinness, but not before shares in London had been affected by the
rumour. Allied gained 10 to 608p, while Guinness slipped 2 1/2 to 468 1/2 p.
Shares in Kwik Save rose strongly, up 19 at 819p, as its largest shareholder
Dairy Farms took its stake to past 28 per cent in the discount food group.
United Biscuits admitted it was considering selling Terry's chocolate
business and the shares responded by adding 4 to 354p. Unilever lost 7 to
1146p on nerves ahead of figures next week.
Shares in British Aerospace were once again in favour ahead of the figures
next week. The shares added 12 to 262p. Many analysts are predicting a big
loss for the year and are expected to use Wednesday's results meeting to
confirm or adjust forecasts for the current year which range between Pounds
120 and Pounds 150m.
The squeeze along with talk of an improvement in UK car sales figures
boosted GKN and the shares added another 4 to 476p.
Fears of cutbacks in orders from US customers continued to weaken Smiths
Industries and the shares lost another 5 to 342p.
A large buyer of GEC caused a squeeze and the shares advanced 7 to 297p. UBS
Phillips and Drew was said to have upgraded the group. Racal Electronics
jumped 10 to 199p. Credit Lyonnais Laing was said to be keen. Vodafone rose
3 to 395p following a big analysts' presentation on Thursday.
Some activity in Mirror Group saw the shares fall 3 to 106p as the group
denied reports of a boardroom coup.
Analysts attributed the fall in Bowater's stocks to traders compensating for
a previous overheating which had followed the company's earlier successful
rights issue.
Blue Circle finished down 1p, in spite of an earlier sharp rise prompted by
a combination of continued bid speculation and a yield of 6.5 per cent
against a market dividend yield of 4.39 per cent.
BPB's strong performance - the company finished up 5 at 234p - was saidb by
analysts to be the result of a successful series of marketing trips and a
recent price increase in the company's main product, plaster board.
Spring Ram finished down another 6p at 123p on market rumours that bear
raiders have targetted the company.
Hartstone, the hosiery and leather goods distributor, closed at 267p up 16p
as volatile trade continued following the announcement that one of the
company's executives was taking control of Cupid, the loss-making bridal and
formal wear group.

FT  20 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities close firmly in calm trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NERVOUS week on the UK stock market closed with share prices edging higher
as US markets continued to respond to President Clinton's State of the Union
message, and an unexpected fall in German M3 money supply rekindled hopes
that UK base rates could be reduced again soon. Trading volume in UK
equities was steady rather than exciting but dealers said that market
confidence had been helped by this week's UK economic data.
Although the 2.3 per cent fall in the German money supply figure was quickly
described by the Bundesbank as a 'distortion', the announcement reinforced
sterling's firmness and also the view of some City analysts that a slowdown
in the German economy will take the pressure off the pound, opening the way
for further cuts in UK base rates.
Government bond prices gained more than half a point yesterday, encouraged
also by comments from the team of independent UK economic forecasts known as
the 'seven wise men'; one of the team called for two more one point cuts in
base rates in the next few months.
Index-linked gilts, the prime anti-inflation hedge instrument, lagged well
behind the conventional bond sector.
Cautious at first because of Wall Street's easier trend overnight, equities
soon climbed by 8 Footsie points, before reversing to show a fall of 5.
Traders said there was little significant selling and buyers reappeared as
the German money supply news was followed by favourable reports from the
Humphrey Hawkins testimony to Congress by Mr Alan Greenspan, head of the
Federal Reserve.
At the close, the FT-SE Index was just 2.3 ahead at 2,840. After plunging
sharply on Tuesday when Wall Street fell ahead of President Clinton's
speech, the UK market has steadied to show a net fall of only 3 points on
the FT-SE scale since the previous Friday's close.
Retail, or customer, interest in equities, which has remained high all week,
was worth Pounds 1.46bn on Thursday. Seaq volume of 533m shares yesterday,
of which about 65 per cent was in non-Footsie stocks, compared with 637.1m
in the previous session.
Activity in the second line issues was also reflected in the rise of 8
points in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index which closed last night at 3,048.3, within
four points of its peak.
Speculative interest was reawakened in a number of takeover candidates but
traders refused to become over-excited. 'Today showed a solid performance by
UK equities which have this week held on to the resistance area around the
FT-SE 2,800,' said one.

<TEXT>
THE derivatives sector ended an active week with a volatile session in the
futures as the March contract on the FT-SE reacted to profit taking and
favourable economic data, writes Joel Kibazo.
March opened at 2,836 but soon moved ahead to 2,847 on sporadic buying. It
however fell back as the expiry of the February index options approached at
10.30am.
A call for further cuts in UK base rates from a group of economists again
sent the contract moving forward, and buying was boosted by data showing a
fall in German money supply.
March maintained its upward momentum with the firm Wall Street opening
before following New York lower.
March finished at 2,837, up 2 on its previous close and at a 4 point
discount to the underlying cash market. Volume was 9,371 lots.
In the traded options, the expiry of the February index options was the main
feature. Total volume was 23,662 lots of which 9,816 was dealt in the FT-SE
100 options.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Money Markets: German M3 tumbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BIG fall in German money supply gave initial hope for a cut in interest
rates shortly. However, further consideration suggested the drop merely
reflected the new base on which the figures are calculated, writes Peter
John.
The Bundesbank announced yesterday that M3 money supply contracted at an
annualised rate of 2.3 per cent in January after an 8.7 per cent rise in
December.
The news caught the markets by surprise and briefly sent German futures
upwards. However, the figure was rebased on the fourth quarter of last year
rather than the fourth quarter of 1991. The fourth quarter of last year saw
money supply artificially boosted by the heavy intervention to prop up the
French franc. Economists said that without the one-off outpouring of money
M3 would actually have risen slightly.
Mr Brian Hilliard, an economist with Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull said:
'It is not giving a clear signal of a cut in interest rates. The figures
came out the day after a Bundesbank meeting. They must have been known on
Thursday and if Germany wanted to cut it would have done so then.'
Nevertheless, not everyone took such a bearish view and the June D-Mark
future which opened at 92.90 was bid up to 93.00 before profit takers moved
in and it settled at 92.97 with 44,000 contracts traded. One dealer argued
that the contract was already discounting a 1 3/8 per cent fall.
In the UK, short sterling was bid up to 94.08 in the March contract with
more than 23,000 lots dealt. March is generally viewed as a stable hedge as
most analysts believe there will be no interest rate cut before the Budget.
Money market operations were comfortably settled with a reasonably large
shortage well taken out. The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage
of around Pounds 1.55bn. The majority of the shortage was taken out
immediately with the central Bank buying Pounds 1,132m of bills. At the late
morning round of assistance, the Bank nudged the forecast back to Pounds
1.5bn and bought Pounds 200m in band one bills at 5 7/8 per cent. In the
afternoon, the Bank bought a further Pounds 170m of bills at the same rate.
However, concerns continued that the concertina effect of a number of loans
expiring next week will mean that money could become very tight.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Currencies resist pointers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HANDFUL of signals from the world's financial leaders did little more than
leave international currencies wallowing yesterday, writes Peter John.
Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, hinted he was
unlikely to raise interest rates. The Bundesbank stamped on hopes that it
might cut interest rates soon. Japanese ministers worked to slow the rise of
the Yen. And in the UK, the 'Seven Wise Men' stood out against higher taxes,
a move that might prompt a base rate cut.
However, the respective currencies did little to reflect the comments and it
was left to the Swedish Krona to make a decisive shift while ministerial
resignations in Italy prompted heavy selling of the Lira.
The dollar spent most of the day around the DM1.63 level and ended little
changed in Europe at DM1.6360, up from DM1.6335.
The generally stronger pound rose to Dollars 1.4530 from Dollars 1.4455.
In Japan, the Yen failed to respond to comments by Mr Yoshiro Mori, the
minister for International Trade and Industry, that it had risen too fast.
After closing at Y119.30 against the dollar in Tokyo overnight it rose to
Y119.10 with one one economist forecasting Y115 shortly.
Sterling rallied from recent doldrums as expectations of an early rate cut
faded. The pound was almost three pfennigs higher against the D-Mark at one
stage but sellers moved in toward the close and it ended the day 1.75
pfennigs better at DM2.3775. There was a feeling that it could breach DM2.40
soon. However, Mr Neil Mackinnon, the senior economist with Citibank
commented: 'The bounce in retail spending and the recent recovery in bank
lending were one-offs. Given the upward trend in unemployment a further rate
cut is on the cards.'
In Sweden, the central bank intervened to support the krona for the third
day running after it hit a record low of SKr4.66 against the D-Mark.
Nevertheless, some economists predict that with inflation falling and the
economy in recession, the currency will fall to SKr4.80 within the next six
months. The krona rallied to SK4.6172 against the D-Mark from SKr4.6208.
Meanwhile, the Lira was under pressure after an announcement that two
government ministers had resigned, generating worries about the stability of
prime minister Giuliano Amato's administration. The Lira closed at L959.2
against the D-Mark, down from L953.4.
In Spain, the central bank intervened to support the peseta which has been
falling steadily against the D-mark. The Spanish currency rallied to
Pta71.70 from Pta71.78.

FT  20 FEB 93 / International Company News: Olivetti pins survival hope on
specialisation - Can Carlo De Benedetti save his company twice?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Carlo De Benedetti, Olivetti chairman, cuts through the politely oblique
inquiries about his company's health like a surgeon wielding a scalpel: 'The
question you should be asking,' he says reprovingly, 'is can Olivetti
survive?'
His point is well taken. Olivetti may still be the largest European-owned
manufacturer of personal computers, printers and related equipment, but its
financial results in the past two years have made dismal reading.
The company lost L460bn (Dollars 297.5m) in 1991 after heavy restructuring
costs and is likely to post an operating loss for 1992 of between L300bn and
L350bn. Further restructuring charges are expected to add substantially to
the final loss figure, bringing it up to an estimated L750bn.
Mr De Benedetti, whose holding company, CIR, has a 38 per cent stake of
Olivetti's ordinary shares, has no doubts that the group cannot survive for
long without stemming the flow of red ink and returning to profitability,
He claims, however, that Olivetti's chief problems are not financial,
drawing attention to its strong balance sheet and predominantly long-term
maturity of its debts. 'Our problem is whether we can successfully execute
our survival strategy. We have to convince our large customers that we will
be around in five years' time,' he says.
Olivetti, in common with the rest of the world's main computer
manufacturers, has been hit hard by profound changes in the indystry's
structure.
Hardware prices have plummeted - personal computer prices fell by 75 per
cent between 1991 and 1992. Customers are demanding 'open' or
industry-standard computers that command low gross profit margins rather
than the proprietary designs which have dominated the industry to date.
Olivetti's sales fell 6.8 per cent from L8,607bn to L8,025bn in 1992,
reflecting lower hardware costs, intense competition and the state of the
European economy.
The company, however, is also fighting to eliminate the effects of two
disastrous strategic errors that have compounded its problems.
The purchase of the office equipment manufacturer Triumph Adler from
Volkswagen in 1986. Triumph Adler will represent the largest element in the
1992 losses - half in operating losses, half in restructuring charges. The
restructuring element is believed to have amounted to about L150bn. A
further, much smaller, charge will have to be taken this year; by December,
Triumph Adler will have fewer than 200 staff compared with 3,000 in 1988.
The decision in 1988 by Mr Vittorio Cassoni, the former managing director to
meet the challenge of a fragmenting market by dividing the company into
three separate units to handle office products, systems and networks and
information services. The duplication of effort cost Olivetti dear as the
overall market collapsed. The three divisions have been wrapped back into a
single company.
Mr De Benedetti believes Olivetti has three characteristics that will enable
it to survive its greatest test.
First, it has proved its culture is adaptable to change. When he bought into
Olivetti in 1978, it was a loss-making typewriter company. He earned his
international reputation transforming the Ivrea-based concern into Europe's
most successful personal computer manufacturer, shifting first from
mechanical to electronic typewriters, then into PCs.
But can Mr De Benedetti manage the trick a second time? He says the company
has adaptability in its genes. He took day-to-day control of Olivetti in
1991, moving Mr Cassoni sideways to the role of international ambassador.
More recently he has appointed Mr Corrado Passera, one of his most trusted
lieutenants, to the post of joint managing director, but he emphasises his
continuing personal and financial commitment to the company.
'Olivetti is my life. It is run by an entrepreneur who is here in the office
every day and who has no interest in short-termism,' says Mr De Benedetti.
Second, it has made the right strategic choices. It has already moved away
from manufacturing in favour of software and services: 'We do not have
factories any more,' Mr De Benedetti says, with only a little hyperbole. At
one stage in the 1980s, there were 14,000 people in manufacturing. By the
end of the year there will be only 4,700.
Mr Passera fleshes out the strategy: 'We have become a systems company. Our
turnover can now be subdivided into three parts of more or less equal size -
professional services, systems and products. Office products, for example,
which used to generate 80 per cent of revenues, now generate only 10 per
cent.'
'Our focus is on Europe and on specific industries such as banking and
financial services. Other markets are marginal. Our target size for the end
of 1993 is 37,000. That gives us critical mass for professional services and
for networking.'
The strategy means the company will be retrenching in regions such as
Australia, the US and Canada, where the aim will be to avoid losses rather
than make profits.
The company is committed to open systems and has secured a number of
strategic alliances, giving it access to leading-edge technology, the most
recent with Digital Equipment of the US. In return for a 4 per cent equity
stake, Olivetti will have access to Digital's new alpha microprocessor, said
to be the world's fastest.
It is possible, Mr Passera says, that the company could develop a fourth
industrial specialisation in telecommunications through a strategic alliance
with a telecommuni-cations company. Italian analysts have regularly
speculated on some form of link with the state-owned STET telecommunications
group. This, however, seems unlikely, not least because of domestic
political differences between Mr De Benedetti and some of the governing
parties.
The third leg in Mr De Benedetti's survival strategy is financial strength.
The balance sheet is strong and even after this year's losses, he says, the
company will have Dollars 3bn in cash.
It expects to break even at the operating level, including financial charges
this year, and make a profit in 1994.
Some may remember Mr Cassoni making similar forecasts for 1992 little more
than a year ago. It will be a vital test of Mr De Benedetti's campaign to
convince customers of Olivetti's staying power that the numbers come out
closer to expectations this time round.

ASAHI Breweries, Japan's second largest brewer with a 24 per cent market
share, yesterday posted a sharp fall in unconsolidated profits for 1992
partly due to a rise in interest payments on its bonds.
Asahi, which holds a 17 per cent stake in Foster's Brewing of Australia,
reported that pre-tax profits plunged 19.6 per cent to Y14bn (Dollars
115.7m) despite a 4.3 per cent rise in sales to Y770.6bn. After-tax profits
fell 34.2 per cent to Y4bn.
Operating profits surged 90.7 per cent to Y35.9bn thanks to cost cutting and
a sharp increase in bulk sales of non-alcoholic beverages, with a large
profit margin.
For the full year to December, Asahi expects pre-tax profits to rise 3.3 per
cent to Y14.5bn on a 5.1 per cent increase in sales to Y810bn.

CANADIAN Imperial Bank of Commerce, Canada's second biggest financial
institution, is closing its operations in Australia and cutting back its
presence in Europe.
CIBC has had a presence in Australia since 1966, specialising in resource
and infrastructure financing, gold hedging and treasury activities. The
operation is understood however, to have been unprofitable for the past few
years.
CIBC said yesterday that the Australian subsidiary, which employs 85 people
at offices in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth, would be wound down or sold over
the next three years. A capital markets division in Sydney was closed last
year.
In Europe, the bank will shut or sell operations in Frankfurt, Milan and
Paris, which together employ 90 people. European customers will in future be
served from CIBC's large office in London. CIBC continues to maintain
private banking and trust administration businesses in Switzerland and
Guernsey.
All five leading Canadian banks have pulled in their horns overseas since
the mid-1980s to concentrate on their North American business.
Mr John Hunkin, president of CIBC's investment and corporate banking
division, said the bank's business in Europe will in future focus on trade
finance, Canadian dollar products and the energy, utilities, media and
communications sectors. The bank also has a presence in securities markets.

PIRELLI. the Italian tyres and cables group, yesterday warned that its 1992
accounts, to be reported in May, would show an improvement on the L622bn
(Dollars 402.3m) lost after minority interests in 1991. But its results
would remain in the red owing to high interest charges and increased
depreciation costs.
Pirelli expects to report substantial extraordinary gains from sales of
subsidiaries in its diversified products division. However, such earnings
would be partly lowered by write-offs on the value of some operations still
being divested.
Earnings last year also suffered from deteriorating economic conditions,
which had required additional restructuring measures to be taken. Some L50bn
more had been spent than was allocated at the end of 1991, while a further
L140bn had been put aside for restructuring costs expected this year, almost
entirely on the cables side.
The group reported a sharp fall in consolidated sales to about L8,300bn last
year against L10,024bn in 1991. Adjusted for disposals, turnover rose by
about 2 per cent.
Gross operating earnings, before depreciation, interest charges and tax,
rose by 30 per cent to about L770bn.
Cash flow returned to the black from being negative in 1991, while Pirelli's
debt-equity ratio improved to 0.85 from 1.4 in 1991.

FT  20 FEB 93 / International Company News: Honda tumbles 16.9% to Y18bn on
surge in yen

THE SLIDE in profits at Honda, the Japanese car manufacturer, continued
unabated as the company reported a 16.9 per cent drop in consolidated
pre-tax profits to Y18.23bn (Dollars 150.7m) for the third quarter to
end-December.
However, the results suggest the fall in Honda's profits may be reaching its
bottom, especially if planned new models increase sales in the US as demand
there recovers. The group is enjoying a dramatic surge in demand for
motorcycles from China.
Honda's pre-tax profits fell largely because foreign exchange losses from
the surge in the yen against the dollar and higher interest charges offset
improvements in operating income.
Operating income was 4.6 per cent higher in the three months between last
October and December at Y23bn. Mr Yoshihide Munekuni, executive vice
president, said this was a reflection of cost cutting and lower depreciation
charges from reduced investment.
Consolidated capital expenditure at Honda rose by 70 per cent between 1989
and 1990 as it established its manufacturing base in the US, which accounts
for about 43 per cent of sales. Capital expenditure peaked in the year to
March 1990 at Y311.7bn, while the depreciation charge peaked a year later at
Y191bn. This year's capital spending is expected to be down to about Y180bn,
while depreciation charges are likely to be Y175bn.
Interest charges have risen as the company has borrowed more to fund its
Y77.5bn of warrant bond redemptions.
Automobile sales fell by 10 per cent in the quarter, dipping to Y785bn,
largely because of sluggish recovery in the US and downturn in Japan. Unit
sales were 6.9 per cent down at 435,000 units.
Honda should be well placed to exploit the expected recovery of the US car
market, according to Mr Andrew Blair-Smith, an industry analyst at BZW, the
UK stockbroker.
Motorcycle sales are surging, largely because of strong demand from south
east Asia. Motorcycle revenues rose 15.2 per cent to Y122.8bn.

Magdeburger Hochbau has sales of about DM300m, and is believed to be losing
about DM3m a month. The buyers have agreed to guarantee 2,900 jobs until the

FT  20 FEB 93 / International Company News: Pioneer slides 54% as Akai
plunges into loss

<TEXT>
THE severity of the recession in consumer electronics was underlined
yesterday by poor results from two Japanese manufacturers.
Pioneer, the specialised audio and video manufacturer known for its karaoke
systems, reported a 54 per cent drop in third quarter pre-tax profits as
demand for its mainstay products declined sharply in Japan and abroad.
Akai Electric, which makes audio products and VCRs, meanwhile, plunged into
loss for the year to November 20 1992. Both companies blamed the reversals
on the economic slowdown worldwide, particularly in Japan, and on the
appreciation of the yen.
Pioneer reported a 9.6 per cent fall in sales to Y167.48bn (Dollars 1.38bn)
for the three months to December. Pre-tax profits fell to Y11.43bn from
Y24.67bn a year earlier.
Demand fell for its audio and video products, particularly compact stereo
systems, CD players and commercial laser karaoke machines. Sales of car
navigation systems, car CD players and software increased, however, while
projection TVs sold well in the US. Car navigation systems sales nearly
tripled in value.
Pioneer said that in spite of continuing weak demand, it was maintaining
research and development expenditure while cutting capital spending by about
Y2bn. The company has recently been criticised for telling 35 older managers
to retire or face dismissal.
Pioneer is in talks to restructure Carolco, the loss-making US film
production company in which it invested Dollars 100m for a stake of just
under 20 per cent. Any deal would involve a further Dollars 40m investment.
Akai reported third-quarter pre-tax losses of Y554m, against profits of
Y1.73bn last time. Sales fell nearly 10 per cent to Y87.26bn (Y96.83bn), hit
particularly hard by the fall in demand for VCRs, one of its main product
areas.
The company, which has 90 per cent of its sales overseas, was also adversely
affected by currency fluctuations.

FT  20 FEB 93 / International Company News: JVC plans German closure to stem
losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VICTOR Company of Japan (JVC), the consumer electronics group which
specialises in video equipment, is planning to close one of its
manufacturing plants in Germany to stem mounting losses.
The move would be one of the most radical yet taken by one of Japan's
electronics groups to cut costs in the face of a prolonged slump in demand.
It is almost unheard of for a Japanese group to close a production plant and
lay off workers, even abroad.
The move suggests more Japanese companies may start to retrench from
overseas operations established in the 1980s when funds for investment were
cheap in Japan.
JVC said a videocassette manufacturing plant in Germany would dismiss all
its local employees, while a holding company in the Netherlands would be
absorbed by another German subsidiary.
The closures and the planned sale to a related company of some office
buildings in Tokyo, should compensate for the loss JVC expects for the year
to end-March. It would be JVC's second deficit after a pre-tax loss of
Y2.3bn last year, the first loss for four decades.
In October JVC reported a first-half Y13.5bn parent company per-tax loss.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Sugar
breaks into higher ground:
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SERIES of bullish developments this week enabled the world sugar market to
break free of the strait-jacket that had been confining prices for some
time.
Having traded mostly between 8 cents and 8.5 cents a lb since last autumn
the prompt March futures position at New York's Cocoa, Sugar and Coffee
Exchange leapt in mid-week to 9 cents, a level last seen on November 2, and
moved on to a five-month high of 9.53 cents before edging back yesterday
afternoon.
Market sentiment has hardened in recent weeks as analysts' assessments of
the likely sugar supply surplus in the 1992-93 season have been reduced.
London trader ED &amp; F. Man now expects supply to exceed demand by some 1.5m
tonnes (about 1.3 per cent of annual production), compared with the 3.4m
tonnes it was forecasting earlier. And this week C. Czarnikow, another
London trade house, which in November was forecasting an 830,000-tonnes
surplus, this week adjusted this to a 370,000-tonne deficit (after allowing
for 'unrecorded disappearance' of 600,000 tonnes ).
However, the factor that changed firmness into strength this week was talk
circulating among traders that Cuba had been forced to buy 100,000 tonnes of
sugar from Thailand to enable it to honour supply commitments to China and
other Asian countries. Cuban sugar minister Mr Juan Herrera warned earlier
this month that lack of basic inputs had 'caused delays in the start-up of a
significant number of mills'.
Also supporting the market were: a surprise announcement of a 160,000-tonne
Kenyan buying tender for next Monday; a 14,000-tonne Moroccan buying tender;
talk of Cuban sales to Mexico and of a 100,000-tonnes sale to Indonesia; and
a cut in Thailand's harvest forecast from 49.15m tonnes of cane to 43m
tonnes.
'There have been several important changes in the statistical outlook for
the 1992-93 crop cycle with adjustments to the supply side of the balance
predominating,' said Czarnikow in the February 17 issue of its Sugar Review.
'Production for the season has fallen by some 1.32m tonnes since our world
forecasts in November and is now expected to slip below last season's output
by some 1.87m tonnes.'
The trade house now estimates world sugar production at 114.57m tonnes,
compared with 115.89m in November, and consumption at 114.51m tonnes,
compared with 114.46m tonnes.
Cocoa prices put in another steady performance as producers and consumers
prepared for next week's International Cocoa Agreement (ICCA) negotiations
in Geneva. In late trading yesterday the New York market's May position was
quoted at Dollars 932 a tonne, up Dollars 7 on the week. In London, however,
that firmness was obscured by the dollar's decline against sterling and the
London Futures and Options Exchange's May cocoa contract ended Pounds 3 down
on the week at Pounds 734 a tonne.
The Geneva meeting will mark the fourth and final attempt to agree a
price-stabilisation pact to replace the moribund one that expires on
September 30. Delegates were moving towards agreement at the last session,
in November, that efforts to steady the market should be based on the
withholding of between 330,000 and 380,000 tonnes of surplus beans from the
market. But they remained far apart on how that was to be financed and on
what price range was to be defended.
The existing ICCA, agreed in 1986, ceased to operate as a market support
pact early in 1988, when its buffer stock reached the 250,000-tonnes
ceiling.
All but one of the London Metal Exchange's contracts finished down on the
week, the biggest fall being in copper, which closed yesterday at Pounds
1,551.25 a tonne for three months delivery, down Pounds 30.50 on the week.
But, as with cocoa's fall, the culprit was the sterling rally, but for which
the price would have been modestly higher.
Dealers said the copper market was supported by concern over production
stoppages in Mexico and Papua New Guinea and the expectation of Chinese
buying on any dip to Dollars 2,220 a tonne, about Dollars 7 below the dollar
equivalent of yesterday's close. But the market remained trapped in a narrow
range, they added, with overhead resistance expected at Dollars 2,231 a
tonne.
After most of an early fall had been recovered in mid-week the aluminium
market ended on the downbeat, with the cash position closing yesterday at
Dollars 1,204.50 a tonne, down Dollars 4 on the day and Dollars 7.75 on the
week.
The market had been steady in the morning, underpinned by talk of further
production cuts following Alumax's announcement on Thursday that it was
reducing output by about 36,000 tonnes a year at its Mount Holly smelter.
Fears that the Bonneville Power Administration restrictions could increase
energy costs for some US smelters were also providing support. But prices
again ran into overhead resistance and fell away during the afternoon.
Among the precious metals platinum and palladium prices reversed last week's
gains as confidence was rocked by nervousness about US economic policy and a
report that Japanese car makers were to cut imports of the metals, both of
which are used in exhaust catalysts.
Dollar weakness helped gold to mount another assault on the upper end of its
recent Dollars 327-Dollars 332 a troy ounce trading range on Tuesday. Once
again it was repelled, as was a fresh attempt yesterday.

FT  20 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Queens Moat near to franchise agreement
with Holiday Inn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUEENS MOAT Houses and Holiday Inn, the Bass subsidiary, are close to
concluding a new franchise agreement, but the number of hotels involved is
smaller than expected.
The agreement being discussed would result in a handful of Queens Moat
hotels in the UK and on the continent adopting the Holiday Inn name. The
total number involved is thought to be fewer than 10.
It had been thought that the two companies were considering a more
wide-ranging agreement with a larger number of Queens Moat hotels becoming
Holiday Inn franchises. Although the deal being discussed could be extended
to involve a greater number of hotels, this is unlikely in the immediate
future.
Queens Moat already runs one Holiday Inn in Newcastle and 19 on the
continent.
The agreement under discussion would only partly compensate Holiday Inn for
the loss of 15 of its UK hotels last year to the Marriott chain. The hotels
are owned by Scott's Hospitality, a Canadian company. Scott's switched to
rival Marriott after its request to become Holiday Inn's master franchisee
in the UK was rejected.
Holiday Inn Worldwide plans to double the number of its hotels in France to
about 40 by the mid-1990s, mainly by taking over existing hotels, Philip
Rawstorne writes.
The Holiday Inn brand will also be extended to seven hotels owned by the
French Alliance group in which Holiday Inn has a 54 per cent stake.
The expansion is part of a programme to lift the number of Holiday Inns in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa, from 125 to more than 200.

THE US coal mining arm of Costain, the UK construction group, yesterday
pleaded guilty to 29 charges involving safety violations at its William
station mine in west Kentucky where 10 people were killed in an explosion in
1989.
An indictment against the company was announced by the US Grand Jury which
has been investigating the explosion and which is highly critical of the
mine's management before and after the tragedy.
Costain said that it had decided to plead guilty on 29 counts, and would not
contest three other charges, rather than face protracted court proceedings
which 'would prolong the pain for all, especially the families of those
miners whose lives were lost'.
Costain is being fined Dollars 3.75m (Pounds 2.64m).
The company also faces claims for damages from the families of the dead
miners. Settlements in two cases have already been agreed by the company's
insurers.
Mr Tom Parker, chairman of Costain's US coal mining division, said: 'We
deeply regret the tragedy that occurred. Although the exact cause and
reasons for the explosion remain unresolved, we believe it is best at this
point to settle the matter for our employees, the miners' families and the
company.'
The explosion occurred in September 1989, just two months after Costain
acquired a 100 per cent stake in Pyro coal company which had previously
operated the mine jointly with the British group.
Costain says that since the explosion it has reorganised the mines safety
procedures including hiring extra safety officers and increasing training
for miners.
The British group now operates 16 underground and open-cast coal mines in
five US states producing 17.5m tonnes of coal a year. US coal operations in
1991 are thought to have generated about Pounds 5m operating profits out of
total operating profits of Pounds 27.4m.
The Grand Jury findings have been published shortly before a court in St
Louis, Missouri, is due to announce its judgment in a separate legal action
involving Costain and Peabody, the US coal mining arm of Hanson, the
UK-based conglomerate.
Peabody has asked the court for an injunction preventing the sale, for
Dollars 245m, of Costain's Australian coal and property operations to Altus,
part of the French Credit Lyonnais group.
Peabody, which says it had previously agreed terms with Costain to buy the
Australian coal business at a lower price, wants the sale to Altus
disallowed.

FT  20 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Pegasus declines sharply to Pounds 620,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS

<TEXT>
PEGASUS Group has reported a sharp fall in profits and turnover, after a
period of boardroom turmoil and depressed activity.
In the 17 months to December 31 1992, the USM-quoted designer of accounting
software recorded pre-tax profits of Pounds 620,000, down from Pounds 1.51m
in the year ended July 1991.
Figures for the previous period were restated to comply with FRS3 accounting
standard.
Earnings per share were 7.7p basic (18.1p) and 7.3p fully diluted. The
proposed final dividend is 2p (8.6p), payable July 10, for a 9p (12.1p)
total.
The latest pre-tax profit of Pounds 620,000 was after Pounds 297,000 of net
interest income, a Pounds 1.27m gain on part-sale of a subsidiary, Pounds
369,000 write-off of assets and Pounds 646,000 for redundancies and
extensive board changes.
Continuing activities fell from an operating profit of Pounds 1.6m on
turnover of Pounds 8.15m to a loss of Pounds 140,000 on Pounds 9m, while
acquisitions added Pounds 126,000 of profits on Pounds 1.27m in the latest
period.
The results were not as bad as some analysts had feared, and its share price
gained 5p, closing at 160p.
Mr Jonathan Hubbard-Ford, chief executive, said the launch later this year
of Version 6 of Pegasus Senior, the company's core product, offered 'a solid
basis for recovery'. Pegasus was also pioneering a new integrated management
information system, Sequel, but was aiming to simplify its overall business
and product range.
Pegasus's market share in the modular accounting market remained stable at
36 per cent by volume.
Mr Hubbard-Ford, reinstated as chief executive in a boardroom coup in
December promoted by institutional investors, promised 'stability and
consolidation'.
All but one of the current directors joined the board in December 1992, when
Mr Philip Sellers took over as non-executive chairman in place of Mr Derek
Moon.

FT  20 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Lopex makes Pounds 3.5m cash call to repay
debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOPEX, the communications group, is to raise Pounds 3.5m in a 1-for-1 rights
issue to repay debt.
The issue is priced at 17p per share and will allow Lopex to pay off its
estimated Pounds 3.5m debt. Its shares closed yesterday at 24p, down 1p.
Lopex, struggling in the beleaguered advertising sector, incurred pre-tax
losses of Pounds 125,000 in the first half of 1992, after losses of Pounds
398,000 for the whole of 1991. It is however, projecting profits of Pounds
200,000 for the year ending December 1992, but no final dividend.
Mr Barrie Warman, finance director, said: 'Our clients have been looking at
us with a bit of a jaundiced eye. Our main problem is with TV companies,
which have very strict balance sheet criteria.'
The issue is underwritten by Kleinwort Benson. It is being accompanied by
the establishment of an employee trust, to be endowed with Pounds 1.2m of
unpaid performance bonuses, which will subscribe to the new shares and
sub-underwrite about a third of the issue.
'We want to see the cash transferred to the trust reinvested in the group,
enlarging Lopex's equity base,' said Mr Warman.
Most of the group's revenue comes from the depressed UK market. Its public
relations and direct mailing side has fared far better than advertising.

FT  20 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Fund-raising campaign to save Fulham ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FULHAM football fans are today launching a fund-raising campaign to try to
secure the club's future at its west London ground, which is owned by a
company in receivership.
Urgency is lent to the Fulham 2000 campaign by the fact that there are only
100 days to run on the club's lease of the Craven Cottage ground, which has
been its home beside the river Thames since 1896.
The ground is owned by a company called Vicenza Development. It was part of
Cabra Estates, the quoted property company where provisional liquidators
were appointed in November. Cabra owed more than Pounds 60m to banks and
other creditors, with Royal Bank of Scotland as the lead bank.
Royal Bank appointed acc-ountants from Coopers &amp; Lybrand as receivers at
Vicenza.
The bank has bought Chelsea Football Club's ground, another part of the
Cabra estate, and granted Chelsea a 20-year lease with an option to buy. But
the future of Fulham FC and the Craven Cottage site remains uncertain.
Apart from the short time left on the lease, the result is still awaited of
an inquiry into a planning application to redevelop the ground for flats.
Cabra made the application but Fulham and Hammersmith council rejected it.
The inquiry is understood to have been concluded in September, but no word
has yet come from the Department of the Environment.
Fulham 2000 says: 'With no planning permission having been granted, and no
demand for any residential redevelopment, Fulham should be allowed to buy
the ground at today's market value.'
The campaign seems to assume it is owned by the Royal Bank, which it is not.
The receivers say that the 'options are open'.
With so much undecided, the campaign has set itself no monetary target,
other than collecting as many Pounds 10 membership fees as possible.
It hopes eventually to be able to contribute to a solution that would see
the club stay at the ground with a partial redevelopment of the site to help
add value for the bank.

FT  20 FEB 93 / UK Company News: City group urges delay in USM closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CITY lobby group is to urge the London Stock Exchange to delay closure of
the Unlisted Securities Market, pending preparation of proposals for an
alternative market with separate governance.
The City Group for Smaller Companies, representing 72 organisations, has
drawn up its response to proposals for closing the USM and establishing a
smaller companies sector on the Official List. The deadline for such
recommendations is March 5.
In its document, Cisco agrees that the differences between the USM and the
main market 'hardly justify the continued operation of the two primary
market regimes'. However, the group argues that there is a strong case for a
junior market with 'markedly different listing arrangements'.
To date, argues Mr Richard Balarkas, chief executive of Cisco, the Stock
Exchange has failed to address specifically the needs of smaller companies.
'The Stock Exchange should be forced to recognise that it is operating two
markets, or someone else should be allowed to operate a national market,' he
said.
'There is a lot of support for the idea, but it would need a significant
change in attitudes from both the Stock Exchange and the government,' he
added.
Mr Balarkas and Mr Andrew Beeson, Cisco's chairman, cite the example of
Nasdaq, which is operated by a self-regulatory body in the US. Established
in 1971, Nasdaq was particularly successful in its early days in providing a
forum for smaller companies. Today, however, the bulk of trading is
concentrated in its biggest companies.
Nevertheless, Mr Beeson said: 'The Nasdaq market is independently operated
and governed and totally dedicated to the needs of smaller companies.'
He stressed that the preferable option in the UK would be to set up a junior
market within an existing framework. However, the market would require
dedicated management.
Cisco argues that the creation of a viable junior market would in the long
run be good business for the Stock Exchange, which currently derives some 90
per cent of share turnover from the biggest companies.
Other issues being investigated by Cisco include the definition of inside
information as included in the draft criminal justice bill. Working parties
have been set up to prepare submissions to the Treasury.
Cisco will be meeting the Treasury next week to discuss its proposals. The
group is also holding a series of discussions with the Bank of England.

FT  20 FEB 93 / UK Company News: ICI faces decision on how to raise Pounds
1bn of new equity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL CHEMICAL Indust-ries, which is expected to announce on Thursday
that it will proceed with its demerger plan, must also decide how to raise
about Pounds 1bn of new equity regarded as essential to make the split work.
The ICI board, chaired by Sir Denys Henderson, is understood to have set
itself a number of goals in the financing, some of which appear to conflict.
First, it is keen to reward loyal shareholders who supported ICI when Hanson
took its 2.8 per cent stake in 1991 by preserving their pre-emption rights.
ICI also wants the certainty of an underwritten issue, which many think can
only be done in the UK market, so that it can proceed with the demerger with
confidence. These two factors would tend to push ICI towards a rights issue,
either before the demerger, or by Zeneca, the pharmaceutical side, after the
demerger.
However, Zeneca would like to widen its spread of shareholders, building an
international, and especially US, investor base. 'That concept is clearly
very important in the mind of Zeneca,' said one person involved. Only about
5 per cent of ICI's shares are held in the US.
ICI and SG Warburg, its adviser, are looking closely at the Wellcome share
sale last summer, which was designed to increase overseas ownership of the
drug company's shares.
The Wellcome sale was done on a 'book-building' basis. Potential buyers put
bids in during a sale period and a price was set reflecting supply and
demand. The price set was close to the market price, whereas a rights issue
is normally made at a significant discount to the market price.
But Wellcome did not face a pre-emption rights problem as the shares being
sold were existing rather than new ones.
Investment bankers are being asked to put proposals to ICI which can bring
the differing aims into line.
One suggestion is that Zeneca should proceed with a rights issue, but that
the company should attempt to generate demand from new investors for the new
shares while they are trading in nil-paid form. That could involve an
international road show to whip up interest in the shares.
That could prove an expensive option for Zeneca though, as it would mean
issuing shares on a rights issue discount and then giving shareholders a
profit if new investors are encouraged to buy.
Another approach could be to run a book building sale which would probably
set a strike price closer to the market price, but to give existing
shareholders the right to buy back a large proportion of the issue at the
strike price. That would have the advantage of preserving pre-emptive
rights, and obtaining a better price for the shares. But it would be hard to
combine that with a firm underwriting commitment.
The hope of broadening the investor base to include US holders also depends
on Zeneca being able to attract interest. Pharmaceutical stocks are out of
favour at present, especially in the US.
Zeneca itself is seen as weak. American sales of its best-selling drug, the
heart drug Tenormin, have halved over the last 12 months following the
expiry of its patents. And according to one banker, Zeneca has 'nothing
promising in the R&amp;D pipeline for a couple of years. Are US investors
prepared for a 2 to 3 year wait?'.

FT  20 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Rank makes Pounds 20m disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRIGHTREASONS, the group run by former Mecca boss Mr Michael Guthrie, is
buying the Italian restaurant businesses, Pizza Piazza and Prima Pasta, from
Rank Organisation for Pounds 20.25m in cash.
The purchases bring two more Mecca businesses back under the control of Mr
Guthrie, who set up Prima Pasta as part of the leisure company's restaurant
business five years ago. Mr Guthrie left Mecca just before Rank's takeover
in 1990.
He paid Rank Pounds 90m for 11 motorway service stations in 1991. These are
run as a separate company.
Brightreasons, which is reportedly preparing for a flotation in the next two
years, will pay an initial Pounds 19m, with Pounds 1.25m deferred to 1994.
The payment will go a small way towards reducing Rank's onerous debt burden,
which was Pounds 999.3m at the year-end.
Mr Guthrie said the acquisition would complement the Pizzaland business
purchased from Grand Metropolitan in 1991. He estimated that after the
latest acquisitions, Brightreasons would have between 20 and 23 per cent of
the pizza and pasta market in the UK.

Newmarket Venture Capital had a net asset value per share of 62p at December
31, against 60p a year earlier. At September 30 the value was 57p.
Its portfolio of venture capital investments in the UK and US is being

wound up voluntarily and the assets distributed to shareholders in 1994.
The directors said that significant progress had been made in the asset
realisation programme begun in 1990. The proportion of net asset value held
in cash, gilts and quoted stocks net of creditors and accruals increased
from 25p to 42p per share over the year.
The company does not take realised gains on successful investments into its
profit and loss account and does not pay ordinary dividends. Net losses
increased from Pounds 776,000 to Pounds 1.32m and losses per share amounted
to 3.7p (2.1p).

12.2m to Pounds 13.5m in 1992, while assets grew from Pounds 971.5m to
Pounds 1.08bn. Mr Bill Midgely, the managing director, said it had been a
good, solid year which bode well for 1993.
Profit growth took into account full provisioning in respect of actual and
anticipated mortgage losses on repossessed properties and anticipated losses
on serious arrears cases.
Mr Midgely said continuing uncertainty in the housing and financial services
sector had prompted the society to be especially prudent as regards
provisions this year. It had taken on a general reserve of Pounds 250,000
and, in doing so, had depressed profit growth by 2 per cent.
Net advances increased from Pounds 95.3m to Pounds 114.6m in the year.

FT  20 FEB 93 / UK Company News: BCE deeper in the red at midway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX losses of BCE Hold-ings, the distributor of snooker, billiards and
pool products, grew from Pounds 20,000 to Pounds 168,000 in the six months
to September 30, on turnover of Pounds 1.98m, against Pounds 2.53m.
Mr David Fisher, chairman, said that the results, while disappointing, were
within budget and reflected the seasonal nature of the business now that BCE
had returned to its traditional core activities.
The sale of the cue and snooker tables manufacturing divisions accounted for
exceptional losses of Pounds 52,000 this time. Losses per share were 0.6p
(0.07p) and there is again no interim dividend.
In recent months, trading and profitability of the distribution division had
been in line with budget despite the devaluation of the pound, but the
company's amusement centres remained depressed.

FT  20 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Trencherwood loss cut to Pounds 21m -
Chairman optimistic as house reservations rise significantly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRENCHERWOOD, a USM-quoted housebuilder and property company, reduced its
loss before tax from Pounds 37.7m to Pounds 21.4m in the year ended October
31.
The loss was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 13.1m (Pounds
29.9m). Operating losses rose from Pounds 863,000 to Pounds 2.3m.
At the year-end group borrowings stood at Pounds 46.6m (Pounds 45m) with a
deficiency on net assets of Pounds 33.3m.
However, following the refinancing, approved by shareholders at a recent
extraordinary general meeting, a pro forma balance sheet shows borrowings
restated at Pounds 22.2m with a positive net worth of Pounds 3.9m.
Mr John Norgate, chairman, said: 'Since the start of the year we have seen
real cause for optimism. Visitor levels to our show houses and house
reservations have increased significantly since December, with demand on
some developments now outstripping supply.'
Mr David Moss, managing director, said the housing market had changed for
the first time since the recession. 'With mortgage rates at their lowest for
37 years, we are experiencing a recovery which we do not believe is about to
peter out.'
He said the company's new found confidence was underlined by the support it
had received from its banks. 'It is significant that the company's five-year
business plan won the support of its lenders.'
The group's loss in the second half was Pounds 5m compared with a deficit of
Pounds 16.4m in the first six months. The total loss after taxation fell to
Pounds 20.8m, compared with Pounds 34.2m.
In line with its policy of increasing its residential side, the commercial
operation disposed of assets worth Pounds 2.9m and commercial sales of
Pounds 2.4m were made.
Under the terms of the refinancing, Pounds 35m of bank debts and claims were
swapped for ordinary and preference shares, leaving existing shareholders
with 30 per cent of the enlarged capital. Their holdings will be diluted to
15.9 per cent if there is full conversion of the preference shares.
The banks also agreed to provide five-year term facilities of Pounds 22.4m,
overdraft and engagement facilities of Pounds 7m and a standby facility of
Pounds 1m.
With the exception of one project, where the maximum recourse is about
Pounds 60,000, the group does not have to repay any of the borrowings of its
joint venture projects.
Losses per share were reduced from 137.01p to 83.10p and the final dividend
is being passed again.

FT  20 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Holmes Protection back in the black with
Dollars 4.17m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SUCCESSFUL completion of a three-month debt restructuring programme at
Holmes Protection yesterday enabled the US security group to announce a
sharp turnround in its year-end results.
Pre-tax profits for 1992 totalled Dollars 4.17m (Pounds 3m) compared with
losses of Dollars 35.5m. Turnover declined from Dollars 59m in 1991 to
Dollars 56.2m.
The company, quoted in the UK, blamed the downturn in turnover on orders
cancelled before a new management team headed by Sir Ian MacGregor, former
chairman of British Coal, had implemented a restructuring plan designed to
wipe out debt held by seven North American institutions.
The institutions, which were unsecured lenders, agreed to forgive a portion
of the debt and accept a part cash and part debt-equity swap for the
remainder.
Yesterday's results included an exceptional gain of Dollars 1.88m (Dollars
30.7m) following the reversal of an acquisition reserve made in 1991.
Earnings per share after adjusting for the share consolidation were 23
cents, against losses of Dollars 12.98. However the directors felt a figure
of 10 cents, on the basis that the shares issued during the restructuring
had been in issue throughout the year, was more meaningful.
Although the company decided not to pay a dividend for the third year
running, Sir Ian said it intended 'to resume the payment of a nominal amount
of dividends during 1993'.
He also predicted increased turnover in the year ahead following a slowdown
in the cancellation rate in its main business of installing and servicing
alarm systems.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Letter: VAT on food a banana skin that government must avoid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Messrs GEOFF RAYNER and TIM LANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael MacKenzie of the Food and Drink Federation (Letters, February
10) has rightly described the proposed imposition of VAT on food as a tax on
the poor. We also think that there are other points to be made against the
proposal.
VAT will cause further inflationary pressure on food costs for an industry
already suffering the effects of the devaluation of the pound. It would also
be a tax on farmers at a time when bankruptcies are commonplace. And it
would be ironic if the government extended VAT, with accompanying
bureaucracy, in the same month as it has launched a campaign to reduce the
burden of regulation on the food industry. As proponents of public health,
we are in favour of sensible and flexible regulation, but the imposition of
VAT on food would be neither. The government should reconsider.
The FT has consistently covered the international row on the banana trade.
We are sure that your readers will join us in judging the idea of VAT on
food as a banana skin the government and the food industry would do well to
avoid.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Nobody's a Nice Guy now: Russia's political battles and
ruined economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The mood in Russia and its sister states of the former union is hardening.
It is now each state, each region, each individual for himself: the forced,
and in part real, equalisation of both scarcity and provision under the old
communist system gives way to a Darwinian struggle which grows more feral.
This is the atmosphere against which the battle for power in Russia is
played out (similar battles go on all about its periphery): it means that
the 'constitutional debate' has less of the legislative chamber and the
study about it, more of the whiff of rifle oil and the rumble of tank
tracks. Everyone - Mr Boris Yeltsin, the president, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov,
the parliamentary speaker, their supporters and ideologues, proclaim that
the price of failure to agree is chaos, dictatorship, the end of another
Russian experiment with democracy, of which the longest was the period 1905
to 1917. They then continue to ensure that no agreement can be reached.
The battle is over the constitution, but the field is the ruined post-Soviet
economies. With no end to the crises in any of the former Soviet states, the
richer are doing what the rich usually do with the poor - spurning them.
This is most seriously the case with Russia, the richest in energy.
The Russian cabinet met on Thursday, and made a series of decisions which,
if followed through, would be momentous. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the new
prime minister - who often shows himself, at least in rhetoric, to be a much
harsher economic realist than his predecessor Mr Yegor Gaidar - told his
colleagues that he wanted to switch over (more or less) to world prices in
all dealings with former Soviet neighbours. He would no longer tolerate a
situation where Ukraine bought Russian oil for a rouble-denominated song and
sold 8m tonnes of it (as the Russians believe it did last year) for good US
dollars.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister in charge of foreign
economic affairs, said last week that Ukraine and other states would have to
make military and other concessions if it wanted to continue receiving cheap
energy: and Mr Vladimir Mashyts, head of the committee for co-operation with
the CIS member states, pointed out that where Russia delivered 60-70 per
cent of promised supplies, the CIS countries averaged about 16 per cent.
A following through of this hard line means impoverishing already miserable
states: countries like Georgia, where more than half the industry has closed
and the black economy traders export the agriculture surplus to hard
currency countries, and which owes 70 per cent of its current government
expenditure to Russia. Other states are less dramatically dependent, but the
tendency will be the same. No more Mr Ivan the Nice Guy is the message they
are all receiving: now, even the most liberal minister must be a
Russia-firster. None can ignore the imperatives of a people demanding an end
to economic misery: nor can they fail to see the galloping disintegration
within Russia, as regions within the federation, too, play the zero sum game
of grasping after 'independence' (from taxes, state obligations, and the
need to confirm to minimum national social and other standards).
The politicians turn harder as it becomes clear to them all that 'the west'
is not a rich and generous idiot. The International Monetary Fund, which
earlier this month anxiously conferred in Washington with Mr Boris Fyodorov,
the new economic chief in the cabinet, over the government's programme,
believes it can do nothing until at least the basic rules of monetary
discipline are in place - a system for controlling the budget deficit, real
Central Bank interest rates, a rein on credits. Yet these are as far away as
ever. Foreign investors and corporations, their hope for stability fading as
the cases of mismanaged and stalled joint ventures multiply, cut back their
representative offices and whine. The west, too, is no longer Mr Nice Guy.
As with states, so with individuals. The post-Soviet rich are spectacularly
rich, the men wearing Guccis and Rolexes, the women dripping with mink, the
Mercedes 500 waiting at the Casino door with an ex-paratrooper behind the
wheel. Most are criminal in one way or another, even if 'only' tax dodging:
the darker side is a violent crime rate now going up almost vertically to
the point where Mr Victor Yerin, the saturnine interior minister, spoke on
Thursday of his being a 'ministry at war', and said that the population must
be 'taught to respect the militia', of whom they had murdered nearly 400
last year. Again, if Mr Yerin's words become deeds, we will see a harsh
regime - and can expect to see it welcomed.
This tightening of the purses, of security, the emphasis on everyone for
himself, underpins the political space within which Mr Yeltsin and Mr
Khasbulatov slug it out for constitutional primacy. Neither are much
respected, though Mr Yeltsin retains recognition for his courage. The
history of their most recent conflict is that of contemporary Russian
politics - improvised, hectic and treacherous.
It stems immediately from a deal made at the Congress of Peoples Deputies in
December, under which Mr Yeltsin was permitted to call a referendum on a new
constitution on April 11: since then, Mr Khasbulatov has attempted to sink
the deal, and Mr Valery Zorkin, chairman of the Constitutional Court who
guaranteed it, has descended into the political arena by saying he now
thinks it a bad idea. This defection from his proper role, hardly noticed in
the turbulence of the day-by-day posturing, removed the last planks of the
legal framework which might have surrounded the manoeuvrings of those on top
of the political heap.
We exist in the now-familiar countdown mode: another deadline has been set
within which, in this case, a preliminary agreement on the division of power
must be drawn up by presidential and parliamentary aides over the next week,
then put to a special one-day session of the Congress in early March.
Mr Yeltsin appeared on television this week in a cardigan to say that he
didn't trust these tricksters in parliament, that he would give negotiation
a shot but that he really thought a referendum on a constitution was the
best bet. Meanwhile, parliament should agree to hand over most of its
economic powers to the government so it could have a free hand in sorting
out the crisis: he too would refrain from interfering with the government he
appointed.
Mr Yeltsin's offer has no hope of acceptance. It may simply be a high
opening bid, but it may also be the tabling of a set of conditions, without
which Mr Yeltsin does not think the country can be governed and the economy
pulled out of its dive. As he attempts to tighten control in face of the
tearing apart of his economy and his country, he cannot afford to compromise
further with a parliament which, under Mr Khasbulatov, wishes to govern the
country too.
Mr Khasbulatov, a former economics professor who comes from the Caucasian
autonomous republic of Chechnya, has brilliantly used what was in Soviet
times a purely ceremonial post to put himself at the head of a parliament
whose members are inexperienced, divided and often ignorant: he has played a
weak hand to the point where it cannot be ignored and must be either
placated or beaten. His self-importance is large, as is his political
intelligence. Often down, he has never been out.
As the battle rages between the two men, the economic room for manoeuvre has
disappeared, as has the 'democratic surplus' - the space within which
choices can be made for compromise and consensus between layers of political
authority. The politicians, too, are out for themselves: Russia and its
neighbours are sucked into the vortex of their struggle, a largely supine
citizenry condemned, yet again, to fear and wait.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Lead role in a power play: Michael Smith asks who will blink
first, government or generators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, the UK electricity
generating company, never expected an easy relationship with the government
following a difficult privatisation process.
'Have no doubts . . . the government will feel happy if National Power falls
flat on its face,' he wrote in the leaked draft of a speech, later amended,
to managers of the Central Electricity Generating Board, the predecessor of
National Power and its rival generator for England and Wales, PowerGen. The
implication was that in the private sector, the generators would have few
friends in the government.
Four years later, another leak of Mr Baker's controversial thoughts is
exacerbating a degree of current tension with the government.
The disclosure on Thursday of a confidential letter from Mr Baker to Mr
Michael Heseltine, industry secretary, reveals an extraordinary
behind-the-scenes battle between the government and National Power and
PowerGen over who should pay to rescue some of Britain's threatened coal
mines.
The government, having rejected most of the more radical options for
increasing the market for coal - such as cutting nuclear or gas-fired
electricity - is looking to the generators to solve its problems by buying
larger tonnages than they want over the next five years. Mr Baker's letter,
and an accompanying memorandum in which he talks of a government threat to
legislate if the generators do not accede, shows that Mr Heseltine has a
fight on his hands. Mr Baker has refused to buy as much coal as the
government wants and thrown the ball back into Mr Heseltine's court.
The response is typical for the tenacious Mr Baker. At 55, he has had an
unusual career for a senior manager in the electricity industry. Most have
joined the sector at an early age, often straight from university, with an
engineering or technological background. Mr Baker began his career in
electricity in 1979, when he was 42, and his background was far from
scientific.
After graduating in English from Oxford, he worked in the transport and
environment ministries as a civil servant from 1961 to 1974 before setting
up the Housing Corporation, a state body to provide rented housing. Some of
the more narrowly focused engineers at the CEGB must have looked askance at
a man who delights in the opera and bridge and who, in one week's holiday,
says he can read up to 15 novels.
Despite his unorthodox background Mr Baker quickly integrated himself into
what one former colleague describes as an engineers' closed shop. He says he
found the CEGB insensitive to shifts in public mood and after joining the
board in 1980 tried to make it more outward looking. He later took charge of
public relations and distinguished himself in the presentation of the
board's case for building the Sizewell B nuclear station. He became
corporate managing director in 1986.
Within the industry he is highly regarded, even by the chairmen and chief
executives of the regional electricity companies who often view former CEGB
managers as remote and arrogant. 'He is not really a hands-on manager like
Ed Wallis at PowerGen, partly because he doesn't have the background,' says
one. 'But he can delegate and his strength is knowing how to operate in the
corridors of power; how to deal with the industry regulator and the
politicians.'
Given his reputation for toughness, there are some in the industry who
believe, probably inaccurately, that Mr Baker leaked the documents to Mr
Heseltine himself.
Whoever did so had a sense of style and humour, since the papers were sent
anonymously to Mr Arthur Scargill, the president of the National Union of
Mineworkers, who is no ally of the generators. The leak prompted a great
deal of concern within National Power yesterday that it could have a
detrimental effect on negotiations with the government.
The nub of the dispute is that the government wants the generators to take
65.5m tonnes of coal at subsidised prices in the next five years over and
above the 160m tonnes they have agreed to buy over the period. The
generators say they will take up to 55m tonnes extra, but 15m would have to
be stockpiled, with the government paying the costs.
The surprising element of the documents is Mr Baker's revelation that Mr
Heseltine 'said that if we (the generators) couldn't take the additional
tonnages, he would be forced to legislate'.
Such a threat appears inconsistent with the prospectus for the flotation
three years ago of National Power and PowerGen which said that the
government 'intends that the relationship between British Coal and each of
(the genera-tors) . . . should be commercially determined on an arms' length
basis'.
The signs are that the government wants to avoid a solution to British
Coal's problems that involves primary legislation. Laws which revised the
terms of the privatisation would inevitably hit the shares of the generators
at a time when the government is looking to sell off its remaining 40 per
cent stakes in each company. The money is needed to reduce the growing
public sector borrowing requirement possibly within the next year or two.
But the government's more pressing problem is to find a publicly and
politically acceptable alternative to British Coal's programme for closing
31 pits. A white paper originally scheduled for this month has been delayed
because of the difficulty of finding a solution.
The likelihood is that a compromise with the generators will be reached, but
some analysts believe National Power and PowerGen are putting their
lucrative contracts for 160m tonnes of coal at risk by trying to drive a
hard bargain. If Mr Heseltine decides to enact legislation to force the
generators to take the extra 65m tonnes, the deals already agreed could be
affected.
'John Baker has proved an accomplished negotiator and has proved adept at
staring in the eye the guy on the other side of the table,' says one. 'Maybe
now is the time to blink.'

FT  20 FEB 93 / Letter: Unfounded maternity leave fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms CHRISTINE GOWDRIDGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The chance of a woman demanding maternity leave the day after the start
of a new job is remote, so it is curious of the Confederation of British
Industry's Mr Gilbert to focus on it ('Maternity changes nurture fears',
February 15). He is probably expressing the fear, still found among some
employers, of the burden that employment rights for working women
represents. If so, he should be reassured that similar fears expressed by
employers about the introduction of maternity rights in the 1970s turned out
to be groundless.
Research demonstrates that maternity leave is only one of the many sources
of absence and much less common than most. Increasingly, employers are
seeing the benefits of providing adequate maternity leave in terms of
retaining valued staff. In any event, much of the cost, in terms of pay, is
borne by the state.
While regretting the complexity of the Trade Union Reform and Employment
Rights Bill, the Maternity Alliance welcomes the proposed extension of
maternity leave to the minority of women not currently entitled to any. It
is reassuring to note that the CBI is not abandoning its commitment to equal
opportunities policies. Women should not suffer disproportionately the
effects of this recession.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Letter: Legislation needed to meet current needs of farmers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr V A G TREGEAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Richardson's observations in Farmer's Viewpoint (February 16)
highlight how much more has to be done by the farming community. That 100 UK
farmers are going out of business each week is merely the continued effect
of battle against rising overhead and declining income during the last 10
years.
Considerable effort is being made now in the home counties, if not the
shires, to respond to the current conditions by 'extensifying' and entering
into new forms of farming agreement. It is in this context that progressive
farmers and landowners are hampered by the antiquated legislation enshrined
in the agricultural holdings acts. The government should therefore be
encouraged to bring forward the legislation that it is now considering based
upon 'freedom to contract'. This would enable joint ventures and other
trading agreements to be introduced to meet modern conditions without either
the fear of creating agricultural tenancies with security of tenure, or the
need to use rather incongruous Gladstone v Bower tenancies.
In parallel with this, the government must be prepared to rationalise both
the capital and income tax framework to remove the anomalies that occur as a
result of new enterprises and agreements.
As it looks as if the government will have to be parsimonious for some time,
its best alternative would be to give parliamentary time as soon as possible
to improve the legal framework and stimulate the entrepreneurial spirit.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Letter: Union power over pay levels in doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON MILNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan's analysis of the link between average earnings growth
and unemployment during three recessions ('The unwelcome pay-jobs link',
February 18) highlights the macro failure of Thatcherite labour market
reforms to deliver. What is particularly noticeable, and what Mr Brittan
fails to point out, is that equilibrium unemployment has remained stubbornly
high (around 2.5m) despite the enormous reduction in union density and
collective bargaining coverage in the second half of the 1980s.
Ten years ago the high level of equilibrium unemployment would have been
principally blamed on unions and their wider influence through pay
bargaining. The decline in numbers covered by collective bargaining,
combined with decentralisation of bargaining, has not produced the improved
macro performance that many predicted it would. In light of this, perhaps we
now also need to reassess the impact of 'union power' on average earnings
growth in the past.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Letter: No case for exempting forces from a 'classless'
society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From BRIGADIER J S RYDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, According to Philip Stephens and David White ('Major's 'classless'
honours plan upsets forces chiefs', February 13) service chiefs are arguing
that classlessness may be all very well in civilian life but the rigid
observance of social status is a vital component of a well-oiled military
machine.
Perhaps they have forgotten the Victoria Cross, the only award available to
all ranks of the three services according to their deeds. All the rest are
remnants of a distasteful system which awards decorations to officers and
medals to other ranks for the same level of bravery.
Britain stands alone in maintaining such an outdated, class-ridden system.
It is time the prime minister removed this blemish - the people wish him
well.

FT  20 FEB 93 / To tax, or not to tax ..: Signs of economic recovery are
pushing the UK chancellor into a fiscal dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oddly enough, the past week has been a relatively good one for Mr Norman
Lamont.
Although UK unemployment burst through the 3m mark in January, other
economic indicators have mitigated some of the gloom that settled over the
country last month.
But it is a measure of the difficulties facing the chancellor that no sooner
do the economic skies lift a little than the debate switches to the other
huge problem in his in-tray. Britain's growing public deficit casts a long
and dark shadow over government economic policy. Every sign that the economy
might be improving brings forward the question of whether Mr Lamont's third
Budget on March 16 should be the occasion to start increasing taxes to cut
the deficit.
The chancellor has had conflicting advice at the highest level over the past
week. While the board of the International Monetary Fund has urged Britain
to tighten fiscal policy, six of his seven-man panel of independent economic
forecasters, the Seven Wise Men, yesterday urged him not to raise taxes in
the Budget.
However, all economic commentators agree that the UK's projected public
sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 37bn in 1992-93 or 6.25 per cent of
gross domestic product is unsustainable in the long term. Although deficits
of Pounds 37bn, or the Pounds 50bn widely expected for 1993-94, may be
acceptable in a recession, borrowing on this scale will push up the
country's debt service burden and eventually force the government to cut
public spending or raise taxes.
Mr Lamont has big decisions to take next month. If he tightens policy too
soon, he could go down as the man who aborted the long-awaited recovery. If
he allows the deficit to grow out of control, history might judge that he
condemned Britain to Italian-style fiscal laxity. He has presided over a
dramatic easing of policy since September, with sterling devalued by 15 per
cent and bank base rates down to 6 per cent from 10 per cent. But Mr
Lamont's judgment will hinge crucially on his assessment of present
conditions in the UK economy, where the evidence is mixed and confusing.
The best that can be said of the economy is that developments are still
consistent with the Treasury's Autumn Statement forecast of a meagre 1 per
cent growth this year. At the Bank of England, economists still regard the
economy as 'bumping along the bottom' of the business cycle.
Some encouraging news emerged over the past week. Retail sales, helped by
heavy discounting, increased in volume by 1.6 per cent in January, reversing
a 1 per cent fall in December. But even here, the tale was not one of
unalloyed joy. Seasonally adjusted sales in the three months to January 31
were up by only 0.2 per cent in volume compared with the previous three
months.
There is little sign of recovery in industry. Manufacturing output inched
ahead by less than 0.1 per cent between November and December while output
in the three months to December was down a seasonally adjusted 0.2 per cent
compared with previous three months.
On the other hand, manufacturing productivity has risen sharply, with
December's 6 per cent annual rate of growth marking the highest year-on-year
rise since April 1989.
Higher productivity reflects the past bad news of sharply rising
unemployment among manufacturers. But by helping to keep costs under
control, it holds out hope for the future. Manufacturers' unit labour costs
fell by 0.5 per cent in December compared with a year ago and were flat in
the three months to the end of December, easing the impact of the higher
imported fuel and raw material costs that have followed sterling's
devaluation.
Not surprisingly, indicators of business confidence have shown an increase
in optimism in recent months. However, measures of consumer confidence and
bank and building society lending are far less robust.
In the housing sector, there has been the familiar mix of good and bad news.
Estate agents polled by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors have
reported that house sales continued to improve after Christmas and new year.
However, the Building Societies Association said that net new commitments -
mortgages promised by lenders - fell by about 18 per cent between December
and January and were sharply down on the level of January last year. Gross
mortgage lending fell to Pounds 1.8bn in January from Pounds 2.1bn in
December.
Monetarists also have reason to feel confused. M0, the narrow measure of
money supply which consists mainly of cash and bank notes and which is
targeted by the Treasury, breached its 0 per cent to 4 per cent annual
growth range last month when it rose by an annual 4.1 per cent. However, M4,
the broad money measure that includes bank and building society deposits and
which should reflect the credit
granting of such financial institutions, has been very subdued. Broad money
grew by only 3.2 per cent in the year to January, its lowest growth rate
since records began.
But the 'M's, in so far as they are telling a story of divisions in society,
probably contain the best clue as to what is happening in the economy and
how Mr Lamont will approach the Budget.
The Treasury believes that strong growth in M0 parallels the rise in high
street spending. Many in work or retired have cash to spend and have been
making the most of the bargains in the shops. The unemployed also tend to
live in a more cash-based world.
M4's weak performance may be evidence of the continued damage caused by debt
deflation, or the erosion of wealth by falling asset prices. According to
the Bank of England, more than 1.5m households have negative equity after
falling house prices have put the value of their homes below the level of
their mortgages.
The Bank thinks that debt deflation is the reason why the recession has
lasted so long. Its analysis suggests that it would be wrong to pin recovery
hopes on increased spending by the heavily indebted. Instead, recovery in
the housing and other markets may have to wait until households without debt
problems have the courage to borrow and buy assets at bargain prices.
The problems of debt deflation and the housing market will probably count
against any radical reform of the tax treatment of mortgages in the budget.
Mortgage interest relief is a natural target for a chancellor such as Mr
Lamont, who fancies himself as a tax reformer and favours tax neutrality -
the principle that taxation should not distort economic activity or favour
any special group. Mortgage interest relief contradicts this principle and
is expensive (costing the Treasury an estimated Pounds 5.2bn this financial
year). Although there are good arguments for targeting tax relief on the
first-time buyer, who is so crucial in setting up 'chains' of house sales,
the chancellor would be brave to tamper with existing arrangements before
having clear evidence that house prices have stopped falling.
Instead, Mr Lamont may draw inspiration from the recent sharp fall in
inflation to find relatively painless ways of raising revenue. The drop in
retail price inflation to 1.7 per cent last month is genuinely good news.
Some economists believe that the annual rise in the 'headline' retail prices
index could fall to 1.3 per cent this spring, or half December's 2.6 per
cent rate of inflation which will be used as the basis for indexing tax
allowances and thresholds in the Budget.
Such a drop might justify freezing some or all of the tax allowances which
apply before Britain's 20, 25 and 40 per cent income tax rates take effect.
If Mr Lamont kept all income tax allowances frozen at 1992-93 levels he
would save Pounds 750m in 1993-94.
Low inflation may also give the chancellor some leeway to widen the
value-added tax net, although he must take care that the resulting upward
pressure on prices does not breach the upper limit of the 1 per cent to 4
per cent target range for underlying inflation.
Britain and Ireland are the only European Community members which zero rate
VAT to any extent: in Britain's case zero rating applies to about 24 per
cent of consumer spending. It would be both politically inept and socially
unjust in a recession to impose VAT on food, where zero rating rather than
levying the 17.5 per cent standard VAT rate costs the exchequer Pounds 7bn a
year.
But there are other areas where the case for zero rating or VAT exemption is
less clear. Exempting private education and finance and insurance from VAT
respectively cost the government Pounds 600m and Pounds 2.7bn a year
compared with the standard VAT rate. Zero rating international passenger
transport leads to a revenue loss of Pounds 800m. The exchequer loses Pounds
1.1bn through zero rating books, newspapers, magazines; Pounds 700m on water
and sewerage services and Pounds 500m on ships and aircraft. Domestic
passenger transport (cost Pounds 1.1bn) or domestic fuel and power (cost
Pounds 2.6bn) are also zero rated.
Nobody is suggesting that Mr Lamont is contemplating swingeing tax increases
in the forthcoming Budget. Indeed his Budget judgment will be very finely
balanced. But the examples of zero-rated VAT and VAT exemptions give an
indication of areas where the government might over time bolster its
finances, perhaps by introducing a lower rate VAT in line with continental
practice.
As he settles down to weigh the evidence before making his strategic
decisions for the Budget, the chancellor may reflect on events across the
Atlantic, where President Bill Clinton this week won strong initial support
for his package of tax increases and spending cuts to reduce the US budget
deficit.
Although Mr Lamont believes in a low taxation economy, he also knows that
the continued high deficits in the US and Italy over the past decade have
done nothing to improve the economic performance of those countries. Their
experience is a strong argument for starting to correct the UK's budget
deficit next month.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Man In The News: Smoother after a few days' growth - The US
president has risen in stature since his successful state of the union
address / Bill Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton was so smooth and eloquent in his state of the union
address on Wednesday night that most people must have assumed it was either
the result of hours of practice or reliance on the teleprompter or both.
Keen students of the Clinton speech-making technique thought they detected
some typical extemporisation. But against the press of deadlines and with
advance copies of his text unavailable until moments before delivery there
was little cross-checking between what he said and the official script.
The local correspondent of the Economist, however, is on sabbatical. Like
most journalists in Washington with a moment to spare, he was in a TV studio
preparing to comment on the president's address and he had a text in front
of him. He calculates that up to 30 per cent of what Mr Clinton actually
said was made up as he stood there. Whole sections - including one
beautifully calibrated passage on the economic and social imperatives of
healthcare reform - were nowhere to be found in the written text, at least
not until the White House released the version as delivered afterwards.
Speechmaking is an important ingredient of the politician's art and, when on
form, which is normally late in the day, Mr Clinton can be better than most.
But lots of fine politicians have the rhetorical ability of newts. What
marks Mr Clinton out is an ability to be rhetorically turned on not only by
the emotion of the moment but also by subjects, such as rural
electrification, community block grants and ad valorem taxes, which normally
render most speakers unintelligible and send most audiences to sleep.
This can only be the result of his being what he is - a policy 'wonk'. All
the evidence is that he was involved in every minute detail in the 50 hours
of meetings that preceded Wednesday night. So consuming was his engagement
that up to hours before he spoke amendments were still being made to the
plan by the man himself, thus explaining why the government printing office
simply could not get out the full supplementary documentation until the
following morning.
He is not the sole policy wonk in his new Washington regime. His wife,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, is another, as members of Congress and others are
rapidly discovering as she pursues her investigation into healthcare reform.
She is also not without political tact and charm, as witnessed by the fact
that she invited to sit next to her on Wednesday night Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve, and John Sculley, the Apple computer mogul.
Neither of them looked the least bit uncomfortable as, it can only be
assumed, she discoursed on M2 and MS-Dos.
Another in his element, and also delivering a virtuoso, though off-camera,
performance earlier on Wednesday, is Leon Panetta, the director of the
budget. He rattled through the whole Clinton programme for the benefit of
the media, pretty much without notes and with constant asides to obscure
congressional budgetary authorities and federal programmes with acronyms
from hell. (Try LIHEAP - low income home energy assistance programme - for
size).
This was, of course, his meat and potatoes for many years in Congress, as it
was Lloyd Bentsen's. But the new treasury secretary, following Mr Panetta to
the podium, made no attempt to compete, confining himself to a couple of
folksy and funny anecdotes before driving up to his old milieu on Capitol
Hill to do some serious arm twisting, at which he excels.
This week, indeed, saw the true soul of Bill Clinton and his administration.
There are still serious doubts about his resolution and his slipperiness -
and still more about his ability to get through Congress all or even most of
what he has set forth. There may well also have been some sleight of hand,
some artful juggling of numbers, in the programme he presented.
But there should be much less doubt about his convictions. The bottom line
for Mr Clinton is that he was elected to change the way the country is run.
He defines his mandate for change not as the measly 43 per cent of the vote
that he won last November, the second lowest winning percentage this
century, but as the 62 per cent that he and Ross Perot combined to score in
reaction to the status quo.
As he put it on Wednesday, 'unless we have the courage now to start building
our future and stop borrowing from it, we're condemning ourselves to years
of stagnation, interrupted by occasional recessions, to slow growth in jobs,
to no more growth in incomes, to more disappointment.' Apocalyptic it may
sound, but oversell is a proven technique.
Second, he came to the office with the firm conclusion that if he was to
achieve anything of substance it had to be laid out from the very beginning.
This is always any new president's greatest window of opportunity. The
chances of Congress agreeing to tax increases and serious spending cuts
diminish as mid-term elections approach. If, as happens more often than not,
the president's party in Congress loses seats in the mid-terms, then the
third year of an administration becomes inauspicious for big initiatives
unless early victories have been won.
Third, he can be simultaneously politically ingenious and ingenuous. Until a
week ago, the latter characteristic appeared to predominate as he floundered
around trying to find an attorney general and to get the military to accept
homosexuals. But it was ingenuity of no small order to challenge the
Republicans to come up with bigger and better spending cuts than he had
proposed and also to say that 'if we do right by this country, I do not care
who gets the credit for it'.
Mr Clinton's convictions are also not those of the conventional 'tax and
spend' big government Democrat of conservative demonology, though he may be
more inclined to tax in what he sees as a necessary cause than cut spending
with the same aim in view.
Critics of his package have noted that it constitutes a significant retreat
from an early promise by Mr Panetta and Mr Bentsen to try and find Dollars 2
in spending cuts for every Dollars 1 in new taxes. Mr Panetta claims an
equal division over four years but the hard numbers look more like a ratio
of Dollars 2 in cuts for Dollars 3 in taxes.
Mr Clinton's departure from the Democratic norm is that he believes in both
government and the private sector in more equal balance than his
predecessors. As he put it on Wednesday: 'tonight I want to talk to you
about what government can do because I believe government must do more.'
But, having taken away the Reagan legacy in 19 words, he gave some of it
back in his very next sentence. 'But let me say first that the real engine
of economic growth in this country is the private sector.'
Mr Clinton can, and does, wax eloquently about the virtues of small
business, in particular, though not overpaid corporate fat cats, just as he
does about the nobility of employment as compared with the dependence of
welfare. 'I pledge to you that I will do my best to see that business and
labour and government work together - for a change.' In this respect he
freely contrasts what the US, in his view, does wrong and what Germany and
Japan have done right.
It was significant, therefore, that after the opening rhetorical ruffles and
flourishes, the first segment of his address on Wednesday night was devoted
to the cause of making business more competitive, with government help by
way of investment incentives, a better trained and educated workforce and
infrastructural improvements. The bleeding heart stuff, movingly as it was
rendered, came later. The tax element, surely the most controversial, came
last.
As he has taken his campaign around the country in the past 48 hours, it is
interesting to note that he presents his arguments to ordinary people in a
very similar and detailed way. He may, for populist purposes, dwell a little
more on the evil ways of lobbyists and other 'naysayers' but he sees no
reason to shy away from the fact that he probably knows his brief better
than anyone in his government, including Mr Panetta. He does not talk down
to people and he is a very good listener.
This week, he is basking in the glory of general approbation, with the
opinion polls favourable, Ross Perot offering qualified support, the
Republicans on the defensive, and the Washington pundits prepared to give
him his due. There were even the first kind words from Brussels and Tokyo.
This must also please a president who is known to believe that the greatest
single contribution he can make to international prosperity is to put the
domestic house in order, as America's friends and allies have been urging
for years.
Yesterday, a leader in the New York Times, previously as hostile to Mr
Clinton as it was to the last two southern presidents, LBJ and Jimmy Carter,
praised his 'vision' and wrote: 'Presidents must seem to grow larger in
office. By that standard Wednesday evening was a plus for Mr Clinton and the
nation.' Cautiously it added, 'it is too early to rejoice'.
But Mr Clinton would agree with the caveat and knows this week's euphoria
will not last. He has privately told visitors in the past week that he was
confident enough in his programme and in his own performance to expect good
initial reviews, but that soon the fight will really begin. This is when he
is really going to have to show his leadership and sell his convictions.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Bill Clinton, the gambler
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton, after a fumbling transition, can feel pleased with
himself and his first month in office. The international reaction to his
bold budget proposals, apart from a few understandable equity market
flutters, was positive, and the initial US popular response has been
enthusiastic. This is no small feat. It comes as no surprise that America's
partners have welcomed what appears, at last, to be a serious attempt to
close the US budget deficit. More surprising is the apparent support of
middle America for a package that raises taxes on middle-class Americans.
The US deficit is mainly a domestic political issue for Mr Clinton, and a
risky one too. So the most significant endorsement of Mr Clinton's budget
package came from Mr Ross Perot, erstwhile presidential candidate and number
one US deficit-hater. Of course, the four-year package of tax increases and
spending cuts did not go far enough for Mr Perot's liking. The president
plans to raise taxes by about Dollars 240bn over four years and make net
spending cuts (after allowing for a Dollars 160bn boost to public
investment) of about Dollars 80bn. It is projected by the White House to
halve the budget deficit from Dollars 332bn or 5 per cent of gross domestic
product this year to 2 1/2 per cent of GDP (Dollars 206bn) in 1997, which
would still be a drain on national savings.
Mr Clinton will have his work cut out if he is to force the package through
Congress and ensure that he is still in the White House to celebrate the
meeting of these targets at the start of his second term. The Republican
opposition was predictable: more tax and spend economics from a Democrat
politician. More worrying for nervous Democrat senators, some of whom face
congressional elections next year, are the political ramifications from
increasing taxes on middle-income voters.
Higher taxes
Some 70 per cent of the increase in taxation will come from people earning
over Dollars 100,000 a year, largely through a new top-income tax rate of 36
per cent for couples earning more than Dollars 140,000 in taxable income and
a 10 per cent surtax on taxpayers earning more than Dollars 250,000. But the
energy tax and other tinkering mean that the great bulk of American
households - all families with incomes of more than Dollars 30,000 a year -
will pay higher taxes as a result, breaking Mr Clinton's mistaken campaign
pledge not to raise middle class taxes.
Yet the fact that the opinion polls show widespread popular support for the
package, and the popularity of Ross Perot's kitchen sink economics, may
indicate a new realism among middle-class Americans. The need to raise
taxes, as well as cut spending, in order to close the budget gap is clear;
and Americans are currently asked to pay a relatively low proportion of
income in taxes to state and federal government. Mr Clinton's package would
raise taxes by over 1 percentage point of US GDP, but from a base of a
little over 30 per cent compared to more than 40 per cent in all the main
west European countries.
Economic recovery
Mr Clinton also has the luxury of an economic recovery, a fact confirmed by
the optimistic testimony to Congress yesterday from Federal Reserve chairman
Alan Greenspan. A good economist but also a shrewd politician, Mr Greenspan
will not trumpet the fact that the credit for this recovery rests with the
cuts in interest rates that the Fed has delivered over the past few years
rather than with Mr Clinton. But the president, who is probably a shrewder
politician than economist, will happily claim the credit for his medium-term
budget consolidation and short-term fiscal stimulus, worth Dollars 30bn over
the next two years. The medium-term effect of the budget package may be
slightly deflationary as consumers rein in consumption to pay higher taxes.
But if, despite its structural problems, the US economy can deliver higher
employment and higher real wages over the next three years, then Mr Clinton
may get away with his tax increases.
The most significant international effect of the package will be felt on
world long-term interest rates. Long-term US interest rates fell by 0.1
percentage points over the course of last week as the scale of the Clinton
package became clear. They have fallen by a full  1/2 point since November's
election. The rest of the world can only hope that the beneficial effects
from lower long-term rates, and a US recovery, are not outweighed by a US
shift towards protectionism as Mr Clinton bargains with Congress in order to
see his budget proposals enacted.
Yet the main obstacle to European growth is short-term European interest
rates. Lower long-term interest rates will be the trophy that the US
delegation will bring to next weekend's meeting of finance ministers from
the G7 group of leading industrialised countries; and a reciprocal cut in
European interest rates will be its aim. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen
will rightly receive the praise of the G7 for starting to bring the US
deficit under control. Sadly for the US and growth-starved Europe, he is
likely to get little in return.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Abta attacks bond rules: Collapsed ski companies unable to
meet liabilities to customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUALITY SKI and Winter World, two ski companies which have collapsed in the
past two weeks, had arranged bonds which were insufficient to meet
liabilities to customers, the Association of British Travel Agents said
yesterday.
Abta said the shortfall of more than Pounds 800,000 would be covered by its
reserve insurance fund, which contains more than Pounds 4m. Abta said the
inadequacy of the two bonds demonstrated the weakness of new government
regulations which allow companies to arrange their own insurance outside the
framework of travel organisations.
A third ski company, Euro Express of Burgess Hill, East Sussex, collapsed
yesterday, but Abta said it believed the company's bond was adequate.
Quality Ski, based in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, and which went into
liquidation last week, said customers could take their holidays with
Altours, which is not part of Abta. Mr Arthur Smith, Altours' managing
director, confirmed yesterday that he had been a director of Quality Ski
until last February.
Mr Smith said Quality Ski customers travelling by air were protected by
Altours' Civil Aviation Authority licence. He said, however, that Quality
Ski customers travelling by coach with Altours were not protected by a bond.
Mr Ian Pinder, Quality Ski's managing director, said 74 of the 80 groups
booked to go to France, Italy and Austria during the half-term holiday had
elected to travel with Altours. The rest were advised to approach Abta for
refunds.
Quality Ski's bond was for Pounds 500,000, but Abta believes that the
company owes customers more than Pounds 1m. Asked whether he was aware that
his bond was inadequate, Mr Pinder said: 'I haven't got a clue.' He said
that complaints should be addressed to Abta.
Winter World, based in Skipton, North Yorkshire, which collapsed last
Thursday, is believed to have a bond of Pounds 700,000. But its liabilities
to customers are also thought to exceed Pounds 1m.
Mr John Dunscombe, Abta chief executive, said: 'Bonding is not an exact
science. This is why we require the underpinning of an insurance policy.'
Mr Dunscombe said bonding levels and the size of the back-up fund had been
increased since ski company collapses two years ago imposed severe strains
on Abta finances.
Under new government regulations, companies have until March 31 to ensure
customers are adequately protected. Non-Abta members can take out insurance
policies.
Mr Dunscombe said, however, that the collapse of the ski companies showed
how difficult it would be to ensure travellers were adequately protected.

THE WAVE of union de-recognition by magazine publishing companies continued
yesterday with the announcement that the NUJ journalists' union and the GPMU
print union will no longer be recognised at several business magazines
recently acquired by the publishing group Emap, David Goodhart writes.
Both unions said they were considering legal action on the grounds that they
had not been consulted about Emap's takeover of 14 Thomson business
magazines. They said that was in breach of the European Community Acquired
Rights directive. About 200 employees will be affected.

<TEXT>
THREE new approaches to cancer treatment are giving promising results in
early clinical tests, a conference in London on the study of tumours was
told yesterday.
All three result from collaborative research involving Scotia
Pharmaceuticals, a UK-Canadian drug company, and university medical centres
in the UK and overseas.
Potentially the most far-reaching treatment is a tumour-killing drug, EF13,
which Scotia described as a 'magic bullet' which could destroy cancer cells
without harming normal tissues.
Preliminary clinical trials indicate that the drug may double the survival
time of patients with late-stage pancreatic and breast cancers.
If the drugs continue to show promise they could be available commercially
within three or four years.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Patten concedes on tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Patten, education secretary, yesterday moved to defuse controversy
over this year's compulsory English tests for 14-year-olds in England and
Wales.
While the tests will go ahead as planned, the results will not be published
in school league tables. However, national totals will be compiled, allowing
parents to compare their children's performance with the national average.
While the move was welcomed by moderate teachers' unions, the two largest
unions, the NUT and the NASUWT, said that they would continue balloting
members over boycotting the tests.
Teachers' unions had claimed that the tests, to be taken for the first time
in June, had been inadequately prepared and that material for them had
arrived at schools too late.
The announcement that the results of the tests would not be included in
schools performance tables appeared to have detached the moderate unions
from the opposition camp.
Mr Peter Smith of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers described the
decision as 'statesmanlike'. He said it was evidence that Mr Patten had
heeded fears expressed over the tests in a meeting with teachers' unions
earlier this week.
Mr David Hart of the National Association of Head Teachers said the move met
his union's main objection. 'It effectively converts this year's tests into
an unpublished national trial,' he said.
Mr Patten also published consultation documents setting out the government's
plans for this year's performance tables for schools and colleges. The
league tables will cover 4,000 state secondary schools and 19,000 primary
schools. For the first time they will also cover 2,000 independent schools,
and 470 sixth-form and further-education colleges.
The tables will include national curriculum test results; GCSE, A-level and
AS-level examination results; vocational examination results and truancy
rates.
In a concession to independent schools, schools will be able to include GCSE
exam results taken up to three years before the age of 16. This year, only
results in the previous two years could be included which meant that some
schools that entered pupils very early for GCSEs appeared to have fewer
pupils with five or more passes at grade C and above.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Nalgo to restrict outlay on strike pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NALGO, the local government union, is to restrict strike pay by sticking
more strictly to its rules after emergency funds were depleted last year.
Disputes in three London branches - Islington, Newham and Camden - cost
Pounds 9.5m last year. The national strike fund is estimated to stand at
Pounds 17m.
The move is in anticipation of a flurry of industrial action this spring.
The union's local government group meeting earlier this month pledged to
oppose the government's 1.5 per cent pay ceiling and any compulsory
redundancies. Branches are likely to ballot next month on whether to stage a
one-day strike.
The national emergency committee has told branches it will stick rigidly to
its guidelines under which strikers can be paid the equivalent of their full
take-home pay.

FT  20 FEB 93 / New cancer drugs show promise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE new approaches to cancer treatment are giving promising results in
early clinical tests, an oncology conference in London was told yesterday.
All three result from collaborative research involving Scotia
Pharmaceuticals, a UK-Canadian drug company, and university medical centres
in the UK and overseas.
Potentially the most far-reaching treatment is a tumour-killing drug, EF13,
which Scotia described as a 'magic bullet' which could destroy cancer cells
without harming normal tissues.
Preliminary clinical trials indicate that the drug may double the survival
time of patients with late-stage pancreatic and breast cancers.
The doctors involved, however, are wary of making extravagant claims for
what is still an experimental drug. 'EF13 seems to have important
therapeutic effects without harming the patients,' said Mr Ken Fearon from
Edinburgh University's department of surgery. 'It really is different from
anything else available.'
Dr David Horrobin, Scotia chief executive, said EF13 was developed not to be
a more potent cell killer than other cancer drugs but to be free of the
toxic side effects which make conventional chemotherapy so unpleasant. It is
similar chemically to Evening Primrose Oil which has until recently been the
main source of income for his company.
The second new drug, EF27, reduces the harmful effects of radiotherapy.
Trials by the Radiobiology Research Group at Oxford's Churchill Hospital
show that the drug can protect normal tissue from radiation damage while
enhancing the damage caused to cancer cells.
The third drug, EF9, is a light-activated chemical designed to improve a
form of cancer treatment known as photodynamic therapy. EF9 destroys cancer
cells when the tumour is illuminated by laser.
If the treatments continue to show promise they could be available
commercially within three or four years.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Labour's union ties win support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE long-awaited interim report on the future of the Labour party's links
with the unions suggests they are 'a cause for celebration rather than
concern'. It argues strongly that Labour's relationship with the unions
'continues to be immensely valuable to the party'.
However, the document proposes an end to the union block vote at party
conference and the eventual introduction of one member one vote for the
selection of parliamentary candidates and election of the party leader.
But the 15-strong group of senior union officials and Labour MPs was unable
to agree on firm recommendations. Instead, their report - which is to be
presented to the party's national executive committee - sets out a series of
options.
A questionnaire will be sent to unions and constituency parties. They will
have until June 10 to respond. The NEC will then decide on precise proposals
and present them for approval at the party conference in the autumn. But Mr
John Smith, the party leader, is expected to comment on the union-party
links at next Wednesday's NEC meeting.
The only member of the review group to oppose the party's present links with
the unions was Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary. The report is firm
in its proposal to end the union block vote at party conference and replace
it with a system under which the voting entitlement of each union is divided
up among its delegates and cast separately.
It also agrees on the gradual move to a 50-50 voting parity between the
unions and constituency parties in the annual conference, although it
suggests the introduction in the autumn of a 70-30 split between union-party
voting strengths should be retained for the time being.
The report suggests a possible 'trigger' for a cut in the union proportion
at conference with a 1 per cent drop for every 10,000 additional individual
members over the present 300,000.
The group argues strongly for maintaining union links with Labour. It argues
that the unions are 'a realistic and stabilising force in the party without
whom on many occasions in the past few decades the Labour party would have
torn itself apart'.

FT  20 FEB 93 / GMTV recruits TV-am saviour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GMTV, the breakfast television station, is calling in Mr Greg Dyke, who
saved the ailing TV-am in the 1980s and made Roland Rat a household name, to
spice up its programmes and woo more viewers.
Mr Dyke, who succeeds Mr Harry Roche as non-executive chairman, insisted
there was 'not a crisis' at GMTV, in spite of disappointing ratings.
He said: 'GMTV's performance has been satisfactory although clearly not as
strong as had been hoped for. Audiences are 15 per cent less than wanted,
but we can improve them.'
He added that when he joined TV-am in 1983, audiences were 200,000 and the
channel had 'only two adverts'. GMTV, he said, was attracting nearly 2m
viewers.
But the station carries the burden of its hefty Pounds 34.6m franchise bid,
which it must pay annually to the Treasury, together with 15 per cent of
revenues. It has lost viewers since taking over from TV-am at the start of
the year, and faces fierce and unexpected competition for viewers from
Channel 4's off-beat Big Breakfast. City analysts are forecasting operating
losses for GMTV each year until 1996.
The station last week appointed Mr Eamonn Holmes to replace Mr Michael
Wilson as co-presenter with Ms Fiona Armstrong. It has also signed up a
cartoon based on characters in a Super Nintendo computer game.
Mr Dyke refused yesterday to talk about personnel changes or specific plans,
but said he had 'lots of ideas'. He added: TV is about good ideas'.
He hinted that the much-vaunted 'F-factor' of GMTV's presenters might shift
to 'family' rather than 'fanciability'. He said: 'What we want is a family
of people who like each other and the audience like them.'
C4's Big Breakfast said yesterday that Mr Dyke was wrong to dismiss it as a
programme for 'kids', as young audiences were attractive to advertisers.
Former associates emphasised Mr Dyke's abilities and 'instinctive
understanding' of television, but said his non-executive role at GMTV would
be different from that at TV-am, where he was editor-in-chief.
He will continue as chief executive of LWT and chairman of the Independent
Television Association.
Mr Dyke, 46, who made his name at LWT with programmes such as the London
Programme and Weekend World, boosted audiences at TV-am to more than 1m.
TV-am later became one of the world's most profitable TV companies.
His tactics included promoting the Roland Rat puppet, and presenters such as
Nick Owen and Loyd Grossman.
He would have been a favourite for the job of ITV's central scheduler were
it not for 'golden handcuffs' keeping him at LWT - share options which are
expected to make him a millionaire when they become exercisable later this
year.
Mr Dyke refused to discuss GMTV's financial position yesterday, saying it
was too early in the year to draw conclusions. The company still hopes to
make an operating profit.
However, stock market and media analysts said GMTV, whose shareholders are
Disney, LWT, Carlton, Scottish TV and the Guardian, was unlikely to meet its
business plan forecasts for advertising revenues of about Pounds 80m-Pounds
90m this year.
Ms Christine Walker, chief executive of media specialist Zenith, a
subsidiary of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, said GMTV's revenues this year are likely
to fall to Pounds 60m. 'The Big Breakfast and satellite are acting as a
pincer movement against GMTV,' she said.
According to Zenith's analysis of BARB's adult viewing figures, GMTV's
audience share in January fell more than 20 per cent compared with January
1992.
GMTV has been able to cut costs compared with TV-am - for example by
reducing staff and contracting out news services. However, several analysts
believe the station's high annual franchise fee, which is index linked, will
push GMTV into a loss by the year end.
Before yesterday's announcement, stockbrokers James Capel were forecasting
1993 revenues of Pounds 81m and a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.8m. Capel said
GMTV would make operating losses until 1996, and pre-tax losses until 1997.

Yesterday the seven-man panel of economic advisers to the Treasury made its
first report. The main points were:
Recovery prospects
Greatly improved as a result of sterling's exit from the European exchange
rate mechanism. But much uncertainty about output strength this year, with
average forecast of 1.1 per cent growth in 1993.
Risks to upturn
None of the panel expects a strong upturn in world economy, with a risk that
a big contraction in Europe could depress UK exports. Interest rates
Gavyn Davies and Patrick Minford want further cuts from 6 per cent soon. The
other five members would reduce credit rates only if the economy weakens or
sterling appreciates, or in response to changes in money supply.
Taxes
Tim Congdon wants Budget announcement of tax rise in 1993-94 to demonstrate
commitment to tight finances. The others say tax rises in 1993 would harm a
recovery though they might be needed later.
Credit growth
Broad money and credit growth 'may remain depressed' during this year. Panel
reckons the 'lending capacity of the monetary system may be inadequate to
sustain recovery'.
Unemployment
Likely to rise from 3m to between 3.1m to 3.4m by the end of this year. One
panellist, Wynne Godley, thinks the total will climb to 3.6m by the final
quarter of 1994.
Current account deficit
The deficit is 'very large for this stage of the cycle and for most of us
this is a cause for concern'. The economists think the deficit will reach
Pounds 15.5bn in both this year and 1994 after Pounds 12bn last year.
Inflation
Panel thinks underlying inflation (measured by the retail prices index less
mortgage payments) will remain inside the Treasury's 1 per cent to 4 per
cent target range over next two years.
Gilts
Panel wants the government to abandon full funding, allowing gilt purchases
by banks and building societies to count towards financing the PSBR. That
would help an upturn by boosting the money supply while also cutting
long-term gilt yields.
Medium-term growth
Four of the seven think UK growth in the 1990s could be above its
'sustainable rate' of 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent a year.
The advisers are: Wynne Godley, Patrick Minford, Tim Congdon, Andrew
Britton, David Currie, Gavyn Davies and Andrew Sentance.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Secrecy of activity in Civil service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER proposals for removing unnecessary secrecy about the activities of
civil servants and ministers are expected to be announced before the end of
July, Ivor Owen writes.
This was revealed in the Commons yesterday when MPs gave an unopposed second
reading to the Right to Know Bill. The move was against the advice of Mr
William Waldegrave, the minister responsible for identifying areas of
excessive government secrecy.
The bill is a private member's measure, introduced with cross-party support
by Mr Mark Fisher, the Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central.

FT  20 FEB 93 / CSO combats leaks of official statistics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS and officials will have their access to economic data restricted
ahead of official release, government statisticians said yesterday.
The changes will reduce the number of those who receive figures before
publication and the length of time statistics are available to departments
in advance of publication.
The move, presented as part of the government's drive for greater openness,
reflects a desire to boost the integrity and independence of the statistics,
which are felt to have suffered from leaks.
Even where details of market-sensitive information are not made available,
its general tenor can emerge. On Tuesday night, for example, Mr John Major
hinted that the official figures for retail sales, published on Wednesday,
would confirm a sustained upturn in consumer confidence.
Under plans announced by the Central Statistical Office the independent body
which issues most government economic statistics, ministers and officials
will usually have only 1 1/2 days to view data ahead of publication -
instead of up to nine days as at present.
In addition, the number of government employees with advance access will be
sharply reduced although ministerial access will be less affected.
The provisional retail prices index is now given to the chancellor and other
officials nine days before publication, and export figures six days before
publication. Producer prices figures, which are circulated to nine ministers
and 22 officials, are released up to three days before publication.
The move marks an attempt to exert tighter control over release of
market-sensitive trade and business information. Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, agreed the change with Mr Major, and other ministers were
informed at cabinet on Thursday.
The main initiative has come from the CSO, which has been stung by
allegations of leaks and statistical massaging. 'There is certainly a very
bad public perception problem,' Mr Bill McLennan, director of the CSO, said
yesterday.
He said he hoped that the changes would lead government departments to
tighten their practices but said the CSO was powerless to force the
government to curb leaks.
A provisional estimate of GDP will be published 3 1/2 weeks after the end of
the quarter - four weeks earlier than at present.
The Treasury said yesterday it broadly supported the proposals although they
could cause 'mild inconvenience'.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Morning after awaits the drinks market: FT reporters
investigate who will bear the brunt of the price effects of devaluation in
five sectors that affect the retail prices index. Will it be retailers,
consumers, UK manufacturers or suppliers abroad?
</HEADLINE>

IT'S not the low pound which has dampened the spirits of drinkers and
partygoers. The price effects have hardly filtered through. Thanks to the
recession volumes are under pressure and competition is intense. Producers,
shippers and retailers have tried to absorb the extra costs rather than
raise prices.
Champagne sales recovered slightly last year after a 34 per cent fall in
1991 and champagne houses, facing increased competition from manufacturers
of cheaper sparkling wine, are keen to protect themselves in their biggest
export market.
Mr Nicholas Strachan, marketing director of Mentzendorff, the wine shippers,
says a 15 per cent reduction in the cost of grapes last year has enabled
Bollinger to avoid raising prices so far. 'However, prices have been largely
unchanged for two years, and I think it is unlikely they can be maintained
through the second half of this year.'
Moet &amp; Chandon has raised prices by 6 per cent, and others are expected to
follow. 'But I do not expect anyone to try to recoup the entire cost of
devaluation,' says one shipper. 'It's difficult enough to sell champagne at
the moment.'
Prices of most French and German wines rose by between 5 per cent and and 10
per cent soon after the sterling depreciation last September. Ms Jayne
Bridges of the Threshers off-licence chain says: 'When Britain joined the
ERM we stopped buying foreign currency forward-payment. As a result, we were
caught without cover last September when the pound was devalued while about
100,000 cases were being shipped to us.
'We have absorbed some costs and a few suppliers and agents have done the
same. But most of our producers are just too small to do so. The further
depreciation of the pound is adding to the strain.'
French and German wines have been losing sales to products from Australia
and New Zealand, California and South Africa. But abundant harvests in 1992
had been expected to ensure more competitive prices this year. 'Devaluation
has hit the industry hard,' said Ms Tan Harrington, of the German Wine
Bureau. 'The pressure is to keep prices down, but something may have to
give.'

FT  20 FEB 93 / Cost trimming that is part of the furniture: FT reporters

five sectors that affect the retail prices index. Will it be retailers,

THE general manager of Hartman UK, Mr Alistair Walker, does not mince words
when giving his view on the impact of devaluation on the furniture and
furnishings industry: 'It's been like a kick in the nuts.'
Hartman UK is a subsidiary of a Dutch-based group which imports and
distributes garden furniture from the Netherlands. The 'kick' has been
Pounds 100,000 - a net loss directly attributable to the exchange rate  -
which will leave Mr Walker's company 'breaking even this year rather than
making a profit'.
Kicks are also being absorbed in the domestic furniture and furnishings
sector. Mr Philip Wain, company accountant in the fabrics division of
Parker-Knoll - which supplies fabrics woven in British and French mills to
department stores around the country - says: 'So far we have taken the hit -
about Pounds 40,000 - ourselves without passing it on.'
Throughout the industry distributors and manufacturers are absorbing the
extra costs rather than raising prices. If prices have moved, it has been
downwards in the midst of the recession and stiff competition.
At Peter Jones in London, a Hartman table was on offer at Pounds 159 this
week compared with Pounds 175 last summer, an example of the discounting
that has happened in many department stores recently.
The knock-back effect devaluation is having on foreign companies is
illustrated by Business Furniture Holdings, a British company which sells
office furniture.
Prior to devaluation the company was importing Pounds 180,000 worth of door
hinges and steel shelf supports annually from Austria and Germany. It has
switched Pounds 140,000 of this to a UK supplier, and Pounds 10,000 to an
Italian supplier. Mr Ivor Bloohn, managing director, estimates he has
achieved a 9 per cent reduction in costs.
Silent Night is another company that has achieved small price reductions
with its foreign suppliers - between 2 per cent and 3 per cent on bed
fabrics from Belgium and beech slats from Germany.
For all the juggling, Silent Night admits it has had to pass on the impact
of devaluation to the consumer. According to Mr Barry McKenzie, the
company's finance director, the price of some of its bed products have
increased since September by between 2 per cent and 3 per cent.
Such increases are the exception rather than the rule in the sector, but
manufacturers, distributors and retailers warn that it could become more
widespread if sterling remains at its current level and/or there is an
upturn in demand.
Mr Walker speaks for his sector when he says: 'No one in the long-term can
bear more than a 20 per cent devaluation without passing it on . . . If
sterling stays as it is for the foreseeable future, our pricing policy will
have to change . . .I think March time could be the crunch.'

ASK WHO is bearing the impact of devaluation in the food sector and the
industry won't give you a clear answer. But while most supermarket chains
are stressing, in public at least, their determination to keep prices down,
many food manufacturers are making gloomy noises.
The evidence so far suggests that prices are being kept down. Between
September and January, the government's retail food price index rose 1.34
per cent, slightly more than the 1.1 per cent rise in the RPI.
But if leading manufacturers have been taking the impact of higher prices on
their margins, they warn that will not do so for much longer. Northern
Foods, Marks and Spencer's biggest supplier, plans increases of up to 8 per
cent by April to compensate for devaluation, while United Biscuits has
announced rises of 5 per cent.
As a net importer of food to the tune of Pounds 6.8bn last year, Britain is
highly exposed to international price shifts. Sharply higher raw materials
costs have forced many manufacturers to revise their budgets.
But other factors are at work that could keep down the average supermarket
bill. Plentiful production is helping to hold down prices of fresh produce
including salads, potatoes and other vegetables. The Meat and Livestock
Commission says that the retail price of pork, in surplus throughout Europe,
has fallen slightly since September.
Manufacturers and retailers are unsure how far they dare pass on higher
costs at a time of weak demand. The recession has made many consumers
economise by cutting out luxuries and 'trading down' to less expensive
products.
The steepest cost increases so far have been for commodities such as beef,
sugar and cereals which are subject to Common Agricultural Policy support
schemes. Since September these products - both home-produced and imported -
have been hit by a 22 per cent devaluation of the green pound, the currency
used in EC farm trade.
The speed at which these increases have shown up on supermarket shelves
varies widely, depending on the competitive structure of individual market
sectors and the strength of the producers in them.
In sugar, Tate &amp; Lyle and British Sugar - which share a UK market monopoly -
have had little difficulty pushing through sharp rises. Poultry producers
have offset a 13 per cent rise in feed prices from devaluation by raising
chicken prices by about 6 per cent.
But the price of eggs, in a production glut, has barely budged, while excess
capacity and cut-throat competition have so far prevented the big bakers
from recouping higher grain costs by raising the retail price of bread.
But eventually someone will have to bear the higher costs. Although neither
retailers nor suppliers will divulge details of price negotiations, both
sides say they are exceptionally tough.
Industry sources say dominant suppliers with strong brands are securing
trade price increases in line with their higher costs. But retailers
sometimes insist they hand back part of the gains in special offers and
price promotions.
The leading supermarkets have a double incentive to fight to preserve market
share - they've invested heavily in new superstores, and are under growing
threat from fast-expanding discount chains such as Kwik Save and Aldi.
Faced with these pressures, many suppliers are seeking to absorb higher
costs through increased efficiency. UK food manufacturers' productivity
improved about 5 per cent last year, and several plan further restructuring.
They are also benefiting from lower packaging prices, due to weaker demand
throughout Europe.

DON'T expect the devaluation of sterling to produce higher prices for
clothing and footwear quickly. That is the message from retailers, in spite
of the very high import content of these products.
Customers will not stand for price increases at present, and shopkeepers,
manufacturers and importers accept they must absorb some of the extra costs
caused by sterling's tumble.
In some cases this means looking for cheaper sources of supply. For example,
the import of cut-price shoes from China last year jumped 60 per cent to 27m
pairs. Some British clothing manufacturers have been approached by
retailers, such as Woolworths and Littlewoods, seeking quotes for goods
normally supplied from the Far East. About 45 per cent of clothes sold in
British high streets are imported.
Domestic manufacturers also face an increase in costs. They have little
option but to import woollen and cotton fibres and fabrics as well as some
synthetic materials.
Mr Colin Purvis, secretary-general of the Apparel Knitting and Textiles
Alliance, said: 'A rough estimate is that about 55 per cent to 60 per cent
by value - and 80 per cent by volume - of textiles sold in Britain come from
imported materials.'
Courtaulds Textiles said the experiences of manufacturers and retailers have
been patchy since devaluation.
'Purchases of many finished goods for the 1993 spring selling season would
have been agreed with overseas suppliers before sterling's collapse,' said
the company, which imports small amounts of clothing to supplement its
domestically manufactured range.
Marks and Spencer, which buys 80 per cent of its clothing from UK
manufacturers, said it would be difficult to pass increases to customers,
though some price rises are likely.
The British Footwear Manufacturers' Federation said struggling shoe
retailers would not want to pass price increases on to customers. 'Retailers
will want to buy the cheapest shoe available,' it said. 'If they cannot get
them from traditional manufacturers and importers they will switch to other
suppliers from emerging countries such as the Republic of China.'

FT  20 FEB 93 / Blair urges 'moral' approach on crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPEAKING out about moral values and principles is an important element in
turning back the rising tide of crime, Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home
secretary, said yesterday.
Mr Blair said the community must rediscover a sense of direction and
recognise that individuals had obligations towards others as well as rights.
His speech marks a further step in his long-term approach of changing
Labour's crime policy, and of moving away from old stereotypes of putting
the emphasis on blaming society rather than the individuals.
'If we do not learn and then teach the value of what is right and what is
wrong, then the result is simply moral chaos which engulfs us all,' he told
Wellingborough Labour party.
Mr Blair said that the 'historic problem of old socialism was the tendency
to subsume the individual rights, duties and all, within the ideas of the
'public good', that at its worst came simply to mean the state'.
The task, he added, was to rescue the idea of community from the narrow view
of the state, and establish a new relationship between society and the
individual.
His approach will be carried a stage further on Monday when he will detail
Labour's plans for dealing with juvenile crime.
These are expected to include tougher powers for the courts and the
provision of more secure accommodation, though not along the lines of the
'approved schools' suggested by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secre tary.
Labour believes that the Conservatives' record on crime has become so
tarnished that the party no longer commands the public confidence on law and
order that it used to do.

SUCH is the global nature of the motor industry of the 1990s that
devaluation's impact on UK manufacturers, markets and dealers is one of
swings and roundabouts.
For big multinationals such as Ford and Vauxhall, the 15 per cent higher
cost of importing cars and components from Germany and Belgium is partly
offset by exports of UK-built Fiestas and Escorts, plus engines and other
components for which the UK is Ford's only source.
For Rover Group, devaluation has mostly been a boon. Of its total Pounds
2.2bn annual spending on components, 80 per cent is in the UK and only 11
per cent in continental Europe.
Not only is it benefiting from being more competitive abroad - reflected in
the planned doubling of Montego and Maestro output - but its UK dealers have
more market leeway because of price rises forced on some of their importing
rivals.
Ford's loss-making subsidiary Jaguar can afford a pained smile, too. Heavily
dependent on US sales, its losses have shrunk as sterling has sunk from
Dollars 2 to under Dollars 1.45.
For big component makers, devaluation's net effect is variable - not just
because of sterling's widely varying shifts against other currencies.
As part of the globalisation process, GKN, T&amp;N, Lucas and other large
components groups have set up a network of overseas plants. In sterling
terms GKN is a beneficiary of its German plants serving German carmakers,
and of its dollar-based businesses in North Carolina.
Less than a quarter of GKN's output is in the UK, requiring more expensive
raw materials. But, as with T&amp;N, much of this output is exported and, with
its low-cost UK labour content, more price-competitive.
The real crunch is for importers of German cars because recession-plagued
Britons do not want to know about the price increases importers need to
offset devaluation. Given the market's plunge of 700,000 units to fewer than
1.6m units in three years, they barely want to know about car purchases at
all.
As a result BMW's wholly owned sales subsidiary has struck a novel agreement
with its 160 UK dealers.
BMW(GB) has been very profitable, making more than Pounds 22m on its 38,000
car sales in 1991 and further profits last year. But the 1992 figures will
not reflect devaluation because BMW bought currency forward at a 1992
average of DM2.84. Having obtained cover for this year's first quarter at DM
2.50, it increased retail prices by only 3 per cent in December.
But the pain will be much worse if its next forward buying has to be around
DM2.36. So it is insisting that dealers share it by capping their profit
margins.
Volkswagen has raised list prices by 7.5 per cent since September. But
having taken over UK distribution from Lonrho it wants a substantially
larger market share and so is leaving dealer margins unchanged at about 15
per cent.
Nevertheless, this leaves dealers with the same problem as that causing
friction elsewhere - including at market leader Ford.
Ford price rises last month left UK-built Fiesta retail prices only about
2.5 per cent higher than in early 1992, but those of Escorts are about 7.6
per cent higher and German-built Granadas and Sierras 13 per cent higher.
Mr Alan Pulham, a director of the Retail Motor Industry Federation, says
consumers will not tolerate such increases. Even though dealers are being
charged more, their effective margins - officially unchanged  - are being
further squeezed.
Mr Pulham said: 'We believe that the time is right for manufacturers to
reduce wholesale prices - it is appropriate that questions should now be
asked about where and how wholesale prices of new cars are set and
achieved.'
Manufacturers, he claims, grab 90 per cent of any price increases at a time
when car dealers have the lowest net margins of any retail sector.
Manufacturers reject the charges. Mr Ian McAllister, Ford's chairman, points
to Ford's big losses in the UK and says no manufacturer can ignore the
devaluation and last year's 4 per cent inflation.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Ministers fight for EC treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RENEWED government offensive to promote the merits of the Maastricht
treaty began yesterday as ministers came under fierce attack from the
opposition over this week's backtracking on the legal consequences of
Labour's amendment on the social chapter.
Even though Monday's embarrassing U-turn seems to have saved the government
from the worst danger of defeat by an alliance of opposition parties and
Tory Euro-sceptics, ministers still made opportunities to drive home the
consequences for the UK of failing to ratify the treaty.
Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the Foreign Office minister, said the treaty
established inter-government co-operation as a framework for community
development, and was critical to economic recovery.
'Nobody should under-estimate the body blow it would be for Britain if we
were to take up a semi-detached position as far as Europe is concerned,' he
warned.
The message will be taken up today in a speech by Mr Douglas Hurd, the
foreign secretary. Looking at the prospects for the community over the
coming decade, he will emphasise that Maastricht is part of a longer-term
game in which it is vital to ensure that the UK remains an influential
player. He will set out a European vision of a wider, de-centralised,
outward-looking, free-trade community - a vision ministers believe can unite
the Tory party.
Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats returned to the attack over Mr John
Major's refusal to publish the advice from Sir Nicholas Lyell, the
attorney-general, which says that acceptance of Labour's social chapter
amendment would not affect the government's ability to ratify the treaty.
In a letter to the prime minister, Mr John Smith, the Labour leader,
insisted that the reasoning behind the opinion was 'a vital piece of
information which should not be withheld from parliament'.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, accused ministers of showing
'a disgraceful contempt for parliament'.
Talking of 'the fumbling indecision of the government and growing evidence
of the lack of integrity of cabinet ministers,' Mr Ashdown said he could not
see why anyone should trust the government on this issue until it produced
its evidence.
The government has already conceded that in future the attorney-general or
his deputy should be available at Westminster whenever MPs debate the bill,
but the opposition says that is not enough. When discussion resumes on
Monday, Labour will call for a new debate on its amendment in the light of
the revised legal advice.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's external trade commissioner, yesterday echoed
ministerial warnings about the economic consequences of rejecting the
treaty. He also raised the prospect of the UK being in the slow lane of a
two-speed Europe, saying that it would lead to a grouping of nations within
the EC 'determined to go ahead further and faster without us, but with a
huge influence over our economic future and potentially even our security'.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Move to reduce secrecy backed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER proposals for removing unnecessary secrecy about the activities of
civil servants and ministers are expected to be announced before the end of
July.
This was revealed in the Commons yesterday when MPs gave an unopposed second
reading to the Right to Know Bill. The move was against the advice of Mr
William Waldegrave, the minister responsible for identifying areas of
excessive government secrecy.
The bill is a private member's measure, introduced with cross-party support
by Mr Mark Fisher, Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent central. It seeks to advance
the cause of open government by providing the public with a general right of
access to most official records.
The bill, which also requires companies to include in annual reports details
of convictions for breaching health and safety regulations, has little
chance of becoming law.

China's reluctance to commit itself to talks with Britain about Hong Kong's
political future has left British diplomats in the colony groping for an
explanation, Simon Holberton writes from Hong Kong.
News that Britain and China were talking about talks was leaked to the
Chinese press in Hong Kong at the beginning of the week. An announcement
that the two had agreed to negotiations was expected by the end of this
week.
One British diplomat said: 'The general presumption is that the Chinese have
differences of opinion within their own camp. Whether they are fundamental
or confined to presentation and tactics we just don't know.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Boeing, the world's largest commercial jet manufacturer, plans to cut its
workforce over the next two years by 28,000, or 20 per cent, because of the
worldwide slump in the airline industry, Patrick Harverson reports from New
York.
Although Boeing originally unveiled plans for major job cuts last month when
it announced a significant reduction in aircraft production, the scale of
the lay-offs was larger than expected. Boeing said this year about 15,000
jobs will be shed in its home state of Washington, 6,000 will go from its
operations in Wichita, Kansas, and another 2,000 or more will be cut from
various sites across the US. Some 5,000 or more jobs will be axed in 1994.
Boeing will employ about 115,000 people when the lay-off programme is
complete.

A GRAND JURY is investigating Eli Lilly, the drugs company, in relation to
the company's compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory
requirements concerning its manufacturing operations, Alan Friedman reports
from New York.
A spokesman for the Indianapolis-based company said Eli Lilly had been
informed of a US government investigation that is being conducted by a
federal grand jury in Maryland.
The company said it believed the inquiry arose from a 1989 FDA review that
resulted in a voluntary agreement between Lilly and the FDA to strengthen
the company's manufacturing quality systems.
Mr Robert Williams, Lilly's vice-president for corporate quality and
environmental affairs, said in a prepared statement that the company had
complied with the terms of the 1989 agreement and claimed Lilly's
manufacturing quality systems were now 'among the best in the industry'. He
stressed that the government had not questioned the safety or efficacy of
any Lilly product in the marketplace. Lilly's share price declined yesterday
by Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 50 3/8 in the wake of the company's
announcement.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Major ready to accept US Ulster envoy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR will tell President Bill Clinton next week that he is ready to
accept with good grace the despatch by the new US administration of a peace
envoy to Northern Ireland.
The prime minister's decision not to make an issue of President Clinton's
pledge to adopt a higher profile in the affairs of the province follows
assurances from Washington that the role of such a mission would be
'fact-finding'.
Officials on both sides of the Atlantic anticipate that the understanding
between the two leaders will avoid the risk of differences over human rights
in Ulster souring the atmosphere of their first meeting in Washington next
week.
President Clinton's aides have also made it clear in advance of the talks
that he has no intention of challenging Britain's permanent place on the
United Nations Security Council.
The administration has stressed that recent remarks by Mr Warren
Christopher, the US secretary of state, suggesting that the composition of
the security council be brought 'up to date' were wrongly interpreted in
Britain as a challenge to the UK seat.
The two leaders' talks on Wednesday will focus on the broad range of
international issues facing both the US and Europe, with the crisis in the
former Yugoslavia and the stalled Gatt trade talks at the top of the agenda.
But irritation among Conservative MPs at the new administration's interest
in the position of the Roman Catholic minority in Northern Ireland had
threatened to cloud their crucial first meeting.
US diplomats confirmed yesterday that President Clinton intended to explore
with Mr Major 'one or two' specific proposals for despatch of an emissary to
talk to leaders of the political parties in Ulster.
They stressed that President Clinton would not give such an envoy the
'mediation' role which was suggested during his election campaign against
President George Bush.
The emissary's contacts would be confined to the leaders of legitimate
political parties and he or she would not make contact with any illegal
paramilitary groups in the province.
For his part Mr Major is expected to underline his concern that the
Democratic administration should not encourage the enforcement in US states
of the so-called MacBride principles.
These principles encourage companies operating in the province to
discriminate positively in favour of Catholics but the UK government argues
that the measure deters inward investment into Northern Ireland.
George Graham in Washington adds: Reports that Mr Tom Foley, the Speaker of
the House of Representatives, might be named a special envoy to Northern
Ireland were discounted last night by Mr Foley's office.
'It is not realistic,' his office said. 'Frankly, there just isn't time. We
are looking at a big legislative programme and we have to be here.'

Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, leaves the Sphinx and Pyramids
after a sightseeing tour in Egypt yesterday. After meeting Mr Christopher,
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said he had accepted an invitation to meet
President Bill Clinton in Washington in early April, writes Mark Nicholson
in Cairo.
Opening his Middle East tour, Mr Christopher said he and the Egyptian
president had 'agreed to intensify efforts' to persuade all sides to
reconvene peace talks, which have stalled since Israel's deportation of 415
Palestinians.
But Mr Mubarak appeared to deny Palestinian suggestions that Egypt was
championing a new timetable for the return by June of the 396 Palestinian
deportees still stranded in south Lebanon. Israel has said it will take back
101 immediately and the rest in a year - a plan the deportees reject.
Mr Mubarak said Egypt still called for Israel's implementation of United
Nations resolution 799 demanding the immediate return of all the deportees.
'We have no new agenda,' he said. 'We are working to implement this
resolution fully - it will take some time.'
Mr Christopher flew on to Amman for talks with King Hussein, the Jordanian
ruler.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Greenspan upbeat on US economy: The Fed is trying to
'promote sustainable economic expansion'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US economy is likely to grow by at least 3 per cent and possibly 4 per
cent this year, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, indicated
yesterday in his semi-annual monetary report to Congress.
In a generally upbeat assessment, he also predicted a further decline in
consumer price inflation, perhaps to only 2.5 per cent compared with 3.1 per
cent last year.
The projections for growth and inflation were both noticeably more
optimistic than in the Fed's last statement to Congress in July. Mr
Greenspan announced a reduction in the Fed's target range for M2, a broad
measure of the money supply, to growth of 2.0-6.0 per cent, against 2.5-6.5
per cent last year. However, he said the reduction reflected changes in the
relationship between money and growth, not an attempt to tighten monetary
policy.
The Fed was 'endeavouring to conduct monetary policy in a way that promotes
sustainable economic expansion.'
In a hearing before the Senate banking committee, Democratic members of
Congress pressed Mr Greenspan to support President Bill Clinton's economic
plan if necessary by easing monetary policy to offset any negative impact on
growth from measures to reduce the budget deficit.
Mr Greenspan signalled strong support for Mr Clinton's plan but said the Fed
could not specify in advance how it would respond to fiscal measures. The
course of interest rates would depend on a host of forces affecting the
economy in coming years.
'Going forward the strategy of monetary policy will be to provide sufficient
liquidity to support the economic expansion while containing inflationary
pressures. The existing slack implies that the economy can grow more rapidly
than potential GDP for a time, permitting further reductions in the
unemployment rate even while inflation is contained.'
Democratic senators criticised Mr Greenspan for failing to achieve monetary
targets in the past. In the year to the fourth quarter of 1992, M2 grew only
1.9 per cent, below the lower limit of the Fed's target.
Mr Greenspan's response was to express profound scepticism about the
reliability of monetary targets as a guide for policy. The monetary
aggregates 'do not appear to be giving reliable indications of economic
developments and price pressures,' he said, noting that the sluggish growth
of M2 had proved consistent with much faster growth of nominal incomes than
had been normal in the past. The most important reason was that savers had
shifted funds out of assets included in M2 in search of higher returns, for
example in bond and stock mutual funds.
Mr Greenspan signalled that the economic outlook had improved noticeably in
the past six months. While uncertainties remained, the economy appeared to
have entered the year with 'noticeable momentum to spending. In addition
inventories are at relatively low levels, and factory orders have been
rising. Consumer confidence has recovered, and spending on consumer durables
and homes appears to be moving at a brisker pace. Recent surveys suggest an
appreciable increase in business investment this year.'
The Fed's 'central tendency' projection is for growth this year of 3.0-3.25
per cent, 0.5 percentage points faster than expected last July. The likely
range for inflation has been lowered by 0.5 percentage points to 2.5-2.75.
Mr Greenspan warned that the near-term outlook was 'uncertain'. A continuing
worry concerned access to credit. 'While banking institutions have become
much more healthy and are well-positioned to meet an increase in loan
demand, very few signals of any easing of terms or standards on business
loans have been apparent to date. '
'But I believe that in many respects the inevitable painful adjustments have
laid the foundation for better performance of our economy over the longer
term. Financial positions have been strengthened; inflation is low and
should remain subdued; labour productivity is increasing; resources are
being shifted from national defence to investment and consumption.'
Mr Greenspan reiterated his view that reductions in long-term interest rates
could potentially provide a significant spur to growth and that progress
would depend on success in cutting the structural budget deficit. However,
in comments on the Clinton plan, he warned Congress against relying too
heavily on tax increases. With many programmes growing faster than the tax
base, stabilising the deficit as a percentage of GDP, not to mention a
reduction, would require 'ever increasing tax rates.' There was thus no
alternative but to 'control future spending impulses.'
He said there was no danger that deficit reduction could be overdone and
create an unhealthy degree of 'fiscal drag.' In the current political
environment excessive cuts in the deficit was 'nothing I would lose sleep
over.'

It was dismissed, however, by Mr John Hewson, leader of the conservative

The accord is intended to speed up the decentralisation of Australia's wage

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PHILIPPINES yesterday concluded negotiations with the International
Monetary Fund without reaching agreement on a successor programme to the one
that is due to end next month.
An IMF team has expressed doubts over growth targets in the government's new
plan which had been presented to the fund for financial support.
It had proposed a three-year, programme designed to push the economy toward
double-digit growth rates by the middle of the 1990s. The IMF's extended
fund facility would be tapped for the programme's financing.
The IMF over the past decade has extended credit support for a series of
18-month programmes for the Philippines. The tight conditions that
accompanied them have been criticised for having constricted growth
opportunities for the economy.
Under the proposed medium-term programme, the Philippines is targeting an
overall growth of 4.5 per cent this year, rising to about 10 per cent
towards the end of the present government in 1998. The IMF team that is due
to end its Manila visit today sought a lower growth target of 3 per cent at
the most.
The talks, according to the two panels, will be reopened in April. However,
the IMF, according to officials close to the negotiations, may not be
inclined to resume the talks unless the Philippines government is able to
secure congressional approval of new tax measures as a precondition.
Also, the IMF wants final implementation of power rates increases that were
announced last year by the government, but ordered temporarily frozen by the
Supreme Court after oppositors filed a legal suit was filed against them.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MULTI-PARTY talks on a new South African constitution will resume early next
month, the first such meeting since talks broke down last May over the issue
of multi-racial power-sharing.
Two crucial meetings which took place this week - bilateral talks between
the government and the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party, and a meeting of
the national executive of the African National Congress - cleared the way
for the resumption of multi-party talks. The three parties, and others from
across the political spectrum, plan to meet on March 5 and 6 to plan the
resumption of full democracy talks.
Negotiators from the government and Inkatha, who ended a three-day meeting
yesterday in Natal, said they had made progress on constitutional issues.
However, the gap between Inkatha and the ANC - bitter rivals in Natal -
remains huge over such issues as devolution of power to regional governments
and whether the new constitution should be written by an appointed or
elected body.
The government and the ANC have already reached outline agreement on many
issues, including a plan to rule together in coalition until the end of the
century, and they have made clear they will proceed without Inkatha if it
resists their proposals.
Yesterday the ANC launched its campaign for the first multi-racial
elections, expected sometime next year, calling on international delegates
to a 'solidarity conference' near Soweto to contribute funds to the
campaign.
ANC officials said they would be discussing their sanctions policy at the
conference, and would announce a major shift in policy tomorrow. South
African police said they were investigating a complaint that former
president PW Botha had assaulted his gardener.
Gardener Jan Louw accused Mr Botha and his bodyguard of hitting him earlier
this month during an argument over whether he had been drinking on duty.

The dollar reached Y119.25 in October when the yen surged amid the
speculative turmoil in European currency markets.
The yen has strengthened throughout the week, apparently on rumours that a
meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers later this
month might attempt to engineer an appreciation of the yen to choke off the
rise in Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the US.
The dollar has also weakened in Tokyo on worries that President Bill
Clinton's economic programme, which involves increased taxes and cuts in
federal spending, might undermine the US recovery.
However, the surge in the yen is also likely to be due to companies
repatriating funds from abroad to improve their finances before books close
on March 31. Most Japanese companies are facing their third year of
declining profits.
Mr Mamoru Ozaki, the finance ministry's vice minister and most powerful
bureaucrat, said there was no need for policy changes to address the
strengthening of the yen.
The Japanese government would be happy for the yen to appreciate gradually,
in part because this might help to correct the trade surplus. However senior
officials at both the finance ministry and the Bank of Japan rule out any
concerted effort by the G7 to manipulate exchange rates to reduce the
surplus.

<TEXT>
NIGERIAN President Ibrahim Babangida yesterday asked the country's private
sector leaders to help the government improve the climate for investment and
economic growth before the handover to elected civilian rule, scheduled for
August.
The appeal comes as rising wage demands in the public sector threaten the
government's 1993 targets for spending, further fuelling inflation and money
supply growth which are already running at more than 50 per cent annually.
Addressing a two-day economic summit in the federal capital, Abuja, Gen
Babangida said: 'It would be a rare feat to make a successful transition of
democracy with a declining economy.'
The summit is seen as a chance to breathe new life into a structural
adjustment programme begun in 1986.
Gen Babangida has called on Chief Ernest Shonekan, formerly head of
Nigeria's largest trading company UAC, to define a mid-term strategy for the
economy to open the way to an Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility from
the IMF and for rescheduling of Nigeria's large external debts.
Chief Shonekan invited business executives to advise the government on the
reforms, incentives and policies necessary to attract private sector
investment which he said was needed to fund economic growth in real terms of
over 5 per cent a year.
He said the summit should address ways of improving competition - domestic
savings levels, training and technology, a strong financial system, and an
adaptable bureaucracy for responsible citizens under the rule of law.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE long slowdown in Japanese money supply growth may be reaching its end,
according to Bank of Japan figures, published yesterday, which indicate the
rate of contraction is slowing.
The broadly defined money supply fell by 0.3 per cent in January from a year
earlier, the fifth consecutive month of contraction. However, the rate of
contraction has eased considerably in the past few months from a 0.6 per
cent fall in October and November and 0.4 per cent in December.
At the same time, the bank's measure of broad liquidity grew by 2.5 per cent
from a year before, an unchanged rate from December. Broad liquidity growth
has been reasonably stable at between 2.4 and 2.7 per cent a month for the
past five months.
The trend in M2, meanwhile, has gradually shifted from a 5.7 per cent
month-on-month contraction last September to 1.5 per cent growth in January
compared with the previous month. It is not clear what is causing the slight
improvement in the money supply growth rate.
It may reflect increased lending by commercial banks, which may gather pace
in the wake of the recent cut in the official discount rate to an historic
low of 2.5 per cent.
Much of the growth in lending is coming from public sector financial
institutions which provide loans and finance for small businesses.
These agencies have had recent sharp increases in their budgets which are
just showing through in higher lending.

FT  20 FEB 93 / UN chief orders resumption of aid to Bosnia: Speculation
mounts that High Commissioner for Refugees is considering her resignation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary-general, said
yesterday he had written to Mrs Sadako Ogata, the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees, asking her to ensure that humanitarian relief deliveries in
Bosnia-Hercegovina are immediately resumed.
In reply to a question on whether Mrs Ogata agreed with such a decision, Mr
Boutros Ghali said: 'I am supposed to direct this operation.'
The UN secretary-general's instructions to Mrs Ogata to reverse her decision
to suspend relief supplies to many parts of Bosnia, which came only 48 hours
after the original decision was made, is a clear indication that there has
been a serious communications breakdown among senior UN officials.
Diplomats representing members of the Security Council have been expressing
surprise and consternation that Mrs Ogata acted without prior consultation
with the Council and the secretary-general. Although she is reported to have
given advance notice of her decision to Mr Cyrus Vance, one of the
co-chairmen of the Bosnian peace conference, Mr Vance is understood to have
advised her against taking a decision without consulting Mr Boutros Ghali.
The UN chief was on a visit to Japan.
A UN spokesman said he did not know whether Mrs Ogata intended to visit UN
headquarters in New York in the near future. But there is speculation she
might be considering resigning, in spite of the high regard in which she is
held by member governments.
UNHCR operations have been crippled by the refusal of local Bosnian Serb
commanders to allow relief supplies into Moslem-held towns in eastern
Bosnia. This prompted last week a Bosnian govern-ment boycott of deliveries
to Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital.
General Philippe Morillon, head of the UN Protection Force (Unprofor) in
Bosnia, said on Thursday that he thought he had won pledges from Bosnian
Serb leaders to allow a delayed UN aid convoy escorted by his troops to
travel to the Moslem strongholds of Gorazde and Zepa.
But hopes that this could prove a signal for resumed UNHCR operations were
dashed yesterday when a reconnaissance mission to Zepa was turned back by
Bosnian Serb forces.
The main convoy will try to reach Gorazde again today, after emergency
repairs to a hole in the road.
Ms Sylvana Foa, a UNHCR spokeswoman, yesterday defended Mrs Ogata from
accusations that the decision to suspend aid was taken without proper
consultation. She said Mrs Ogata had spoken the previous day to Mr Vance and
had recently warned Mr Boutros Ghali that suspension might be necessary.
The decision had aroused intense controversy. A private meeting on Thursday
of about 20 countries involved in the aid effort in the former Yugoslavia
had backed Mrs Ogata's stand, Ms Foa said.
Meanwhile, the Security Council yesterday decided to renew the mandate for
23,000 UN peacekeeping troops in the former Yugoslavia for an interim period
of six weeks, to give international mediators extra time to broker peace
agreements in Croatia and Bosnia.
The decision, which covers the period from February 21 to March 31, is
intended to strengthen Unprofor in the Krajina region of Croatia, where it
has been unable to ensure the full implementation of a peace plan concluded
in January 1992.
The resolution, drafted by France, which has seen 12 of its peacekeeping
troops killed in conflict so far, invites Mr Boutros Ghali to take
'appropriate measures' to strengthen the security of Unprofor.
The resolution specifically mentions for the first time that Unprofor will
be acting under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter. This chapter governed allied
operations in the Gulf war and allowed member states to use military means
to ensure the implementation of Security Council resolutions.
Although the resolution was adopted unanimously, China expressed
reservations about putting Unprofor's operations in the framework of Chapter
7.
The Chinese representative said the implementation of Chapter 7 should be
considered an exceptional case and should not constitute a precedent for
future peacekeeping operations.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Rocard steps over the Socialist debris to eye presidential
prize
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michel Rocard, the former French prime minister, showed a keen eye for
history when he chose Tours, the city where the original French Socialist
party was dissolved in 1920, as the scene of his assault on the party of
today.
His appeal on Wednesday night for a 'political big bang' amounted to a
'funeral oration' for the party, according to Liberation, bible of the
French left. In his new universe, the left would jettison old-style
socialism and join forces with ecologists, human rights activists and other
kindred spirits in an 'open movement' to lead France into the next century.
Such a call could not have come at a worse time for the socialists. Battered
by scandal and gloomy economic news, they are braced for a bruising defeat
in next month's parliamentary elections. But for Mr Rocard the timing could
not have been better.
He is concerned not with the present election campaign - he is struggling
even to save his own seat - but with his prospects in the 1995 presidential
election. His speech was partly to breathe new life into the floundering
left, but partly to distance himself, and his presidential aspirations, from
the socialists' problems.
The socialists have been struggling ever since Mr Rocard was replaced as
prime minister by Mrs Edith Cresson in 1991.
Regional elections last spring, when the party was hammered by ecologists
and the National Front, showed the electorate's disaffection with the
political establishment. The left should also have been warned by the
election defeats of the British Labour party and the Italian socialists.
Despite these danger signs the socialists have entered the present campaign
with the same tired policies.
One explanation is the crisis of confidence in the party, which is weary
after a decade of government and a stream of scandals. Not least of these is
the Aids blood trial which has haunted Mr Laurent Fabius, appointed first
secretary last year with a mandate to modernise French socialism.
Another factor is Mr Fabius' political mentor, President Francois
Mitterrand. He resurrected the Socialist party in 1971 and told its
adherents on TV last week to strengthen the party rather than abandon it for
a Rocard-type new alliance.
The idea of a new alliance has been circulating in the left for some time.
Mr Rocard is an astute politician who took care to warn his peers before
dropping his Tours bombshell. So far most senior socialists have responded
positively, as has Mr Brice Lalonde, former socialist environment minister
and founder of the Generation Ecologie movement.
The Tours speech was only the beginning. It will take more than such a
'funeral oration' to bury a complex institution like the French Socialist
party. But Mr Rocard has the advantage of representing, to ambitious French
politicians, the future, whereas the septuagenarian President Mitterrand is
fading into the past.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Paris gives fresh veto warning on oilseeds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday warned the European Community that it would veto the draft
US-EC accord on oilseeds if the deal was put to a vote at next month's farm
ministers' council.
The warning followed a European Commission proposal to put the oilseeds deal
 -an integral part of the US-EC farm accord in the Gatt trade talks - on the
agenda of the foreign affairs ministers' meeting in Brussels on March 8.
Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, French farm minister, said he had authorisation from
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, to veto the deal if it were
put to the vote.
The draft accord is also expected to be on the agenda of the EC farm
ministers' council on March 16-17. Mr Soisson is to attend the meeting,
where there is greater sympathy for France's position than among foreign
affairs ministers.
A spokesman for the Danish presidency of the EC said in Brussels yesterday
that a vote could technically take place; but he echoed the view of other EC
officials involved in the Gatt talks that ministers were unlikely to force
the oilseeds issue two weeks before French parliamentary elections.
The one notable exception is Mr Rene Steichen, the new EC farm commissioner
from Luxembourg, who said he would like the oilseeds deal put to a Council
of Ministers vote to show the US that the EC could 'stick to an agreement'.
Mr Steichen added it was possible the US might start back-tracking on the
farm export subsidies deal agreed in Washington last November if there was
continuing uncertainty. 'It is a good issue for the EC to have calm on farm
exports and oilseeds.'
The European Commission yesterday launched a vigorous defence of its new
banana import regime in response to criticism from Latin American producers
and Germany, the EC's largest banana consumer.
Mr Rene Steichen, EC farm commissioner, said the agreement would generally
mean lower or stable prices in the EC and guaranteed protection for
Community banana growers and generous support for the traditional African,
Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) producers.
Germany and the Benelux countries opposed last week's deal which set an EC
quota for Latin and Central American (dollar-zone) banana-producing
countries of 2m tonnes, effective from July 1, at a duty of Ecu100 (Pounds
82.60) per tonne. Bananas above the 2m quota face a duty of Ecu850 per
tonne.
Germany plans to lodge a formal complaint at the EC Court of Justice in
Luxembourg, claiming the deal approved by qualified majority infringes its
banana protocol under the 1957 Treaty of Rome.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Fillip for German rate cut hopes
</HEADLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES for further, sustained cuts in German interest rates were given a
fillip yesterday after the Bundesbank released figures showing that broad
money supply - traditionally the German central bank's key indicator in the
battle against inflation - fell in January on an annualised basis.
Economists had expected the rate of growth in M3 to fall significantly from
December. But the annualised, seasonally adjusted 2.3 per cent drop in M3 -
following an 8.7 per cent rise in December - took observers by surprise when
it was announced yesterday, prompting an increase in German bond prices in
expectation of further interest rate cuts.
The Bundesbank said the figure was distorted, taking care to emphasise that
the drop reflected a number of special factors, chiefly the reversal of the
currency flows which had bloated M3 growth in the autumn of last year. The
Bundesbank's currency market interventions helped send annualised M3 growth
to a record 10.3 per cent last October.
Another reason was purely statistical - the Bundesbank calculates the growth
with reference to the previous three month's figures. As these were
exceptionally high, it was inevitable that the January annualised figure
would be vastly improved on the December M3 number. Economists were,
however, expecting growth of around 4 per cent, not a fall.
Despite the Bundesbank's attempts to play down the significance of the
number, economists were encouraged, predicting that the Bundesbank would be
able to meet its growth target for M3 this year. Last year M3 grew at 9.4
per cent compared to a target range of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent, the worst
performance since targeting was introduced 18 years before. The target was
subsequently raised to 4.5 to 6.5 per cent for 1993.
The Bundesbank said that on a straightforward year-on-year basis, M3 - which
includes cash, current accounts and short-term deposits - grew by 7.5 per
cent. Measured against the previous six months, it grew by 6.5 per cent.
Norway and Ireland both cut short-term interest rates yesterday, Our Foreign
Staff adds.
Norway's central bank cut the key overnight lending rate to its lowest level
since the rate was introduced in 1986. The cut in the benchmark rate, the
third this month, was to 9.25 per cent from 9.50 per cent, from Monday.
The move followed a period of strength in the krone and low money market
rates. Norway uncoupled the krone from the European currency unit on
December 10, and the currency has since fallen.
The central bank also lowered the rate for overnight deposits, the credit
rate, to 8.25 per cent from 8.50 per cent. The key rate reached 25 per cent
last November during turbulence in the Scandinavian currency markets.
Meanwhile, in Ireland the central bank cut its short-term lending facility
(STF) by three quarters of a point to 13 per cent, its first reduction since
it was raised by 3 points last September at the beginning of the ERM crisis.
The STF was restored only two weeks ago at its suspension level of 13.75 per
cent, having been withdrawn in November as the currency crisis deepened. It
was temporarily replaced by an overnight lending facility which at times
soared as high as 100 per cent, as the bank sought to ward off speculation
on the punt.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Job losses to mount in French industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JOB losses will mount across France in the first half of this year as
industry continues to cut costs and prune investment, according to the
latest business survey by Insee, the state statistics institute.
The rise in unemployment, after last year's 5 per cent increase to 2.98m
people, will keep consumer confidence and spending depressed, the survey
says. There is also little hope of a recovery in industrial expenditure.
The 2,000 companies questioned by Insee expected an overall cut of 4 per
cent in industrial investment this year after last year's 6 per cent
reduction.
French industry has just emerged from a bruising 1992, when companies
struggled against a combination of sluggish consumer spending, high interest
rates and a strong currency. Yesterday's announcement confirms the gloomy
tone of the Bank of France's business survey published on Monday and follows
Thursday's news that the Insee industrial production index fell in December
to its lowest level for four years.
The threat of further industrial cuts comes at a sensitive time. France's
socialist government, which faces defeat by a conservative coalition in next
month's elections, is anxious to paint a positive picture of the economy to
avert further attacks on the franc.
However, the Insee survey points to another difficult year for French
companies. Most respondents expect the overall level of activity in the
first half of 1993 to match the corresponding period last year.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Brussels fends off criticism of banana import regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday launched a vigorous defence of its new
banana import regime in response to a wave of criticism from Latin American
producers and Germany, the EC's largest banana consumer.
Mr Rene Steichen, EC farm commissioner, said the agreement would generally
mean lower or stable prices in the EC and guaranteed protection for
Community banana growers and generous support for the traditional African,
Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) producers.
Germany and the Benelux countries opposed last week's deal which set an EC
quota for Latin and Central American (dollar-zone) banana-producing
countries of 2m tonnes, effective from July 1, at a duty of Ecu100 (Pounds
82.60) per tonne. Bananas above the 2m quota face a duty of Ecu850 per
tonne.
Germany plans to lodge a formal complaint at the EC Court of Justice in
Luxembourg, claiming the deal approved by qualified majority infringes its
banana protocol under the 1957 Treaty of Rome.
Mr Steichen said the EC had a 'blatant need' to introduce a Community quota
for dollar-zone bananas now that the single European market was in force.
Otherwise the EC would have to reimpose controls at national borders.
He also dismissed Latin American charges that the agreement amounted to a
cocaine cartel licence as it would encourage banana farmers in Ecuador,
Colombia, Panama and elsewhere to turn to other products for income. The
import restrictions come at a time when many Latin American countries have
made considerable investments to increase banana production.
Mr Steichen stressed the quota could be revised upward to take account of EC
demand, and said it was intolerable for the EC's good faith on this pledge
to be challenged.
He also gave short shrift to arguments that the new quota failed to take
into account the upsurge in demand for bananas, particularly in eastern
Germany.
He added the Commission was examining the close similarity between prices in
quota-free Germany and the Benelux countries, which had a 20 per cent
tariff.
A similar dispute involving Germany has erupted over European Commission
efforts to impose a Community quota on cheap imports of items such as toys
and textiles from China, North Korea and Vietnam.

Commercial lending rates are pegged to the STF. However, financial
institutions have been warning that unless interbank money rates fall, they
may be obliged to increase their lending rates to businesses and mortgage
holders. Since the punt was devalued last month, interbank money rates have
remained stubbornly high.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Foreign architects look to heavenly image for redesign of
Berlin's Reichstag
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THREE radically different designs
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
all by foreign architects - to convert the war-scarred Reichstag building in
Berlin into the new German parliament were chosen yesterday.
One of Britain's foremost architects, Sir Norman Foster, proposed a 50-metre
high canopy over the building (left). The cloud-like shape of the structure
won the immediate nickname 'Himmel uber Berlin' (Heaven over Berlin), the
title of the Wim Wenders film known in English as 'Wings of Desire'.
Sir Norman said the pavilion created a sense of 'grand arrival' but still
left a social gathering point at the site of momentous developments in
German history. His design reflected 'an image of Germany today. . . We are
not in the 19th century, and German democracy is looked up to now'.
Spaniard Santiago Calatrava proposed a glass dome over the building, while
Dutch architect Pi de Bruijn suggested a more modest design.
The Reichstag, opened in 1894, was burnt out in an arson attack in 1933. In
1991 the Bundestag decided to transfer parliament to Berlin.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Trouble at the Hammer and Sickle engine plant: The problems
of collapsing trade among former Soviet republics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON and CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT UKRAINE'S Hammer and Sickle plant in Kharkov, diesel engines cannot be
sold for lack of one missing component from Russia. Meanwhile in the Russian
city of Rostov, combine-harvesters sit in the Rostselmash plant waiting for
the Ukrainian-made diesel engines.
The mismatch is one of thousands of examples of how trade has sharply
declined among former Soviet republics since they gained independence a year
ago and have tried to switch from central planning to market economics and
separate currencies.
The contraction in trade is one of the main reasons for a fall of more than
20 per cent in Russia's industrial output and exports last year - with
similar results in other republics.
Echoing the complaints of industrialists on either side of the Russian
border, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, says trade must
be revived among former Soviet republics 'because we cannot compete on any
other markets'. At the same time, he and various ministers served notice
that cash-strapped Russia would stop subsidising other republics with cheap
energy and raw materials.
The problem of inter-republican trade now tops the agenda of many
politicians in other republics too. Lithuania's new president, Mr Algirdas
Brazauskas, the former communist leader, owes part of his victory this week
to promises of improved trading ties with other republics and cheaper energy
supplies from Russia.
Ultimately, the republics expect to move to a system of dealing enterprise
to enterprise through a normal banking system. But such an option will take
time while other republics are weaned off traditional dependence on cheap
energy, and fully switch to their own currencies.
The day before Mr Brazauskas was elected, the country's finance minister
said Russia had agreed to take roubles to pay a backlog of energy debts, but
that the two sides had agreed to use hard currency settlements from March 1.
It is unlikely in the meantime that Mr Brazauskas will be able to restore
hot water to Lithuanian homes.
A more immediate solution - which is making little progress - is an
inter-state bank which commonwealth states agreed to establish at their
summit in Minsk last month. This would have acted as clearing system for
other republics to continue trading freely in roubles, but would have
required Russia to subsidise the trade deficits of other republics, and it
would only have covered deliveries under inter-state agreements.
But Mr Vladimir Mashits, chairman of Russia's committee for relations with
other republics, confirming suspicions that Russia would drag out the issue,
has said it was not even being discussed because most republics, apart from
Belarus, were refusing to co-ordinate financial policies with Russia for the
privilege of continuing to use the rouble.
While private entrepreneurs have found numerous ways of paying each other
and getting around various rules to limit flows of currency and goods
between borders, many of the enterprises are still closely connected to the
state and indirectly depend on some form of state subsidy. Meanwhile the
banking system - already very inefficient within Russia - has made virtually
no progress in establishing efficient settlements among republics.
Russia took the first step in cutting off a life-support system of cheap
energy to other republics this summer by preventing them from issuing rouble
credits to cover trade. Now Mr Mashits says that Russia will insist that
they reimburse Rbs1,000bn 'technical credits' advanced to them by the
Russian central bank for energy imports. He said also the central bank
should start quoting exchange rates for the other currencies issued by
republics.
Russia is clearly trying to force other republics to drop the rouble or
co-ordinate financial policy with Russia's. .But once that is decided it
will have to weigh the benefits of subsidising trade against the
disadvantages of breaking it off.

FT  20 FEB 93 / 'Wise men' warn against tax rises: Treasury team says
outlook remains uncertain - Survey finds sharp fall in confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government's new team of private-sector economic advisers warned
yesterday that economic recovery is far from assured and could be
jeopardised by any tax increases in next month's Budget.
It also warns that Britain's potential to produce goods and services during
the rest of the 1990s may have been damaged by increased long-term
unemployment and the premature scrapping of capital equipment.
The generally gloomy report from the advisers coincided with news that
consumer confidence has fallen sharply in recent weeks, a reminder that lack
of strong indications about an upturn in the economy may continue to hold
back spending.
According to a monthly survey by Gallup, a market research group, confidence
has dropped partly in response to worries about inflation and unemployment.
The survey, based on interviews with more than 2,000 people at the start of
February, says 60 per cent of UK citizens are either just making ends meet
or drawing on their savings.
The report by the Treasury's seven-strong advisory panel was published at
the end of a mixed week of economic data which saw the headline jobless
total climb above 3m for the first time in six years.
Although the panel believes economic prospects have been helped by lower
interest rates and sterling's devaluation, it says there is 'considerable
uncertainty' about the strength of any rebound from the recession.
The panel sees more scope for further cuts in bank base rates from 6 per
cent, should economic activity weaken in the next few months. It says high
debts 'may be a greater brake on consumer spending than we have allowed
for'.
Of the seven economists only Professor Tim Congdon, managing director of
Lombard Street Research, wants to see Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
increase taxes in the March 16 Budget. The others say such a move could hold
back a recovery but are keen to see the Treasury 'set out a clear strategy'
to reduce the rising deficit by tax increases from 1994-95 or cuts in public
spending.
The part-time advisers - recruited by Mr Lamont at the end of last year as
part of a move to greater openness in economic policymaking - think that
underlying inflation will fail by a small amount to breach the Treasury's 4
per cent target this year and next. However, the target is likely to be
exceeded in 1995 and 1996 as extra economic activity prompts rising cost
pressures.
All the advisers think unemployment will rise further to between 3.1m and
3.4m by the end of the year.
The average forecast of the advisers is for the UK economy to expand 1.1 per
cent this year, with growth picking up to 2.7 per cent in 1994. The advisers
warn that another year of flat or declining output, after economic
contraction last year and 1991, would be 'extremely damaging'.
The group is concerned about the large current account deficit. It reckons
the gap between imports and exports will rise from Pounds 12bn last year to
Pounds 15.5bn this year.

FT  20 FEB 93 / ICI board poised to press ahead with demerger of group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK's largest manufacturer, is
believed to be almost certain to vote on Wednesday to split the company into
two separately-quoted groups.
However, a debate is raging within ICI and SG Warburg, its adviser, about
how to structure the expected Pounds 1bn fund-raising necessary to carry out
the demerger.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, and Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief operating
officer, are determined to complete the move in spite of poor trading
conditions, according to non-executive directors.
At least one board member has expressed doubts about whether the new ICI
will be able stand on its own during the recession without the cash-flow
generated by the pharmaceuticals division.
One option for financing the move is an immediate rights issue by the
pre-demerged ICI. The structure of such a deal would probably be
complicated.
Another possibility involves an international issue at a later date by
Zeneca, ICI's newly created pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and specialty
chemicals group. 'It all comes down to John Mayo and what he can persuade
the board to do,' said one investment banker. Mr Mayo, Zeneca's finance
director and a former Warburg corporate financier, is thought to favour the
second solution.
However, others feel that the ICI rights issue is preferable, given the
stock market's current receptiveness to issues, and with ICI craving
certainty in the financing. An issue of this size could only be underwritten
in the London market.
The rights issue is required to clear some of ICI's debt, estimated by
broker BZW at between Pounds 1.7bn and Pounds 2bn. Without the issue, the
new ICI, whose cash-flow has suffered from the recession, would find it hard
to pay its dividend.
Since the demerger was announced in July, trading conditions for ICI's
chemicals business have deteriorated. Earlier this week, Rhone-Poulenc,
France's largest chemical group, said the European chemicals industry was in
a worse state than during the 1973 oil shock. ICI's industrial chemicals
business is expected only to have only broken even last year on turnover of
about Pounds 1.4bn.
Zeneca might have some difficulty completing a rights issue given the poor
recent stock market performance of drugs stocks.
In addition, when ICI reveals its full-year results on Thursday, the group
is expected to show that Zeneca's performance has deteriorated since 1991.
Hoare Govett, the UK broker, estimates that Zeneca's operating profits fell
from Pounds 917m in 1991 to Pounds 765m last year. Its pharmaceuticals
operations are expected to post static results, while those of its
agrochemicals business will decline.
The speciality chemicals division, which was designed to provide
counter-cyclical earnings, is forecast to make operating profits of only
about Pounds 26m on turnover of more than Pounds 1bn.
On Wednesday, ICI's board, comprising eight executive directors and six
non-executive directors, will decide on a straight show of hands whether to
split the company.
The decision will be revealed the following day after the 1992 full-year
results are announced.

FT  20 FEB 93 / Italy shaken by further cabinet resignations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of Italy's shaky seven-month-old government was plunged into
doubt yesterday after the resignation of the finance minister, Mr Giovanni
Goria, and the health minister, Mr Francesco De Lorenzo.
Opposition politicians called for the immediate resignation of Mr Giuliano
Amato as prime minister and his replacement by an apolitical figure to lead
an administration until new elections based on a reformed voting system.
Yesterday's resignations follow the decision earlier this month by Mr
Claudio Martelli, the former justice minister, to step down. Mr Martelli has
been advised by Milan magistrates that he is under investigation in
connection with illegal political funding.
Last night, Mr Amato was locked in talks with senior representatives of the
political groupings that form his four-party coalition amid considerable
uncertainty whether the government would survive or be allowed to collapse.
Tension mounted throughout the day as magistrates in Milan, Rome, Naples and
Asti ordered a wave of arrests of politicians and businessmen as part of the
crackdown on political corruption. The atmosphere grew increasingly charged
at what should have been a routine address by Mr Amato to the Senate, the
upper house of parliament. The corridors of the parliament building were
already echoing to growing rumours of impending arrests and resignations.
Then first Mr Goria, followed by Mr De Lorenzo, announced their resignation.
Mr De Lorenzo's 89-year-old father was yesterday morning placed under house
arrest in a separate investigation into illegal political kickbacks.
Mr De Lorenzo was told he was under investigation in connection with a
Naples votes-for-jobs scandal. Mr Goria is allegedly involved in unspecified
corruption relating to the construction of a hospital in his constituency.
The tense political climate had an immediate effect on the lira, which fell
to L957 against the D-Mark. The currency, which has been under growing
pressure as political uncertainties mounted this week, has never sunk so
low, apart from a brief spell after last year's decision to leave the
exchange rate mechanism. While Mr De Lorenzo's resignation did not come as a
surprise, that of Mr Goria was less expected. Both moves are linked to the
growing anti-corruption wave sweeping Italy, which has led to numerous
politicians being investigated and hundreds of arrests.
Tension in the government, which is made up of Mr Amato's Socialist party,
the Christian Democrats and the Liberals and Social Democrats, had been
rising this week. This followed growing doubts about the chances of a
successful reshuffle to broaden its base and allow other parties into the
coalition.
The loss of two senior ministers could represent the coup de grace for Mr
Amato. However, some observers believe party leaders may let the government
survive, pending approval of new electoral laws, which could lead to new
elections and a more representative administration.
While Mr Goria, a former prime minister and treasury minister, has not been
under recent judicial investigation, he has been embroiled in a long-running
investigation into a 1976 affair involving the local savings bank in his
Asti constituency. More recently, leading local Christian Democrats have
been investigated by magistrates over allegations of political kickbacks,
allegedly totalling L7.5bn, on the construction of a local hospital.
Yesterday, magistrates made further arrests of politicians in Asti.
In his resignation letter to Mr Amato, Mr Goria said he could 'not tolerate
suffering accusations which were unjust, unfounded and unreasoned, without
the ability to defend himself'.
Mr De Lorenzo's resignation followed Thursday's vote by the parliamentary
committee on immunity to approve a request by Naples magistrates to lift his
immunity as an MP.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Yeltsin steps up battle with Speaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN A dramatic raising of the stakes in his power struggle with parliament,
President Boris Yeltsin has demanded that all state authority be centralised
under the executive branch of the Russian government.
A draft 'agreement between the executive and legislative powers of the
Russian federation', sent yesterday to Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the
parliamentary Speaker, demands that parliament refrain from any actions
which would restrict the government's handling of the economic crisis. It
also calls for the 'subordination' to the government of the central bank,
the Bank of Foreign Economic Affairs and the Foreign Trade Bank, as well as
the Committee of State Property, a parliament-controlled body which oversees
state enterprises, all of which have operated policies independent of and
usually hostile to the government.
The plan, outlined on Wednesday by Mr Sergei Shakhrai, a deputy prime
minister, would effectively neutralise parliament, which has consistently
blocked the government's and the president's reform programmes.
Preliminary reactions from deputies were that it stood no chance of being
approved - a view which signals a deepening of the already bitter and
dangerous struggle between Mr Yeltsin and Mr Khasbulatov.
The draft says the government must immediately bring forward the most urgent
economic measures, and lays down that 'all draft decrees and draft laws
concerning budget expenditures will be subject to the government's
agreement.' Ministers complain that parliament has fuelled inflation by
passing expenditure bills, especially for social benefits.
Under an agreement between Mr Yeltsin and Mr Khasbulatov this week, a joint
presidential-parliamentary commission must find a formula for a division of
powers by the end of the month.
However, the uncompromising tone of Mr Yeltsin's first draft makes the
prospect of any agreement doubtful - while both sides fear the country is
heading towards authoritarian rule.

FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Banks want to maintain Mirror's Labour
stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOUR banks which are majority shareholders in Mirror Group Newspapers
said yesterday that they would be 'very concerned' if the political stance
of the newspaper were altered from its tradition of supporting the Labour
Party.
National Westminster, Midland, Goldman Sachs and Lloyds have indicated that
they would become more actively involved in MGN's affairs if they feared
that the business was becoming unstable as a result of editorial changes.
The banks' comments come against the background of criticism of MGN from the
Labour Party, following the resignation this week of Mr Alastair Campbell,
the Daily Mirror's political editor.
Meanwhile, MGN last night denied that there was a boardroom rift over Mr
Campbell's departure, which has also attracted criticism from Mirror
journalists.
Mr Charles Wilson, MGN's editorial director, said there was no split between
Lord Hollick, the Labour peer, and Mr David Montgomery, brought in last
October to become MGN's chief executive.
Lord Hollick, chairman of the media and finance group MAI and Meridian, the
new television station in the south of England, has rejected recent reports
that he wants control of MGN. He declined to comment yesterday.
Mr Wilson said: 'Lord Hollick is in a difficult position as a member of the
Labour Party and a peer. He's with people at Westminster who are having
their concerns agitated by elements within the Mirror - and I don't mean at
boardroom level.'
He added: 'There is absolutely no indication at all that this paper is
drifting away from the Labour Party. We totally support the Labour Party.'
The future of the the former Maxwell newspaper group lies in the hands of
the four banks, whose 54 per cent stake is held by administrator Mr John
Talbot of Arthur Andersen.
The banks are communicating their views to the MGN board through Mr Talbot.
They received the shares as security for loans. Yesterday the shares closed
2p higher at 109p, valuing the group at Pounds 430m.
The figures compared with a 1991 flotation price of 125p, when the group had
a market capitalisation of Pounds 501m.
MGN's shares resumed trading last July at 53p, but have climbed steadily
since October as investors have been attracted by the cost-savings which Mr
Montgomery pledged to make.
However, analysts said they would be concerned if the new management team's
actions threatened MGN's valuable franchise on the left of the political
spectrum.
More than 150 Labour MPs signed a Commons motion criticising Mr Montgomery's
approach following the resignation of Mr Campbell.
Mirror journalists called for the resignation of Mr Montgomery and blamed
him for the paper's continuing fall in circulation.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Timex sacks and replaces its Dundee workforce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGRY PICKETS were last night besieging the Dundee plant of Timex
Electronics, the US-owned multinational, in protest at the company's
decision to sack all its production workers and replace them with a new
labour force.
This is the largest case of a mass dismissal of workers by a company in
Britain since News International fired its print workers before moving
production facilities to Wapping in east London in January 1986.
Yesterday the first 12 recruits walked into the Dundee plant, which makes
printed circuit boards, through a picket line of former Timex employees.
With more than 10.2 per cent of Dundee's workers jobless, the company has
been inundated with job applications from the unemployed.
'We have had an enormous response to our call for new workers,' said Mr
Peter Hall, the Timex president, last night.
Two senior union officials face jail or fines in the High Court next week
for alleged breach of an injunction to keep pickets down to only six outside
Timex.
Mr Hall said the company had decided to replace its 320-strong manual
workforce after a 20-day dispute over provisions for a series of lay-offs
and two months of negotiation with the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union.
Senior executives flew from Connecticut last week to hammer out a peace plan
with the union. This involved asking the workers to accept a rotation of
lay-offs among the whole workforce for six months with access to independent
arbitration, a pay freeze for 1993, a 10 per cent cut in benefits and
introduction of a profit-sharing scheme.
Mr Hall said the company intended to increase production in the second half
of the year and recruit a further 300 workers.
He said the staff had refused to accept the peace plan at meetings last
Sunday and again on Wednesday.
Mr Gordon Samson, the AEEU's district secretary in Dundee, said staff had
agreed to return to work 'under protest' and the company had fired them.
Mr Hall agreed that 'technically' the union was correct, but he added the
company had no alternative but to dismiss all its production workers
(including 17 who worked through the strike) because they could each
individually, with the union's backing, take Timex to court.
The company could face heavy fines over breach of contract if it changed
pension and other benefit provisions without the agreement of the workforce.
The trouble began when Timex warned the AEEU that the Dundee plant faced
closure, or compulsory redundancies, if the workforce did not accept
lay-offs and a reduction in the value of their present lay-off agreement.
In response the workers said that they would share what work was available
so all of them would have periods in and out of work with the promise from
the company of increased production in the second half of this year and an
expansion in the labour force.

FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Proposed buy-out of Univa meets
opposition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CDollars 41bn (USDollars 32.5bn) Caisse de Depot, the investment arm of
the Quebec public pension plan, disagrees with a CDollars 11 a share buy-out
of Univa, the Quebec-based food distributor, proposed on February 9 by
Blackstone Group, the New York investment bankers.
As the owner of 17.3 per cent, fully-diluted, of Univa, the Caisse says the
Blackstone offer does not recognise Univa's potential for recovery from the
downward cycle in food distribution.
While the Caisse uses the word disagree, it leaves little doubt it will
oppose the potential offer. The Caisse is an independent agency of the
provincial government but usually works with public policy.
The proposal, worth CDollars 1.03bn, was made by Blackstone Capital Partners
and Mr Bertin Nadeau, chairman of Univa and its biggest shareholder with 26
per cent of the equity.
Blackstone offered CDollars 11 a share for all Univa's 94m common shares. As
part of the deal, Mr Nadeau would re-acquire a 20 per cent interest in
Univa.
Univa is Canada's second biggest food distributor and has an affiliate in
California and several non-food subsidiaries. Mr Nadeau's stake is held
through Unigesco, his own heavily-indebted holding company.
The Blackstone proposal is being studied by a committee of Univa's board.
One problem is that the proposal is structured as a leveraged buy-out and
Univa would be saddled with well over CDollars 1bn debt.
The Caisse says the proposal does not assure the integrity of Univa.
