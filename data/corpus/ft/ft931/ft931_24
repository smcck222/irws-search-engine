FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (15): This is the
year for colour systems - Desktop Publishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOMENTUM of desktop publishing (DTP) is being strongly maintained as
prices fall for high-performance personal computers, laser printers and
enhanced page-composition software.
Furthermore, new methods of colour creation for documents of all types are
exciting users right across the DTP spectrum.
As businesses large and small discover the almost endless range applications
for DTP - from brochures, sales catalogues and financial reports to colour
magazines, books and newspapers - there is a rising demand for
better-looking publications.
Countless publications in typewritten form are also becoming candidates for
DTP - 'for business, DTP has meant lower costs, more control and later
deadlines on a wide variety of printed materials,' says Emilia Knight,
Apple's publishing marketing manager.
Worldwide revenues for DTP software tools are likely to reach Dollars 369m
this year, rising by Dollars 100m in 1994 and reaching Dollars 663m by 1996,
according to forecasts by the International Data Corporation.
Much of the thrust of the DTP market has come from the US. Although Apple
Corporation, with its Macintosh computers, along with the Adobe Postscript
page description language, were founder companies of the industry, an
increasing number of other hardware and software companies are developing
their own market strategies for DTP.
Today, there are two main DTP markets. One, at the lower-end - what is
termed the personal or 'office DTP' sector, including in-house publishing to
promote its services or products. Then there is the high-end, professional
DTP market, described by Apple as 'DTP for profit.' This includes graphic
art services, newspaper, book and magazine production.
On the hardware front, the increasing power of PCs and portable computers is
good news for desktop publishers, especially with the move towards colour
systems which demand. At a starting point, the cost of a basic Apple DTP
system is under Pounds 2,500 with, say, an Apple Mac LCII computer, with 14
ins. colour monitor, (Pounds 1,099); Aldus Pagemaker software (Pounds 500);
and a personal LaserWriter for around Pounds 775. Five years ago, the cost
of a basic system might have been nearer Pounds 8,000.
Apple's new mid-range Mac II and Centris computers (prices range from Pounds
1,675 to Pounds 2,595) have systems built-in to support up to 256 colours in
the new 14 ins colour display - and can be easily upgraded to deliver 32,000
colours. Last month, Apple introduced its Colour Printer (Pounds 1,995) for
Mac-users wanting to use colour in everyday documents. It takes advantage of
ColorSync software's colour matching capabilities, ensuring that DTP users
achieve colour output that closely matches colours created on the computer's
display.
DTP technology has brought creators (writers, designers, editors,
illustrators and photographers) much closer to the production process, and
in many cases eliminated the need for a separate production step altogether,
says Jonathan Seybold, the DTP industry's guru.
The collision, eight years ago, between the computing and publishing began a
'revolution that turned the publishing industry upside down ..and spawned
desktop publishing,' according to Jonathon Seybold. The publishing
revolution is far from over, which means that training for new DTP entrants
continues to be an important issue, especially with the need for skills to
operate for colour images systems and other of new technologies.
While today's software with colourful icons and graphical user interfaces
(GUIs) help to reduce the DTP learning curve, training and consultancy
services are in demand from business users. Rank Xerox, with its philosophy
of 'total quality document,' offers a range of workshops for programs such
as PageMaker, Ventura and CorelDraw.
The reason that colour is the hot topic of the DTP world is that, until now,
the missing ingredient has been colour management systems.
While different devices, such as scanners, monitors and printers deliver
colour variations, software products - such as ColorSync from Apple - now
provide excellent matching facilities.
In the colour management arena, companies such as Kodak, Agfa, EFI
(Electronics For Imaging), Quark, Apple, Microsoft, Adobe and other
suppliers are planning strategies to make colour management the norm. There
is also wide interest in Kodak's new Photo CD system - a quick and
economical way to bring colour images to the desktop for business and
commercial imaging applications.
Photo CD allows DTP users to take 35mm colour pictures, scan them on to a
disk and retrieve them via a CD-ROM drive. High resolution pictures can then
be easily imported into documents. Linked with Photo CD is Kodak's new
PhotoEdge software which allows images on a PC to be modified in colour,
tone and shape.
Next to colour, the hottest area in computer publishing are the emerging
digital technologies able to deliver documents in a new form. For example,
users may wish to view only selected portions of documents, all stored
electronically.
In the fast-changing DTP world, specialist software, such as PageMaker and
Quark XPress have evolved beyond all recognition. For professional
page-layout systems in the UK, 53 per cent use Quark XPress and 23 per cent
use PageMaker, according to Ashdown, the strategic marketing consultancy.
Aldus has recently announced PageMaker 5.0 for Windows and Macintosh,
offering 100 new features and enhancements for professional DTP users.
In the Windows environment, Microsoft, in particular, is making ease-of-use
a strong feature. It has seen wide success among DTP entrants with the
'Microsoft Publisher' package.
Windows applications overtook sales of DOS applications in the UK in
November for the first time, according to Romtec, which forecasts a 25 per
cent share lead for Windows this year.
As technologies merge, there is growing interest in multimedia - the
computer-based medium which brings together text, high-resolution graphics,
The conversion of traditional media into a common digital format gives
multimedia its wide appeal. Apple, the leading supplier in this field, has
been providing hardware platforms for multimedia since 1985.
Microsoft, the developer of MS/DOS operating system and the Windows 3
graphical environment, has been involved in developing multimedia technology
on PCs since the mid-1980s. The conversion of traditional media into a
common digital format is what gives multimedia its wide appeal.
Meanwhile, interest is also being shown in publishing without paper - such
as electronic delivery, allowing rapid access to visually sophisticated
documents. Adobe's Acrobat software, for example, aims to solve the
transmission of these documents between incompatible computers.

FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Vitro hit by sluggish growth in
Mexico
</HEADLINE>

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VITRO, the large Mexican glass company, yesterday announced net profits of
602m new pesos (Dollars 200m) last year, 11 per cent less in real terms than
in 1991. Sales reached 10.32bn new pesos, a 2.4 per cent increase after
inflation.
The company blamed the fall in profits on the sluggish growth in Mexico and
the US, higher domestic interest rates and real appreciation of the peso.
Nearly half of Vitro's sales were in the US, making it particularly
vulnerable to a strong peso and a weak US economy.
During the year Vitro acquired two local glass companies - Vidriera Oriental
and Alum de Mexico - and bought ACI of the US. Without these acquisitions,
sales last year would have fallen by 3 per cent.
Mr Ernesto Martens, chief executive, said 1992 was 'a complex period due to
macroeconomic conditions', but said he hoped this year his company would
consolidate dynamic growth, reduce the level of indebtedness, and improve
productivity.
Vitro's margins fell particularly sharply in the US, in part due to
operating difficulties with Anchor Glass, its US subsidiary. Exports,
however, reached Dollars 377m, an increase in dollar terms of 7.4 per cent.

Henkel's profits

<TEXT>
HENKEL, the German chemicals, cosmetics and household goods group, recorded
a 10 per cent fall in profits last year, mainly due to the costs of
restructuring and acquisitions.
Pre-tax profits for the year ended December 31, 1992, fell to 'around
DM400m' (Dollars 250m) while total sales rose by 9 per cent to DM14.1bn.
Sales in Germany grew by 5 per cent and sales abroad rose by 16 per cent.
Turnover was boosted by a 53 per cent increase in sales of cosmetics, which
rose from DM1bn to DM1.5bn as a result of the acquisition from Sweden's
Nobel Industrier of Barnangen, the household and personal products company.
Henkel bought Barnangen early last year for DM900m. A company spokesman said
the fall in profits was mainly due to the cost of financing the acquisition
and to the expected bigger marketing costs for Barnangen products. Cosmetics
sales accounted in 1992 for 10.9 per cent of the group's total sales, as
compared with 7.8 per cent the previous year.
The group also suffered an undisclosed fall in the sales of chemicals
products, which had been hard hit by the appreciation of the D-Mark against
the dollar in 1992.

FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Three-fold rise at Dyno despite
'difficult' year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DYNO INDUSTRIER, the diversified Norwegian group, yesterday reported a
three-fold increase in 1992 pre-tax profit to NKr160m (Dollars 23.1m) from
NKr54m a year earlier.
Group sales fell to NKr7.5bn from NKr7.7bn as Dyno experienced a 'difficult
year' in most of its main markets, caused by pressure on prices and the sale
of its construction machinery business.
Group operating profit rose by NKr26m to NKr329m and financial income
improved by NKr55m to NKr212m.
Plastics suffered an operating loss of NKr12m compared with a NKr69m profit
in 1991. The explosives division made progress in the US and Australia but
profits fell in Scandinavia due to low construction activity.
Leif Hoegh, one of Norway's biggest shipowners, yesterday revealed a sharp
fall in 1992 net profit to NKr173m from NKr368m in 1991.
Freight income fell by NKr138m last year to NKr2bn, but operating and
voyage-related expenses were the same as in 1991 at NKr1.5bn.
Leif Hoegh said its 1992 performance wes satisfactory but admitted to
difficult market conditions for combination carriers and container/bulk
vessels. Group operating profit fell by NKr153m to NKr309m in 1992.
The shipowner said that asset value increased last year to NKr2.3bn from
NKr2.2bn.

FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Kleinwort Benson ahead 66% - Advance to
Pounds 46.3m helped by cut in bad debt provisions to Pounds 7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KLEINWORT Benson's pre-tax profits recovered sharply in 1992,mainly because
of a drop in bad debt provisions from Pounds 39m to Pounds 7m.
The merchant banking group also disclosed that Mr David Peake, its chairman,
would retire at the next annual meeting on April 28, to be replaced by Lord
Rockley, currently a vice chairman.
Profits of the merchant banking group increased 66 per cent to Pounds 46.3m.
However, after-tax profits rose by only 10 per cent to Pounds 21.3m because
Kleinwort was forced to take an exceptional tax charge of Pounds 13.6m in
its profit and loss account as an adjustment to the accrued tax losses it
carries in its balance sheet.
Mr Jonathan Agnew, Kleinwort's chief executive, insisted that the
exceptional tax charge was an accounting nicety: 'It has no economic effect
on us.'
The charge relates to financial transactions carried out by Kleinwort in
1988 with the purpose of generating tax losses. It then included these
assets in its balance sheet as an asset.
In preparing the latest accounts, Kleinwort re-examined the transactions and
decided the losses should be removed from the balance sheet.
However, Mr Agnew said that Kleinwort would still be able to benefit from
the losses by reducing the tax it pays in future. The losses were now a
contingent off-balance sheet asset.
The growth in 1992 pre-tax profits was held back by a Pounds 10m charge to
cover the costs of the group's surplus off-ice space in the UK and the US.
The merchant banking and securities division pushed up profits from Pounds
24.7m to Pounds 38m, while the investment management and private banking
division suffered a small drop from Pounds 24.4m to Pounds 22.1m.
Within the merchant banking and securities operations, Kleinwort's Japanese
securities business made a loss and there was also a drop in profits from
the corporate finance department, which is the traditional heart of the
group.
There were sharp profit increases in the treasury operations and the
financing business.
The proposed final dividend is maintained at 10.7p, giving an unchanged
total for the year of 16p.
Earnings per share, excluding the exceptional tax charge, increased from
14.3p to 26.6p.
Mr Peake, 58, said he had been thinking about retiring 'for some months',
but other board members were putting no pressure on him to go.
He preferred to go now, to allow Lord Rockley, who is a few months older
than him, to do the job for a few years.
Lord Rockley is seen by Kleinwort executives as chairman for a transitional
period, while the next generation of senior Kleinwort executives acquire
more experience.
However, some Kleinwort executives said they were slightly surprised that Mr
Peake had not been replaced by Mr Simon Robertson, 51, who was appointed
deputy chairman last year.

FT  19 FEB 93 / RTZ makes Dollars 470m move into US coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, is moving into US coal with a
Dollars 470m (Pounds 331m) agreed offer for Nerco, the floundering natural
resources group 82 per cent owned by PacifiCorp.
Nerco's profitable coal units will be merged with RTZ's US Kennecott copper
and gold mining subsidiary but the Morgan Stanley investment bank will sell
the oil and gas operations.
Nerco's gold and silver mining interests have been up for sale for some
time. RTZ will look closely before deciding whether to go ahead with the
disposal process already in place.
Nerco's net debt at the end of 1992 was Dollars 692m and after the deal
RTZ's gearing will rise to about 60 per cent from 35 per cent. Mr Robert
Wilson, RTZ's chief executive, said: 'We shall move promptly to achieve the
planned asset disposals. Meanwhile, we expect this transaction to enhance
earnings even in 1993.' PacifiCorp has agreed to fund Dollars 225m of the
consideration and will be repaid from certain contract revenues of Nerco.
Through its 49 per cent-owned associate, CRA, RTZ already has coal interests
in Australia and Indonesia. Nerco owns two low-sulphur, open pit, steam coal
mines in the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming and has a 50 per cent
stake in a third. It produced 16.6m tonnes in 1992 and has reserves
totalling 580m tonnes, and more than 60 per cent of production is secured by
long-term contracts. Mr Wilson said demand for low-sulphur coal in the US
was expected to grow by 2 per cent annually and material from Powder River
was probably the lowest-cost in the world: about Dollars 4 a tonne to mine.
RTZ's share price closed 6p down after the news at 646p, possibly because of
market fears of a rights issue.
RTZ is offering Dollars 12 for each Nerco share. At the close in New York
Nerco's shares were up Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 11 1/2 . The US company also
announced a net loss of Dollars 551m on revenues of Dollars 578m after
write-downs totalling Dollars 714m. This left its net assets worth Dollars
247m.
Mr Euan Worthington, head of the mining team at S G Warburg, said: 'It looks
like a very good deal - if you want that sort of deal. But should anyone be
buying coal anywhere in the world, even reasonably high-quality coal?'

RTZ was clearly anxious to get its hands on Nerco's attractive US coal
reserves. The Dollars 1.2bn acquisition also includes a disparate package of
oil, gas and precious metals assets for which a buyer will have to be found.
That leaves a degree of risk. Gearing of around 60 per cent is not
unreasonable at this stage of the cycle, but it would do to make some
in-roads into debt through disposals before making another move.
If that can be achieved, RTZ looks sensible to add coal to its portfolio of
commodities. The low-cost and low-sulphur coal bought yesterday should be
less vulnerable to environmental legislation. With 60 per cent of the output
sold under long-term contracts, there is also some security of earnings.

FT  19 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Kleinwort Benson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 5 per cent rise in Kleinwort Benson's shares yesterday is an obvious
mark of relief at its lower provisions. The rest of the story, though, is
not particularly reassuring, least of all the Pounds 13.6m exceptional prior
year tax charge. Kleinwort rightly asserts that this is a one-off accounting
item. It is simply moving a tax loss off its balance sheet. The credit will
now be carried forward as a contingent asset, making no difference to the
amount of tax it actually pays or to cash flow. But the change in treatment
suggests the credit should never have been on the balance sheet at all,
something that has taken Kleinwort's management years to correct.
Given the bank's strategic problems, one might have hoped for more
precision. Return on capital is not inspiring. Even without the exceptional
tax charge, net return on shareholders' funds is less than 9 per cent.
It is difficult to see where growth will come from, especially since
Kleinwort has been losing market share in mergers and acquisitions.
Kleinwort may be lucky with the markets. It had a good year both in gilts
and treasury business. But growth needs a more secure foundation than
privatising Argentine utilities. Some surplus capital could be put towards
acquiring additional fund management business, though that would mean a
hefty goodwill charge. A better idea might be for Kleinwort to give
shareholders back some money by again buying its shares in the market.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Observer: Muffled move
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision to change chairman by Kleinwort Benson has been so discreet as
to camouflage the boardroom upheaval that has occurred at the old
established merchant bank which has lost its momentum.
David Peake, a member of the family and a banker, is handing over to Lord
Rockley, a few months older and a corporate finance man. Peake, who at 58
has been doing the job for a mere four years, stays on the board.
Considering that it was only last year that another corporate finance man in
the shape of 51-year-old Simon Robertson was promoted to be Peake's deputy,
he would have seemed the natural successor to a casual outsider.
But merchant banks are more collegiate than most outfits, and it seems to
have been felt that an Old Etonian city gent like Lord Rockley, a
vice-chairman, was the best bet to command the trust and confidence of the
troops. But will he take the tough strategic decisions needed to restore
Kleinwort to former glory?
Somehow, one suspects not.

FT  19 FEB 93 / People: Three new directors at Bank of England
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Frances Heaton, the director general of the City of London's Panel on
Takeovers and Mergers, yesterday became the first woman director of the Bank
of England.
Two other non-executive directors were also appointed to the Bank's court:
Sir Jeremy Morse, who retired earlier this month as chairman of Lloyds Bank,
and Sir Chips Keswick, chairman of Hambros Bank.
Bank directors are appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of the Prime
Minister's office. John Major has adopted a policy of appointing women to
senior public posts wherever possible.
Heaton worked at the Treasury between 1970 and 1980, when she joined the
merchant bank, Lazard Brothers. She was seconded to the Takeover Panel last
year. 'The thing I am particularly pleased about in being appointed a
director is that it maintains a continuity between the Bank and the
Treasury,' she said yesterday.
One of the three retiring bank directors is Sir David Walker, the deputy
chairman of Lloyds Bank and a former Treasury official. The others are Sir
Brian Corby, chairman of the Prudential Corporation, and Lord Haslam, former
chairman of British Steel.
The court of the Bank of England usually meets once a month on a Thursday.
The non-executive directors serve as a sounding board for the Governor, but
do not get involved in setting interest rates and monetary policy or in the
minutiae of bank supervision.
Heaton, 48, says that there could be a conflict between her Panel
responsibilities and her new Bank role, if there were a takeover bid for a
bank. In that case, she would concentrate on her role of adjudicating on the
bid and absent herself from any Bank discussions of the takeover attempt.
Sir Jeremy Morse, 64, has had a long association with the Bank of England.
For ten years from 1965 he was an executive director of the Bank, before
joining Lloyds.
Both Sir Jeremy and Sir Chips both began their banking careers at Glyn
Mills, now part of Royal Bank of Scotland.
*****
Ian Rae, a director of COURTAULDS TEXTILES, died on February 17.
*****
Neil Cannetty-Clarke has been appointed finance director at LWT in
succession to Peter McNally who retires next month.
*****
Alan Woods has been appointed operations director of Palmer Environmental

FT  19 FEB 93 / Technology: Moving into deeper waters - Shell's new
production platform is a milestone for the oil industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of nature's less obvious amphibians has this week been inching its way
into the blue waters of the Mediterranean off Taranto on Italy's
south-eastern coast.
At almost 19,000 tonnes, the massive hull for Shell's new Auger production
platform in the Gulf of Mexico represents a milestone for the offshore oil
industry. As reserves in easily exploitable locations are gradually
depleted, oil companies are searching for new sources in more hostile
terrain, whether on land or ever deeper at sea.
The large rectangular structure, built by Italy's Belleli engineering group
at its Taranto yard, comprises four 49m-high, twin-core steel towers, linked
by a thick steel pontoon belt at the bottom and diagonal struts at the top.
Like a giant upturned table, the 109m-long and 88m-wide hull forms the lower
part of the new platform, which will stretch offshore oil production
technology to unprecedented limits.
The completed platform, due to start producing oil early next year, will sit
in 980m of water off the US coast. At that depth, it will beat by almost a
third again the previous record depth for a platform, and could represent
the first step towards a new generation of 'super' oil platforms capable of
operating at depths of up to 1,200m.
Working in such deep waters has obliged engineers to abandon previous
platform technology in favour of new solutions to address the problem of how
to create a structure which will be sufficiently tall, yet rigid enough to
permit oil to be extracted successfully and safely.
The offshore business has until now been dominated by two designs: the
familiar 'jacket' - tapering latticeworks of special steels, akin to a
modern Eiffel Tower, which are floated on barges to the production site and
then carefully tipped over so their feet sink to the sea bed. More recently,
large, heavy concrete platforms have been developed for the North Sea,
particularly by the Norwegians.
Both designs are still perfectly valid for shallow-to-medium-depth
operations, explains Umberto Pellegrini, Belleli's project manager for the
Auger contract. But as oil companies have pushed ever deeper to sea, the two
designs have been showing their limits.
A 900m-tall jacket would be prohibitively expensive owing to the amount of
steel required, he says. At that height, it might also be insufficiently
rigid. As for a concrete platform, its weight would make it wholly
uneconomic, he says. 'Tension leg platforms are the answer to the oil
industry's need to work in ever deeper waters. They combine stability and
size with relatively low weight and therefore lower cost, than conventional
designs,' he adds.
The first TLP was developed about seven years ago for Conoco's Hutton field
in the North Sea. Since then, two more have gone into operation in the Gulf
of Mexico and the North Sea. However, the Auger platform marks the biggest
and most expensive TLP to date. The hull alone cost around L200bn (Pounds
91m), while the deck, being built by McDermott, the big US engineering
group, will cost as much again. On to that must be added the separate
modules covering functions such as production and accommodation.
TLPs comprise a large floating metal hull - the upturned table - on top of
which the deck and modules are mounted. Although seemingly the simplest part
of the structure, the hull is in many ways the key to how a TLP works.
Because it floats, the hull requires no direct support from the seabed,
representing an obvious saving in weight, and therefore cost. But in order
to provide the necessary stability and rigidity, the TLP is attached to the
ocean floor by 12 steel tendons - in reality 12-inch steel tubes bolted
together in 100m-sections - which are put under tension to lock the platform
in place. A pair of anchors, stretching up to 3km from each leg, provides
further stability in the case of severe weather conditions, such as the
hurricanes which can sweep the Gulf of Mexico.
The floating technology is deceptively simple, yet lies at the heart of the
two key processes involved in preparing a TLP for use. Precisely controlled
ballasting and de-ballasting is needed for the first step, due later this
year, when the hull will be 'mated' with the superstructure at sea.
As no floating cranes exist which are powerful enough to lift an object as
heavy as the 20,000 tonnes of completed deck, the process will be carried
out by sinking the hull instead. Once in position, pumps in the four columns
will start bringing in enough sea water to lower the top of the hull to the
water line. In the meantime, barges carrying the superstructure will move
precisely into position over the submerged structure. By pumping out the
water, the hull and superstructure will gradually rise, eventually reaching
their desired operating height. Once there, the superstructure will be
welded to the hull at five special anchor points topping the four columns.
'It seems very simple, but it's actually very difficult, especially to avoid
bumping,' says Pellegrini.
Sophisticated ballasting techniques will also take centre stage when it
comes to tensioning the cables linking the platform to the sea bed. The
cables are put under tension by shedding ballast in the hull. Only once the
platform is fully stable can oil start flowing through the 24 pipes, known
as 'risers', which link it with the wells on the ocean floor.
Although the Auger platform uses technology which has already been tested
before, the depth at which it will operate means it represents a new
challenge compared with its predecessors. Moreover, it is the first TLP to
have its hull wholly assembled on land before being towed out to sea in one
piece.
Belleli made three of the four giant legs on the previous TLP, built for the
Snorre field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. But once fabricated,
they were shipped to the main contractor, where they were then joined to the
rest of the hull offshore.
Onshore fabrication will set the pace for the even bigger TLPs of the
future, the company thinks. Among projects believed to be under preliminary
consideration are new platforms for Shell in both the Gulf of Mexico and off
the Philippines, and for French oil companies off the Congo.
The new TLPs may have to operate in waters of up to 1,450m deep, stretching
existing techniques still further. If the orders come through, they will be
a godsend to an industry currently suffering from the downward phase of an
often highly cyclical business.
Low oil prices and worldwide recession, reducing demand for oil, mean new
orders for rigs and platforms have become scarce. In Belleli's case, the
almost simultaneous launching this month of the Auger hull and two big
modules for other platforms will leave the Taranto yard without work.
With only about half a dozen companies probably capable of building the big
TLPs of the future, Belleli's engineers are setting great store by the
experience they have gained so far. No other European fabricator has won a
similar order for the US market, which is still largely dominated by US
manufacturers.
However, even TLP technology could be nearing its limits - at least until
more experience is gained with the current generation of platforms in
operation. Pellegrini says extending current techniques to produce TLPs
capable of working in up to 1,500m is quite feasible.
The challenge lies in going deeper. 'That will require new techniques for
preparing the seabed templates to which the securing tendons are attached,'
he says. And even the most enthusiastic TLP engineers will want to see how
their latest brainchilds, such as the Auger platform, perform at sea over a
period of time before taking too big a leap further forwards.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Krupp Stahl poised to close two big steel plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KRUPP STAHL, one of the best known names in the German steel industry, is
set to shut down its entire output of some steel products, with the loss of
4,000 jobs in the heart of the Ruhr industrial region. Two of its plants
face closure.
The announcement came as thousands of steelworkers demonstrated in steel
towns against imminent job losses throughout the industry and as Mr Gunter
Rexrodt, economics minister, held crisis talks with steel industry leaders
to agree a common strategy for next week's meeting of EC industry ministers
in Brussels. That meeting is meant to decide on a Community-wide plan to
reduce steel capacity.
The talks showed clear differences between Mr Rexrodt and the industry on
how far imports of cheap steel from eastern Europe should be restricted to
protect the west European industry during the restructuring process.
Krupp Stahl said that only last minute developments in talks with rival
steel producers, including Thyssen and Saarstahl, could prevent a final
decision to close its steel plants in Siegen and Hagen being taken at the
end of March.
'We are standing on the brink of closure there if there are no new
developments in the very near future,' Mr Gerhard Cromme, chairman of the
Fried. Krupp group and the newly merged Hoesch-Krupp combination, told
demonstrating steelworkers outside the Hoesch Stahl headquarters in
Dortmund, where an emergency board meeting was also under way.
Krupp Stahl, which provides almost half the turnover of the Fried. Krupp
group, said the management had concluded the only solution to the latest
steel market downturn was to give up its manufacture of steel sections such
as pipes and girders, which totalled almost 550,000 tonnes in 1991. The
company produces 3.6m tonnes of flat steel products, which would not be
affected.
The parent group has said it will decide whether to close an integrated
steel plant belonging to Hoesch Stahl in either Dortmund or
Duisburg-Rheinhausen in the next two weeks, as the company seeks a drastic
cut in its steel-making capacity. The company said last night the decision
would be taken as soon as the production and sales figures for February were
known.
The Krupp statement said final calculations on the viability of its output
of steel sections - all of which are high quality, special steels - had not
been made. It was possible that some residual activities could be kept going
during the closure process. The co-operation talks with Thyssen and
Saarstahl might also offer some relief.
It is estimated the restructuring may cost 30,000 steel jobs in west Germany
and another 10,000 in the east.

BANCO Central Hispano-americano (BCH), one of Spain's biggest commercial
banks, is understood to be negotiating to buy the bulk of the Spanish
state's 95 per cent stake in the Transmediterranea ferry company.
The government had wanted to include Transmediterranea in a slew of part
privatisations this year. The company has returned to profit in the past two
years. Talks are said to centre on BCH taking about 60 per cent of the
company.
This would cost the bank about Pta85bn (Dollars 726m), based on the price of
the 5 per cent of the company that trades in the Spanish markets.
Spain's financial futures exchange, the Barcelona-based MEFF, said it would
start trading its first individual share options on February 25, Reuter
reports from Madrid.
It will start with Telefonica Espanola and Endesa options, which have been
running in simulated trading since February 2, and hopes to add Repsol and
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya shortly.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S health minister, Mr Franco De Lorenzo, yesterday faced calls to
resign after deputies voted to remove his immunity from prosecution.
Mr De Lorenzo, a Liberal from Naples, is under investigation following
allegations that he, along with other Naples politicians, exchanged
political favours, such as guaranteed jobs, for votes.
The decision on Mr De Lorenzo's immunity still has to be ratified by the
full Chamber of Deputies, Italy's lower house.
On Wednesday , the lower house committee also voted in favour of lifting the
immunity from prosecution of the two other MPs involved in the case, Mr
Giulio Di Donato, a Socialist, and Mr Alfredo Vito, a Christian Democrat
(DC).
The latest twists in Italy's corruption scandal could complicate moves by
leaders of the four-party coalition to bring other parties into government.
Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, yesterday declined to comment on Mr
De Lorenzo or a possible cabinet reshuffle, before delivering a statement to
the Senate, the upper house, today.
Early next month the committee on immunity is expected to hear testimony
from Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist party leader, before opening
discussions on whether to lift Mr Craxi's immunity on two of the six
requests by Milan magistrates.
Meanwhile in Milan, magistrates yesterday began questioning Mrs Enza
Tomaselli, Mr Craxi's long-standing private secretary in his Milan office.
Mrs Tomaselli, who was arrested on Wednesday, is reported to have denied
allegations of corruption and collusion in illegal party funding.
According to testimony from other witnesses involved in the corruption
scandal, leaked by the Milan magistrature, Mr Craxi's office was a focal
point for the payment of illegal kickbacks to the party.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (12): A shadow on
Qwerty's keys - Electronic Pen Technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE QWERTY keyboard has always been an odd choice of interface between man
and machine. It is difficult to use, and for many, intimidating.
By the end of this decade, if the prophets of high technology are right, the
keyboard may have been consigned to the dustbin, at least as far as portable
computing is concerned. In its place could come voice or electronic pen
technology, or a combination of the two.
The hottest new products at last November's Comdex computer fair in Las
Vegas were those operated by moving an electronic pen across a
touch-sensitive screen or pad. Portable Computer manufacturers, including
industry heavyweights Toshiba, Apple, and IBM are racing to deliver
computers which take their commands from a pen rather than a keyboard.
Some market researchers have predicted that 1m pen computers will be sold by
1995, but the market is in its infancy and the estimates vary wildly. Last
year perhaps 100,000 pen-based machines were sold.
Among the first pen-based machines to reach the market were hand-held
machines from Poqet, the Fujitsu subsidiary, and the GRiDPad from Victor
Technologies. Meanwhile NCR, the AT&amp;T subsidiary, has already launched a
successor to its 3125 pen-based machine which was the first system based on
Intel's 80386 microprocessor.
The new NCR 3130 is based on the Intel 80386SL microprocessor, comes with
two megabytes of RAM expandable to 16, flash memory or a hard disk, and
weighs 4.4 pounds. A new screen texture has been used that feels more like
paper than glass to write on. If the machine is dropped, it senses gravity
changes and shuts the hard disk down.
So far, two basic designs of pen computer have appeared: the clipboard and
the palm-top. Clipboards are generally A4 size, weigh about 6lb, and are
used just like a conventional pen and paper clipboard for collecting data or
completing pre-defined electronic forms. Customised software enables
engineers, market researchers, nurses or surveyors, for example, to gather
data, with the pen operating like a glorified mouse, pointing to items on
the screen to select them.
On both sides of the Atlantic several companies have begun to use clipboard
machines so as to achieve cost savings in paper-intensive areas. The UK
Department of Trade has also sponsored the Freestyle projects to explore the
use of pen computers in industry.
But the biggest market share of the pen-based computer market is expected to
go to the hand-held palm-tops. The most eagerly awaited of these is the
Newton, Apple's 'personal digital assistant' which is due to be launched
later this year. Newton, measuring 7in by 4in, will feature a flip-up lid
and a thin electronic pen which clips onto the side of the casing.
Once again, however, the development of the pen computer market, like the
desktop PC market before it, could be constrained by competing software
operating systems. In addition to Apple's Newton, there are already three
competing operating systems, Microsoft's Windows for pen computing, which
claims the support of more than 120 software vendors, Penpoint from GO, a
Silicon Valley company and Geoworks. IBM is also understood to be working on
a version of its OS/2 operating system for pen environments.
Microsoft, in particular, is betting heavily on the success of pen
computing. Mr Bill Gates, its chairman and co-founder, has said he expects
pen computing to take off very rapidly. Hesees pen-based computer systems as
'the next generation of portable computers.'
The company believes that the relative ease of using a pen-shaped electronic
stylus instead of a keyboard will provide computer power to users like as
lorry drivers, meter readers, the police and others who, because of their
jobs, cannot use a conventional portable computer with a keyboard.
However before pen computers become widely adopted, the character
recognition software which they use for turning pen writing into computer
text will have to become more sophisticated. At present most systems can
just about cope with neatly-written capitals, but are lost when it comes to
reading standard cursive writing. What is more, most typists, even the
two-fingered variety, can write more quickly with a keyboard.
For these reasons, some critics suggest that the advantages of pen computing
are being overstated. One possible intermediate solution to this problem is
to build machines which feature both keyboards and electronic pens.
One such machine is the recently launched GRiD Convertible which looks and
works like any other clamshell-type notebook computer. However, by using
cunning hinges which drop the screen flat on its face, the Convertible can
be closed with the screen on the outside. It can then be used like a
conventional clipboard pen system.
Meanwhile Sharp, the Japanese electronics group, will launch the latest in
its IQ electronic organisers next month which for the first time uses pen
technology. The IQ-9000 has a small keyboard and an electronic pen which can
be used to activate the usual functions of an organiser on its touch
sensitive screen.
However, as in the PC market, any surge in pen-based computer sales will
probably not happen until the development of application software will
enable the machines to do really useful work - and no-one really knows what
form that will take or when it will happen.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (10): Quest for
lighter machines poses a bit of a size problem / A look at battery
technology and power management
</HEADLINE>

WHEN THE transportable computer had the dimensions and weight of a large and
full briefcase which was usually plugged into the mains, the size, weight
and capacity of the batteries were relatively unimportant.
However, as portable computers have shrunk and com puting-on-the-move has
become more of a reality, considerably more attention has been focused on
the power supply and particularly on how long batteries will last between
charges.
Indeed, battery technology has become one of the main limiting factors in
the quest for lighter and smaller machines with desktop functionality that
can operate for long periods without an umbilical power cord.
Unfortunately, battery technology has lagged behind developments in almost
every other sector of electronics. By some estimates, battery technology for
portables has improved a paltry 5 per cent a year and in most portable
devices the battery now accounts for a quarter of the weight, compared with
a tenth a decade ago. As a result, battery makers are now scrambling to come
up with lighter, more powerful and longer-lasting batteries.
With the exception of hand-held computers, most portables have until
recently relied on rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries. Generally, they
provide enough power between charges to keep a notebook PC running only for
between one and four hours, depending upon the application. More power could
be delivered by larger batteries, but this would add weight.
These NiCad batteries have other disadvantages, including the so-called
'memory-effect' which can mean that unless they are fully discharged before
recharging they gradually lose capacity - or the ability to be fully
recharged.
Improvements in NiCad technology are reaching their limits, while some
governments are moving towards banning them because the cadmium they contain
is so toxic that they are difficult to dispose of safely. So researchers
have switched their attention to new types of rechargeable batteries.
Several alternatives have been tried, but most have either proved unstable
or have shown little power-to-weight advantage over NiCad cells.
Manufacturers want a cell that is electrically compatible with NiCads but
lighter, thinner, longer-lasting, quicker to recharge and friendlier to the
environment.
So far, the most popular alternative has been nickel-metal hydride
powerpacks. Initially developed in Japan by Sanyo, NiMH batteries can now be
found in the latest portables. NiMH cells deliver the same 1.2 volts as
NiCad cells but can store nearly twice as much power (watt-hours) and have
the added advantage of being more environmentally friendly. Their total life
span of about 1,000 charge/discharge cycles compares with 500 to 600 cycles
for NiCad batteries.
However, some manufacturers including Sony Energytec, an affiliate of the
consumer-electronics giant, have attempted to leapfrog the competition with
a new generation of rechargeable batteries based on a lithium ion cell.
Many manufacturers make disposable lithium batteries - mostly in the form of
little 'button' cells for electronic devices, but it has been a lot more
difficult to build stable rechargeable cells.
Although they are still considerably more expensive than NiCad batteries,
current versions of lithium rechargeables pack up to four times the power of
the best NiCads but weigh only half as much.
But most manufacturers agree that two or three years are still needed to
remove technical hitches and reduce the cost of lithium batteries to make
them real rivals to NiCad and NiMH technology.
Meanwhile, some companies are focusing their research on improving existing
types of battery by giving them their own microprocessors - turning them
into what Dr Ross Green, a senior consultant and researcher at the
Hertfordshire-based Technology Partnership, calls 'intelligent battery
packs'.
By providing rechargeable batteries with a thumbnail-sized low-cost
microprocessor containing a mathematical model of battery behaviour, Dr
Green says it is possible to monitor and control the way the battery
operates.
Among the advantages he claims for the intelligent battery packs he has been
working on are extended service life - because charging and discharge are
carefully controlled - the ability to pack up to 15 per cent more charge
into a battery and astonishingly fast recharge times - as short as three
minutes.
Another byproduct of the research is that intelligent batteries can provide
detailed information to the user about their charge state - 'an accurate
fuel gauge'.
However, the relatively limited and slow progress in rechargeable battery
technology, coupled in particular with the advent of power-hungry colour
portables, has encouraged portable computer manufacturers to turn to other
solutions to extend operating life of their machines.
This is one factor behind the move by notebook computer manufacturers to
replace disk drives and similar components with less power-hungry
alternatives such as the PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International
Association) memory cards.
An earlier development, pioneered by Toshiba, was software implemented power
management systems which introduced auto-resume and pop-up battery power
indicators.
Software-based power management solutions can enhance battery life, but some
risk introducing compatibility and reliability problems, and more
fundamental solutions are required to achieve the substantial power savings
which portable PC users now demand. More complex power management systems
therefore depend upon a combination of hardware and software features.
To provide this, chipmakers AMD and Intel have begun to deliver low power
versions of their standard micro-processors with special built-in features
to improve power management and extend battery life. Intel began by
redesigning its 80386 chip set to include System Management Mode (SMM)
circuitry producing the power-saving Intel 80386SL chipset, unveiled at the
end of 1990.
Last year, Intel followed up by releasing the 486SL, a low- voltage version
of its most powerful PC processor. The 486SL's 'flexible voltage' feature
means that although it can operate as a 5-volt device, the real savings are
made at 3.3 volts with other low voltage components. In these circumstances
power consumption is reduced 50 per cent from a 5-volt 386SL system. Intel
claimed this should yield one to four hours of additional battery life.
Low-powered chips running at 3.3 volts, instead of the usual 5 volts, have
another big advantage - there is less waste heat to contend with. Indeed,
some portable computer manufacturers held off from releasing 80486 notebooks
because of concern about overheating and Intel has incorporated System
Management Mode (SMM) circuitry into its soon-to-be-released Pentium chip.
SMM is thought to account for about 10 per cent of the 3.2m transistors on
the Pentium chip, switching idle bits of the computer in and out of 'sleep'
mode at great speed and even turning off different parts of the
microprocessor between key strokes.
Perhaps by the time the first Pentium-based portables appear, other power
management techniques and battery technology itself will have made equally
significant leaps forward.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (11): Display -
the next steps / Screen Technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS axiomatic that, without the thin flat liquid crystal display, the
notebook computer that dominates the portable market today could never have
been built. Display technology will also play a pivotal role in determining
the shape, size and function of the next generation of portable computers.
Liquid crystals are odd substances, sharing properties of both liquids and
solids. After their discovery in 1888, they remained a laboratory curiosity
until 1963 when RCA, the US broadcasting company, found that by applying an
electrical charge, the liquid crystal molecules could be made to realign so
that they could either pass, or block, polarised light.
Ten years later Sharp, the Japanese consumer electronics group, sold the
first calculators with LCD screens. But when the first transportable
computers emerged in the early 1980s, they packed tiny cathode-ray tube
displays. These were heavy and power-hungry and were quickly replaced by the
LCD panel which has since become the standard for portable computing.
Nevertheless, over the past decade there has been growing pressure from
portable computer users for clearer, brighter screens and in particular
recently for high-resolution and colour screens able to do justice to
sophisticated software packages like those running under Microsoft's
'Windows.'
In simple 'passive' LCD devices, known as twisted nematic (TN), liquid
crystal molecules are held in a double sandwich of polarising filters and
glass plates. Individual cells can then be made to lighten or darken by
applying a charge.
This is fine for a small display; unfortunately, however, as the size of the
display increases, the contrast between dark and light areas declines. To
compensate for this, manufacturers have sought to increase the twisting
effect and thereby heighten contrast.
They have developed 'super twisted' nematic displays (STN) which produce the
blue screens familiar to portable and laptop computer users, and 'double
super twisted' nematic (DSTN) displays in which two STN cells are used.
Finally, there are 'triple super twisted' nematic (TSTN) displays which use
a refracting polymer film applied to the STN cell, allowing thinner displays
with higher contrast.
Today's new slimline notebook machines, like the 3.6lb Dell 320SLi, boast
these significantly improved LCD screens which also consume less power than
their predecessors, enabling manufacturers to cut battery weight.
Dell's 320SLi features a 9.5 inch LCD that uses 75 per cent less power than
the conventional edgelit LCD but is still able to offer a high contrast
ratio of 12:1 and 640x480 (VGA) resolution.
However, despite these improvements, 'passive' LCD technology still has some
shortcomings. In particular, the contrast is still insufficient to reproduce
the entire range of colours available on a CRT, and LCDs have relatively
slow response times which mean that moving images in particular tend to blur
and leave shadows.
These problems are overcome by using another form of LCD screen. Most
notebook manufacturers now sell premium-priced top-end machines with high
definition full-colour LCD screens using 'active matrix' thin film
transistor (TFT) technology in which contrast and response time are boosted
by adding a transistor 'switch' to each display cell or pixel.
However a TFT display is an extremely complex device consisting of 10 to 15
layers of materials, finely etched circuitry, and around 1m transistors that
can be shorted out by a microscopic speck of dust.
Predictably, manufacturing defects are high and, despite manufacturing
improvements, up to 20 per cent of the displays have to be scrapped. But, as
yields improve, prices are beginning to fall.
Aside from passive and active matrix LCDs, there are two other relatively
common screen technologies in current use: gas plasma and
electroluminescence.
Unlike LCDs, which need back or sidelighting, gas plasma displays generate
their own light. A particular advantage of the technology is that response
times are fast. The price of gas plasma portables is lower than that of
active matrix systems, and colour plasma displays are technically possible.
Electroluminescence (EL) screens are also fast, can support very high
resolutions and are cheaper than TFT displays, but they tend to be
power-hungry.
Manufacturers have therefore been investigating other newscreen technologies
including ferro-electric LCDs and metal-insulator-metal (MIM) screens, both
of which have yet to make their way into full commercial production.
In MIM displays, a layer of insulator is sandwiched betweentwo layers of
metal. They provide high contrast and may eventually be cheaper than TFT
machines. However, mass production techniques for MIM displays have yet to
be devised.
Some industry analysts and manufacturers believe that in the longer term
ferro-electric LCDs, pioneered by Thorn EMI in the UK and Cannon in Japan,
offer the most promise because potentially they have significant advantages
over TFT displays.
FLCDs use a different type of liquid crystal which reacts more quickly and,
most importantly, is bi-stable. This means that if a pixel is switched on so
that light cannot pass, it stays like that; if it is switched off so that
light can pass, it stays like that too.
Because only those parts of the screen that have changed need to be updated,
battery life can be increased by 20 times or more.
FLCDs are also lighter, brighter, easier to view and cheaper than TFT
screens, but have been more difficult to develop as a practical screen
because of their sensitivity to shocks although this problem now appears to
have been overcome.
Mass production of FLCDs is probably at least three years away, but they
should be significantly cheaper than TFT systems because no transistors are
required. Their fast response times and high contrast should also make them
ideal for pen-based computer systems.
In the meantime Mr David Brooke, Dell Computer's European product marketing
manager for portables, believes that most of the exciting developments over
the next year will involve conventional (LCD) screen technology. In
particular, he argues that advances in LCD technology will enable
manufacturers to build smaller and lighter machines with higher resolution
displays - closing the quality gap with desktops.
He also expects more notebook computer manufacturers to offer
interchangeable modular screens - ranging from low cost mono twisted nematic
LCD screens all the way to high definition colour TFT displays.
Adopting a modular screen design will help manufacturers reduce the need to
maintain high stock levels while customers will benefit from greater choice
and flexibility.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (8): When to take
Pentium - How users will react to a new microchip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL ARNOLD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MUCH more powerful, PC microchip called Pentium is soon to be launched by
Intel to follow its popular current-generation 486 microprocessor. For PC
users or perspective buyers this raises questions about what they should do
now. Should they stay with the PC they may already have, or buy the first
Pentium-based PC available?
Pentium (which could be considered a 586) leads a pack of new,
higher-performance microprocessors that are emerging, such as the Alpha from
Digital Equipment and the PowerPC from the Apple Computer-IBM-Motorola
alliance. These process data 64 bits at a time compared to 32 bits with a
486.
As each of these microprocessors is designed to provide big performance
improvements, a user or perspective buyer needs to know how and when to best
upgrade his existing hardware and software; the availability of new
software; and whether his current software will run on Pentium-based PCs.
Significantly, how will the new microprocessors affect PC costs?
The best thing may be to stay with what a user already has for a while. 'Buy
an economical 486SX which runs Windows right now,' recommends Mr Kim Brown,
microsystems vice president at InfoCorp, a market research company in Santa
Clara, California.
If a user wants more performance later in the year, incorporate an Intel DX2
Overdrive microchip that doubles processor performance, Mr Brown suggests.
DX2 Overdrive prices are too high at the moment but should become reasonable
later on, he says.
Then next year, as Pentium-based PC prices begin to fall, look carefully at
existing applications and determine whether Pentium provides a viable and
needed alternative, he adds.
A buy-486-and-hold strategy makes sense to Ms Nancy Tanana, marketing
manager at the PC business unit of Digital Equipment in Acton,
Massachusetts.
If the applications in use are fairly static and not highly graphical, such
as spreadsheets or word processing, then a 486 will do the job for the next
several years, she says. There are still a lot of 386-based systems being
shipped to meet those kinds of needs as well, she observes.
However, it obviously depends on which applications are in use. If file or
network servers are being implemented, then a more powerful, next-generation
processor is probably needed, Ms Tanana adds.
Also holding back, Mr Scott Uhrich, senior analyst, at Municipal Bond
Investors Assurance (MBIAC) in Armonk, New York, says he sees nothing on the
way that would cause him to replace his 486 in the near future. He will wait
for prices to fall.
Availability of new microprocessors from system manufacturers is also a big
issue for users. 'The new microprocessors will not have a significant impact
this year,' declares Mr Mel Thomsen of Pathfinder Research, a market
research company in San Jose, California. Nor, he says, will they compete
much with 486s now in the marketplace on cost and performance tradeoffs,
since 486-based PCs are so cheap.
Pentium-based machines will probably begin to appear this autumn as servers
or other high-end systems aimed at power users, according to Mr Tony Tong,
product manager with Elitegroup Computer Systems (ECS), a PC board systems
manufacturer in Fremont, California. But it will probably not be until 1994
that systems will appear in any volume, he says. Part of this is due to the
time it will take Intel to bring up advanced new fabrication processes to
produce Pentiums in volume, he says.
When it is time to upgrade his PC, a user has several choices: buy a whole
new PC; swap a new Pentium-based motherboard (printed circuit board on which
the chips are mounted) for an existing 486 PC; plug in an add-in board
containing a new higher performance processor; or replace a 486 chip with a
higher performance microprocessor - assuming that the existing socket on the
motherboard will accept the new microchip. Each approach has pros and cons.
For Mr Chuck Davis, information resources director at Eagle Industries in
Chicago, Illinois, swapping boards gives a level of complexity he does not
need. Using boards would create problems with ordering, record keeping,
installation and maintenance, he says. 'My orientation is toward the box,
not the CPU or boards. We move boxes, not boards,' he says.
Mr Uhrich of MBIAC would probably swap motherboards or use add-in cards
containing new microprocessors to upgrade but that would depend on the cost
implications. However, using add-in cards would not overcome the limitations
of the other parts of existing PCs.
To provide a system-level upgrade, Dell Computer in Austin, Texas, recently
announced 18 new 486-based PCs with sockets that will accept a Pentium-class
microprocessor from Intel, according to Mr Charles Sauer, vice-president for
software and technology strategy. Dell is evaluating a Pentium add-in card
for the new systems that would provide users with an upgrade path, he says.
Chip vendors cloning Intel microprocessors also provide upgrade options. For
example, Cyrix in Richardson, Texas, enables users to upgrade their 386DX
sockets by plugging in a 486-compatible microchip that doubles the clock
speed, according to Mr Glenn Burchers, microprocessor marketing manager.
Cyrix also is developing Spike, a processor, due out in the second half of
1993, that is Intel-compatible for which he claims better-than-Pentium
performance.
But software can also limit PC performance, Mr Thomsen of Pathfinder points
out. Software is the real wild card in the whole mix, he says. To exercise
fully the performance of Pentium and Alpha class microprocessors, for
example, Microsoft is developing Windows NT (New Technology) which is
expected to be unveiled in May.
Windows NT is designed to let a desktop run applications software developed
specifically for the new microprocessors as well as existing applications
software written for current Intel-based PCs, such as 486DX desktops that
have MS-DOS operating systems. Presumably, x86 applications software could
run on, say, an Alpha-based machine, as well as a Pentium one.
This 'backwards-compatibility,' a stated goal of Microsoft and chip vendors,
is designed to preserve the great investment and installed base of MS-DOS
and Windows-based applications ' and might give users more flexibility in
choosing new hardware. 'The beauty of the DOS-based PC is the Dollars 100bn
software base,' declares Mr Dick Eckhardt, engineering vice president of
Cyber Research in Branford, Connecticut. 'No one will buy a system that's
not compatible with that software,' he says.
However, Windows NT will only emulate software written for 486 and older
PCs, so performance - though quicker than a 486 machine - won't be as fast
as software written specifically for Windows NT, according to Mr Scott
Thomas, of Toshiba's Semiconductor Group in Irvine, California. To run
faster, the software would have to be cleaned up but this should not be too
difficult, he adds.
'There's no merit in buying a 586 (Pentium-class) machine and running the
software I've got,' Mr Thomsen points out (He uses a 33-MHz 386-based
desktop, which works just fine, he says.) 'To optimise the performance of a
586, you need to recompile all the software to take advantage of all of the
microprocessor's features.'
What about PC pricing? Mr Peter Zandan, a market analyst at IntelliQuest in
Austin, Texas, believes that Intel will pursue an aggressive pricing
strategy for Pentium, echoing the 386 to 486 transition. This should be
reflected fairly early on in PC pricing, he says. Users not only will expect
it but will demand it, he adds.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (9): A fish among
sharks / Profile of AST Research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL ARNOLD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE it entered the PC martketplace six years ago, AST Research has quietly
become a Dollars 1bn-plus company that is compared favourably with such
first-tier high-flyers as Compaq and Dell Computer.
Revenues from the most recent second fiscal quarter soared to Dollars
346.3m, up Dollars 60m from the previous quarter and Dollars 107m from a
year earlier, while net income almost doubled to Dollars 14.6m from the
previous quarter. Revenues have grown 60 per cent over the past 12 months.
In that second quarter AST shipped 200,00 notebook, portable and desktop PCs
and expects to ship 1m units in the next 12 months.
But that only makes AST a fish that is eighth in the US and 11th worldwide
in a roiling PC marketplace, swimming among much larger sharks such as IBM,
Apple, Compaq and Dell. It must navigate carefully to survive in a
marketplace ruled by severe price competition, continuing shake-out of PC
vendors and unrelenting technological innovation. Furthermore, all
competitors have access to the same commodity components and software.
Reflecting on market conditions, analysts with investment house Merrill
Lynch Global Securities Research estimates that, although AST's revenues
will continue to rise, gross margins continue to slide. Consequently, they
lower the earnings per share estimate to Dollars 1.85 from Dollars 2.00 for
the third quarter. However, the New York-based firm acknowledges that AST
has 'significant' orders, is controlling costs and can expect greater
revenues from new products such as notebook PCs.
More bullish analysts at Alex Brown &amp; Sons in Baltimore, Maryland, declare
that 'we know of no better, low-cost, design and volume PC manufacturer than
AST'. They point to the company's ability to quickly sniff out 'sweet spots'
in high-growth channels to jump into first, such as selling through large
consumer electronic and appliance chains. They put AST in the 'PC elite'
along with Compaq, Dell, IBM and Apple.
To continue to grow, AST president and co-founder Safi U. Qureshey says that
the company does not face external market challenges but internal ones. 'The
challenge is how to build an organisation that thrives on change,' he says.
AST in Irvine, California, for example, must find ways to continually
improve production and execution, he says.
Mr Qureshey points out that AST has a young workforce that might become
overawed competing against the likes of IBM and Compaq. 'AST has to find its
own solutions' and 'build an organisation that doesn't get scared,' he says.
'We must constantly re-engineer the organisation,' Mr Qureshey says. 'If we
continue to do what we did a year ago, we will fail,' he says. AST employees
must not be afraid to experiment, he adds.
To prepare for growth, Mr Qureshey says that a strong management team has
been brought in. The new head of engineering is a 15-year veteran from IBM's
PC operation in Boca Raton, Florida. Worldwide service (an AST strong suit)
is run by a 25-year Digital Equipment veteran and worldwide manufacturing by
a manger with 10 years' experience at Motorola and 15 years at Texas
Instruments. (The former engineering head now hunts for new business and
technology opportunities.)
But how does bringing in industry veterans from large organisations that
might be perceived as slow-moving equate with a young company trying to
thrive on change? Acknowledging that this was a concern, Mr Qureshey says
that they were chosen carefully and attracted to AST in the first place. The
ex-IBMer, for example, was responsible for several successful products
there.
AST's goal is to grow faster than the marketplace, Mr Qureshey declares.
More moderate price declines in the coming months will help, he predicts.
The big players were out of line with their prices and made a correction.
Declines now are not likely to be as steep as the last six months of 1992,
he maintains.
According to Mr Qureshey, AST's success is based on being totally focused on
the PC business, based in the biggest marketplace, able to pick and choose
from the best technology, and staying close to customers to respond to their
needs.
That may sound like motherhood and apple pie, but Mr Qureshey says it is
also based on the 'challenge' of having his 250-person engineering
department wring out the best performance from commodity components and
software.
Mr Qureshey claims that when AST entered the PC market six years ago with a
286-based machine, it set new standards for price and performance and
started the company's growth. Two years ago AST went after the notebook
market against the likes of Compaq, NEC, Toshiba and Zenith and is now a
solid number three in the notebook business.
Alex Brown analysts call AST's PowerExec notebooks introduced last September
'unparalleled in the industry'. The notebooks have pop-out modules that
enable users to upgrade their display screens, microprocessors and hard disk
drives without having to buy a whole new system. The Dollars 995 to Dollars
3,395 Bravo line of desktops for small and medium-sized businesses feature
graphics and modem capabilities that 'set (them) apart from similarly-priced
competitive offerings', the analysts report.
The initial Bravo line was brought out four years ago to offer
business-oriented features when people were buying consumer-oriented PCs
from Leading Edge and Samsung, Mr Qureshey says. A year ago it introduced
the Advantage] line for consumer electronic chain stores, now in more than
900 US locations. 'We created a whole new strategy,' he declares, one that
saw revenues for that segment grow to Dollars 50m in the second quarter from
Dollars 30m in the first.
Being vertically integrated also enables AST to design and manufacture PCs
for other PC vendors. It reportedly builds PCs for Digital Equipment and may
also do contract manufacturing for either IBM or Unisys, according to Alex
Brown analysts. Mr Qureshey will not comment on specifics but says that
because AST competes head to head with the best PC vendors in the
marketplace, large system houses confidently come to the company for design
and manufacturing.
This represents the third phase of contract manufacturing. First, large
system companies dabbled with the PC manufacturing and then turned to Far
East manufacturers, who proved unsatisfactory. Alex Brown analysts say that
OEM sales is an increasing percentage of North American sales, rising from
10 per cent to the teens, depending on the quarter.
AST also grows by staying out of some markets, Mr Qureshey explains. For
example, one is the Risc marketplace (Risc is speedy microprocessor
technology that competes with standard PC microchips). 'People looked at Sun
(Microsystems) and got seduced,' he says. 'Sun did a good marketing job but
it sells a whole workstation whereas Risc clones couldn't and now are out of
business.'
Others include pen-based PCs and multimedia machines, which Mr Qureshey says
have no primary applications driving them today. They will be niche markets
for the next 12 months, he says. Nevertheless, AST will introduce a pen-
based system in a few months as part of a measured product strategy in both
areas.
AST, now 12 years old, began as a maker of add-in boards that enabled users
to add features to IBM PCs. It took its name from the first letters of its
co-founders' first names. 'I think that there will be 10 or 12 PC
manufacturers left in the world and AST will be one of them,' Mr Qureshey
declares.

the ideal work for monks'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ONE OF the oddest businesses in Rhone Alpes must be Chartreuse Diffusion,
which exists not for pure profit but to support a silent, mountain-bound,
religious order.
Chartreuse Diffusion's mission is to sell the fragrant green herbal liqueur
of that name, and other drinks, bearing the brand of the Chartreux, or
Carthusian, monastic order.
With sales more or less stable at FFr33m a year, and 48 employees,
Chartreuse Diffusion is based in a motley collection of warehouses and
cellars in Voiron, an industrial town in the valley beneath the high
mountain stronghold of the 11th century monastery of the Chartreux fathers.
Majority-owned and controlled by the religious order, it employs lay workers
and is run on the fathers' behalf by Mr Jean Marc Roget, a local
businessman.
Beyond cultivating and preparing the liqueur's 130 ingredient plants in
their monastery gardens, the fathers play little part in the daily
operations of the business.
Two of them descend to the valley at intervals to operate the distillery,
which produces 1m bottles a year. The monks receive a special dispensation
to speak for business purposes, explains Mr Philip Boyer, who is in charge
of external relations.
'The Chartreux rules oblige them to work for a living, unlike the mendicant
monastic orders. Distilling is the ideal job for them because it demands so
little labour,' Mr Boyer says. Labour-intensive storage, bottling and sales
are left to the lay employees.
The company sells a steady 48 per cent of its output abroad, relying on its
natural mystique to attract custom. Spain is the biggest market outside
France, taking 25 per cent of exports, followed by the US with 10 per cent.
A recipe for a powerful green health elixir (as with Coca Cola, the recipe
is a trade secret) was donated to the Chartreux fathers in 1605 by Marechal
d'Estrees, the legendary French field marshal. It took the monks more than
100 years to work out how to make the remedy, 40 per cent volume. Thirty
years later, in 1764, the monks produced the milder green liqueur based on
the elixir, and this is their main product today.
The elixir itself is still available. There is a increase in demand for it
in Japan - not as a drink, but as a hair tonic, says Mr Boyer. 'It might
seem odd, but there could be some active herbs in the mixture.'
The fathers nearly lost what is now their main source of income when
Napoleon seized the recipe in 1810, during a general round-up of all secret
remedies which might prove useful to the state. He returned the document a
few months later, stamped 'refused' - to the fathers' lasting relief.
Chartreuse Diffusion's main customers are supermarkets and the hotel
catering business. With un-monastic commercial aggressiveness it has to
fight its corner against other drinks brands, Mr Boyer says.
It also has a traditional direct marketing programme in local ski-resorts,
where holidaymakers on their first night are offered 'Green Chaud,' the
latest in Chartreuse Diffusion's menu of Chartreuse-based cocktails. 'Green
Chaud' consists of hot chocolate plus a dash of the liqueur. The idea of
this made the fathers laugh, says Mr Boyer, but it has gone down well with
skiers.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Rhone-Alpes (11): All eyes on the weather / A look
for green shoots in the snow
</HEADLINE>

THE GREEN shoots of recovery are beginning to show in the ski industry, a
mainstay of the Rhone Alpes economy, but they are still fragile.
There are mixed reasons for this in the region which traditionally attracts
60 per cent of all French winter sports bookings. One is fall-out from the
1992 winter Olympics in the Tarentaise resorts around Albertville. Another
is two seasons of better snow following three years of dismally bald pistes.
Then there is a recovery in consumer spending in the US - an important
market for Salomon and Skis Rossignol, the leading ski equipment makers
based near Annecy and Grenoble respectively.
The winter Olympics gave the region's ski industry the biggest shot in the
arm since the 1968 Olympic games came to Grenoble. Like most shots in the
arm, it caused initial pain to the patient - in the form of a decline in
winter sports bookings during the games early last year. Holiday skiers were
frightened off by the prospect of crowds and traffic jams.
Excellent December snowfalls attracted them back to the slopes in large
numbers. Christmas week ski resort bookings were up by 15 per cent,
according to the Rhone-Alpes regional council. But much of the snow had
melted by late January. The industry fears that mass cancellations for
February, usually the peak month, could ruin the season's good start.
'We are finding a new optimism in the market. But our fortunes are more
sensitive to changes in the climate than in the economy,' says Mr
Jean-Jacques Bompard, secretary general of Skis Rossignol, the world's
largest supplier of skis (under its own name and as Dynastar).
New motorways and express rail lines have been built around the Olympic
sites. The Olympics also provided some communes with ice rinks and halls
surplus to immediate requirements - a financial headache for some, but an
improvement in the capacity of the winter tourism industry.
Whether economic recovery proves real or illusory, both the leading ski
equipment groups have long come to accept that they live in a mature market.
Skis Rossignol, for example, forecasts that world demand for skis from all
producers should rise from 5.9m pairs in 1991-1992 to more than 6m pairs
this season, of which more than a quarter will be Rossignol brands. Yet that
only brings sales back to the same level as four years ago.
To guarantee long term survival, both groups have followed a similar
strategy: trimming operating costs and diversifying into other sports
equipment.
Salomon, the larger of the two companies with sales of FFr1.5bn last year,
was the first to diversify beyond its core business of ski-bindings, in
which it is world market leader with a 44 per cent share. In 1984 it bought
Taylor Made, a US golf club maker which has since prospered. Then came an
innovative ski model, made of a single shell rather than of the conventional
sandwich design. Since its launch in 1989, this model has taken at least a
fifth of the market for skis priced at FFr2,000 and up.
'We could have bought a ski company, but there would have been no point
because we would have had to invest in complete retooling for our new
design. I am glad we started from scratch,' says Mr Jean-Francois Gautier,
the young chief executive brought in two years ago by Mr Georges Salomon,
the retiring company founder.
The group had to suffer 380 French job losses two years ago - a serious blow
to the small lakeside town of Annecy. Since then, however, it seems to have
turned the corner.
Rossignol, which still devotes 64 per cent of turnover to skis, has followed
a slightly different diversification strategy. It began in 1977 with the
launch of a line of tennis rackets which has since proved a flop. Rossignol
stopped production in France last year and has now turned to Asian
subcontractors.
Rossignol's main diversifications outside skis are its two lines of ski
boots, its own and Lange, a maker of competition boots it bought in 1989,
which now account for nearly a fifth pf its sales and 11.5 per cent of the
world downhill boot market.
Rossignol's recovery has been weaker than Salomon's, but Mr Bompard is
expecting a profit this year. Everything hinges on the weather.

blessing

RECESSION has hit the pockets but not the spirits of the 20,000 people who
earn their living from making and selling Beaujolais. It is, perhaps,
Rhone-Alpes' best known product internationally .
The mood was jovial as the wine growers around Anse, in the south of the
area that produces Beaujolais Nouveau, gathered for their annual seven
course lunch on St Vincent's day last month, to celebrate the wine
industry's patron saint.
As foil-covered numbered bottles were passed round for a blind pre-lunch
tasting, the consensus was that the wine to come on to the market next
autumn would be of excellent quality. Riotous singing floated up to the
rafters of Anse's Maison Rurale as celebrations wore on through the late
afternoon.
Like the rest of the French wine industry, Beaujolais has recently been
through hard times.
Wholesale prices fell by an average of 27 per cent last year for Beaujolais
Nouveau, the refreshing young wine released world wide every year in the
third week of November, which accounts for half the region's production of
170m bottles a year.
Prices now stand at their lowest since the 1960s, and well below some
growers' production costs, says Mr Gerard Canard, director of the Union
Interprofessionelle des Vins du Beaujolais, the local wine industry
association.
Price falls have been lower for the higher quality Beaujolais Villages
which, unlike the so-called primeur, can be drunk up to two years after
bottling and represents another quarter of Beaujolais output. The highest
quality Beaujolais wines, the 10 crus such as Morgon and Brouilly, have
never been known to sell below cost.
'Prices had risen to unreasonable levels in 1989, so this is no great
surprise.' Even so, he says, growers of the cheapest Beaujolais Nouveau have
experienced 'some difficult situations.' Fortunately volumes have kept up,
with an estimated overall rise in sales of five or 10 per cent last year.
Within this, exports rose by 25 per cent in volume - but were static in
value - in the first 10 months of 1992.
The Beaujolais industry remains a striking mixture of craft production and
international marketing clout. Typically, Beaujolais wine properties are
owned by small family businesses, unlike the food and quality goods giants
which dominate Bordeaux and Champagne.
Bottling, distribution and marketing is handled by a handful of large
wholesale merchants such as Georges Duboeuf or Ferraud - a function of the
investment required to deliver 85m bottles across the world in the few weeks
during which Beaujolais Nouveau is marketed.
This is why merchants handle a much higher proportion of Beaujolais sales -
on average 85 per cent, Mr Canard estimates - than they handle in other
wine-making regions of France. However, the proportion of direct sales has
gradually risen in recent years, as supermarkets and the catering business
seek keener prices by cutting out the merchants.
The Beaujolais tradition of releasing at least half the region's production
over a period of just a few weeks is partly historical accident, partly
marketing technique. In the early years of the century, the so-called
Beaujolais primeur had an even shorter shelf-life than it has now - so Lyon
brasserie owners used to order it by the barrel before it had even finished
its four to five day fermenting period. When some bar owners started putting
up notices proclaiming that the Beaujolais Nouveau had arrived, the wine
merchants saw a marketing opportunity.
'The merchants have played a very important role in marketing us,' says Mr
Canard.
Their ability to keep export sales rising steeply during a world recession
indicates that Beaujolais merchants have not lost the knack.

WHAT'S next after personal computers? According to many in the PC industry,
the future lies in hand-held devices that combine computer and
communications technologies. Apple Computer calls them personal digital
assistants, others refer to them as information appliances, but perhaps the
best name is personal communicators.
Whatever they are called, they are creating a great deal of interest among
potential customers, and excitement within the computer industry where they
are viewed as a potential multi- billion dollar market opportunity.
Last May, John Sculley, Apple chairman, described his vision for personal
digital assistants as the seeds for a Dollars 3,500bn industry that would be
created by the 'collision of content, communications, computing and consumer
electronics'.
'This isn't about taking a computer and shrinking it down,' he said. 'It's
about starting with an entirely new set of principles built around
intelligence, built around communications, built around complete
intuitiveness . . . about building something that is as easy to use as an
aim-and-shoot camera or a telephone.'
The first version of the much ballyhooed Newton personal digital assistant
is now expected to make its debut this summer. It will be an electronic
note-pad, a hand-held device that 'intelligently assists the user to
capture, organise and communicate information,' Apple says.
At a recent demonstration of a prototype version of Newton, the device could
decipher and store handwritten notes, automatically making entries in a
personal calendar, send a facsimile message and send or receive electronic
messages via the telephone.
Apple says that the first version of Newton will be priced at 'well below
Dollars 1,000'. It will be aimed initially at business executives, rather
than the masses that Apple eventually hopes to attract with its easy-to-use
technology.
Price will be an important factor in the development of the market. It is
generally agreed that to reach a broader market personal communicators will
have to sell for less than Dollars 500 and preferably closer to Dollars 300.
Bringing the expectations surrounding hand-held personal communicators down
to earth is important, says Marc Porat, president and chief executive of
General Magic, a three-year-old company that is developing software for
personal communicators.
'I am a walking antidote to hyperbole and hysteria,' says Mr Porat. 'The
public is tired of promises that the high-tech industry does not live up
to.' It may be a decade, or even longer, before intelligent personal
communications become a reality, he stresses.
Nonetheless, General Magic has renewed interest in personal communications
devices with its announcement of software that is designed to enable
personal communicators from different manufacturers to exchange information.
The company has developed Telescript, a programming language for
communications software that it aims to make into an industry standard.
Magic Cap is General Magic's software foundation for personal communicators.
It provides a 'user friendly' face for personal communicators much as
Apple's Macintosh did for personal computers.
Companies backing General Magic, and planning to use its technology are
Apple Computer, Motorola, Sony , AT&amp;T, Matsushita and Philips.
Motorola, a leader in cellular telephones and paging devices, claims that it
will be the first company to bring wireless communications capabilities to
personal communicators. 'We believe there will be strong demand for fun and
easy-to-use devices that will help people stay in touch with the office or
with those at home,' said Pat Richardson, vice-president and director,
Motorola Personal Messaging Products. 'Personal communicators will provide
business users and ultimately the average consumer with the ability to
communicate with anyone, anywhere in the world at any time.'
Motorola's first personal communicator will be launched later this year, the
company said.
AT&amp;T has already staked its claim to the personal communications market
through an alliance with Eo, a Silicon Valley start-up company that recently
announced its first products - hand-held computer tablets with built-in
communications capabilities.
'These personal communications devices will become as ubiquitous as the
telephone or the television,' said William Warwick, president of AT&amp;T
Microelectronics. He predicted that there could be as many as 1bn of the
devices in use in 10 years.
The question hanging over personal communicators is not whether they will
become the next blockbuster electronics products but when.
'We think there are going to be billions of these devices out there, and at
some point sales of these new devices will surpass those of personal
computers. We are guessing what is going to happen before the end of the
century,' says John Sculley.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (6): Striking the
right Notes for the future / A look at the impact of Groupware
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMPUTER software industry has been promising to change the way people
work for the past decade. Sceptics might suggest the aim has been achieved,
but only in terms of expense and frustrated users. Enter Groupware.
Groupware is a term coined to embrace programs for people working in teams.
It provides an infrastructure to co-ordinate individuals in the group, while
ensuring the concurrence of data relating to their work. Members of the
group can be scattered across continents. But when they turn to their
software environment, the very latest information from all involved is right
there.
Groupware offers a godsend to large organisations tackling the logistics of
teamwork. The concept has taken off, with Lotus Notes first on the beach.
Notes sits on one dedicated PC which serves up to 50 users. This central
core holds material which users summon up, seeing the latest change to the
project across the network. Lotus began selling Notes licences for batches
of 200 users upwards. The entry investment, at Pounds 200 per user, was
Pounds 40,000.
The appeal was dramatic, with blue chip companies buying licences by the
thousand. In the last 12 months the user base has grown exponentially. By
March 1992 Lotus had sold 117,000 licences worldwide. Industry sources
suggest that this figure now stands at 500,000.
Notes answers many administrative headaches. Use it for conferencing and it
boosts productivity by avoiding duplication of effort. A centrally held
diary can fix meetings in one shot, rather than the familiar round of phone
calls via secretaries requiring a dozen cancelled appointments before one
convenient day can be established.
But it does have limitations. The dedicated server must run IBM's OS/2
operating system which is greedy in terms of space on a machine and is
primarily established among very large corporate users. Each group hangs off
one server, but co-ordinating that server to others to form a constellation
of workgroups is not easy. A release for the Unix operating system, offering
vastly improved networking capabilities, is imminent.
Management consultants KPMG recently conducted a survey covering 10,000 UK
Notes users. The principal problem encountered was actual communication of
what Notes does. Within large organisations senior managers still have
reservations about whether Notes is worthwhile.
The computer industry can blame itself for this. Groupware arrived in a
blaze of jargon. Workflow, a term that has as many definitions as it has
adherents, is a typical Groupware spin-off. It refers to monitoring
individual effort and directing the user so as to optimise time and effort.
But the term is so imprecise that it serves to confuse.
To use Groupware, a company must be comfortable with team structures. There
is little point installing Notes if the users work in a fractious
environment. Groupware is suited to professional harmony.
But corporations that have embraced Notes have gone for it in a big way.
General Motors has bought nearly 30,000 licences for Notes, through its IT
arm, Electronic Data Systems. Mr Mike Thompson, an EDS manager attached to
GM in the UK, is impressed. 'It's been phenomenal. The user perception is
extremely positive.'
A typical GM application is shipping pictures of parts around across Europe
to ensure that they are produced exactly to their original specification.
And it is evidence of the quality of graphics with Notes.
GM is prepared to entrust Notes with a critical role in maintaining
engineering standards. But the GM world already consisted of a massive IT
infrastructure and the trained staff to use it. Mr Thompson warns that
without this investment Notes will not deliver. 'You must take account of
the support aspect. You do need a network in place.'
BP Oil employs Notes as the framework for its emergency response system. If
an oil leak occurs in Germany, staff across Europe consult Notes for site
plans, technical diagrams and up-to-the-minute strategies.
Notes maintains information on health and safety rules and their
implications for the oil sector on a system that can be accessed by BP staff
across the continent.
Lotus has certainly gained acceptance for Groupware with Notes. But there
are other products that do a similar job. Why has Lotus Notes emerged from
the PC world to eclipse steady performers like Verimation's Memo or the new
Co-operation program from NCR?
Mr Richard Lavender, a senior consultant at systems house Logica, describes
the rise of Notes as 'a confidence trick in the nicest possible way.' The
market presence of Lotus as a reputable supplier of PC software was
critical. 'People knew who Lotus were and they already had Lotus products
under their belt.' And the sales strategy of going straight for large users
has produced influential enthusiasts.
Verimation's Memo range grew out of an electronic mail system for Volvo. It
tends to thrive in mainframe environments where a lot of users need to pull
down and share corporate data. Mr Bruno Giversen, Verimation vice-president,
admits that both products have their strengths, and can be complementary.
'Memo is much cheaper, but rightly so because Notes has more database
facilities.'
Abbey National's new life insurance wing uses a mainframe based Memo system
to co-ordinate its PC environment. NCR's Co-operation ties together elements
of an existing IT infrastructure. The idea is to maintain the hardware
investment but control staff working locally within the overall wide area
network. It is a development environment that can be altered to suit
individual businesses, offering a shot at the elusive prize of 'competitive
advantage'.
National &amp; Provincial Building Society is implementing Co-operation to keep
documents flowing between teams. A typical price for a 100-user installation
would be Pounds 77,000.
Mr Kenny MacIver, a software analyst at International Data Corporation, has
made an exhaustive study of the mass migration to Notes. He concludes
Groupware is here to stay. 'Notwithstanding its obvious limitations, Notes
is a glimpse of the future. Where there is a need to share data and
co-ordinate group activity, there's going to be a need for such a package.'

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Rhone-Alpes (8): Profits under pressure - Lyon is
an important banking centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARIS BANKS are feeling the squeeze in Rhone-Alpes as the economic slowdown
takes full effect in what is one of France's most competitive regional
banking industries.
'Until the end of 1991, we and many of our business customers thought
Rhone-Alpes would escape the crisis,' says Mr Philippe Barriere, director of
Banque Nationale de Paris' network in Rhone-Alpes, Bourgogne and Auvergne.
'Companies continued to invest and seek external growth and we contributed
to this by lending to them. Now they are left with overcapacity. We were hit
later than the rest of France, but we were hit hard. The more economic
vitality you have the harder you are hit,' he says.
Growth in both lending and deposits has slowed. Loans outstanding by French
banks in the region grew by a mere 0.7 per cent to FFr303bn in the year to
last September - a small fraction of the 14 per cent growth achieved in
1990, a year before the slowdown hit. The Banque de France says that the
total of deposits at the region's banks rose a mere 2 per cent to FFr310bn
in the 12 months to September 1992.
Like their Parisian counterparts, Lyon's banks are also burdened by troubled
loans on city property. They made made heavy (but unpublished) provisions on
these, says Mr Bernard Rivier, deputy director general of the Banque de
France's Lyon office. Demand for office property in Lyon fell by 25 per cent
last year, while prices have fallen by up to 20 per cent for old buildings,
10 per cent for new ones, according to a recent study by Bourdais, the
property consultants. 'All the banks have property investments. They have
seen some difficulties, but they have been largely provisioned for,' says Mr
Rivier.
So it is no surprise that profit margins across the region's banking
industry have been under intense pressure.
Most of the leading players can stand the strain because they are owned by
powerful national banks. But at least one independent operator has hit
trouble. Only last month the Lyon-based development capital group, Societe
de Developpment Regionale du Sud-Est, had to be taken over by Credit
Lyonnais - the state-owned bank which owned 19 per cent of its shares -
because of heavy operating losses and bad debts.
Historically, Lyon's claim to be the region's banking capital dates from the
15th century, when Italian financiers set up shop there after escaping from
the Guelph-Ghibeline civil wars of that time. Some are still there - indeed
the Italian banking community is growing fast. Today the city hosts most of
the 69 banks present in Rhone-Alpes, of which 23 are foreign, including
eight Italians.
While the intensity of competition makes bank managers' lives uncomfortable,
it is a boon for both private and business customers. This explains why the
region has more bank branches per head than the national average, and why
Lyon has six market dealing rooms and the best developed supply of venture
capital available outside Paris.
Business loans in Lyon can even be cheaper than would be available in Paris,
according to several local bankers. 'Because of the very fierce competition,
our spreads can be lower in some cases than in Paris,' says Mr Yves
Minssieux, regional director of Lyonnaise de Banque, France's largest
regional bank, which is indirectly owned by the GAN state-owned insurance
group. Indeed, the sophistication of Lyon's banking industry is one of the
reasons why the city feels confident in its bid to be headquarters of the
European central bank.
As in Paris, the main banks are the three big national clearers: Credit
Lyonnais, Banque Nationale de Paris and Societe Generale. Beneath them come
half a dozen regional banks owned by national ones, of which Lyonnaise de
Banque is the leading example.
At the next level comes Credit Agricole du Sud-Est (Case), the giant
co-operative bank which has taken market share from conventional banks since
being given the right to lend to industrial customers (rather than only to
farmers) five years ago. Conventional banks complain that Case's huge
network - 251 branches in 10 departements - gives it an unfair advantage in
access to cheap funds. Case argues that it is competing fairly because its
costly structure - a federation of fully fledged banks with their own
semi-autonomous administrations - means that its costs are higher than those
of conventional banks.
Then comes the recent wave of Italian banks which have not hesitated to
undercut their Rhone-Alpine competition, especially in lending to the
construction industry, the Italians' traditional expertise. Lyon has eight
Italian banks; more than half, attracted by the growing cross-frontier trade
between Rhone-Alpes and Italy's industrial north, have come in the past
seven years, Recent arrivals include Banco Nazionale del Lavoro and
Instituto Bancario Sao Paolo di Torino.
Some of their Rhone-Alpes competitors have responded by co-operating, or
taking equity stakes in an Italian partner. Case and Lyonnaise de Banque
have done so, though the latter has curbed its international investments in
recent years.
Mr Joel Picard, deputy managing director at the Case, believes the
competitive threat from Italian banks is containable. 'So long as Italian
banks are coming to the region to accompany Italian companies here, they
will have no problem, but I don't think they can do as well as we can on our
own market. They have arrived here late, and at a difficult time,' he says.
Overall, according to Mr Rivier of the Banque de France, the picture is of a
strong banking industry, with high quality management, well able to ride out
the economic downturn. 'So long as the crisis does not go on too long, I do
not foresee any major problems,' he says.

THE PORTLY Mr Raymond Barre, the voluble 68-year-old economics professor who
has been an MP for Lyon for the past 15 years and is a former prime minister
of France, is on a crusade.
He is leading the campaign for the former capital of Roman Gaul to be chosen
as the site for the future European Central Bank.
Mr Barre is a tireless ambassador, arguing the city's cause in London,
Brussels and even in front of an audience of sceptical and suspicious German
bankers in Frankfurt, seat of the German Bundesbank and the most heavyweight
rival for the honour. The final decision is likely to be made by European
Community governments, some time after the final ratification of the
Maastricht treaty on European political and monetary union, possible in the
second half of this year, Mr Barre believes.
Thanks to his efforts, Lyon has waged a much more visible campaign for the
honour than other candidates such as Amsterdam, Edinburgh, Strasbourg,
Luxembourg - or even Frankfurt itself.
In this, Mr Barre's crusade has the discreet support of the French
government, aware that attempts to attract the bank to Strasbourg, the main
rival French site, is very unlikely to succeed because of the presence there
of the European Parliament.
The egg-headed Mr Barre looks and talks like an archetypical Lyonnais,
jovial and fond of the good things of life. Yet like many French politicians
his real roots are well outside his local power base; he was born in the
Indian Ocean island of Reunion and he is married to a Hungarian.
'To have the bank here will be good for Lyon, for the internal balance of
France and for the balance of power in Europe,' he says, taking a brief rest
in his Lyon headquarters during his weekly whistle-stop tour of his inner
city consituency. 'Whether we succeed or fail, there will be an advantage in
it for Lyon because it will be better known internationally.'
Lyon's natural claim, he says, rests on its 500-year history as a banking
centre, good road, rail and air links to northern Italy and Spain and
western Germany, and its position at the geographical and cultural divide
between north and south Europe.
He points to other international bodies which have chosen Lyon for their
base for similar reasons - Interpol, the international police organisation,
and Euronews, the European television news service which, symbolically,
started broadcasting from Lyon at the dawn of the single European market on
January 1, 1993.
But why should Lyon have a claim rather than Paris? 'I have long been
preoccupied by the concentration of activity in Paris. Other cities now need
to become, if not as an important centre of activity as Paris, at least a
balance. Lyon is, after all, the capital of the French provinces,' says Mr
Barre - quoting Albert Thibaudet, the early 20th century literary critic.
He uses a similar argument to justify Lyon's claim for the bank against
other non-French candidates. 'All the centres of EC decision-making tend to
be concentrated in northern Europe. Since the enlargement of the EC to
include Spain and Portugal - economies with great potential - the south has
acquired a new importance. Lyon is exactly between north and south, and
belongs to both at the same time,' he says. Its close political and business
links with Barcelona, Milan and the powerful German region of Baden
Wurttemberg reinforce this claim.
Mr Barre is far too decent a man to knock the competition, but he argues,
nevertheless, that Lyon has important advantages over rival sites.
Frankfurt, home to the Bundesbank, poses an obvious political problem; there
would be a concentration of monetary power in German hands. Apart from that,
Mr Barre sees Amsterdam as the nearest competitor, because of its banking
industry and agreeable quality of life.
However, the Dutch city suffers from the disadvantage of a northern
position, which runs against the claim that the Euro-bank site should be at
the centre of gravity of the EC's political map.
Some would say that Lyon's campaign is a long shot, given the uncertainty
hanging over monetary union - and, therefore, the need for a European
central bank in the wake of the recent upheavals in the European Monetary
System. Mr Barre is undismayed. He is among those who believe it quite
possible that seven or eight European countries - Germany, Benelux, France
Spain and Italy - may switch to a single European currency towards the end
of the decade, leaving the rest to join the core of the new system later.
Whether Mr Barre's campaign succeeds or fails, it does underline a change in
French attitudes - the slight shift of power from Paris to the provinces
over the past 10 years.
'I am a great partisan of decentralisation,' says Mr Barre. 'But it is not
enough to create regions with powers when so much of the administration
remains concentrated in Paris.'

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Rhone-Alpes (10): Innovating is a tradition -
Grenoble buzzes with technology research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<TEXT>
GRENOBLE'S post-war transformation from obscure little French industrial
town to France's biggest technology research centre outside Paris is part
accident, part industrial planning by an active local government.
Its high-tech image was ruffled a few weeks ago with the publication of a
parliamentary report claiming that Grenoble might be unwitting host to a
Mafia network. This has provoked a firm denial from Mr Alain Carignon, the
town's RPR mayor and it promises to be a strong local theme in the run-up to
next month's parliamentary elections, in which Mr Carignon is planning a
return to national politics.
Underneath the pre-election alarms and excitements, Grenoble has reason to
be content with its lot.
At the end of the last war, Grenoble was 'a really mediocre, dull little
town, even a national joke,' explains Mr Joele de Leiris, deputy mayor and
university professor. 'On average, we have had one new big science
establishment coming to Grenoble every 10 years. Today, people tell us we
have too many. I can't agree,' he adds.
Today, Grenoble and the Isere departement of which it is the capital is host
to 250 laboratories and 8,500 researchers. It produces economic growth well
above the national average and has lower than average unemployment. It is a
fertile ground for a number of high prestige European technology projects
and electronic company investments, around which have sprung a vigorous
community of small high technology companies.
Isere produced 1,433 new companies in 1990 - the first year of the economic
slowdown, when unemployment stood at just at 8 per cent against a national
norm now two points higher.
Many of the start-up businesses founded by local executives, or spun off
from the research departments of Grenoble's four universities, have quickly
died. 'Too many of them have a product, but nothing else,' mourns Mr de
Leiris. But others have flourished, such as Cap Gemini Sogeti, founded
nearly 20 years ago in Grenoble by Serge Kampf and now Europe's largest
computer services company.
On a more modest scale, there are a flock of smaller successful start-ups
such as Atral, an alarm systems maker founded nine years ago by two former
executives of Merlin Gerin, the local electrical products group. Atral now
employs 200 people at Crolles, just outside Grenoble.
This solid base of skilled research workers and innovative companies has
acted as a magnet for large technology-based groups such as the US group
Hewlett Packard, which moved its world microcomputer heaquarters from
California to Grenoble two years ago, at the same time as Sun Microsystems
opened its international network computing centre there. The latest arrival
is Rank Xerox, the office equipment group.
These newcomers have helped to offset the job losses made over the past few
years by Bull and Thomson, the French state-owned computer and electronics
groups, which are both active in Grenoble.
The town owes its break with its industrial past in part to the influence of
one or two local decision makers - such as Louis Neel, the Nobel
prize-winning physicist who was posted there during the war, and the Merlin
family, founders of the Merlin Gerin electrical equipment group.
They were influential in persuading central government to set up the CNRS
national centre for scientific research in Grenoble just after the second
world war. This was followed, 10 years later, by the CENG nuclear research
centre, and joined, in the mid 1960s, by the Laue Langevin Franco-German
neutron laboratory.
The latest, scheduled to start operating later this year, is the
Synchrotron, the FFr2.2bn particle accelerator owned by 12 European
countries which is due to open to users next year.
'Here, within a radius of one or two kilometres, you have leading European
laboratories in a whole range of disciplines,' says Mr Yves Petroff,
director general. One of the things which made Grenoble attractive was the
city's willingness to pay for road access to the Synchrotron. 'Until
recently, Paris never gave money to technology. Grenoble has been doing it
for years,' says Mr Petroff.
This is where the town's tradition of several decades of active industrial
and economic planning comes in. The late Mr Hubert Dubedout, the Socialist
mayor for 18 years until 1983, and a former nuclear scientist, was another
pioneer who used his local government resources to help put Grenoble on the
map.
He was instrumental in attracting the 1968 winter Olympics - and the
infrastructure investment that came with it - as well as launching an
ambitious urban development programme, including one of the most efficient
public transport systems outside Paris.
But perhaps his most important policy was that of encouraging links between
scientific research and industry well ahead of other French towns.
Grenoble's showcase in this respect is the awkwardly named Zirst, a business
park which opened in 1973 on the twin principle that tenants must be vetted
by a scientific committee. In return for this, the finance for their
buildings is guaranteed by the departmental council.
The idea came not from Mr Dubedout, but from the mayor of Meylan, a commune
just outside Grenoble; it received full backing from the city. Zirst tenants
now include the Cnet, France Telecom's research centre, Merlin Gerin, and
Sema, the leading software group.
Mr Dubedout's successor at the town hall, the young Gaullist Mr Alain
Carignon, has continued in the same tradition. Under his tenure, the city
has funded university chairs - normally the domain of central government -
merged the area's disparate economic development organisations into a single
powerful body, Grenoble Isere Developpement.
He also launched the biggest public investment in the city for years: the
Europole business centre, next to the railway station (which is now less
than three hours from Paris, thanks to the opening of a direct Train a
Grande Vitesse (TGV) link last year.
The cost of all this activity has been a sharp increase in the city's debt.
Grenoble's financial problems, however, are mild by comparison with a city
like Angouleme, which has had to reschedule its debts.
Mr Carignon's team has trimmed away at Grenoble's borrowings - down to
FFr1.45bn last year from FFr1.7bn three years ago - with a programme of
privatisations (a growing trend in French local government) and spending
controls. Not for the first time, Grenoble is turning to innovative
solutions.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (4): Every variety
from Apple on display - The strategy of IBM's arch-rival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APPLE'S determination to plough its own furrow, away from the fertile fields
occupied by IBM PCs and their clones, rarely seemed as justified as it did
in 1992.
While IBM, its arch-rival in the world of personal computers, posted a loss
for the final quarter of Dollars 5.46bn, the highest ever in US corporate
history, Apple finished the year on a high note. Quarterly profits were
Dollars 161.3m on record sales of Dollars 2bn, close to the level made by
IBM's personal computer division. Sales of the Powerbook range of portable
computers alone were worth about Dollars 1bn in their first full year on the
market. The company's share price reflected the mood, almost doubling in the
second half of 1992.
One of the factors behind this performance has been an explosion in the
company's product range. By the end of this year, Apple will have launched
more products than ever before in a two-year period. New arrivals include
the Powerbook Duos - portable computers sold with adaptors that turn them
into desktop computers - colour screen versions of older models and
additions to a range of high-powered, high profit margin machines, the
Quadras.
This marketing-led proliferation of brands reflects the priorities of Mr
John Sculley, Apple's chairman and chief executive, who was recruited from
Pepsi-Cola in 1983 to replace the boffins who began the company in the
1970s. In spite of Mr Sculley's marketing credentials, the current brand-led
management philosophy is a more recent arrival.
'Two years ago there was a change of strategy,' says Ms Jane Burley, Apple's
UK regional group product marketing manager. 'From being a
middle-of-the-range desktop computer maker, we moved both upmarket with the
Quadras, and downmarket with the Classic and LC models.'
Since then, the upmarket Quadras have consolidated their position as the
first choice for design studios and publishers, with the help of some price
cuts. The move downmarket was largely a matter of cutting the prices of
older models. It culminated at the end of 1992 with the price of the
cheapest Apples falling below Pounds 400.
Although the approach boosted short-term finances, there have been problems
behind the scenes. The price cuts and wider range of products boosted sales
too much. Last quarter saw turnover 7.4 per cent higher than a year earlier,
but margins were eroded and profits fell 2.8 per cent. Still worse, the
company was unable to keep up with the demand for some of its products.
Potential buyers were turned away as demand outstripped the supply
especially of Powerbook portables and the budget models selling into the
Christmas market.
The price of the bottom-of-the-range Classic has now risen again and the
company is busy mollifying frustrated customers.
Apple's financial performance, especially compared with other computer
hardware suppliers, has also distracted from the fact that the company faces
an ever-growing challenge on the software front from Microsoft's Windows
programmes.
Like Apple software, Windows uses striking graphics to appeal to
non-technical buyers. This is more than a matter of pretty packaging: when a
computer is easy to use, employers have to pay less for technical help. A
survey by market research company Gartner Group shows how expensive it can
be to assist the users of unfriendly computers. The cost of owning personal
computers based on the old IBM personal computer software, DOS, is one
quarter higher than using Windows on a similar computer and 50 per cent more
expensive than Apple.
Much of the history of Apple has been about the battle between such
technical advantages of its software and the marketing of microchip power by
IBM and its sales-driven followers such as Dell and Compaq. The arrival of
Windows represents a recognition by Apple's rivals that software is as much
part of marketing a computer as the model number of its microprocessor.
Apple's response has been twofold. In the first instance it has established
a set of alliances with IBM itself. The aim is to share the costs of
developing the building blocks of the next generation of personal computers.
The ventures include Taligent in software more suited to screen graphics,
and a tie-up with electronics company Motorola to build a more efficient
kind of microchip using the 'reduced instruction set computing', or Risc,
approach.
The second response is to try to take the friendliness of its technology to
new heights. It is driving hard into a new area of computing called
'multimedia' in which text, moving pictures and sound all form part of the
application.
More dramatic still is its proposed Newton computer, designed to accept
handwriting instead of typed-in words and commands. The company has signed
alliances with Japanese electronics companies Hitachi and Sharp to develop
products associated with the Newton.
These ideas have immediate appeal, but Apple is not alone in its efforts. At
least one company, Dauphin Technology of Illinois, has announced a Dollars
2,500 computer that it says will compete with the Newton. And last month IBM
itself set up a venture in multimedia on which it promised to invest 'tens
of millions of dollars'.
Apple's world is a fertile one and it has in recent months reaped some of
its rewards. But the computer industry moves quickly and for Apple to
maintain the momentum it gained in 1992, multimedia and the Newton must
succeed.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (5): Game of
prevention - Michael Dempsey examines security packages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPUTER games are a serious business. Playing one on a portable computer
cost a Birmingham Midshires Building Society salesman his job last year. The
society insists that its employees avoid exposing its computers to any risk
of a virus. And computer games are a prime source of damaging bugs.
Introducing one is regarded as a breach of contract.
Birmingham Midshires uses NCR/AT&amp;T Safari portable computers to sell life
insurance and mortgages to potential buyers at home. The portable gives its
salesforce the means to calculate and demonstrate mortgages and pension
packages. This accelerates the sales process, but leaves the sales staff
holding sensitive data on a machine that attracts thieves. And any bug on
the software could infect branch computers when sales data is fed down the
network.
The building society has spent Pounds 300,000 issuing its 90 salesmen with
the machines and associated software, notably a security package from Fifth
Generation Systems called Safe. Three portables have been stolen in the last
12 months. The object of Safe, which evolved from a product called Triumph,
is to make sure the thieves are left holding an attractive but useless piece
of hardware.
'Safe is a package that makes our data totally secure, you put the sensitive
data on the hard disk and you can't access it without going through three
levels of password,' says Mr John Edkins, who is manager of business
improvement at Birmingham Midshires. Provided his staff follow the rules, no
thief will benefit from confidential information provided to Birmingham
Midshires. A stolen portable can be used again - but only by installing a
new hard disk.
Safe also limits how far unapproved software, notably games, can go on the
portable. A game can be played, but only if loaded with its own
disk-operating system. Only head office has the ability to copy software
from the A drive to the C drive of the hard disk. Software is copied from a
central computer via a modem at branch offices.
The society's employees are not issued with disks. This reduces the danger
of contamination by computer virus. And the copying limitations make it
difficult for a member of staff to copy client lists before giving notice.
If these security precautions sound unflattering to Birmingham Midshires
staff, there are significant compensations from using a portable PC. The
technology dispenses with the need to heave books of life insurance and
mortgage rates from door to door. Administrative work at branch office is
reduced to downloading software via the modem. This leaves the salesforce
free to concentrate on selling.
'The sales people like it and the clients are very positive. We've had some
clients take over the PC and enter their own details.' Mr Edkins is
convinced the portables have paid their way. 'Perhaps 30 per cent of sales
are now attributed to the technology. At around Pounds 3,000 a machine, one
extra mortgage sold will pay back the value of the system.'
One company that relies on portables and knows the reality of the virus
threat is Reflex Magnetics. Reflex is a media duplication house, supplying
disks and tapes across the computer services sector. Mr Andy Campbell, the
sales director, works entirely from a portable. With master disks arriving
by the dozen to be mass-replicated, he has always been aware of the danger.
Nevertheless, the company eventually did load a virus by accident. It was
uncovered and dealt with during testing, but the incident made an
impression. Once bitten, Reflex decided to write its own security program.
Most virus incidents can be traced back to the floppy disk, Mr Campbell
says. 'So we came up with a product that forces us to check any disk before
it is loaded.' Disknet costs Pounds 89 and will not allow the user access to
the hard disk unless his floppy has been cleared for bugs by virus-scanning
software. The correct password must also be entered. The A drive can still
employed, but data held on the hard disk is protected.
Mr Campbell is pragmatic about the extent to which Disknet can guarantee
security. 'Any security device can be cracked if you have enough knowledge
and time. Our technical director does his development work on a portable. If
a commercial rival targeted and stole that machine they would get past
Disknet.' There is clearly only so much you can expect from a security
package. But Disknet is robust enough to be ordered by the RAF and financial
services group HFC.
Physical protection through programs like Safe and Disknet needs to be
accompanied by security practices. Marlborough Stirling Group writes
financial systems for use on portable computers. Mr Jim Deane, MSG's
technical director, recommends pulling data back on to a branch computer at
every opportunity. This is known as docking, and reduces the client's
exposure to staff defecting with valuable files.
The incentive for field sales personnel to co-operate with docking is that
it speeds up the processing of a new policy or product.
The pharmaceuticals arm of ICI, recently re-named Zeneca, issues its
salesforce with Sanyo 386 portables. The machine comes with a removable hard
disk and ICI adds its own security software. But that is not considered
enough. ICI issues internal guidelines on the security of information,
dividing it into what can be carried off-site and what can be held on a
laptop.
'You're in the game of prevention,' says Mr Graham Burton, information
systems manager at ICI/Zeneca. 'You should prevent sensitive information
beng put on portables in the first place.' He acknowledges that this places
a limitation on the use of the system, but that is a price he is willing to
pay.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Rhone-Alpes (3): Slow-down takes effect - David
Buchan assesses the region's industrial prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC slowdown generally comes late to the Rhone-Alpes, because the
region has so many successful industrial firms, with diversified products
and markets.
But come it has, says Mr Etienne Subra, regional director of the Banque de
France. Unemployment rose by 10 per cent during 1992. Mr Subra dates the
downturn to last May-June, after domestic demand began to fall but before
defence of the franc pushed real interest rates still higher. Again, the
fall-off in export orders from Germany, Italy, the UK and Spain began before
the currencies of the latter three countries depreciated against the franc
in September.
The depressing effect on the region's industry has been widespread, though
Mr Subra reports that the food, glass-making, pharmacy and some parts of the
textile sectors held up well through 1992, and says the improvement in the
US economy is leading to more orders for the region's chemicals, capital
equipment and aeronautic exports.
The one real black spot, as elsewhere, is the property market. This is 'very
bad,' says Mr Subra; Lyon now harbours 18 months' worth of unsold or unlet
office space and 2 years' worth of residential real estate.
Part of the rise in the region's unemployed (threatening, for the first
time, qualified middle management on permanent payrolls), is attributable to
company managers' fast reaction. 'It is not that the bosses are turning to
redundancies as a first resort when orders start to fall,' says Mr Subra.
'It is just that they are much quicker to run through the whole gamut of
austerity measures - reining in general costs, cutting down on stocks and
inventories and, lastly, making redundancies - than they used to be'.
The financial as distinct from the human consequences of this more active
management style is the greater soundness of Rhone-Alpes companies; by the
end of 1991 they had reduced their total debt to the level of their own
funds and equity.
Over the longer term Rhone-Alpes can count on the natural advantages of its
central location to attract investment, domestic and foreign. Mr Jean
Chemain, director of the Lyon chamber of commerce, believes that
Switzerland's obtuse rejection in December of the European Economic Area
(EEA) treaty can only benefit Rhone-Alpes, as Swiss companies move
investment westward to give themselves a base within the EC single market.
Mr Phillipe Brossette, marketing director of Renault VI, the car group's
truck-making arm, lists Lyon's advantages, which include good road and rail
(TGV) links and direct flights to most European capitals (four times daily
to London).
These are just the sort of geographical merits which have made Mr Michel
Coste, head of Lyon's Institute for the Ecu, a persistent champion of the
city for the suggested European central bank. Mr Coste notes with delight
that, against an EC majority preference for locating it in Bonn, the UK
presidency touted Lyon at the EC summit at Edinburgh.
But it is history, rather than geography, which has attracted to the region
the two biggest employers: Renault VI and Rhone-Poulenc.
Renault VI was formed out of the 1978 merger between Renault's (smaller)
truck subsidiary Saviem and the (larger) independent Berliet company. The
merged company made its headquarters round the Berliet operation in Lyon;
far more extensive than Saviem's assets, and bringing with it 600 hectares
of prime industrial land in the adjacent Lyon suburbs of St Priest and
Venissieux. (Renault still grows maize on some of this land - until such
time as its factories expand further.)
Lyon is also the home of many of Renault's best clients, such as the
trucking firm of Mr Norbert Dentresangle who, since he made his start taking
apples to the UK, has built up a fleet of 2,400 vehicles.
Today Renault VI - part-owned by Volvo - is third in Europe and the world.
In 1991 it churned out 58,638 trucks in Europe and, through its wholly-owned
Mack subsidiary, 13,229 in the US.
For several years Renault VI's European market was better than the US one
(the two almost cancelled each other out in the 1991 after-tax profits,
which showed a FFrs 23m profit). Now the new world is being asked to redress
imbalance in the old world. 'But the problem is that the European market is
getting worse - truck output in France falling from 52,000 in 1990 to 35,000
last year - faster than the US market is getting better.'
Renault VI is now demanding of its suppliers something of the same
specialisation it has forced on itself. Just as each Renault factory in the
Rhone Alpes region focuses on a single activity - truck assembly (above 18
tonnes) at Bourg-en-Bresse, gearboxes in St Etienne Boutheon, motors at St
Priest/Venissieux, bus assembly at Annonay - so it is asking its suppliers
to concentrate more on its needs.
Its aim is to reduce by two thirds its existing 1,500 subcontractors, which
range from Bosh in Germany, to Lucas-Girling disk brakes in the UK to a host
of smaller suppliers in the Rhone-Alpes region.
Part of this reduction is to have a closer, Japanese-style partnership with
a larger and more capable brand of subcontractor. By contrast,
Rhone-Poulenc, the region's top employer, has scattered 16,500 local
employees across Rhone-Alpes in 16 factories, 14 technical and commercial
centres and six research units.
Chemicals have become something of a Rhone-Alpes speciality, with
Elf-Acquitaine, Atocem, Lafarge Coppe, Roussel-Uclaf and ICI all attracted
by abundant water, energy and opportunity to trade basic chemicals among
each other.
Inevitably, Rhone-Poulenc has come under local pressure to clean up its
local act. 'We don't deny the necessity of doing this,' says Mr Xavier
Patrouillard, the chemical group's Rhone-Alpes co-ordinator, 'but we do
sometimes contest the deadlines by which we are forced to make urgent
investments at very high prices, leaving less money for other projects. The
Rhone may be cleaner, but there is perhaps more unemployment.'
He concedes that Rhone Poulenc has an image to redress. 'Twenty years ago,
if you worked for Rhone Poulenc, people thought that was fantastic. No
longer.' But Mr Patrouillard believes the times may be changing. One reason
for this is the economic climate, creating greater awareness of the
opportunity costs of channelling very large amounts of money into the
environment. Another reason is that the Lyonnais now know 'that their city
pollutes the Rhone more than we do'.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Rhone-Alpes (5): Risky flagship - William Dawkins
takes a close look at three important industries in the region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FUTURISTIC blue steel and glass building, glittering at the foot of the
snow-capped peaks that ring the Gresivaudan valley near Grenoble, is the
latest site for the flagship of the French and Italian semiconductor
industries.
SGS-Thomson, the microchip maker jointly owned by French and Italian state
interests, will start production in the spring. Its Dollars 700m plant is
one of the world's most modern semiconductor facilities and one of the most
important high technology projects the Rhone-Alpes region has ever hosted.
As a consumer of power and services it will have a significant impact on the
local economy.
It was Grenoble city hall's fierce lobbying which contributed, first, to the
merger of France's and Italy's state-owned computer groups in 1987, and then
to the merged company's decision to choose a flagship site near Grenoble -
rather than the group's Italian headquarters near Milan.
The plant, near the village of Crolles, costs Dollars 100,000 a day to run.
'With overheads like that, we cannot afford to run idle, so the existence of
potential equipment suppliers in the region has been important to us,'
explains Mike Thompson, director of the centre.
Some suppliers have set up in Grenoble, or expanded there specifically to
sell to SGS-Thomson - such as Lam Research and Applied Materials, two US
semiconductor equipment suppliers, and Metron, a UK distributor of
semiconductor equipment; examples of how existing high technology projects
have acted as a magnet to new investment.
SGS-Thomson itself is not a significant employer: 184 staff are expected to
be in post by the end of this year. Fifty more will come from France
Telecom, whose research division contributed half the Dollars 200m start-up
cost, and a further 30 from Philips, the Dutch electronics group which is a
research partner of SGS-Thomson.
However, SGS-Thomson's presence is expected to attract other international
technology projects - which is why the local economic development body,
Alpes-Gresivaudan Developpement, has kept a neighbouring industrial site
empty, says Marie-Claude Dupuy, the organisation's secretary general.
Grenoble has all the more reason to thank its lucky stars that this prestige
project has come off: until recently SGS-Thomson's very future was
uncertain; Grenoble could have ended up with a white elephant rather than an
electronic flagship on its doorstep.
SGS-Thomson was Dollars 102m in the red in 1991, the latest in a string of
heavy losses caused by the huge investment demands needed to keep pace with
technology at a time of intense price competition from the US and Japan.
The Italian government, in the face of French persuasion, hesitated for many
months over pumping badly needed fresh capital into the group. Late last
year it changed its mind, paving the way for a Dollars 1bn capital increase
from both governments. The first Dollars 500m is expected to be disbursed in
the next few months.
The Italian administration was probably encouraged by evidence of recovery
in SGS-Thomson's fortunes. The group managed a Dollars 3m profit increase
last year (on sales up 12 per cent - well ahead of the 9 per cent growth in
its markets) to Dollars 1.6bn, officials say.
It is too early to say whether SGS-Thomson has completely turned the corner
in its high-risk industry, but the white suited technicians padding around
the Crolles clean rooms assume they are there to stay. Even Mr Thompson, a
Scot who used to work at Inmos, the Scottish semiconductor maker taken over
by SGS-Thomson, has started to learn French.

RANK XEROX has just announced that it has chosen Grenoble for its European
research centre, to open in the second half of this year.
'It has all the elements we are looking for, with its university, research
centres, computer industry and small dynamic companies,' says Mr Herve
Gallaire, the group's European research director.
Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French industry minister, greeted the move as
an example of 'the snowball effect' which has been created by the presence
of Grenoble's multitude of laboratories and research bodies.
Rank Xerox plans to employ 150 researchers on an annual budget of Ecu15m by
the time the centre is up to full steam, towards 1996. Grenoble won the Rank
Xerox investment in competition against rival offers from Italy, Spain, and
Germany - and southern France, from the Sophia Antipolis high tech business
park near Nice.
The French government and local authorities will cover about 10 per cent of
the initial investment during the first two years, in line with aid
available from the rival sites. However, the deciding factor was Grenoble's
pool of skilled research workers - including the fact that it produces 20
per cent of all French PhD students in information technology.
The centre will study automatic translation and assisted translation of
computer documents. The aim is to design products to reduce the 8 per cent
of total spending that the average company spends on creating and handling
documents, says Mr Gallaire.
The group also hopes to pass development contracts to some high technology
companies grouped around Grenoble.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Rhone-Alpes (2): Self help shines out - St Etienne
expects to ride out hard times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM THE air St Etienne looks like one big industrial site. The stephanois
('Etienne' is French for 'Stephen') are proud of that: even their vaunted
museum of modern art has been deliberately made to look like a factory.
All those shining new pieces you see on St Etienne's industrial checkerboard
are not what the first-time visitor expects to see. In the 1960s-1980s St
Etienne was synonymous with industrial decline. It is still the object of
eye-rolling, cosmopolitan derision from the nearby citizens of Lyon. Yet
most stephanois seem much more confident than the Lyonnais about their
city's ability to weather today's economic hard times.
Mr Bruno Roux, the city's economic development director, says this relative
buoyancy stems from 'the feeling that as we have suffered a good half dozen
crises since the 1960s and come through, we will do so again'.
St Etienne lost 30,000 jobs when the mines closed, 25,000 jobs when the
steel mills shut down, and 15,000 when its mainstream textile sector
declined. Overall, the city lost some 80,000 traditional manufacturing jobs.
But it has replaced all but about 20,000 of these by means of a very active
industrial policy which has successfully encouraged a larger number of
smaller companies to diversify. At 11 per cent, the city's unemployment rate
is over France's 10.4 per cent national average, but the gap is tiny
compared to the five point spread that existed in the mid-1980s.
Although nearly one in every three employed stephanois works in industry,
the city feels better able to ride out the present austerity. 'We do not
even really have a property crisis like other cities do in the office
sector, because we don't have offices,' Mr Francois Dubanchet, the bulky
Christian Democrat mayor, says with almost blue-collar pride.
But the city's drive to re-industrialise itself has been an expensive
gamble.
It has spent FFrs 1.5bn, with only about a third coming in national/EC aid
from Paris and Brussels. Because French cities are forbidden (probably
rightly) to subsidise companies directly, St Etienne has worked mainly
through real estate. Much of its FFrs 2.8bn debt comes from reconverting old
industrial properties, and selling or renting them cheaply to new companies
wanting to invest or existing ones wanting to expand, sometimes even before
having any idea of who might occupy the new buildings. On its 'Technopole'
site, it has also made available low-rent offices for up to two years to
companies just starting up.
The mayor and his officials are convinced that their gamble has paid off. Mr
Dubanchet says St Etienne's financial problems have more to do with some 500
functionaries unnecessarily hired by his communist predecessor. He adds that
recipients of municipal aid (which can include temporary exemption from the
taxe professionelle payroll tax) are now selected with greater care. But he
says that only 2-3 per cent of the 400 companies which have received public
aid have, in one way or another, failed.
One windfall has come from the south. Some Italian companies, such as Ratti,
which prints on silk, have long been present in the city. But the last two
years have seen a small flood of new Italian investment. This includes
Siccma, which makes office partitions and cupboards, Molemab, which makes
abrasives, and Viero, which manufactures silk weaving machines. These
investments account for one third of all Italian industrial investment in
France during this period (excluding Mafia investment in the Cote d'Azur).
Most of the reasons given for moving north arise more from frustration at
home than the lure of St Etienne itself, says Mr Roux. Such frustrations
include higher wage and electricity costs in northern Italy, environmental
constraints on building new plants in crowded Lombardy and Piedmont, and
complaints about tax money disappearing into the Mezzogiorno maw. But no one
in St Etienne is complaining about this new Italian emigration.
St Etienne is also trying to give its annual commercial fair more of an
international flavour, says Mr Andre Locquet, its director (who also heads
GST Alcatel, an exporter of telecommunications equipment from St Etienne to,
for example, Prague). Besides inviting twinned cities such as Coventry in
the UK or Hupperthal in Germany to participate, the fair organisers now plan
regular exhibitions from neighbouring European countries, to dilute what is
otherwise a purely national, not to say, regional event each September.
Most of St Etienne's diversification is home-grown. Some traditional
activities have returned; Houles has moved all its ribbon-making and
embroidery business back from Paris. And gun-making continues - though on a
more artisan scale than bankrupt Manufrance, whose Fauriel site is now being
redeveloped into a multi-purpose civic centre.
But luring top class management from Paris to St Etienne is a problem for a
company such as Casino, France's second biggest retailer, with a FFrs 60bn
turnover. It has outgrown its stephanois origins.
Mr Antoine Guichard, grandson of its founder, the current president, makes
no bones about the impossibility of running from St Etienne an international
company with holdings in the US and a growing alliance with Argyll in the UK
and Ahold in Holland. 'All board meetings take place in Paris, and we have
to run two corporate jets, which cost a lot.' What about the TGV train?
'Only taken it once, when there was an air controllers' strike,' Mr Guichard
replies dismissively.
Casino's boss is far from being St Etienne's Citizen Kane, but there is a
certain imbalance of power between the company and the city. Casino is chief
sponsor of St Etienne's art museum, theatre,and football team (whose
'Geoffroy Guichard' stadium will host one of the 1998 World Cup games). But
only 2,000 of Casino's 58,000 employees work in St. Etienne. One false move
 -perhaps one tax increase too many - could prompt the giant retailer to
shift its headquarters elsewhere.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Rhone-Alpes (6): Sponsorship thinks big
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPOLE, Grenoble's biggest property development since the town hosted the
1968 winter Olympics, is an example of how it has used decentralisation to
seize the initiative in its own affairs.
Mr Alain Carignon, Grenoble's young Gaullist mayor, launched the project
four years ago, making use of the new planning permission powers granted to
town councils - powers which were previously the domain of central
government. At the time, the Europole site was a wasteland of redundant
industrial buildings and railway goods yards; a blight at the heart of one
of France's fastest growing towns.
Today the site boasts a business school, a hotel and more than 25,000 square
metres of prime office space. Next month will see the opening of another
hotel, to be followed by a conference and exhibition centre grouped round
the Place Robert Schuman - aptly named, after a founding father of the
European Community.
Europole is typical of the many hundreds of prestige property development
sponsored by town councils across France in the wake of decentralisation.
However, unlike some of the others, it has not brought its city sponsor to
near-bankruptcy.
Grenoble has carefully limited its part in the project, set up as a city
hall majority-controlled joint venture with French banks and construction
companies.
City funds have put up FFr340m for the cost of acquiring land from the SNCF
railway board and providing the supporting infrastructure. It has been up to
the private sector partners to pay for the construction - and find tenants.
Despite the property market crisis, Europole has found tenants for 90 per
cent of the space so far completed in the scheme. This is well above the
average occupancy rate for office property in Grenoble, says Mr Christian
Abel, who is the deputy managing director for the Europole project.
The decline in demand for property, however, has brought one potential cloud
to Europole's horizon. No firm tenants have yet been found for a 13,000
square metre office block, part of the project which is due for completion
in September of this year. 'For the moment, Europole has escaped the
property crisis. But we are worried because our potential clients are
worried,' admits Mr Abel.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (20): IBM poised
to compete - Personal Digital Assistants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LETTICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POINT about the computer of the future is that it is a phone. For the
past 10 years the computer industry has been trying to sell computers to
people who do not buy them. The sticking point has always been that people
buy applications, not computers. There is no single application that the
buyer who does not need a spreadsheet, database, word processor or
games-playing machine views as a 'must'. So enter the Personal Digital
Assistant (PDA), the phone, the entirely different model.
Apple fired the first shot in the PDA wars about a year ago, announcing its
Newton device would be on the way, but it looks as if the industrial muscle
of IBM and AT&amp;T will make the running.
Starting from the premise that the basic components of a computer - CPU,
memory, screen and credit card expansion - can be boiled down into a
cellphone-sized package, those companies can then work out sets of
applications for them.
Mr Paul Mugge, head of Entry Systems Technology, IBM's R&amp;D division, at Boca
Raton, Florida, thinks of these as 'personality' modules. A credit
card-sized wireless modem, for example, could be slotted in and used by a
student to download information from the college library. Games modules
could be fitted to turn it into a games machine, or it could be a portable
TV or personal entertainment system.
All of these could theoretically use a wireless modem - if it's a TV, for
example, one might just download films from the local video library.
Mr Mugge goes as far as to paint a picture of a 'virtual mall' where an
entire computer-generated model of a shopping mall could be used by any
number of people with any number of PDAs.
His problem, however, is that he has to make at least some of these goals
achievable by the end of the year, launching and selling what will probably
be small quantities of PDAs into a definable market.
AT&amp;T sees the PDA market as eventually being in the billions, 'basically the
number of telephone handsets in the world if we're being modest, and the
number of people in the world if we're not', and Mr Mugge himself accepts
that for his dreams to come true, units have to sell at consumer prices, say
Dollars 99 or Pounds 99, depending on which side of the Atlantic you're on.
IBM spokesmen, however, speak of a substantially higher initial price, the
Pounds 500-Pounds 1,000 being basically dictated by prices in the cellphone
market, which is probably the PDA's first achievable target.
The first IBM demonstration units indicate the type of machine that the
company intends to test this summer. They are slightly larger and heavier
than the current generation cellphones, but are of similar shape. Rather
than a keypad or keyboard, they have a touch-screen and pen combination
which allows different key or number layouts to be used, and also gives the
computer-phone some note-taking capabilities.
Instead of the new generation operating systems, such as Go's PenPoint,
Microsoft's Pen Windows or IBM's own pen extensions to OS/2, they use a
custom version of the PC-DOS operating system that has been running on
desktop PCs for 10 years.
Mr Lee Reiswig, IBM software president, sees DOS - which was developed to
run on low-power computers - as the operating system to be used on machines
with limited power, and IBM's PDA is one of the first examples in that kind
of setting. Although its basic system is DOS, the machine uses what is
described as a 'custom shell' sitting on top, and users need never see the
systems that lie underneath.
In this way, IBM should have a chance of establishing itself in the
cellphone market, by offering basic phone services plus smart messaging,
computer communications, notepad and personal organiser functions. As the
cellular market itself grows out of its niche, PDA suppliers should be able
to grow with, or even ahead of, it.
Although IBM has historically been known for producing high-value machines,
the company now looks well-geared to exploit the market for low-cost,
hand-held devices.
Along with Intel, IBM runs the Robert Noyce Center research project in Boca
Raton. Its primary goal is to produce a super-integrated PC-on-a-chip based
on Intel's x86 processor. This will provide brains for the PDAs, which will
be compatible with current industry standards.
IBM is also one of the few substantial memory manufacturers outside south -
east Asia, and is investing heavily in the next generation, while it is also
one of the few western companies involved in developing flat panel colour
displays.
Heavy research in multimedia, together with its alliance with Apple, may not
have an effect on the first generation of IBM PDAs, but as the devices move
from high-price specialist business tools to low-cost consumer toys,
knowledge of how to handle sound and video will also become important.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (21): Tougher
times for pirates / A look at networks' hidden benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERSONAL COMPUTER networks look set to change forever the way that software
is sold and used. While networks offer computer users many big advantages,
there are also some hidden benefits for computer and software manufacturers
about which you will probably not hear so much.
To start with, PC networks give computer companies control over what is
being done with PC software throughout an office or department - and in
particular they restrict software piracy.
For years, it was common practice in many companies to buy a single copy of
a popular PC package such as WordPerfect or Lotus 1-2-3 and let a number of
users share it.
For as long, the software industry has been telling users that this was
illegal. It has tried to educate the business community about software
licensing and piracy issues. Now, the advent of widespread PC networking
gives it a chance to exert effective control over software use.
The breakthrough has been achieved by the introduction of 'network-aware'
versions of stand-alone PC software products. For example, a
network-configured version of a spreadsheet can identify the serial numbers
of all other versions of that software being used at the same time. If it
finds any other machine using a spreadsheet with the same serial number, it
will refuse to load.
Piracy prevention is not the major reason for producing network-aware
versions of software, but it is a useful by-product of the process. It is
also forcing software companies to look at how personal computer software is
sold. Traditionally, software companies would tell purchasers that they were
buying a single 'site-licence'. That licence would entitle the user to
operate the software on only one computer at any one time. It would be all
right to have one copy on your desktop computer and another on your portable
system - provided both were never in use at the same time.
But with the average 'serious' software application costing Dollars 300 to
Dollars 700, many companies found that buying enough software for everyone
who might want to use it was too expensive. In small companies many
individuals deliberately or inadvertently made single copies of software on
more PCs than they should.
The industry is aware that piracy is still widespread and that software
companies are missing out on sales. To combat the problem, companies such as
Microsoft are considering 'site licensing'. The theory is this: companies
which buy a copy of every product for every employee rarely have more than
60 per cent of that software in use at any one time. So they are paying for
more software than they need. Also, some may shy away from implementing a
given software solution altogether due to the cost.
According to Mr Mike Maples, Microsoft executive vice-president for
products, 'site licences' allow all users in a company to install the
Microsoft's Word for Windows word-processor on their PCs - but the company
would pay only 60 per cent of the cost of buying individual licences.
He says software companies would actually sell more product to corporate
customers and that piracy would decline dramatically if this were to become
widespread The software companies could also make money on sales of
additional documentation for extra users and on the supply of training
programmes - which have long been a source of strong profit for those that
conduct them .
These 'soft' solutions to the piracy problem are an improvement on
heavy-handed efforts such as the use of 'key' disks or hardware 'dongles'.
The key disk anti-piracy system required users to have a specially-encoded
floppy disk in the disk drive of their PCs when they wanted to use the
software. This arrangement was fine until you accidentally damaged or lost
the key disk - then you would be unable to use your software.
There have been similar problems with 'dongles' - which are anti-piracy
software devices on a chip. They operate by plugging into a PC's printer
port and send signals to the PC that the dongle is in place and the copy of
the software is legitimate. Dongles have, however, been known to interfere
with printing and are also easy to lose. Software reviewers despise them and
users have no great enthusiasm for them, either. But with improved
network-based control of software registration and an increased use of
site-licensing, neither dongles nor software protection look as if they have
a future.
Finally, it appears that even the US government wants to help end piracy.
Outgoing President George Bush signed an anti-piracy bill late last year
that imposed tougher fines and jail sentences on big-time software pirates.
Software pirating is now a felony - punishable by up to five years in prison
and Dollars 250,000 in fines - rather than a misdemeanour. And US
professional software associations hope that the new legislation will help
curb the estimated Dollars 1.2bn lost in revenues each year to software
piracy.
Although the software industry does not expect the Federal Bureau of
Investigation to leap to attention every time an individual PC user makes an
illegal back-up copy of software, the publicity being given to these changes
in piracy law should make big-time pirates think twice. . Combine that with
an ongoing legal assault on pirates and you have a powerful movement against
the illegal use of software.
Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and founder, says that he has teams of
people reading computer advertisements from small PC manufacturers all over
the country - and checking with the Microsoft contract department to ensure
that each one which offers the MS-DOS operating system with PCs actually has
a legitimate contract to have it supplied. If not, Mr Gates unleashes the
legal wolves.
So the message in all this is to be much more careful about the software you
put on your PC. The industry is out to get software pirates - and with huge
financial resources, and the backing of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
 -the pirates don't stand much of a chance.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (19): Pile the
small boxes high - Distribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LETTICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN IT comes to distrib- ution, the salient feature of the portable
computer sector at the moment is that there is no salient feature. The
construction of an average portable computer is now virtually as trivial a
task as the construction of an average desktop PC; the arrival of the
portable computer as a commodity means the departure of its ability to
command a greater margin than a desktop computer.
Traditionally the trade's ability to charge higher prices for, and therefore
make a greater margin on, portable computers has been dependent on the
expense of producing components that are smaller and use less power than
those that make up a desktop computer. The standard package that these
components have to be placed in has not, however, shrunk significantly in
the past 18 months or so, and the portable's place on the cutting edge of
technology has started to look shaky.
If the target box weighs around 6lb and takes up the same amount of desk
space as an A4 sheet, you don't actually need to make the hard disk smaller
than 2.5in, and if you have not yet made the next breakthrough in battery or
LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) technology, you cannot charge for it. In
effect, you could say that portable computing is between technologies.
The current basic issues in portable computer distribution are therefore
similar to those in the desktop market. The direct channel, typified by
small start-up companies specialising in off-the-page, low margin selling
sets the price for an increasingly experienced user base, while traditional
players react by cutting their own costs, perhaps stripping service out of
the basic machine price and selling it as an extra, and attempting to
segment the market by launching multiple ranges.
It is no accident that the low-cost ranges which Compaq and IBM produce for
the commodity market now tend to include portable computers. Essentially,
portables are now boxes, and the main difference is that, as they are
smaller boxes, you can pile them higher before you sell them cheap.
For other reasons, desktops are likely to become more like portables. The US
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Energy Star programme, for example, is
intended to trigger massive reductions in the power requirements of business
computers, and the technologies being used to do this are largely borrowed
from portable computing.
IBM's Energy Workstation prototype, for example, which was demonstrated in
the US last November, is intended to use a low-voltage processor, 'credit
card' storage and a colour LCD. Portable manufacturers can view flat-panel
colour displays as a differentiating factor for their machines, but it is
likely that environmental and health considerations will make them standard
on the desktop at around the same time as they become standard on portables,
and at that point one of the few differences between desktops and portables
will be the level of power management employed.
Because the battery life of a portable computer needs to be maximised, it
probably makes sense to incorporate clever circuitry that switches off parts
not being used. But it is the life of a desktop machine that has to be
maximised, so it probably does not make sense to have bits switching off in
between key-presses, because the machine will break a lot sooner. It is not,
however, clear how much users would be willing to pay for such an apparently
small piece of differentiation.
But there are areas associated with portable computing where differentiation
is still possible, because although the box itself has become trivial, the
way in which it links to the rest of the world is becoming more critical. If
it is now financially viable for a company to buy 2,000 portable computers
for its salesforce, it becomes absolutely vital that the company work out
how that salesforce uses those machines in the company network.
So the perceived value of the machine, and hence the margin, will be greater
if it uses some form of 'base station' of the sort recently introduced by
Apple, where the connections and expansion can be left on the office desk,
and the portable plugged in when it needs to be a 'desktop'.
Because most portables do not use standard expansion slots, manufacturers
which have spent money on developing internal fax modems and network
adaptors for their machines will again tend to be able to command higher
prices.
Theoretically, these advantages should erode, and some companies may give
one the impression that they had vanished already, but credit card
expansion, which will ultimately lead to new capability for both portable
and desktop machines, is not quite as finished as one might suppose.
Although there were numerous credit card-sized fax modems at Comdex, the US
computer show, last year, Mr Bill Goodwin, chairman of British developer
Communicate, claims his was one of the few that actually worked. Credit card
Ethernet and Token Ring adaptors are in a similar state of development, and
although Communicate finds that an increasing number of manufacturers rely
on the imminent arrival of credit cards, rather than pay to have their own
internal modems developed, credit card expansion slots are still not so
common, and when they are fitted are not necessarily of the type needed.
To be used for anything other than memory expansion, the slot has to be
PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) type 2 or
greater, while for larger peripherals such as credit card hard disks, the
double thickness PCMCIA type 3 is needed. No machines on the market use
this, but then there are no credit card hard disks on the market, either.
But although it is still possible for the channel to make money out of
portables by selling high value expansion, and the next generation of
'standard' portable expansion will also initially be able to command higher
prices, this new equipment is being designed specifically to sell as a
commodity, and should only be able to raise margins for a short period. By
switching to smaller format designs, dropping the weight of a notebook
computer by a few pounds as companies like Dell have recently done, and by
pushing into colour screens, manufacturers will have the ability to restart
the technological spiral.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (18): Technology
shift - Operating Software
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHIL MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE computer industry is preparing itself for one of its periodic technology
shifts. In the past these shifts were solely the result of fundamental
advances in hardware - the inventions of both the transistor and the
microprocessor are notable examples.
This time, however, the technology shift is the result of a fundamental
change in operating system software - the software which controls what goes
on 'under the covers' and provides the base for applications.
Improvements in user interface software and in telecommunications, and the
novel applications they can deliver, demand much more from operating systems
software than before. Nowadays they must not only control the internal
workings of the computer they dwell in, they must also take care of the
complexities of networks and be able to communicate with other systems.
The stability of the personal computer software industry is, therefore,
under threat. Microsoft's MS/DOS - with an estimated 150m users worldwide -
has dominated the PC industry for a decade and fought off every challenge.
But at the end of 1992 US networking software company Novell declared its
intent to take over the development of Unix, one of the two biggest
challengers to MS/DOS. Originally developed by AT&amp;T for minicomputers, Unix
has been widely adopted as the universal operating system for mid-range
computers - although it has, for some time, been touted as a possible
candidate to replace MS/DOS. Through the takeover of Unix Systems
Laboratories (USL), which was set up in 1991 to co-ordinate development of
Unix for the industry as a whole, Novell hopes to become the 'custodian' of
Unix and mount a serious challenge to Microsoft.
Novell hopes to do this by bringing Unix together with PC networks.
Novell is in a good position to achieve this. It has established itself as
the dominant supplier of networking software for personal computer local
area networks (LANS) with its Netware package. It claims to have about 70
per cent of this growing market and has itself beaten off a challenge from
Microsoft - which also has designs on this important market.
Novell's takeover has other implications - especially in the market for
corporate computer networks. USL also controls the development of an
important software product called Tuxedo - a package that can combine
traditional corporate transaction processing with personal computer
networking.
Novell's move has occurred at a time when the limitations of personal
computer software are becoming increasingly evident. Their lack, both of
system security and the robustness associated with operating software on
large computers, has led to close examination of operating system software
and what it might be required to do in the next decade.
If Novell combines its successful networking software with the virtues
offered by Unix and Tuxedo, it could outflank Microsoft.
It will certainly change the fate of Unix.
'We see Novell skewing development towards the integration of Unix with
networks,' says Paul McGuckin, a mid-range computing specialist at market
researchers Gartner Group.
'It will concentrate on the kernel, low-level operating software - at the
expense of the high-level stuff. This could mean that Unix vendors will have
to be more self-reliant as far as the high-end development is concerned,' Mr
McGuckin adds.
The technological intricacies of computer operating systems are generally
beyond most computer users. Unfortunately, the choice of an operating system
is as important as the choice of the computer hardware it runs on. Operating
systems organise the internal workings of a computer and, as a consequence,
they dictate what the computer can do and what applications software can be
used.
The MS/DOS PC launched by IBM a decade ago brought stability for the first
time and allowed the development of a wide range of applications.
The success of the graphical user interface (GUI) on the Apple Macintosh
prompted Microsoft to add the Windows GUI and make significant improvements
to the original software, but MS/DOS is still outdated and in need of
replacement.
Specifically, MS/DOS has failed to make any impact on the world of networked
systems - the area where Novell dominates.
The final result of the conflict is far from clear. Microsoft continues to
improve MS/DOS and is in the process of developing Windows/NT - an entirely
new contender. IBM continues to promote OS/2 with varying degrees of
success. And, the many versions of Unix - including AIX from IBM itself -
vie with each other for dominance.
Mr Brian McBride, IBM UK's AIX marketing director, sees Novell's takeover of
Unix as 'healthy' because it brings stability to Unix. 'We see it as a
different implementation that we can communicate with. None of use can
afford to lock each other out in a networked world and we are all being
driven to standards-based inter-operability.'
Mr McBride is confident about IBM's ability to integrate Unix, PC networks
and corporate computing - in addition to maintaining links with other
systems.
Where it could come into conflict with Novell, however, is in the area of
transaction processing and USL's Tuxedo - an increasingly important part of
the link between personal and corporate computing.
'You can link a DOS/PC into Unix systems with Tuxedo. It is an open
transaction processing system,' explains Ms Gillian Mogg Smith a consultant
at USL.
'Linking it with Novell is a separate issue. But we have already done much
work with Novell with the UnixWare development,' she adds.
Tuxedo dominates the open transaction processing market - but IBM is hot on
its heels. IBM's rival to USL's Tuxedo is a Unix-based version of its
25-year-old CICS teleprocessing package. Developed originally for
mainframe-based on-line processing, CICS is a well-established and mature
piece of software with about 33,000 principal sites across the world.
Last year IBM announced CICS/6000, a version which will run under AIX/Unix
and allow personal computers to act as 'client' terminals to an
enterprise-wide computer system. IBM has licensed CICS to Hewlett Packard,
which will build a 'reference' version to work on other manufacturers'
mid-range Unix systems.
According to the Gartner Group, this sector is set to expand rapidly in the
next three years. It says that the total market for mid-range transaction
processing was worth only Dollars 190m last year. By 1995 it will be worth
Dollars 3bn worldwide - with Tuxedo and CICS/6000 taking more than 50 per
cent of the market between them.
This is rich ground for a battle between IBM and Novell. It also seems
likely that Microsoft - while having no obvious plans to get into this area
 -will certainly be keeping an eye on it.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (17): The battle
to topple Intel - Chip Wars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BANKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEL jumped from third to the top of the world league of semiconductor
companies last year according to Dataquest, the market research company. Its
26 per cent (Dollars 1bn-plus) growth in revenues cut across the general
recessionary trends of the industry.
Interestingly, 1992 saw two other major US manufacturers, Motorola and Texas
Instruments, achieve significant growth (22 per cent and 11 per cent
respectively) compared to low single-figure growth, or even declines, by the
Japanese suppliers.
Across the board, the US suppliers' share of the world market grew by some 3
per cent, whereas the Japanese fell by nearly 4 per cent, giving the two
groups roughly equal shares in the marketplace.
The key drivers of this are linked: the growth in demand for high-powered
processors such as Intel's 486 device, and the rapid and widespread
acceptance of the portable PC as not only a low-powered, note-taking
addition to an existing desktop system, but as a computer in its own right.
All the leading portable PC manufacturers now offer high-powered,
fully-specified systems, often in a notebook form factor. Their popularity,
one of the few sales high spots in a lacklustre year for PC makers, has
driven the demand for the high-performance processors offered almost
exclusively by US suppliers.
This trend, however, increases the pressure on the dominant processor
supplier, Intel. Not only does it face stiff competition for its leading
desktop PC devices both in the marketplace and the law courts, but there are
also increasingly tough technological challenges as it seeks to service the
needs of portable and notebook PC users.
The competition comes from a growing number of sources. There is even
speculation that IBM, which lost nearly as much as Intel grossed, might join
the fray. It could be the dark horse of the semiconductor marketplace. IBM
is often claimed to be, in practice, the largest semiconductor manufacturer
in the world, and has significant rights to produce Intel-compatible
processors.
The most important area for competition now comes in two areas which can be
loosely defined as the 'present' and the 'future'. In the former, it is the
popularity of notebook PCs which is the driving force.
Here the rate at which the electronics consumes the power of the batteries
is of vital importance, and while much is being done in software to control
the utilisation of the circuitry, displays and disk drives, making devices
that consume less power in the first place is the high demand.
Intel is most threatened in this area, for others are joining it in
producing devices that operate at 3.3 volts, rather than the standard 5
volts. This one-third reduction in power consumption means a reciprocal
increase in battery life - a strong sales point for notebook manufacturers.
Even with 5-volt devices, any saving in consumption is vital. For example,
Intel introduced a low-power version of its popular 386 processor, the
386SL, some two years ago, but this has been beset with problems and has not
proved too popular with systems companies. One leading supplier, Toshiba,
recently went on record that it would utilise Advanced Micro Devices 386SX
processors because Intel could not match the power consumption
specification.
Intel has now switched its emphasis from the low-power 386 processor to the
low-power 486 marketplace, where it has a 3.3 volt 486SX processor available
and already being used in notebook systems from Toshiba and Texas
Instruments. The company is gambling this device will become the effective
'entry-level' specification for such systems.
Packing density is as crucial an element as consumption. Many other
suppliers, such as Cyrix and Chips and Technologies, offer notebook PC
manufacturers greater advantages by integrating more of the PC architecture
'glue' circuitry - the many components that surround the processor and
memory devices - on to a single chip together with the processor itself.
In the near term, Intel's success will hinge on its continued extension of
the technology. It has, for example, the next generation of its processor
family, the Pentium, (often referred to as the 586) due out shortly. Several
PC makers have already demonstrated systems running this device and it is
likely soon to appear in a high-end portable system as well.
Further in time comes the 'future' competition, in particular the new
generation of hand-held computer-telephone systems, Personal Digital
Assistants (PDAs).
The first company to declare a real interest in this market has been Apple
Computer, with its Newton product, based on a Reduced Instruction Set
Computer (Risc) chip from ARM, the UK company in which has a minority stake.
A more recent contender is Sharp, the Japanese consumer electronics and
computer giant. As yet, however, it is fair to say that both are dabbling
with the market to assess customer demand.
The potential, however, is huge, particularly if AT&amp;T, the US
telecommunication leader, is to be believed. The company's microelectronics
division recently launched the Hobbit processor chipset specifically to
address this market, predicted to account for 1bn units by the turn of the
century.
The objective is to create systems which combine personal pen computer,
cellular telephone, fax and a wide range of communication services such as
electronic mail into a single, hand-held personal unit.
This is an entirely new marketplace which Intel, and others that make
compatible chips, will not automatically dominate.
Indeed, the power required to manage these facilities points, as AT&amp;T has
found, to the use of Risc devices optimised for the job.
It is an opportunity which has not escaped the notice of IBM which, together
with its alliance partners Apple and Motorola, is already well advanced on
the design of a chip specifically for PDAs.
This will be a development of the new PowerPC processors from the partners,
the first example of which is now entering production. It will have a
significant potential advantage for corporate users, for it is planned to be
code-compatible with all other versions of the PowerPC family. This will
extend from desktop workstations to large enterprise network servers.
It is unlikely that Intel will ignore this new market opportunity,
especially as it could also offer similar levels of enterprise-wide
compatibility. It is, however, a market offering different technologies and
services, so it will be a new, level playing field on which it has to
compete.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (16): A general
purpose tool-box - Applications Software
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHIL MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APPLICATIONS software for personal computers is changing. The increased
power, mobility and ease-of-use of modern personal computers has stimulated
a new wave of software - in the form of a general-purpose tool-box. This
replaces the traditional idea that an application is a set of programs built
to suit a specific user.
At the same time, personal computer software is now required - and
increasingly able - to span different technology environments in terms of
hardware and operating systems software. This means the same software can be
used on different types of personal computer and even on powerful
workstations. Personal computers can also communicate with each other - and
with larger systems - to make use of shared resources such as laser printers
and centralised corporate databases.
Increasingly, a personal computer - whether on a desktop or on someone's lap
in an aeroplane - is a personal window into a corporate computer network.
This growing role for personal computers has put pressure on software
developers to build software which is flexible, adaptable and portable.
'We have to think about the tools we can build which will contribute to what
users want - particularly as they are becoming more mobile,' says Mr Paul
Bailey, European and international vice-president of leading software
developer Lotus Development.
'Mobile computers speak directly about personal productivity. But it goes
beyond that. You can dial up and connect to the network and the rest of the
company. And through electronic mail and workgroup systems like Lotus Notes,
you can work in new ways,' Mr Bailey continues.
It is also possible to build applications in new ways. Lotus Notes
applications, for example, grow from electronic mail infrastructure and a
set of tools which can be used both by the end user and by the systems
professional. The end user applies the tools to individual needs and
preferences - the professional developer extends the infrastructure to
provide more services and features.
Application software for personal computers has always differed from that
used on larger computers. The low costs of personal computer hardware and
the way it is used, meant that traditional ways of building applications
could never work.
They require lengthy analysis and design, rigorous testing and expensive
support. While this is still necessary for large-scale, corporate computing,
it is not cost-effective to build applications for personal computing in
this way.
Applications software for personal computers evolves organically, rather
than being cast in concrete like that used in larger computers. Personal
computing must take account of the personal and the best way to provide this
is to devise good tools which can be used to do many different things.
This concept began with the emergence of graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
like the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows. These environments provided
a standard framework which could be used to build many different types of
application and, more important, new types of tool.
'Many leading products - Lotus 1-2-3, Excel 4, Wordperfect - are now
available across Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows on the DOS PC,' says
Mr Nigel Turner, product manager at Apple UK.
'This means that users can mix-and-match their software and their computer
hardware. They can run the same applications and exchange data between the
two machines,' he adds.
The increased popularity of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) is a principal
force in the drive towards standardisation.
Not only have GUIs provided a common standard for user access and a better
way to exploit the power of personal computers, they have also helped
standardisation at increasingly high levels of software. An application
program built for the Apple Macintosh can be transported to a Windows
environment relatively easily. Although they are different environments,
both use a common set of functions to draw screens, control the mouse and
access data. These functions can be translated easily from one environment
to the other.
'A lot of DOS developers are finding the benefit of Windows - it brings them
broader market potential,' says Mr Turner.
It also brings advantages to the end user. There is no need to learn a new
set of controls for every new program - the instruction to print a document
is the same regardless of what type of document it is.
But GUIs are the tip of the iceberg. Behind the flashy graphics is a set of
standards for exchanging data between programs, access to standard 'drivers'
for screens, printers, scanners, and even ways to link data dynamically.
This is a powerful mechanism for building new style applications. A
spreadsheet table showing monthly sales figures can, for example, be
embedded in a word processor document - and updated automatically if there
are any changes in the table. An executive information system can extract
data from remote databases automatically and display the results as if they
had come from the local disk.
The disciplines of developing application software based on GUIs has led to
rapid standardisation of many aspects of software. And as personal computers
evolve into multimedia communications devices, this process is likely to
accelerate. 'Quicktime - the systems software which handles multimedia in
the Macintosh - will soon be available for Windows PCs too,' says Mr Turner.
This means that all types of data - video, audio, text and numbers - will
become interchangeable - if not identical in form. A video message recorded
on a Macintosh will be playable on a Windows-based personal computer.
This new form of computer communications demands different ways to create
applications and will stimulate development of new software tools.
'We increasingly view an application as a series of editors - ways to enter,
change and access data,' says Mr Bailey of Lotus.
'We need to provide an infrastructure - electronic mail, access to databases
 -and the tools to let users get at it and use it the way they want to,' he
adds.
There is no doubt that a great deal of progress has already been made and it
is not too hard to imagine a time, when personal computers will combine a
broad set of power tools which can be applied to all aspects of information
processing.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (15): This is the
year for colour systems - Desktop Publishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOMENTUM of desktop publishing (DTP) is being strongly maintained as
prices fall for high-performance personal computers, laser printers and
enhanced page-composition software.
Furthermore, new methods of colour creation for documents of all types are
exciting users right across the DTP spectrum.
As businesses large and small discover the almost endless range applications
for DTP - from brochures, sales catalogues and financial reports to colour
magazines, books and newspapers - there is a rising demand for
better-looking publications.
Countless publications in typewritten form are also becoming candidates for
DTP - 'for business, DTP has meant lower costs, more control and later
deadlines on a wide variety of printed materials,' says Emilia Knight,
Apple's publishing marketing manager.
Worldwide revenues for DTP software tools are likely to reach Dollars 369m
this year, rising by Dollars 100m in 1994 and reaching Dollars 663m by 1996,
according to forecasts by the International Data Corporation.
Much of the thrust of the DTP market has come from the US. Although Apple
Corporation, with its Macintosh computers, along with the Adobe Postscript
page description language, were founder companies of the industry, an
increasing number of other hardware and software companies are developing
their own market strategies for DTP.
Today, there are two main DTP markets. One, at the lower-end - what is
termed the personal or 'office DTP' sector, including in-house publishing to
promote its services or products. Then there is the high-end, professional
DTP market, described by Apple as 'DTP for profit.' This includes graphic
art services, newspaper, book and magazine production.
On the hardware front, the increasing power of PCs and portable computers is
good news for desktop publishers, especially with the move towards colour
systems which demand. At a starting point, the cost of a basic Apple DTP
system is under Pounds 2,500 with, say, an Apple Mac LCII computer, with 14
ins. colour monitor, (Pounds 1,099); Aldus Pagemaker software (Pounds 500);
and a personal LaserWriter for around Pounds 775. Five years ago, the cost
of a basic system might have been nearer Pounds 8,000.
Apple's new mid-range Mac II and Centris computers (prices range from Pounds
1,675 to Pounds 2,595) have systems built-in to support up to 256 colours in
the new 14 ins colour display - and can be easily upgraded to deliver 32,000
colours. Last month, Apple introduced its Colour Printer (Pounds 1,995) for
Mac-users wanting to use colour in everyday documents. It takes advantage of
ColorSync software's colour matching capabilities, ensuring that DTP users
achieve colour output that closely matches colours created on the computer's
display.
DTP technology has brought creators (writers, designers, editors,
illustrators and photographers) much closer to the production process, and
in many cases eliminated the need for a separate production step altogether,
says Jonathan Seybold, the DTP industry's guru.
The collision, eight years ago, between the computing and publishing began a
'revolution that turned the publishing industry upside down ..and spawned
desktop publishing,' according to Jonathon Seybold. The publishing
revolution is far from over, which means that training for new DTP entrants
continues to be an important issue, especially with the need for skills to
operate for colour images systems and other of new technologies.
While today's software with colourful icons and graphical user interfaces
(GUIs) help to reduce the DTP learning curve, training and consultancy
services are in demand from business users. Rank Xerox, with its philosophy
of 'total quality document,' offers a range of workshops for programs such
as PageMaker, Ventura and CorelDraw.
The reason that colour is the hot topic of the DTP world is that, until now,
the missing ingredient has been colour management systems.
While different devices, such as scanners, monitors and printers deliver
colour variations, software products - such as ColorSync from Apple - now
provide excellent matching facilities.
In the colour management arena, companies such as Kodak, Agfa, EFI
(Electronics For Imaging), Quark, Apple, Microsoft, Adobe and other
suppliers are planning strategies to make colour management the norm. There
is also wide interest in Kodak's new Photo CD system - a quick and
economical way to bring colour images to the desktop for business and
commercial imaging applications.
Photo CD allows DTP users to take 35mm colour pictures, scan them on to a
disk and retrieve them via a CD-ROM drive. High resolution pictures can then
be easily imported into documents. Linked with Photo CD is Kodak's new
PhotoEdge software which allows images on a PC to be modified in colour,
tone and shape.
Next to colour, the hottest area in computer publishing are the emerging
digital technologies able to deliver documents in a new form. For example,
users may wish to view only selected portions of documents, all stored
electronically.
In the fast-changing DTP world, specialist software, such as PageMaker and
Quark XPress have evolved beyond all recognition. For professional
page-layout systems in the UK, 53 per cent use Quark XPress and 23 per cent
use PageMaker, according to Ashdown, the strategic marketing consultancy.
Aldus has recently announced PageMaker 5.0 for Windows and Macintosh,
offering 100 new features and enhancements for professional DTP users.
In the Windows environment, Microsoft, in particular, is making ease-of-use
a strong feature. It has seen wide success among DTP entrants with the
'Microsoft Publisher' package.
Windows applications overtook sales of DOS applications in the UK in
November for the first time, according to Romtec, which forecasts a 25 per
cent share lead for Windows this year.
As technologies merge, there is growing interest in multimedia - the
computer-based medium which brings together text, high-resolution graphics,
The conversion of traditional media into a common digital format gives
multimedia its wide appeal. Apple, the leading supplier in this field, has
been providing hardware platforms for multimedia since 1985.
Microsoft, the developer of MS/DOS operating system and the Windows 3
graphical environment, has been involved in developing multimedia technology
on PCs since the mid-1980s. The conversion of traditional media into a
common digital format is what gives multimedia its wide appeal.
Meanwhile, interest is also being shown in publishing without paper - such
as electronic delivery, allowing rapid access to visually sophisticated
documents. Adobe's Acrobat software, for example, aims to solve the
transmission of these documents between incompatible computers.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (13): The global
area links may take a little while - Enterprise-Wide Networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ERA of stand-alone personal computers is over, but that of
enterprise-wide networks has not yet begun. How quickly the transition can
be achieved depends partly on developments in the software industry and
partly on how willing managements are to change their thinking.
Linking personal computers together to form local area networks has become
standard practice in the past few years, driven largely by a user rebellion
against slow service from central mainframe and minicomputer departments.
The typical LAN now joins together around 20 users and around a tenth of
LANs join as many as 250. By 1995 it is expected that half of all the
business PCs in the world will belong to such networks.
LANs were set up first to provide relatively simple applications such as
word processing, spreadsheets and electronic mail. As users increasingly
look for more quickly developed and more cost-effective corporate systems,
LANs are gradually being extended to take on more of the traditional data
processing functions, based on larger databases from leading suppliers such
as Oracle and ARK Ingres.
The era of stand-alone PCs has come and gone in little over a decade. But to
connect PC LANs to corporate systems to form wide area networks and
enterprise-wide or 'global area' networks, which will allow many thousands
of users to communicate, is a vastly more complicated matter.
Many firms have machines on different sites that are connected, but it is
one thing to be able to transfer simple files between them and another to
get complex applications running across several transport protocols.
Some of the network management problems involved in establishing
enterprise-wide systems are still unsolved and look unlikely to be solved
for several years. Processes such as the electronic distribution of new
versions of programs to thousands of users in remote sites are just only
beginning to be widespread. Security features remain weak and viruses
continue to pose a threat.
There are also outstanding technical questions about how best to connect
portable computers to corporate systems, using fax/modem cards or adaptor
devices.
In sum, large companies using systems from a wide range of suppliers may
face a 10-20-year migration from the stand-alone environment to the
enterprise-wide system. Mr Bruce Murrill, technical director of the Network
Management Forum, cautioned last year that the goal of managing
enterprise-wide networks was 'still some way off'.
So far, neither of the two leading PC operating system software companies,
Novell and Microsoft, has proved that it can fulfil all the necessary
functions for the task of controlling very large networks.
Microsoft has achieved a dominant position in single-user operating systems
with its DOS and Windows products. Novell has become the principal LAN
software supplier, with around 70 per cent of that market.
In the next few months, Novell will seek to consolidate its position with a
new version of its Netware product, while Microsoft will challenge it with a
new network operating system called Windows NT (New Technology). Many users
are delaying investment decisions until more is known about the capabilities
of these new products.
Last year, Novell launched a major move to broaden its operations by an
agreement to take over Unix System Labs from AT&amp;T. Ownership of USL will
give Novell control of the development of the Unix operating system.
Unix is the engine of most of the new range of smaller machines which have
been steadily taking over from mainframes and minicomputers in the past few
years.
This acquisition will therefore give Novell a central role in the evolution
of corporate systems and potentially the ability to integrate those
corporate systems with LANs.
Novell's plans for Unix remain a matter of speculation until the takeover
process is completed. However, there is a view in the industry that it will
seek to consolidate Unix as the vehicle for the next generation of systems
built on a client/server structure and to push it down onto personal
computers as a shrink-wrapped commodity product.
Mr Ben Smith, Novell's UK managing director, argues that users will benefit
by having Unix in the hands of a hardware- independent company. He says that
Novell intends to 'purify' Unix by reducing the number of variants in use.
However, Novell may now come into confrontation with Microsoft, which could
bring a new and potentially damaging conflict within the industry.
Microsoft's UK marketing manager for corporate network systems Ms Jack Fogg
says that there will inevitably be more direct competition between the two
companies because of their similar business strategies.
The opening shots in the battle have already been fired. Novell and the Unix
camp claim that very little is yet known about Windows NT and that users
have no reason to wait for it. Meanwhile, Microsoft has begun to argue that
Unix has design weaknesses and is seeking to show that many software
developers are switching their support from Unix to Windows NT.
Some industry experts consider that the main barriers to building effective
enterprise-wide networks are psychological rather than technological. They
say that most corporate networks are still badly managed, inefficient and
unreliable.
Mr Chris Yates, managing partner of telecommunications consultancy Newburn
Consulting and formerly of National Power, is a proponent of this view. In
his opinion '95 per cent of networking problems are managerial and only 5
per cent technical. Most business leaders are still not aware of how
dependent their business is on communications. They ought by now to be as
aware of information technology issues as they are of finance or
production.'
Ms Laura Lilyquist, European marketing manager for Sun Connect, Sun
Microsystems' networking business, also thinks the problem of building
global area networks is one of management education. 'Each vendor only owns
one piece of the problem,' she argues.
'Users may need software products from a dozen different sources to be able
to get machines to interact properly at the application level. But many of
them are still attuned to one-stop shopping for their computing and do not
take advantage of the range of choice of products available.'

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey uf Personal and Portable Computers (14): Quality
reaches all parts - Peripherals are being updated in line with personal
computers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST OF the personal computer industry's attention in recent years appears
to have focused on making PCs smaller, faster, cheaper and more powerful.
Equally aggressive efforts, however, have gone into doing the same for the
devices which users attach to their PCs - including printers, back-up
systems, scanners, network systems, external displays, modems, high-capacity
external storage systems and just about anything else you can imagine. The
most noticeable difference for most users has been in the quality and
variety of printers available for their PCs.
While impact technology - such as dot matrix and daisywheel - characterised
printer designs in the first half of the 1980s, higher-quality, non-impact
systems using laser and inkjet print engines now dominate the market. These
have been married with sophisticated 'page description languages' such as
Adobe PostScript and Hewlett-Packard's PCL5 to provide unprecedented
printing flexibility and quality.
This has given a large number of users the chance to produce almost-typeset
quality from their printers - as well as graphs, charts and diagrams that
would previously have to be produced by a commercial artist (or not at all).
Two other printer innovations which have had great impact in recent years
are the proliferation of colour printers and, more recently, portable
printers. The former have made personal computers credible pre-production
tools for professional colour publishing work, while portable printers have
made life a little easier for the growing army of those who carry their
computers around.
While printers have been improving the images that come out of a PC,
scanners have increased the range and quality of information that go into
them. Scanners allow users to 'photocopy' images onto the computer's hard
disk - so that they may be stored, edited and printed at any time. They are
vital to anyone involved in PC publishing work and, when combined with
optical character recognition software, allow users to have large amounts of
text on paper turned into editable word-processor files on the computer's
screen.
Colour and portability are also the two major areas of innovation in the
scanning world. Lower-cost colour scanners are coming into their own at the
moment - as are inexpensive ways of obtaining colour pictures in a form that
can be used by PCs.
One of the best examples of this is Kodak's new Photo CD process - which
allows standard 35mm films to be 'developed' onto a personal computer's
add-on CD-ROM optical disc. The images from that disc can then be treated as
any other scanned images - except they are of a far higher quality than most
users would be able to get from an affordable hand scanner.
That situation is not likely to exist for long, however, as the quality of
hand scanners is improving fast and the price is dropping just as quickly. A
number of good colour hand scanners - such as Logitech's ScanMan 256 - offer
the ability to scan images into a PC with support for up to 256 colours.
The great limitation to such devices, however, is that they can scan only a
certain portion of a standard A4 page at once. This means that you must
often do several scans and 'stitch' them together to get a complete page
into your computer.
Scanners and printers largely concern themselves with the business of
getting images or text in and out of your computer. A new range of computer
add-ons stretches the horizon of what you can get a PC to do for you.
These add-ons are called 'multimedia' peripherals - and generally include
sound cards, a CD-ROM, a microphone and external speakers. If used in an
operating environment that supports them properly, these extras enable you
to incorporate speech in on-screen presentations, use educational
applications that can play music and animated sequences on the computer -
and even standard audio CD music.
The real key to the success of multimedia, however, lies in the CD-ROM. This
variation on standard CD audio technology allows specially-encoded compact
discs to hold up to 600 Megabytes of data each - giving them six to eight
times the capacity of the average personal computer hard disk. That is why
increasing numbers of encyclopedia products are being offered on CD-ROM.
CD-ROM versions of encyclopedias can incorporate the voices of famous
people, digitised images of places, animated sequences explaining how
different technologies work - and lots of text that can easily be searched
by the computer and then printed out as needed. And, of course, they do not
weigh as much or require the death of many trees in their production
process.
Finally, there is the rebirth of the parallel port. For years, the parallel
(sometimes called Centronics) connector on the personal computer was used
only for hooking up printers - sending information from the computer to the
printer.
Recently, however, the parallel port has become the conduit for two-way data
traffic - and many developers have designed converters that turn parallel
printers into SCSI (Small Computer Systems Interface) connectors. SCSI is a
popular connection standard, supported by most manufacturers, allowing users
to hook up external hard disks, CD-ROMs, tape back-up systems and other
devices.
By using the parallel port as a SCSI connector, even the most humble
portable computer users will now have another way to hook up some very
powerful add-ons to their machines.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (3): The lean,
mean survivors - A price war epidemic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERSONAL computer price wars have broken out across Europe. During the
second half of 1992, the large established groups, such as Compaq,
Hewlett-Packard and IBM of the US and ICL of the UK, admitted PCs had become
commodity products.
The branded companies decided to take on the clone manufacturers at their
own game. Prices were slashed and low-price models launched. In the UK,
average prices for PCs using the 386SX chip fell nearly 30 per cent from
Pounds 2,074 to Pounds 1,479 between 1991 and 1992, according to Context,
the London-based market research company.
The situation is still deteriorating - at least for manufacturers, if not
consumers. Mr Bruce Sinclair, vice-president of Northern Europe for Dell
Computer, reckons the price of a 386 workstation has fallen by 50 per cent
to about Pounds 1,000 over the last 12 months, depending on configuration.
Infocorp Europe, the Paris-based market research group, expects prices to
fall 15 to 20 per cent during the first half of 1993.
Compaq led the way with the launch of its ProLinea PC range and its Contura
notebook computers. IBM followed with its ValuePoint range, as did
Hewlett-Packard.
The initial success of low-priced branded products surprised even the
companies involved.
Both Compaq and IBM were left with product shortages. At the end of the
year, Compaq still had two months of back orders to fill.
However, Ms Marye Tonnaire, industry analyst at Dataquest in Paris, says
once these early problems began to be overcome in the last quarter of last
year, the floodgates opened and prices tumbled even faster.
The price has driven volume growth. Dataquest estimates the European market
will have increased by 11 per cent last year, a reversal of the previous
four years which witnessed slowing growth rates.
Meanwhile, so-called no-name manufacturers such as Vobis in Germany and
Elonex in the UK have continued to do well.
In Europe, they increased their share of the market from 8.1 per cent to 9.1
per cent, according to Infocorp.
The switch for most of the groups from high-technology high-price companies
to high-technology low-price distribution has created an enormous culture
change. The price cuts have squeezed margins for the PC manufacturers.
Put simply, they launched cost-cutting initiatives. Dell Computer, for
example, launched a cost-containment drive during the second half of last
year called 'Cost-busters'.
'Anything that did not add value was cut,' says Mr Bruce Sinclair at Dell
Computer. 'Through the programme we reduced operating expenses from 20 per
cent of sales to 16 per cent of sales. Meanwhile we were doubling the number
of worldwide employees.'
Measures taken at Dell included changing the car policy so that not all
managers automatically had cars. Pay policies were changed so that the
salaries of 40 per cent of the workforce were linked to performance.
During the third quarter, salaries were frozen and employees offered 50
share options instead. Distribution costs are also being slashed. Dell
Computer has always sought to minimise its distribution costs through direct
selling. The company reckons 90 per cent of its European sales are through
internal channels.
It has also rationalised its logistics by centralising warehousing at
Limerick in Ireland, where its new plant is capable of configuring computers
for European local markets. This cuts down inventory in local markets.
'What is so encouraging about the last 12 months is that it shows the
established PC manufacturers are capable of change. They have become lean
and mean,' says Ms Tonnaire at Dataquest.
Meanwhile, European retailers are also having to adapt to the price wars.
The squeeze on margins sent at least 20 per cent of computer dealers out of
business last year.
Warehouse-style superstores are being set up in the UK in an effort to
emulate US practices. Whether these superstores are successful remains to be
seen.
Costs such as real estate and labour in Europe are equivalent to 20 per cent
of turnover compared with 8 per cent in the US.
As one PC manufacturer points out, costs in Sweden are rather different than
in Austin, Texas.
The full impact of the price wars on the structure of the industry is yet to
be determined, according to Dataquest. But some winners have emerged.
Compaq's share of the European market increased from 6.4 per cent to 8.5 per
cent between 1991 and 1992, according to Infocorp Europe.
Hewlett-Packard also improved from 1.7 to 2.4 per cent: it shipped as many
PCs in the last four months of 1992 as it did during the previous eight.
Meanwhile Dell's market share rose from 1.1 to 1.7 per cent. ICL, thanks to
its acquisition of Scandinavia's Nokia Data, rose from 1.8 to 2.8 per cent.
Vobis of Germany almost doubled its market share from 2.8 to 4.5 per cent.
Olivetti of Italy fell from 6.6 to 6.4 per cent and ZDS of France dropped
from 3.2 to 2.7 per cent. Toshiba, the specialist portable computer group,
had a tough year, but maintained its market leadership, although Compaq is
fast catching it up.
Infocorp Europe predicts the PC market will be polarised between the large
groups, capable of pushing down production costs through efficient
purchasing and economies of scale, while spreading marketing and
distribution costs over very large volumes. Small groups will continue to
maintain some competitive advantage, given their proximity to clients and
their flexibility and high service levels. It expects that many groups in
the middle ground will find it difficult to survive.
The companies that succeed will be those with a wide product mix that allows
them to address different vertical markets, says Ms Tonnaire at Dataquest.
Those that survive will also have to get their prices right and sort out
their logistics effectively.
'There will undoubtedly be a shake-out during 1993. Some companies will not
exist by the end of the year,' she says.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (2): Second fiddle
in the west - The Japanese challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE context of global PC markets, Japanese manufacturers have generally
had to play second fiddle.
In contrast to their position in their own domestic market, where Japanese
manufacturers have been able to keep a tight hold on consumers, their
presence overseas has been singularly unimpressive.
'The reason why Japanese manufacturers are not doing so well in the US and
Europe is because US manufacturers are so strong,' admits Mr Takashi
Kuwabara, general manager of the international personal computer product
marketing division at NEC.
In Japan the dominance of NEC's proprietary system and the difficulty of the
Japanese language have made it difficult for foreign manufacturers to
penetrate the market.
In the same way, the predominance of IBM's operating system in the west has
been a big obstacle for Japanese companies trying to break into the US and
European markets.
NEC, for example, which makes IBM-compatible machines, says that it is
always a step behind IBM in bringing out advanced models because it has to
test about 100 important software applications every time it launches a new
machine.
Another difficulty Japanese PC manufacturers face abroad is the need to rely
on sales of stand-alone machines, rather than systems integrated products,
says Dr Shigenori Matsushita, general manager of the planning and
co-ordinating office in Toshiba's information processing and control systems
group.
This is because computer systems are very closely tied to the culture of
each particular country so that it becomes necessary to employ expensive
engineers - a risk which most Japanese companies have not been eager to
take.
Obstacles, such as the above, to Japanese penetration of overseas markets,
leads NEC's Mr Kuwabara to conclude that 'Japanese (PC) manufacturers will
not become a threat to western manufacturers'.
Having failed to make much of an impact in terms of market share, the
Japanese strategy has been to concentrate on high value-added products.
'We are working to maintain high performance and high quality and not get
involved in price wars,' says NEC's Mr Kuwabara.
Mr Kuwabara compares NEC's strategy to that of Mercedes-Benz or Audi in the
car market: both are products which have kept to their own independent
marketing strategies regardless of overall market trends.
That may sound like little more than trying to put a brave face on an
impossible situation but a high value-added strategy may not be such a bad
one for the Japanese, particularly when combined with their strength in PC
components.
'As PC vendors, the Japanese have about as low a profile as you can get in
contrast to what they've managed in other areas,' says Mr Mike Jeremy,
electronics analyst at Baring Securities in Tokyo.
But in terms of the components that go into a PC, the Japanese have a very
high profile. They are leaders in integrated circuits, particularly DRAMs,
in floppy disks and in flat panels.
'If you apply the strategy of the parts to the whole, the Japanese have a
very successful PC strategy,' Mr Jeremy says.
The edge that they have in components, particularly in some of the promising
new technologies such as flat screens and small batteries, could in future
strengthen their overall position in the PC market.
Just as Toshiba was able to capitalise on its early entry into the laptop
and notebook PC market, an early entry into new technology areas could give
the Japanese just the break they need.
Industry experts expect some of these advanced technologies in which the
Japanese excel to become more popular as their prices fall over the next few
years and as the price wars that have been raging in western markets become
less of a determining factor.
'Japanese manufacturers sell high performance machines at high prices but
the market does not want that now,' says Mr Katsushi Shiga, an analyst at
Dataquest, the high-technology market consultancy.
When the environment for such new technologies improves, however, they could
become strong weapons for the Japanese, Mr Shiga believes.
Among the promising new technologies in which Japanese manufacturers have a
leading edge in are thin-film transistor (TFT) colour liquid crystal
displays (LCDs).
In fact, the Japanese dominance of the TFT market is such that US attempts
in the US to impose an anti-dumping duty on Japanese-made TFT-LCDs caused an
uproar among US users which depended on products from Japan.
Unlike passive colour liquid crystal displays, TFT colour LCDs are easy to
read even when viewed from a slight angle.
The problem, however, has been the high price of PCs which use TFT displays
and it will take some more years until prices come down to more acceptable
levels.
This could happen in about five years' time as consumer electronics
manufacturers have been working hard to use TFT colour LCDs in their
products and once the TFT ball starts rolling in the consumer electronics
industry, volumes could rise steeply bringing prices down dramatically.
Japanese manufacturers also have an advantage in their manufacturing
technology, says Dr Matsushita.
Surface mount technology used in notebook PCs, for example, which allows
printing on both surfaces of a printed circuit board and therefore greater
compactness, is a technique perfected by the Japanese.
Meanwhile, as they continue to work on developing these technologies
further, Japanese manufacturers will want to speed up a long overdue review
of their overall marketing strategies for domestic and overseas markets.
Until quite recently, Japanese manufacturers have been able to maintain high
prices in the domestic market. This means that they have not participated in
the price wars that have spread through western markets.
However, in the past few months, US manufacturers such as Compaq and IBM
have begun to present a previously unseen challenge to the domestic
manufacturers' stranglehold on the Japanese PC market.
In a bid to spread the use of its bilingual operating system, DOS-V, IBM set
up the Open Architecture Developers Group (OADG) in Japan two years ago. The
American giant invited other hardware manufacturers, both foreign and
domestic, to back its standard as an alternative to NEC's 9800 PC series.
OADG has so far brought together more than 25 manufacturers, and if it has
not helped the fortunes of all of its members, it has certainly raised the
profile of IBM in Japan.
Then in October last year, Compaq shocked the Japanese market by announcing
a range of desktop PCs priced at about half of what it would cost to buy
comparable machines from a domestic manufacturer.
Compaq's move was soon followed by price cuts from IBM, NEC and most
recently, Fujitsu.
That the spiral of falling prices is unlikely to end just there was
signalled when Compaq announced a further cut in prices this month.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Rhone-Alples (1): Resilient stronghold -
Rhone-Alpes has the largest economy and population outside Ile de France.
The region now runs its own local affairs - and looks likely to influence
the shape of national government after the March elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<TEXT>
IF FRANCE'S opposition right wing wins next month's parliamentary election,
which is likely, Rhone-Alpes will be one of the main victors.
The economically biggest and most populous French region outside Paris is a
traditional conservative power base. So it will probably be the most
important provincial influence on French national politics during the next
government.
Over the past few years it has provided firm ground on which half a dozen
ambitious young opposition politicians have built political bases, some
hotly tipped to take ministerial jobs in the new government. This can only
increase Rhone-Alpes' already weighty influence in the Paris bureaucracy, a
valuable asset in a country where much economic power remains concentrated
in the capital, despite the decentralisation of the past decade.
Local political heavyweights tipped for a national cabinet seat in the
spring include Mr Charles Millon, chairman of the regional council and
national parliamentary whip for the centre right UDF party; Mr Bernard
Bosson, centrist CDS mayor of Annecy; Mr Michel Barnier, the RPR Gaullist
president of the Savoie general council and organiser of last year's winter
Olympics, and Mr Alain Carignon, the RPR mayor of Grenoble. Mr Bosson and Mr
Carignon had ministerial jobs in the 1986-1988 conservative government.
Rising above the fray is the distinguished head of Mr Raymond Barre, former
prime minister of France and a centrist member of parliament for the Rhone,
who is spoken of as a possible (though outside) runner for the Matignon
again.
The young reformers have become candidates for ministerial jobs because they
have used decentralisation (which has mainly increased the power of town
mayors by granting them authority to give or withhold planning permission)
to shape the region and demonstrate their skills in the art of government.
'At national level, the political class is being devalued in public opinion.
But good mayors are still respected, except those who have made mistakes,'
explains Mr Jean Regis, one of Mr Bosson's colleagues on Annecy town
council.
Of course, local politics in Rhone-Alpes is not an automatic track to
stardom. Take Mr Michel Noir, the dynamic mayor of Lyon, the regional
capital which is the economic and political lynchpin of Rhone-Alpes. Only a
few years ago he looked ready for great things - perhaps as a rival to Mr
Jacques Chirac for leadership of the RPR.
Mr Noir remains respected for the amount of investment he has marshalled to
update Lyon's crowded roads and to beautify further this ancient city. Yet,
his ambitions have taken a knock with his misjudged decision, in 1990, to
give up his RPR parliamentary seat in disgust at internal bickering among
the leadership, hoping to form a right wing union of young reformist-minded
people like himself. In the event, only two other MPs followed his example
and the idea has quietly sunk.
Mr Noir's national image took another battering when his son-in-law and
former election campaign manager, Mr Pierre Botton, was jailed last November
for alleged misuse of public funds. The latest twist to Lyon's city politics
came last month when the RPR placed Mr Alain Merieux, one of its rising
stars in the region, as parliamentary candidate in the same constituency as
Mr Noir - re-elected since as an independent.
The RPR's choice of Mr Merieux was significant. He is a vice president of
the regional council, an important businessman (he is head of the Institut
Merieux pharmaceuticals group) and a member of the old bourgeoisie which
runs Lyon behind the scenes. 'The Parisians have decided against the will of
the Lyonnais to organise the division of the national opposition,'
complained an angry Mr Noir.
Rhone-Alpes' political importance is also a reflection of the size and
vitality of its economy - dimmed by the economic downturn. 'For a while we
were sheltered from economic difficulties because of the strength of our
economy. But when the crisis did finally hit, it hit us harder than other
regions,' says Mr Yves Minssieux, regional director of Lyonnaise de Banque.
Of course, damage from the recession has been as unevenly spread as might be
expected from a region as big as Rhone-Alpes. Its 5.3m inhabitants represent
just under a tenth of the French population; it covers 8 per cent of the
nation's land mass and produces a tenth of France's gross domestic product.
It is geographically diverse, from the high snowfields of the French Alps to
the fertile wine-producing hills around the Rhone and the arid scrub of the
Drome.
Economically Rhone-Alpes presents no less striking contrasts: traditional
chemicals, engineering and automotive industries around Lyon, which have
been hardest hit in the slowdown; light industries around the old coal steel
and textile town of St Etienne, which appear more confident than businesses
around the regional capital; and a thriving community of high technology
companies around the town of Grenoble.
Some economic commentators liken Rhone-Alpes to a small country such as
Switzerland or Belgium. A more exact comparison could be made with other
important European regions such as Piedmont in northern Italy, Hesse in
Germany or Catalonia in northern Spain. Rhone-Alpes has intimate political
and business links with all three - and this highlights another of its
important qualities: the pro-European Community consensus among the regional
leadership.
It is no accident that, when the rest of France hesitated over the prospect
of European political and monetary union, Rhone-Alpes produced nearly 55 per
cent in yes-votes in last September's referendum.
The region is a pro-European island on the map of French referendum results,
surrounded by no-votes from Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur in the south,
Auvergne to the west and Burgundy to the north. To complete the picture,
Switzerland is on its north-eastern frontier. Some local planners expect
last year's Swiss vote against closer European integration to trigger a
migration of Swiss-based companies into the Haute Savoie.
Lyon has played on its European credentials, as well as on its high quality
of life, to support its campaign (led by the tireless and persuasive Mr
Barre) to become the headquarters of the European central bank. The
uncertainties facing European monetary union have not diminished the city's
determination. 'If we didn't believe in the Euro-bank, we would not make the
effort.'
That resilience translates into an ability to continue attracting prestige
foreign investments to the region at a time when the international recession
has caused overall foreign investment in France to decline. Last year
Rhone-Alpes overtook Ile de France for the first time in terms of the number
of jobs created by foreign investors - although it still lagged behind
heavily subsidised Lorraine, in north-eastern France. It has a slightly
higher economic growth than the French average and, according to a recent
study by the Economist Intelligence Unit, it will grow 20 per cent faster
than France as a whole over the five years to 1995.
Rhone-Alpes' high profile newcomers include Rank Xerox's new European
research laboratory in Grenoble, and Euronews, the new satellite news
channel. A satisfied Mr Maury claims: 'If they come here, it's not because
of aid, because we don't offer very much. It's because we are attractive.'

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (1): Challenge of
the notebooks - The computer industry today bears little resemblance to its
counterpart of a decade ago. Younger, more agile competitors are moving in
the direction of more compact, more flexible and more portable personal
computers
</HEADLINE>

INSURANCE ASSESSORS inspecting the damage caused by Hurricane Andrew in the
southern states of the US last year took part in a novel experiment. They
used a hand-held computer which was able to accept handwriting and also to
determine its geographic location by reference to a satellite signal - an
essential capability with roads and streets damaged or vanished. A linked
video camera provided a complete photographic image of the devastation.
The experiment points to the future use of portable computing - and to the
way the computer industry is going. Today's computer industry bears little
resemblance to its counterpart of a decade ago and rapid change is still the
order of the day.
Personal computers and their more powerful cousins, workstations, are the
key contributors to the shift which has seen yesterday's industry leaders
cast down in favour of younger, more agile competitors, and a decisive swing
away from traditional mainframe-based data processing.
The leaders of the new industry include Microsoft, the software company
which sells, MS/DOS, the most popular operating system, Intel, the
semiconductor house which makes the microprocessors used by the majority of
PCs, and Novell, which markets the most popular networking software.
It has become a world where the owners of the key technologies have the whip
hand. Computer makers are, in a sense, simply distributors of that
technology. For the future, therefore, there is a powerful incentive for
companies to establish their proprietary technology as an industry standard.
Digital Equipment, for example, a company which missed out on the personal
computer revolution the first time round, is trying to establish its Alpha
microprocessor, the first commercial 64-bit risc chip, as a standard for
power computing. It faces competition from IBM, Hewlett Packard, Sun
Microsystems and MIPS.
IBM is still the world leader in personal computer sales, with revenues from
its PC business of between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 12bn a year. The
European leader is Olivetti of Italy, while NEC has a commanding lead in
Japan by virtue of its proprietary design.
Now the personal computer industry is beginning to experience, in its turn,
the wind of change as portable computers in a broad range of sizes and
designs begin both to make inroads into the desk-top market, and to make
personal computing available to a new generation of potential customers.
About 20 per cent of all personal computers bought today are portable, and
the proportion is increasing. Consultants Frost &amp; Sullivan estimate total
shipments of portable computers in the US last year at 2.3m units, 2.14 of
which were notebook machines.
There is little disadvantage now for the individual in opting for a portable
computer over a traditional desktop. Portable and notebook computers use the
same powerful microprocessors, run the same software and have as much memory
as desktop machines. Lightweight power supplies seem likely to remain out of
reach, for the foreseeable future, however.
There is a wide choice of laptops. Olivetti has introduced the Quaderno,
smaller and lighter than conventional laptops with digital audio recording.
Handheld computers include devices from Hewlett Packard of the US and Psion
of the UK.
The development of portable computing is being driven by advances in
miniaturisation which often boggle belief. IBM has developed at its Boca
Raton, Florida, laboratories, for example, a 105 megabyte hard disk drive
about the size of a credit card destined for a new generation of very small
personal computers. A decade ago, a 10 megabyte drive in a 20-pound
'luggable' computer was at the leading edge.
IBM researchers envisage a range of tiny, personal machines which can be
modified for different purposes by plugging in adaptor cards - a global
positioning device to work with an on-screen map, for example, or a colour
video camera. Mr Jack Kuehler, IBM's most senior technologist, describes the
strategy as akin to 'razor and razor blades'. The personal computer is the
razor. The core business will be providing the 'blades' of on-line services,
communications and information.
IBM is not alone in anticipating huge potential demand for products of this
kind. Apple Computer has in development a personal digital assistant, called
Newton, which is due to be launched this year. Newton will combine computing
power with the facility of an electronic organiser. It will accept
handwritten input and fit in a suit pocket. EO, a Californian company, has
forged an alliance with AT&amp;T, and the Japanese company Matsushita, to
develop a personal communicator combining personal telephone and personal
computer.
These gadgets, exciting though they are for the future, form the second age
of PCs. The personal computer industry is today characterised by more
immediate concerns, including pricing, branding and distribution.
Companies across the world are no longer spending money on computing as they
did in the past. Total investment in computer systems - mainframes to
notebooks - was Dollars 107bn in 1992, Dollars 2.5bn less than in the
previous year according to the US consultancy Dataquest. These numbers
reflect the effects of the recession, the falling cost of computer hardware
and a tougher attitude to IT investment among senior executives.
Nevertheless, according to Dataquest, European PC suppliers experienced a
surge in demand in the second half of 1992. According to Mr Chris Fell,
director of Dataquest's PC service, the surge represents a blip in spending
as the market takes advantage of the price wars. 'Shipments will certainly
remain strong into the early part of 1993, as manufacturers struggle to
fulfil a backlog of orders. We will have to see if the demand continues
through the summer, although we feel a return to more modest growth is
inevitable later in the year.'
The price of personal computers has already fallen by up to 40 per cent a
year over the past few years - a basic PC which cost more than Pounds 4,500
in 1983 now costs Pounds 500. There are indications that prices could fall a
further 20 per cent this year causing problems for manufacturers and
distributors alike as slim profit margins are squeezed further.
It seems likely, however, that prices are stabilising and that PCs will
become richer in features rather than cheaper. There are now comparatively
few PC components on which prices can fall further. An exception is active
matrix flat colour screens, manufactured principally in Japan and used for
top-of-the-range portable and laptop machines. The percentage of useable
screens obtained from the manufacturing process is still disappointingly
low. When it improves, prices will fall rapidly.
Many trace the latest phase in the PC price war to June 15 last year when
Compaq, a US company which had been a world leader in high performance PCs,
announced a plethora of new products along with price cuts of up to 32 per
cent. New ranges of low-priced models were announced.
The effect was electric. 1992 was the year of the no-name manufacturer, when
companies without much track record gained market share at the expense of
the well-known names, selling on price and a realisation among customers
that a well-known brand name was no guarantee of extra quality. Examples of
no-name clone makers include Elonex in the UK and Vobis in Germany.
The effect of Compaq's announcement was to cut the difference in price
between a Compaq computer and a no-name clone to only 15 per cent from 35
per cent. Last month the company reported net income for the three months to
December 31 of Dollars 89.5m, or Dollars 1.10 a share, on sales of Dollars
1.42bn, against net earnings of Dollars 66.6m, or 77 cents, on sales of
Dollars 873.4m a year earlier. Analysts had expected the company to earn
between 80 cents and Dollars 1.01 share in the quarter.
Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, chief executive, was quoted as saying: 'We have seen
record-setting demand for our entire product line since June when we began
implementing our new strategy of offering price-leading products that
feature Compaq quality and the best service and support in the industry.'
Later in the year, IBM announced its own strategy: four separate product
sectors, each serviced separately. A new, wholly-owned subsidiary was
established in Europe to compete, apparently successfully, with the lowest
cost no-name suppliers without hurting IBM's quality image. It also
introduced a budget line world-wide - the PS/Valuepoint systems designed to
compete against lower priced offerings from Compaq, Dell and the like. These
lower priced machines have been selling well. The turnround at Compaq and
IBM suggests that if prices are comparable, customers will opt for the name
brand. Prepare for further blood-letting this year. By comparison, Hurricane
Andrew was a breeze.

FT  19 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy trade in Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN IMPRESSIVE set of half-year figures from pharmaceuticals group Glaxo
prompted one of the biggest daily turnovers in the stock recorded over the
past decade. By the close of trading yesterday, more than 23m shares had
been dealt in London and the share price, which reached a high of 710p at
one stage, closed a net 22 ahead at 684p.
When the figures were announced early in the session, the share price shot
up sharply, offering an opportunity for UK institutions to sell into
strength. But the momentum was checked only briefly and it soon rallied
ahead of the start of trading on Wall Street. US investors were equally
enthusiastic about Glaxo's figures and it was only towards the close in
London that the selling pressure returned.
The market was reassured by a denial that Glaxo was planning a massive
rights issue, contrary to speculation that has dogged the stock over the
past few weeks. Also, the headline profits figure of Pounds 819m was way
above the forecast range of Pounds 780m to Pounds 800m, and analysts were
particularly impressed by sales of Glaxo's main earner, the ulcer drug
Zantac, which grew by 16 per cent to Pounds 1.03bn.
Most houses raised forecasts. Hoare Govett, around the top of the range,
moved to Pounds 1.728bn for the current year and Pounds 2.032bn for 1994,
while James Capel moved to Pounds 1.675bn and Pounds 1.82bn. However, even
the bulls conceded that US sentiment was likely to drag on the share price
for some time.
Reaction to the results helped the rest of the pharmaceuticals sector.
Wellcome gained 9 at 907p and SmithKline Beecham rose 4 1/2 to 443 1/2 p in
the 'A's and 3 1/2 to 385 1/2 p in the Units.
Stores deal
After weeks of speculation, Kingfisher finally sealed the deal to buy Darty,
the French electrical group, and the relief factor sent the stock surging.
Sentiment was also helped by Kingfisher's estimate of its profits to January
1993, which at Pounds 233m were several million ahead of most analysts
forecasts. The shares jumped 30 to 557p in heavy trade of 8.5m.
The upbeat presentation and details of the deal prompted a welter of
upgrades as analysts took account of the effect of France's leading
electrical retailer on Kingfisher's profits. Kleinwort Benson increased its
current year preliminary estimate from Pounds 255m to Pounds 320m, while
others were said to be as high as Pounds 340m. There were also a number of
buy recommendations issued.
However, the merger was not without its critics. Questions over the state of
the French electrical market, the French economy and Darty's financial
situation were all raised by analysts doubtful over the synergies of the
takeover. One bearish analyst said 'I cannot see the value for shareholders
in this deal', and retained his negative stance.
A more positive Mr Andy Hughes at Nomura commented: 'I am reasonably
assured. The deal is earnings enhancing and it takes Kingfisher into a new
market without dilution.'
On the domestic front, Kingfisher said Comet was performing well, although
the DIY chain B&amp;Q was in the doldrums. This was said to be the main reason
for the fall in Ladbroke shares, off 2 at 196p, and the weakness in WH Smith
'A', steady at 425p.
Conglomerate Hanson was steady in reaction to the news of the US tax
proposals. Mr Jack L. Kelly of Goldman Sachs in the US argues that Hanson
will not be affected by the levy on transfer pricing, which constitutes the
most significant part of the proposed taxes on domestic profits from foreign
companies.
BAT Industries recovered 6 to 964p, with investors relieved that President
Clinton did not include higher US tobacco taxes in his State of the Union
address.
Analysts said that UK building shares with transatlantic interests had
largely anticipated President Clinton's tax plans, although Wolseley, the
sector's most US exposed company, declined 6 to 550p on the back of worries
about the US recovery.
Turnover of 1.5m shares masked a 4.27m overnight agency cross trade in
Taylor Woodrow, one of the leading UK housebuilders, which closed 2 up at
80p in line with a generally firm market.
George Wimpey appreciated 9 to 139p as the market responded well to its
attempt to avoid the mistakes of the 1980s by reorganising the way it buys
building plots.
Mining group RTZ slipped 5 to 646p in the registered stock after announcing
that it is to enter the coal business through a Dollars 470 (Pounds 330.9m)
purchase of Nerco of the US.
The oil majors held up following announcement of the new US energy tax. BP
added 1 1/2 at 262 1/2 p and Shell Transport 4 1/2 at 582p.
Mr John Toalster of Strauss Turnbull said that although there was no
short-term impact there was 'long-term cause for concern and, in an industry
which is suffering very badly, you don't need an extra negative against
you'.
Merchant bank Kleinwort Benson rose 17 to 626p after it announced 1992
profits well above market forecasts at Pounds 46.3m, against Pounds 27.9m
last time. Analysts of the financial sector had expected a figure of around
Pounds 35m but the bank cut its net provisions to Pounds 7m from Pounds 39m
in 1991.
Enthusiasm over the improvement spilled over into the rest of the sector.
Schroders rose 65 to 1573p, SG Warburg 9 to 626p and Hambros 8 to 300p.
Specialised medical products group Amersham International advanced 21 to
716p following a well-received presentation to about 35 institutions by
Hoare Govett.
Presentations to City analysts by Kwik Save were said to be unimpressive and
the shares retreated 2 to 800p. J. Sainsbury received a boost from BZW, the
shares rising 5 to 516p.
Associated British Foods advanced strongly as Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken turned
buyer. Some in the market believe the group may benefit from any
restructuring in the bakery market. The shares climbed 10 to 474p. Carr also
liked Great Universal Stores following a visit to the mail order business.
Analyst Mr John Chataway said: 'We think our forecast of a 10 per cent rise
in profits in mail order will now definitely be met.' The shares put on 23
at 1608p.
Advertising group Gold Greenlees Trott fell 12 to 288p after announcing a
one-for-three cash call. The company is issuing 6.49m shares at 235p a share
to raise Pounds 14.7m.
Shares in security group Chubb firmed 4 to 277p as the company held
presentations for several City institutions. A reported recommendation from
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was said to have boosted BTR, the shares appreciating 3
to 552p with some 3m traded in the equities and the equivalent of 2.7m in
traded options. Danka Business shares were wanted and they closed 18 up at
573p.
The rally in the US dollar helped British Airways gain 7 to 287p, while the
market continued to appreciate plans by BAA for a fifth terminal that were
announced on Wednesday. Shares in the UK airports operator moved ahead 11 to
781p. Mersey Docks continued to bask in the glow of good results adding
another 9 at 318p.
Engineering group Wheway moved forward 1 1/2 to 9p after McLeod Russell, an
investment holding company, launched a hostile Pounds 14.3m takeover bid.
The offer values Wheway stock at 10.2p per share.
A shortage of stock in GKN saw the shares harden 7 to 476p. Motor
distributors were in demand and Thomas Cowie gained 5 to 200p, while
Pendragon rose 8 to 263p. Aerospace and engineering group Smiths Industries
continued to languish on fears that a big customer may cancel or defer
aircraft orders. The shares eased another 2 to 347p.
In textiles, Hartstone, the hosiery and leather goods distributor, closed 7
up at 251p as a volatile trade in the company continued. Shares in Dawson
International, one of Britain's biggest clothing manufacturers, were held at
226p by reports from analysts touring the company's US operations.

FT  19 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETTER than expected aver-age earnings figures, together with the favourable
response by the US markets to the State of the Union speech by President
Clinton, brought good trading activity in the derivatives area, writes Joel
Kibazo.
The March contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 2,825, up 10 from its previous
close, but suffered a slight dip to 2,823 in the first 10 minutes of
business. It later rose on buying from independent traders and securities
houses.
The release of favourable average earnings figures boosted the contract
further, maintaining momentum into the afternoon, and it reached the day's
high of 2,854 just before Wall Street opened.
March subsequently came off the top, but it maintained the high levels due
to early firmness on Wall Street. Profit-taking later in the session caused
the contract to gently drift back and it ended at 2,835, up 20 from
Wednesday's close but at a 7-point discount to the underlying cash market.
Turnover was 10,031 lots.
The traded options market was active and turnover expanded to 34,174
contracts. The FT-SE 100 option traded 14,033 lots while the Euro FT-SE
option had 1,920 contracts dealt.
Among the stock options, Amstrad was the busiest with 7,300 lots transacted
and most of the day's total done in the June 25 calls. It was followed by
BTR with 2,726 contracts and Glaxo with 1,489.

FT  19 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Strong recovery in higher turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BURDENS laid on the London stock market earlier this week were lifted
significantly yesterday and share prices bounced back confidently in good
trading volume. The favourable response from Wall Street and the US dollar
to President Clinton's State of the Union Message set the stage for a good
performance by UK equities. The market was further encouraged by good
interim results from Glaxo, relief that two potential rights issue hurdles
were cleared, and an acceptable set of data on the UK economy.
At best, the market was 38.1 up on the Footsie scale, but gains were trimmed
in the second half of the session when Wall Street lost part of its early
gain to show an advance of 17 points on the Dow Average as London closed.
The final reading on the FT-SE 100 Index showed a 23.7 rise at 2,837.7.
Blue chip stocks opened strongly as the US dollar steadied and London noted
with relief Wall Street's firmness overnight following President Clinton's
speech.
Trading results from Glaxo were significantly better than some market fears
and the stock market caught the hint from the boardroom that no rights issue
or major acquisition was in the pipeline.
Another of the rights issue threats overhanging equities was soothed when
Kingfisher, the UK retail store, confirmed its Pounds 1.1bn merger with
Darty, the leading French electrical retailer, but called for only Pounds
313m from shareholders, much less than had been feared when the deal was
first mooted three weeks ago.
The disclosure that unemployment in the UK had indeed risen above 3m, to
10.6 per cent of the workforce in January, had been well foreseen in the
City of London and had little effect on share prices. More encouraging was
the increase of Pounds 2.1bn in UK bank lending last month, although
strategists agreed that this should not be regarded as conclusive evidence
of increased economic activity.
Heavy turnover in Glaxo made up about 3.6 per cent of the day's Seaq total
of 637.2m shares. Stocks in the pharmaceutical group had been depressed
ahead of the profits statement.
However, some analysts refused to shed their doubts on Glaxo's longer term
outlook, and the shares ended well under the day's best levels.
The focus on the blue chip stocks yesterday was reflected in a slight fall
in trading among non-Footsie shares, which made up just under 60 per cent of
the day's Seaq total. However, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index climbed by 22.9 to
3,040.3. On Wednesday, Seaq volume of 618.6m shares was worth Pounds 1.2bn
in retail worth.
Good results in the merchant banking sector brought gains among the
financial stocks. The market's conviction that domestic interest rates will
be cut again at Budget time, now only a few weeks away, helped shares in
building, construction and property companies.
The stock market has now effectively recovered the ground lost at the
beginning of the week when Wall Street fell sharply as it reacted to the
first hints of President Clinton's taxation plans. The Footsie 2,800 area
appears to have established itself as a support level and traders now hope
to see the market move up towards the 2,900 mark again as it awaits the
Budget speech from the UK chancellor of the exchequer.

FT  19 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow ends lower after a
volatile session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US PRICES were in mixed form yesterday following the announcement of
President Bill Clinton's economic package, although secondary stocks, which
were particularly hard hit earlier in the week, made a comeback, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally down 10.00 at 3,302.19, ending
a rollercoaster session in which the index had at one point been up 35
points, and then down almost 35 points. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.40
at 431.90, while the Nasdaq composite performed well, rising 3.02 to 662.45
on bargain buying. Trading volume on the New York SE was 311m shares.
After the big sell-off on Tuesday the dominant feeling yesterday was one of
relief that the State of the Union speech did not include nasty surprises.
Taken together with further good news on the economy - industrial production
up 0.4 per cent in January and weekly jobless claims down sharply - share
prices saw strong early gains, lifting the Dow more than 35 points in the
first few minutes of trading.
The buying, however, quickly evaporated, at least among blue chip and large
to medium-sized stocks. The general reaction to the economic package was
that it was much more bullish for bonds than equities, while concern that
higher taxes will retard economic growth continued to trouble investors.
Consequently, the main indices gave back their morning gains, and by early
afternoon the Dow had plunged to a 34-point drop, but blue chip prices
eventually recovered most of their losses.
Leading Dow stocks were mixed, with General Motors down Dollars 1 1/8 at
Dollars 38 1/2 , Philip Morris up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 70 5/8 ,
International Paper off Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 63 7/8 and Merck up Dollars
 1/4 at Dollars 37 7/8 .
Merck aside, most other big drug shares were lower, still worried about
possible government-imposed limits on pharmaceutical prices. Schering-Plough
slipped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 56 3/4 and Bristol-Myers Squibb lost
Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 56 1/8 .
Airlines were hard hit by news of the energy tax and worries that higher
personal taxes will stifle demand for air travel. Delta fell Dollars 1 3/4
to Dollars 46 7/8 , AMR Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 57 and UAL Dollars 3 1/2 to
Dollars 115 3/4 .
On the Nasdaq market, Intel led the way higher, rising Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 110, followed by Apple, which put on Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 55.
Canada
THE Toronto market showed a mildly negative reaction to US President
Clinton's speech on his economic plan. The TSE 300 index shed 8.3 to 3,409.4
and falls led rises by 303 to 289 after volume of 53.5m shares.

FT  19 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Tel Aviv drops on conflict allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices in Tel Aviv fell heavily yesterday, the latest lurch in a
10-day downtrend as investors reacted to allegations that Israeli banks have
been stoking the market to unwarranted levels.
Already depressed by worries that equities were over-valued after riding a
surging bull market for most of the past two years, the index of the 100
most traded shares dropped 5 per cent during the morning session, before
recouping some of the loss. It ended the day down 3.9 per cent at 194.63.
This compares with a high of 218.17 on February 8 and an end-1992 mark of
195.98, which in turn compared with a level of 100 at the beginning of 1992.
The day's fall followed remarks to a parliamentary committee on Wednesday by
Mr Moshe Beijsky, the former High Court judge, which raised the spectre of a
disastrous share collapse in 1983.
Mr Beijsky, who chaired a state commission of inquiry into the 1983 crash,
said bank-owned mutual and providential funds, which have supplied much of
the heavy demand on the TASE, 'do not always have the interests of savers as
their first concern.' He added: 'The fact that it is the banks which manage
the provident and the mutual funds constitutes an inadmissible conflict of
interest.'
Present market conditions are very different from those of 1983, when the
principal cause of the crash was the collapse of a system by which the banks
ramped up their own shares. But government officials, brokers and analysts
have noted that the banks, suffering from low margins in their mainstream
business, have benefited by heavy lending to investors for stock purchases
made through their own institutions.
Mr David Klein of the Bank of Israel comptroller's committee also told the
Knesset: 'People who want to invest are still not getting objective
financial advice. Each bank simply sells its own goods.'
Bank of Israel officials said they were considering moves to remove mutual
and providential funds completely from bank control, or at least to
strengthen the 'Chinese walls' between them through independently appointed
investment committees. Judge Beijsky noted that his commission of inquiry
had advised separation, but that no action had been taken.
The issue has acquired extra urgency because of the government's plan to
sell off 20 per cent of Bank Hapoalim, the country's biggest bank, on the
TASE within the next few weeks. Along with its rivals, Bank Leumi, Israel
Discount Bank and Bank Mizrahi, Bank Hapoalim has been majority-owned by the
state since the government spent Dollars 7bn on buying up bank stock after
the 1983 crash.
Mr Klein said it would be impossible to take back control over the mutual
and providential funds from the banks after they were re-privatised.
In spite of the heat generated by the row over the role of the banks,
analysts said it tended to cloud judgment of the underlying health of the
market, which has slipped back significantly in a yo-yo pattern of trading
since peaking in early February.
Comments by the Bank of Israel that the market was like a 'financial bubble'
and similar cautionary talk from the Finance Ministry helped to induce the
slump, which the banks row compounded. Significantly, Israeli high-tech
stocks quoted in New York, where they have consistently outperformed local
markets over the past year, also declined on Wednesday, a day when the Dow
Jones index rose overall.
But most analysts in Tel Aviv say they do not anticipate a 1983-style crash.
They point out that the market is now much broader and deeper, but still not
soaking up a steady flow of demand. Also, the high inflation, low growth
economy of 1983 has been replaced by strong growth and single-digit
inflation.
Mr David Rosenberg of Pacific Mediterranean Investments said: 'The market
was due for a correction, but we are probably past the worst of it.' He
added that average historical price-earnings ratios were down to 20 or less.
'It could go to 185 before recovering, but the underlying fundamentals are
still good. We think it is a little overvalued, but not much.'

FT  19 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong rises 1.6% as
Tokyo shows modest loss

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TECHNICAL trading dominated activity as most investors remained on the
sidelines to observe movements on the currency and bond markets after
President Bill Clinton's economic statement in the US, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average declined 27.49 to 16,982.14, having moved between
17,156.72 in the morning session and 16,974.62 in late trading.
Volume rose to 250m shares but from Wednesday's meagre 207m, as gainers led
losers by 547 to 395, with 182 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all
first section stocks lost 0.15 to 1,293.12, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50
index edged up 0.79 to 1,037.59.
Buying by public funds was countered by selling by investment trusts, while
short-term traders and dealers sought large-capital steels and other theme
stocks.
Mr Bill Clinton's policy announcement, presented during the lunch hour in
Tokyo, had little effect on prices. Mr Yuichi Kohashi, analyst at Daiwa
Securities, said: 'The tax hikes had little news value for the market, and
we would have to wait for the long-term impact on the foreign exchange and
interest rates.'
Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, firmed Y1 to Y295 after reporting
a better than expected dividend yield of some 2 per cent, against estimates
of 0.9 per cent. Other large-capital issues attracting interest included
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Y1 harder at Y507.
Nagase, a trading house specialising in chemical products, forged ahead Y32
to Y906 on the Aids theme - the company's subsidiary is currently developing
an anti-Aids drug. Kanematsu, a medium-sized trading house, moved ahead Y4
to Y416 on the same theme.
High-technology shares continued to weaken on worries over the high yen and
faltering demand. Hitachi dipped Y2 to Y676 and Fujitsu finished Y4 cheaper
at Y525.
TDK, the tape manufacturer, declined Y50 to Y3,340 on reports that it would
post a 26 per cent fall in consolidated pre-tax profits to Y9bn, sharply
lower than previous estimates of Y36bn.
Housing issues were stronger on hopes of a recovery in demand. Haseko gained
Y8 at Y610 and Shokusan Jutaku Sogo closed Y12 to the good at Y515. However,
Daikyo, the leading condominium builder, softened Y2 to Y882 on
profit-taking.
In Osaka, the OSE average improved 87.17 to 18,419.81 in volume of 79.1m
shares.
Roundup
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's economic statement received mixed reactions from
the region's markets yesterday.
HONG KONG, encouraged by reports that China had freed a political dissident
and on optimism that UK-Sino tensions were easing, saw the Hang Seng index
rise 99.48, or 1.6 per cent, to 6,186.94. Turnover was good at HKDollars
3.7bn following Wednesday's HKDollars 3.2bn.
Jardine Matheson, which has lagged behind the market recently, was one of
the day's most active issues, climbing HKDollars 3.50 to HKDollars 50.50.
MANILA advanced some 3.5 per cent on hopes that a new oil field will provide
most of the country's needs. The composite index put on 49.15 at 1,458.26 in
turnover of some 255m pesos.
Investors were also encouraged by a good overnight performance in the US
from Philippine Long Distance Tele-phone, which appreciated 25 pesos to 910
pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR retreated slightly in spite of an easing in interest rates. The
composite index slipped 2.70 to 623.11 in turnover of MDollars 591m.
Among the day's losers, Tenaga Nasional, the electric utility, receded 10
cents to MDollars 8.70 with 1.73m shares traded. Telekom Malaysia dipped 20
cents to MDollars 12. Sime Darby weakened 16 cents to MDollars 4.60 in
volume of some 1.26m shares.
SEOUL fell for the third straight session as hopes for measures to stimulate
the economy receded. The composite index finished 11.21 lower at 653.91 in
turnover of Won318.5bn.
SINGAPORE showed a modest improvement although there was little direction to
buying. The Straits Times Industrial index ended 15.57 ahead at 1,632.13 in
turnover of SDollars 166m.
AUSTRALIA retained early gains and banks continued to be supported by hopes
that a change in government after next month's elections would lead to
mergers in the sector. The All Ordinaries index closed 6 higher at 1,607.3.
ANZ, favoured as a merger candidate, added 2 cents at ADollars 3.40 in
volume of some 3.8m shares. Among other banks, Commonwealth gained 2 cents
at ADollars 6.62 but Westpac surrendered 4 cents to ADollars 3.23.
BANGKOK closed sharply lower as nervousness continued regarding First City
Investment, which has been forced to defer repaying matured deposits. The
SET index lost 11.81 to 961.43 in low turnover of Bt6.75bn.
NEW ZEALAND followed Wednesday's weakness with another setback of 9.78 in
the NZSE-40 index to 1,590.93, with Telecom declining 8 cents to NZDollars
2.67.

FT  19 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Senior bourses anticipate
German M3 data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK did not move on interest rates yesterday but bourses rose,
partly on spreading optimism for modest German M3 growth for January, writes
Our Markets Staff.
As dealers said that hopes of further interest rate cuts were based on
expectations of M3 landing within the Bundesbank's target range, the
president of the Munich-based Ifo economic research institute was saying
that Buba should make further cuts to encourage more capital investment.
Meanwhile, bond yields were dropping in Frankfurt and Paris, and nudging
their equities higher.
FRANKFURT registered a seven-month high as the DAX index rose 19.00 to
1,672.26, its highest close since July 17, just after a Bundesbank rise in
the German discount rate took European equities into decline. Turnover
improved from DM6.1bn to DM6.5bn.
Even though there had been no decrease in rates yesterday, Mr Edgar
Benischeck at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt said that investors were aware
that the Bundesbank had taken two small steps on the downward path when, on
precedent, it could be expected to take seven or eight.
Even after an 8 per cent recovery this year, he added, the DAX was still 4
per cent down from its July 16 level, while the Bundesbank's average bond
yield had fallen from 8.48 to 6.71 per cent, or by 177 basis points, in the
interim.
Finally, he said, the market was 12 months ahead of the economy, looking not
to 1993 when the move to strong cost reductions will hit corporate profits,
but to 1994 when some of the benefits will arise.
The interest rate and cost reduction themes were reflected respectively in
financials, where Deutsche Bank rose DM11.70 to DM682.70, and in carmakers
where Volkswagen recovered DM6.80 to DM287.40 after its fall on last
Friday's DB Research downgrade.
PARIS stayed with the interest rate theme as many investors clung to the
belief that European rates are due to ease in the short-term. The CAC-40
index, which dipped briefly after the Bundesbank left the Lombard rate
unchanged, closed off the day's high of 1,932, but still 21.55 ahead at
1,926.52.
Apart from financial and bank stocks, stronger on rate cut hopes, high
turnover was noted in Bon Marche, up FFr45 or 8 per cent at FFr554, with
speculation that there might be a restructuring of companies in Mr Bernard
Arnault's group.
Chargeurs gained FFr58 to FFr1,378 after confirming reports that it may buy
a 20 per cent stake in the satellite division of Canal Plus, FFr17 firmer at
FFr1,238.
Rhone-Poulenc continued to advance ahead of its inclusion in the CAC on
Monday and its good earnings announcement on Wednesday. The shares rose
FFr17 to FFr565.
MILAN stayed firmly in the grip of 'Fiat fever' as shares in the car group
advanced another 9 per cent, fixing at L5,400. Most analysts believe that
demand for the stock has come about partly because of its relative cheapness
prior to its gains at the end of last week, and through foreign
institutions, underweight in Italy, looking to enter the market. Speculation
that Fiat might be planning a rights issue with warrants has also fuelled
demand, according to other analysts.
The Comit index rose 7.96 to 506.49. Olivetti gained L65 to L2,095 while,
among the banks, Mediobanca was L555 firmer at L14,705.
ZURICH followed the general trend, helped by easier Swiss interest rates,
banks were strong and volume was described as fairly good as the SMI index
rose 19.0 to 2,131.9. Union Bank saw heavy volume as it rose SFr9 to SFr936,
SBC added SFr7 to SFr342 and CS Holding SFr30 to SFr2,150.
STOCKHOLM saw S-E Banken decline after announcing that it expects to see
further loan losses in 1993-94. The C shares lost SKr2 to SKr12 but the rest
of the market was generally firmer with the Affarsvarlden General index
advancing 10.9 to 984.9 in turnover of SKr1.1bn.
Ericsson and Astra both recovered Wednesday's losses, with respective rises
of SKr13 and SKr8 to SKr716 and SKr222.
OSLO was helped to a higher close by Kvaerner which, up SKr2.50 at SKr163,
said that it expected stronger earnings in 1993. The all-share index
improved 1.58 to 398.74 in turnover of NKr512.2m. Norsk Hydro, which
releases 1992 results on Monday, gained NKr2.00 to NKr162.50.
AMSTERDAM firmed with chemical stocks and major blue chips giving good
performances. The CBS Tendency index advanced 1.3 to 99.0.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollars rides Clinton switchback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR bounced higher in early European trading but doubts about
President Clinton's plans for reducing the US budget deficit left it
struggling to break through DM1.6400, write Emma Tucker and Gillian Tett.
The market's initial reaction to the president's economic package was
favourable and the US currency rose to DM1.6600, but by the European close
it had dropped near to DM1.6300.
Market worries were fed by White House comments that Mr Clinton hoped to
work with the Federal Reserve to keep rates low and that Mr Alan Greenspan,
the Fed chairman, shared that goal. These appeared to outweigh relatively
strong inflation and trade data. The December merchandise trade deficit
narrowed to Dollars 6.95bn from Dollars 7.35bn and both the headline and
core rates of inflation rose by more than expected.
Mr Stephen Hannah, economist at IBJ International, said the dollar's
volatility stemmed from markedly different reactions to the president's
message. 'One camp is highly cynical, and says the budget reductions are
based on tax increases rather than lower expenditure,' he said. 'It worries
that the expenditure figures will rise once the plans reach Congress, so a
high deficit will continue to be generated.'
The opposing view, according to Mr Hannah, is that President Clinton is
being bold and is dealing with the deficit in the appropriate manner.
Mr Avinash Persaud, currency economist at UBS Phill-ips &amp; Drew, believes the
president's growth package will trigger fast economic growth this year.
'The key factor is the timing of the fiscal stimulus with respect to his
reduction measures. The fiscal stimulus is front end loaded, whereas
reduction measures are back end loaded,' Mr Persaud said, pointing out that
since Mr Clinton's tax measures would not be introduced until at least the
autumn, they would not damp economic growth this year. The dollar closed
just over  1/2 pfennig up at DM1.6335. In New York the US currency finished
at DM1.6315.
Trading in European currencies was quiet. The exchange rate mechanism came
under no particular pressure, with poor industrial production figures in
France making little impact on the franc. The French currency closed
fractionally firmer at FFr3.389 against the D-Mark.
The Italian lira continued to fall in spite of the reduction in ERM
tensions, suggesting that it is now domestic factors determining the lira's
level. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, said: 'The lira has
been very much undermined by worries over the strength of the government
coalition.' It ended at L953.4 per D-Mark, compared with L951.1 at the
previous close.
Sterling stood on the sidelines, largely unmoved by better than expected
bank lending and unemployment figures. It gained a pfennig at DM2.3600.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Money Markets: French futures firmer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH PIBOR futures were slightly firmer yesterday, buoyed by a stronger
franc and news that the Bank of France was making progress in rebuilding
reserves.
Dealers reported that the shorter dated futures contracts had been oversold
on fears that the central bank was failing to replenish its foreign currency
reserves and would have to keep short dates high for longer, in order to
attract funds.
With these fears diminished, the March and June contracts bounced back. The
March contract rose more than 12 basis points during the day, and the June
contract was 14 basis points up at the close.
The German debt market was generally firmer, but short-dated Euromark
futures did not move significantly, trading in a very narrow range. There
was some residual disappointment in the market after the Bundesbank left its
key interest rates unchanged following its council meeting, even though this
was expected.
Although there are hopes for further early interest rate cuts by the German
authorities, dealers reported that the market had already priced in the next
round of easing. The June contract closed at around 92.90, unaltered on the
day.
The UK money markets were extremely quiet. The Bank of England posted a
small shortage of Pounds 100m and did not operate in the morning. The
forecast was then revised to a flat position and there were no afternoon
operations.
Period rates were mostly unchanged. The three-month interbank rate stayed at
6 1/4 per cent on the offered side.
Short sterling contracts were steady for most of the day. A dealer said
there was no particular reason for the market to change its view that the UK
government would not cut rates at the Budget next month, particularly after
yesterday's economic figures. These included higher than forecast bank
lending, and a smaller rise in unemployment in January than in the prev-ious
month.
Another dealer commented: 'The revival of bank lending and the less than
horrific unemployment figures point to the fact that the recovery has
started somewhere. We have also had a fairly consistent fall in the pound.'
Otherwise, yesterday's sluggish trading reflected a generally unfocused
week. The market is looking ahead to next week when conditions are expected
to be much tighter.

The complex, to be funded by the Westbury consortium of Pakistan and the

Gulf states and central Asia. Malaysia's processors already have excess
refining capacity, while Pakistan's are fearful for the country's

FT  19 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber dampened by its price -
A producer-consumer accord hangs in the balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When trading in natural rubber became computerised on the Singapore
commodity exchange last year, producers were hoping prices might lift from a
three-year trough. One year on, prices remain low and a bitter argument
rages between producing and consuming nations over support for the industry.
At the end of this year, the current five-year agreement of the
International Natural Rubber Organisation (INRO), which groups together 26
producing and consuming nations, will expire. Producers have set a deadline
for the end of March for consumers to indicate whether or not they are
willing to negotiate a new agreement.
INRO's system of intervention prices and buffer stock management now hangs
in the balance. Industry officials say the US and tyre companies, including
Goodyear and Michelin, support renewing the agreement. But the European
Community is proving indecisive they say, and tends towards abandoning it.
Under INRO regulations, if the average market price over a six-month period
is below the buffer stock intervention price, the intervention price must be
cut by 5 per cent.
When the price was reviewed on January 28, the six-month average was 175.95
Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo, fractionally below the 176 cents a kilo
intervention level.
The market price has risen to 183.71 cents a kilo and producers fear a cut
in the intervention price will damage the fragile market recovery. Consumers
insist that the cut be implemented. Producers are arguing for intervention
levels to be raised under a renegotiated INRO agreement.
Dr AF Budiman, executive director of the Indonesian Rubber Association, says
the current 'market price is not remunerative enough to guarantee a
long-term re-investment in natural rubber'.
Producers still gripe that the international pricing system for rubber is
weighted in favour of the tyre companies, which mostly buy direct from
processors at a price related to that prevailing on the commodity exchange
in Singapore.
The producers allege the exchange price is depressed by the low volume and
quality of rubber traded in Singapore. Tyre companies have responded by
saying they will reduce direct sales and improve the market's liquidity.
While producers complain direct sales are having a dampening effect on the
market, they feel in a weak position vis-a-vis the tyre companies. 'There
are five major buyers against hundreds of sellers,' says Mr Teddy Chua,
managing director of Transworld Rubber brokers in Singapore. 'They feel the
five can hold up better than them.'
Producers' complaints, however, may be overblown. Traders say rubber is a
fickle commodity and while marginal oversupply at present has resulted in
low prices, a shift to a small excess in demand could lift prices sharply.
A recent report by Free University of Amsterdam, funded by the Dutch
government on behalf of natural rubber producers, estimates world production
will rise from 5.24m in 1990 to 6.66m tonnes in the year 2000.
In the same period, world consumption will rise from 5.23m tonnes to 6.69m.
Longer-term forecasts have world production of 8.57m tonnes and consumption
at 8.51m tonnes in 2010.
The report concludes that while supply exceeds demand, 'the likelihood of
more buffer stock intervention in the next few years is considerable'. Last
year the stock rose from 60,000 tonnes to 170,000 tonnes and could reach its
ceiling of 550,000 tonnes 'before 1995'.
But a world economic recovery, the report says, could mean a big change. The
long period of low prices has led to a fall in the growth of new planting.
'If the (world) economy recovers . . . it may be difficult to produce enough
natural rubber in the second half of the current decade and in the first
decade of the next century to satisfy demand.'
Increases in production are expected to come from Thailand, rising from
1.27m tonnes in 1990 to 1.76m tonnes by 2000, and Indonesia, from 1.25m
tonnes to 1.67m tonnes in the same period. These large increases will be
necessary to offset an expected decline in Malaysia's production from 1.32m
tonnes to 961,000 tonnes in the current decade.
Donor agencies say farmers replanting now will get a good price when their
trees reach maturity. In Indonesia, the World Bank and Asian Development
Bank have committed more than Dollars 300m in projects to rehabilitate and
expand smallholder plantations.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME and Comex in copper wrangle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Metal Exchange was willing to stock copper in its US warehouses
if that is what the American industry wanted, Mr Raj Bagri, the LME
chairman, indicated at a conference in New York.
He suggested the industry would benefit if it gave up its present system
where US copper producers set prices for their domestic market and instead
used LME prices. Mr Bagri pointed out that 55 brands of copper produced in
24 countries were registered for trading on the LME. 'There is international
confidence in our base reference prices which are transparently and
independently established,' he added.
However, Mr Joseph Robertson Jr, first vice chairman of the New York
Commodity Exchange, which also offers a copper contract, said that in his
many contacts with US copper producers and consumers 'I have yet to find
anyone who is interested in pushing or promoting LME pricing for their
domestic sales.'
The first LME warehouses in the US started operating only a year ago and
copper, which is traded in sterling in the LME 'ring', was excluded so as
not to challenge the Comex copper contract. This is a dollar contract and
occasionally presents arbitrage opportunities to LME traders. However,
recent turbulence in currency markets caused a change of heart among
London-based traders so the LME copper contract will shortly switch from
sterling to dollars. This eliminates the main reason for excluding copper
from US warehouses.
Mr Bagri said at the conference organised by American Metal Market magazine
he did not agree with those who suggested that putting copper into the LME's
US warehouses would cause the Comex contract to go into terminal decline.
The Comex contract would continue to thrive 'so long as Comex continues to
meet the expectations of its users and they want to continue to use it.'
He said there could be no carving up of territory between exchanges nor any
'no-go' areas as far as the LME was concerned. 'The LME has a duty and
obligation to its users to provide them with the best possible facilities.'
Comex's Mr Robertson, who stressed he was speaking personally, made it clear
that the New York exchange was in no mood to hand over business to the LME
without a fight.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UN cocoa talks enter final
round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL COCOA Organisation delegates gather in Geneva on Monday for a
fourth and final attempt to thrash out a new cocoa agreement under the
auspices of the United Nations.
Producers and consumers from 45 countries remain far apart after three
previous rounds, but observers are not writing off an agreement yet. 'Never
underestimate the powers of the UN negotiators, who spend all their lives
pushing this sort of thing through,' said one London analyst yesterday.
Another pointed out that the last cocoa agreement took five rounds to
negotiate, and only in the last did things get moving.
The 1986 agreement, which is operating on a purely adminstrative basis, ends
on September 30. Unlike the coffee agreement, the cocoa accord has no scope
for further extensions.
While producers and consumers were in November moving towards agreement over
the amount of cocoa which should be withheld from world markets to support
prices (between 330,000 and 380,000 tonnes), they were nowhere near agreeing
how to finance such a scheme.
The current agreement's market support system collapsed early in 1988 when
the ICCO buffer stock hit the maximum permitted level of 250,000 tonnes.
Since then some of the cocoa has been sold to finance storage of the
remaining 233,000 tonnes.
The buffer stock is owed Dollars 137m in unpaid levies, with the Ivory
Coast, the biggest producer, owing Dollars 75m. The EC, which accounts for
40 per cent of cocoa consumption, is adamant that any new agreement should
be financed by sales from the buffer stock and payment of existing levy
arrears by some producers. However, producers feel that the financial burden
of any new agreement should be shared.
If the financial hurdle is overcome in the next fortnight, the two sides
will still have to agree a price range to be defended. Producers in November
proposed a range between 1,180 Special Drawing Rights a tonne and SDR 1,770,
while consumers urged SDR 840 to SDR 1,260. The ICCO 10-day indicator price
was SDR 713.77 on Tuesday.
Adding to the difficulties are the fact that the US, the biggest consumer,
is not in the agreement, neither are Malaysia and Indonesia, the fourth and
fift biggest producers, who are attending the Geneva talks as observers.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mongstad faces tough targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY'S Mongstad oil refinery may have to be wound down or sold if it fails
to improve profitability over the next two years and become as competitive
as the best of continental Europe's refineries.
Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, Mongstad's operator, has
implemented a draconian programme to improve the return on its NKr12bn
(Dollars 1.73bn)investment made in the mid-1980s to upgrade and expand the
facility.
Mongstad has an annual refining capacity of 6.5m tonnes. The upgraded
facility came on stream at the end of 1989 at a cost overrun of NKr7bn,
creating what is widely considered to be one of Norway's biggest ever
industrial scandals. The event forced the resignation of Mr Arve Johnsen,
chief executive, followed by a reshuffle of the group's executive
management.
Statoil said yesterday that it had postponed an estimated NKr600m investment
programme for Mongstad meant to enable it to meet European Community targets
for gas/oil desulphurisation set for 1996.
Part of the plan to improve profitability calls for a 20 per cent reduction
in Mongstad's estimated 950 full-time and temporary employees by the end of
1994.
Mongstad's refining margins sank to just under Dollars 3 a barrel last year
from just more than Dollars 5 a barrel in 1991. The facility's amortisation
and finance costs have remained a drain on Statoil's cashflow since it was
commissioned.
Last year Mongstad suffered a NKr710m operating loss, including finance
costs, versus a NKr797m loss in 1991. Before finance costs, operating losses
rose to NKr224m last year from a loss of NKr132m in 1991. Statoil aims to
improve Mongstad's 'cash' operating profits 'amenable to in-house action' by
between NKr350m and NKr400m annually - before finance costs and depreciation
write-offs - during 1992. Of the total improvements, two-thirds will come
from operations and the rest from cost reduction measures.
The relentless problems at Mongstad are a combination of irregular
operations and high maintenance costs. Statoil refused yesterday to
speculate on specific future options for the refinery.
Mrs Berit Oeyen, a Statoil spokeswoman, said the company would be forced to
rethink Mongstad's future if big improvements to profitability are not made
by the end of next year.

PLATINUM group metals closed above the day's lows in London after falling in
the wake of an overnight report that Japanese car-makers will cut imports in
1993 and may sell metal from their stockpiles. 'Platinum and PALLADIUM
really needed a shake-out and I think that's what we've seen on the Japanese
news, but the main improvement in platinum demand is likely to be in Europe
and the US this year,' one dealer said. Nymex platinum and palladium futures
were down at midday. RHODIUM was quoted at Dollars 1,500 on the free market
in London, down Dollars 150 on the day; a possible retreat to Dollars 1,400
was predicted. ALUMINIUM and COPPER prices moved up to the higher ends of
comparatively narrow ranges on the LME. Dealers said aluminium's gains were
fostered by reports of a 36,000 tonne production cutback at a US smelter.
Talk also circulated that Bonneville Power Administration restrictions will
make power increasingly expensive for the aluminium smelters it services.

MR Z Lou Guttman, who on Wednesday afternoon received notice from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission that he was subject to serious trade
violation charges, became further embattled on Thursday when the leadership
of the New York Mercantile Exchange asked him to step down as chairman.
Mr Guttman, who has maintained his innocence in the trading case, refused to
relinquish the chair.
'Mr Guttman respectfully declined to resign, stating that this issue should
be decided by the membership, rather than the board,' said a statement
issued by the exchange on Thursday morning.
Directors of the Nymex, the world's largest energy market, will meet again
to consider if they should suspend Mr Guttman under an obscure clause in the
rulebook.
A board vote to suspend would have to be ratified by a vote of the entire
membership. With many members sympathetic to Mr Guttman's plight, the board
could face a membership defeat if it pushed the issue, one exchange official
noted.
Mr Guttman was charged with pre-arranged trading and other market violations
in connection with trades in options on sugar futures during 1989.
The CFTC civil complaint, which does not entail charges of fraud, says that
Mr Harold Magid, Mr Guttman's former partner, executed the allegedly
questionable trades for their joint account, but that Mr Guttman still
maintained responsibility for the transactions.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Hemp ban lifted - but for paper
not drugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK Home Office is to allow farmers to start commercial production of
hemp for the first time in more than 100 years. The fibres can be used for
manufacturing top quality paper.
Growing hemp was banned in the UK under the Misuse of Drugs Act (1971) as it
is the source of tetra hydra cannabinol (THC), or cannabis. The Home Office
said yesterday that growers would be 'subject to strict licensing controls'
to make sure that only varieties with no potential for drugs are grown.
However, varieties containing very low amounts of THC are already covered by
a long-standing EC regime and are grown in France and Spain. UK farmers will
be able to claim an EC grant of about Pounds 250 an acre.
Hemp used to be grown in the UK before it was undercut by imports in the
days of the British Empire, according to Mr Melvyn Askew, head of crops and
horticulture at Adas (the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service). He
believes it could once again become a useful crop for UK farmers, who are
having to set aside some of their land under the CAP reforms. From a seed
the size of wheat, it quickly grows to 4m tall.
'It's annual and easy to grow,' he said. 'It has a very long fibre, which
can be used for paper as well as linen, lace and ropes.'
He believes the paper market has big potential. Hemp fibre contains only a
small amount of lignium, the yellowing agent which needs expensive and
environmentally damaging bleaching treatment in wood pulp.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries soar at long end amid heavy
buying
</HEADLINE>

THE US Treasury market responded enthusiastically to President Clinton's
economic plan yesterday, with prices soaring at the long end of the maturity
range amid heavy buying.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 1 3/16 at 101
3/8 , yielding 7.010 per cent, a record low for the issue. At the short end
of the market, the two-year note was up  3/16 at 100 19/32 , to yield 3.913
per cent.
The State of the Union address on Wednesday night was well received by bond
investors, who believe that the deficit-cutting part of the president's
economic plan stands a reasonable chance of passing through Congress almost
intact.
Before the speech some investors had worried that the package would lack
credibility, but bond market analysts said that Mr Clinton's forthright
account of the economic troubles facing the country, and his outline of the
solutions, convinced investors that deficit reduction can work, and that the
planned tax increases will be implemented. The latter is doubly positive for
the Treasury market because higher taxes could slow the rate of economic
growth and subdue inflation.
Bond prices rose strongly despite economic news that was bearish for the
market. The day's statistics included a 19,000 drop in weekly jobless
claims, a larger-than-expected 0.5 per cent increase in January consumer
prices, and a 0.4 per cent rise in January industrial output.
BETTER-than-expected UK jobs data prompted little enthusiasm in the gilts
market yesterday, where prices ended virtually unchanged.
The number of unemployed rose by 22,100 in January, keeping the seasonally
adjusted total just below the 3m level.
The Bank of England's first inflation report earlier this week has also
deflated sentiment by suggesting that an early interest cut is not on the
cards, dealers said.
On the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, the long
gilt future ended at 102-27, down  3/16 from Wednesday's close, and off
earlier highs.
However, the two tap stocks announced on Tuesday afternoon were partly sold
yesterday, dealers said.
GERMAN government bonds firmed slightly yesterday, on market speculation
that money supply data due early next week will be positive for the bond
market. This would mean improved prospects for further interest rate cuts.
JAPANESE government bonds continued to rally on strong investor demand, but
came off the highs of the day as investors took profits. The recent rally in
Japanese government bonds has been helped by the strengthening of the yen
against the US dollar.
The June futures contract opened at 109.94 and traded up to a high of 110.15
before ending at 109.96.
ITALIAN bonds ended lower due to further political uncertainty, after the
Liberal party threatened to leave the coalition government. On Liffe, the
March BTP ended 19 basis points lower at 95.93 and was poised to test the
next support level at 95.70, some said.

US SECURITIES exchanges are responding aggressively to US budget proposals
that would impose transaction taxes on securities and derivatives markets,
writes Laurie Morse in Chicago. US futures and securities exchanges, as well
as the Futures Industry Association and the Securities Industry Association
are banding together to fight the proposal.
'We're opposed to industry-specific taxes,' said a spokesman for the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, 'They could put us at a competitive disadvantage
internationally, and they could hamper our liquidity.'
Congressman Mr Daniel Rostenkowski said in a letter to the Treasury
Secretary, that while such taxes may be perceived as a tax on the wealthy,
the burden 'ultimately will fall on the millions of middle-class pension
fund beneficiaries and small investors'.

FT  19 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Strong demand for Sweden's Dollars 2bn
global offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STREAM of large international issues continued yesterday as the Kingdom
of Sweden launched its Dollars 2bn, 10-year global offering to strong
demand.
Meanwhile, Toyota Motor Corp announced that it planned to raise Dollars
1.5bn through a five-year offering early next week in what would be the
largest corporate deal yet seen in the Eurobond market.
Toyota's offering is expected to be priced to yield around 40 basis points
above comparable US Treasuries, which syndicate managers said was fair value
in view of the car manufacturer's triple A rating and its scarcity value in
the market.
The proposed yield is close to that on Toyota's Dollars 1bn five-year
Eurobond which was launched last May, the biggest corporate issue currently.
The flood of issues fanned rumours yesterday that a big UK corporate utility
or a Scandinavian sovereign was sounding the market for a possible
sterling-denominated Eurobond.
Officials at the joint lead underwriters of the Swedish deal, Salomon
Brothers and Morgan Stanley, said that demand for the bonds was centred in
Europe but that there was also good interest from Tokyo and New York.
However, they discounted market talk that the deal would be raised to
Dollars 3bn.
There were reports that European investors were willing to pay 40 basis
points above the the 6 1/4 per cent US Treasury due 2003, well below the
indicated range of 42-45 basis points. This suggested that the deal would be
priced at the lower end of the range.
The current fashion of global deals is expected to continue during the next
few weeks and the Republic of Italy is said to be considering a dollar
global offering.
The World Bank's Y200bn global offering, launched on Wednesday, was priced
at 25 basis points over the benchmark Japanese government bond No 145
yesterday. This was at the lower end of the indicated range of 25 to 27
basis points and in line with expectations.
The World Bank also took advantage of investor demand for high-yielding debt
instruments by issuing the Eurobond market's first floating rate note based
on the yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds. This contrasts with other recent
note issues with minimum and maximum coupon levels, which have been tied to
short-term interest rates.
An official at Lehman Brothers International, which arranged the Dollars
100m five-year note for the World Bank, said that this type of note was
attractive to investors who believed that the US yield curve would remain
steep or flatten only gradually.
The note was issued at par to yield 50 per cent of the US Federal Reserve's
Constant Maturity Treasury plus 145 basis points. The CMT reflects the
average blend of 10-year US Treasuries, currently at 6.29 per cent.
The minimum coupon on the notes is 4.6 per cent, which compares with
three-month dollar Libor of 3.25 per cent, and the maximum is 25 per cent.
By late yesterday, the bonds had not been freed to trade.
Lehman Brothers also provided the market's other colourful issue, a Dollars
125m five-year offering for the Mexican company, Gruma, the world's largest
tortilla manufacturer. Gruma generates Dollars 300m annually in the US.
The bonds were priced to yield 445 basis points above the 5 3/4 per cent US
Treasuries due 1998, in the middle of the indicated range of 430-455 basis
points.
An official at Lehman said that price was chosen so that both the issuer and
the investors could share the impact of the rise in the underlying US bond
prices yesterday.
She added that the yield was close to that of other dollar-denominated
Mexican corporate paper.

FT  19 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Kuwaitis concede serious
damage from KIO row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE KUWAITI authorities have for the first time conceded that the row
surrounding investments by the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) in Spain is
seriously damaging the emirate's standing in international credit markets.
Mr Abdullah al-Gabandi, the head of the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA,
the KIO's controlling body), told a group of Spanish journalists in Kuwait
that Kuwait had been forced to postpone a borrowing in the international
capitals planned for December.
'The loss of image provoked by the KIO case and the way it has been treated
makes it difficult to obtain credits and those that are available would be
very expensive,' Mr al-Gabandi was quoted as saying.
The KIA negotiated a Dollars 5.5bn loan for Kuwait soon after the war that
ended the Iraqi invasion in 1991. But after new managers took over the KIO
last May they quickly became involved in a vitriolic and public row over
what they allege was Dollars 5bn lost by their predecessors in risky
investments in Spain. Bankers in London said yesterday the row had
'inevitably' undermined the emirate's position in debt markets.
There are few signs of the row subsiding although two attempts to bring
criminal charges against former managers of the KIO and its Spanish
operations have been rebuffed this year by the Spanish courts for lack of
evidence.
The new KIO management says it is determined to continue pursuing Sheikh
Fahad al-Sabah, the former KIO chairman, Mr Fouad Jaffar, its former general
manager, and Mr Javier de la Rosa, the former manager of their Spanish
operations, for alleged fraud.
While this effort will keep the affair public, it appears increasingly to
have Kuwaiti political rather than legal objectives. Mr al-Gabandi, who said
Kuwaitis were 'furious' about what had happened in Spain, pointedly did not
accuse the former KIO management of illegalities. Instead, he said the KIA's
investment guidelines had been ignored. The KIO should have contracted an
institution and not Mr de la Rosa to run its affairs in Spain, he said.
These remarks reflect the marked differences of opinion now emerging from
Kuwait on just how the KIO's Spanish debacle should be concluded. The new
KIO management currently reports directly to the finance minister and is
being encouraged to keep up public pressure on the former KIO management.
In contrast, Mr al-Gabandi appears to favour an internal, less public,
settlement which would in effect shift Kuwait's sensitive finances away from
public scrutiny.
The desirability of the KIA taking control of all of the KIO's direct
investments overseas has been canvassed inside Kuwait in recent weeks.

SOUTH China Morning Post Holdings, part of Mr Rupert Murdoch's News
Corporation which publishes Hong Kong's leading English language newspaper,
has reported slower first-half profits but plans to pay an unchanged interim
dividend.
Net profit for the six months to ended December fell to Dollars HK253.8m
(USDollars 32.8m), a 5 per cent decline from the Dollars HK267.3m recorded
in on 1991. The interim dividend is being held at 6 cents a share.
The profits decline was a result of the acquisition of loss-making Chinese
language newspaper Wah Kiu Yat Po. An additional factor was a substantially
increased tax bill, due to the company having had fully utilised tax losses
that had resulted in minimal tax over the previous five years.
Tax increased from Dollars HK37,000 to Dollars HK34.8m, but the company
predicted that net profit for the full year would exceed the 1992 level.
After years of inactivity, the publishing group recently signed up a Dollars
HK500m deal to sell its premises in Quarry Bay to Swire Pacific, moving its
printing and distribution oper-ations to the New Territories.
The company has also purchased a 15 per cent stake in the Bangkok Post in
Thailand, while it is currently endeavouring to turn around the ailing Wah
Kiu Yat Po.
Kong Wah Holdings, the Hong Kong consumer electronics group, has ventured
into China's container port development through a joint venture with a
Shenzhen-based concern, AP-DJ reports from Hong Kong. The venture, Shenzhen
Harbour City Industrial Development, will have an initial capital of about
160m yuan (USDollars 27.7m). It will develop container terminals and a
warehouse complex in the development zone.
The Chinese partner is Nanhai Oil Shenzhen Development and Service.

UMW HOLDINGS. one of Malaysia's biggest motor vehicle assemblers and heavy
equipment distributors, has announced a 34 per cent drop in pre-tax profits
to MDollars 137.6m (USDollars 52m) for 1992.
UMW says government measures to curb consumer spending and control
inflation, particularly restrictions on hire-purchase agreements, caused a
sharp drop in vehicle sales and profits.
UMW says vehicle sales are likely to pick up with the recent lifting of some
of these restrictions.
UMW, the listed subsidiary of state-owned Permodalan Nasional, is one of the
main partners, along with Daihatsu of Japan, in Malaysia's
recently-announced second national car project. The initial cost of the new
car project is put at MDollars 400m.
Malaysia already produces the Proton car in co-operation with Mitsubishi.

<TEXT>
KIRIN BREWERY, Japan's largest food and beverage company, reported a rise in
1992 sales thanks mainly to its premium beer, Ichiban Shibori, but posted a
fall in non-consolidated profits.
Pre-tax profits fell 4.3 per cent to Y82.7bn (Dollars 689m), despite a 3.8
per cent rise in sales to Y1,366.1bn. Kirin said sales of its core
businesses, including beer and pharmaceuticals, showed a firm increase.
After-tax profits improved by 2.2 per cent to Y37.5bn.
Kirin's balance on financial items fell by Y8.8bn, due to a decline in
interest income and a Y900bn loss on its stock holdings. However, a 3.4 per
cent rise in beer sales to Y1,328bn and a 84.5 per cent jump in
pharmaceutical sales to Y18.6bn contributed to the overall sales rise.
Kirin said it would be introducing a new brand called Nippon Blend. Japan's
brewers face increasing pressure to produce a number of new brews each year
and are now seeing competition from imported brands.
This year, Kirin expects pre-tax profits to rise 0.3 per cent to Y83bn on a
3.2 per cent rise in sales to Y1,410bn.
The brewer warns that increased losses on financial items would depress
profits. Annual capital spending is expected to rise 15.2 per cent to Y98bn.

FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Records continue to tumble on
Wall Street - Why this week's losses on equities were only a natural
correction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO FAR, 1993 has been good to the US securities industry, which is quietly
confident that this year will prove as profitable as 1992, when every record
in the book fell before the Wall Street earnings juggernaut.
Since the New Year, two of the main engines of profits growth for securities
firms - brokerage commissions and underwriting revenues - have been firing
strongly.
Trading volumes on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq electronic
market have been running at extremely high levels, averaging 267m shares and
259m shares a day respectively. That is 32 per cent and 36 per cent more
than in 1992, which was itself a record year for volume. When trading is
busy, brokerage commissions blossom.
On the investment banking side, Wall Street houses continue to prosper.
According to Securities Data in New York, during the first six weeks of this
year new issues of straight corporate debt and equity (including initial
public offerings of stock) totalled Dollars 66.6bn, compared with Dollars
59.8bn in the same period of 1992.
With underwriting business currently running ahead of 1992 - a year when all
previous records for securities issuance were shattered - Wall Street's
investment bankers are working in top gear, and earning fees to match.
The third engine of earnings growth is trading profits, and here the picture
is less bright in the wake of recent setbacks in the equity markets,
triggered by President Clinton's planned tax increases.
The profits firms earn from trading their own positions are driven by the
direction of markets. And, while bond prices have remained strong - thanks
to low inflation, cuts in the size of government bond issues and confidence
in President Clinton's ability to reduce the huge Federal deficit - the main
equity indices have stumbled, barely a week after soaring to record highs.
The heavy selling of the past few days could prove a problem for securities
firms if it presages a significant correction in equity prices. As Mr John
Keefe, of Keefe Worldwide Information Services, explains: 'When the market
is down, it hurts trading profits because brokers cannot escape their long
positions. And, if prices keep going down, people will leave the market.'
The latter is the scenario that Wall Street fears most. A feature of the
industry's boom has been the return of the individual investor to the stock
market, which has had a positive knock-on effect on almost every line of
business.
It has boosted brokerage commissions; lifted trading profits by keeping
prices buoyant; fuelled strong growth in firms' revenues from asset
management, because individuals have been entrusting more of their money to
professional managers; and provided a huge pool of capital to invest in new
corporate stock, thus keeping the underwriters busy.
Few Wall Street economists, however, are predicting the stock market will
nosedive this year. The run-up in prices two weeks ago was based on
confidence in the economic and business outlook. The subsequent downturn was
disappointment at the President's plans for tax increases, which investors
fear could retard growth.
Hence, this week's losses were viewed as a natural correction that is
unlikely to turn into a rout. Most forecasters expect the Dow Jones
Industrial Average and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 to end 1993 with solid
gains for the year.
Wall Street is also confident that the flows of investor capital into
equities will not dry up. Interest rates remain at 30-year lows, which means
investors will move their money out of poor-yielding short-term assets, like
cash and money-market funds, and into more speculative but higher-yielding
assets, like stocks.
Unless interest rates rise sharply this year, funds are likely to continue
to pour into the equity markets. This will keep commissions buoyant and help
sustain growth in the fee-based revenues securities firms earn from managing
customers' assets - a relatively new area of business that Wall Street firms
have been building up in recent years as a protection against more volatile
trading-related revenues.
Low interest rates are also good for securities firms in other ways. First,
they keep the underwriters busy. In the past two years, US companies, eager
to take advantage of low borrowing rates, have been issuing new debt in
record amounts. They have also been issuing record amounts of new equity
because of strong stock markets and heavy demand from investors.
Second, low rates keep down the cost of the industry's raw material -
capital. The big firms are particularly good at leveraging that capital and
using it to make big profits from proprietary trading. Moreover, if the
spread between short and long-term rates remains wide this year, as it has
for the past 18 months, then Wall Street will continue to reap profits from
borrowing short and lending long.
Much, therefore, depends on the interest rate environment remaining
favourable. Although rates will probably rise this year as economic growth
improves, President Clinton's planned tax increases, coupled with his
relatively tough stance on cutting the deficit, plus low inflation, should
keep interest rates at levels that are still low by recent historical
standards.
While the overall outlook for the securities industry is bright, at least
one leading firm faces a rocky road. In the recent batch of fourth-quarter
1992 results, Shearson Lehman Brothers stood out with a large loss, incurred
in the wake of write-downs for litigation and soured property investments.
The problems at Shearson, however, go deeper than possible legal action and
ill-judged past investments. The firm's costs, especially its employee
compensation payments, have been growing faster than revenues.

FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Sparebanken reduces its losses

SPAREBANKEN NOR, Nor-way's biggest savings bank known internationally as
Union Bank of Norway, yesterday announced a significant reduction to NKr169m
(Dollars 24.3m) in pre-tax losses for 1992, from NKr1.03bn a year earlier.
The recovery was due to an increase in net interest income to NKr2.6bn, from
NKr2.5bn, and a rise in operating income to NKr3.7bn from NKr3.3bn. But
losses on loans and guarantees stayed at NKr1.5bn, the same as 1991.
Operating losses, including credit losses, fell to NKr271m last year, from
NKr907m. The bank said it had reduced costs by 12 per cent to NKr2.4bn.
'The substantial work which was undertaken to reduce costs and improve the
bank's operational income yielded results in a difficult market. The bank's
income before losses was significantly improved,' Sparebanken Nor said.
Operating profit, before credit losses and write-offs, more than doubled to
NKr1.3bn, from NKr602m in 1991.
Sparebanken Nor said the domestic economic situation last year was weak and
that bankruptcies had risen to a record level as property prices continued
to fall.
The bank said it would make a loss for 1993 but that this would show another
substantial reduction. Last year, Sparebanken Nor improved its capital
adequacy to 9.2 per cent of risk-weighted assets, from 6 per cent in 1991.
The bank said that the past year had seen reduced demand and tougher
competition.
Alubaf Arab International Bank (AAIB) returned to profit in 1992 after heavy
losses in the previous two years caused by the Gulf crisis, Reuter reports
from Manama. The Bahrain-based offshore bank said net profit was Dollars
512,000, compared with losses of Dollars 27.3m in 1991 and Dollars 64.5m in
1990.
AAIB, now part of the Libyan Arab Foreign Bank group, has used its entire
paid-up capital and reserves to write-off accumulated losses.

INDEPENDENT Newspapers, the New Zealand publishing company 49 per cent owned
by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, has lifted its operating profit after
tax by 43 per cent in the six months ended December 31, agencies report from
Wellington.
Net profit after tax for the period amounted to NZDollars 23.4m (USDollars
12.1m) or 20.6 cents a share, against NZDollars 16.3m or 14.4 cents in the
first half of 1991. Sales improved by 4.8 per cent, to NZDollars 494.1m from
NZDollars 471.4m.
Pre-tax profit amounted to NZDollars 40.53m against NZDollars 28.54m
previously.
The group said that it was poised to meet or exceed its full-year profit
targets but it did not specify what those targets were.
INL increased its interim dividend to 8 cents a share from last year's 7
cents.
'There have been demonstrable signs of a recovery in confidence in New
Zealand with a pronounced improvement in advertising demand across all
areas,' INL said. But it added that the same confidence in recovery could
not be found in Australia or parts of the US.
Operating profits had risen but had come from a very low base. Gains had
come from cost efficiencies through technology rather than from significant
growth in revenue.

MCCAW Cellular Communications, the wireless telecommunications group,
yesterday announced fourth quarter operating income of Dollars 178.8m, up
from Dollars 125.3m a year earlier.
The company recorded a Dollars 82.5m net loss for the quarter, however,
because McCaw's rapid growth over the past few years has left it with a
heavy debt burden, consistently putting the company in the red.
For the year, operating income was Dollars 644.5m, up from Dollars 460.6m in
1991. But after debt payments, there was a net loss of Dollars 364.7m in
1992.
Net revenues in the fourth quarter attributable to McCaw's cellular
interests jumped 37 per cent to Dollars 363.4m.
Lin Broadcasting, a cellular company in which McCaw has a 52 per cent stake,
had a net fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 15.4m, or 30 cents a share, down
from 1991's Dollars 27.4m deficit.

FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: George Weston income drops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARPLY lower profits are reported by George Weston, holding company for the
Weston family's North American interests.
Net income for 1992 fell to CDollars 48m (USDollars 38m) or 85 cents a share
from 1991's CDollars 92m or CDollars 1.81 a share. In contrast, sales
increased to CDollars 11.6m from CDollars 10.77m.
However, the latest figures allow for special provisions of CDollars 25m for
plant closings, consolidation in the fresh bread business and financial
restructurings. There was a CDollars 10m provision to cover problems with a
US subsidiary sold in 1988. The 1991 profit includes a CDollars 30m gain on
the issue of shares by a subsidiary.
Earlier in the day, Loblaw, Canada's biggest food distributor which is
controlled by the George Weston group, reported fourth-quarter net profits
of CDollars 28.8m, down from CDollars 29.5m, on revenues 19 per cent ahead
at CDollars 2.4bn. Earnings per share came to 33 cents in both periods. For
the year, net profits fell 24 per cent to CDollars 79.8m or 88 cents a
share, from CDollars 104.7m or CDollars 1.17. Revenues rose 8 per cent to
CDollars 9.6bn.
Loblaw said it continued to improve market share and expected reasonable
growth this year.
Confederation Life, one of Canada's biggest insurers, has been hit by
property woes. Net profits for 1992 fell to CDollars 1.9m, after CDollars
161m of special charges, from CDollars 17.3m a year earlier. Revenues
slipped by nearly 10 per cent to CDollars 3.9bn.
Torstar, publisher of the Toronto Star, Canada's biggest daily newspaper,
earned net profits of CDollars 48.8m or CDollars 1.21 a share in 1992,
including a CDollars 54m special gain, against losses of CDollars 3.4m or 9
cents a share in 1991.
Revenues rose 3 per cent to 921m. Newspaper publishing was hit by lower
advertising, but books improved, the group said.

FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Proposed buy-out of Univa meets
opposition

<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CDollars 41bn (USDollars 32.5bn) Caisse de Depot, the investment arm of
the Quebec public pension plan, disagrees with a CDollars 11 a share buy-out
of Univa, the Quebec-based food distributor, proposed on February 9 by
Blackstone Group, the New York investment bankers.
As the owner of 17.3 per cent, fully-diluted, of Univa, the Caisse says the
Blackstone offer does not recognise Univa's potential for recovery from the
downward cycle in food distribution.
While the Caisse uses the word disagree, it leaves little doubt it will
oppose the potential offer. The Caisse is an independent agency of the
provincial government but usually works with public policy.
The proposal, worth CDollars 1.03bn, was made by Blackstone Capital Partners
and Mr Bertin Nadeau, chairman of Univa and its biggest shareholder with 26
per cent of the equity.
Blackstone offered CDollars 11 a share for all Univa's 94m common shares. As
part of the deal, Mr Nadeau would re-acquire a 20 per cent interest in
Univa.
Univa is Canada's second biggest food distributor and has an affiliate in
California and several non-food subsidiaries. Mr Nadeau's stake is held
through Unigesco, his own heavily-indebted holding company.
The Blackstone proposal is being studied by a committee of Univa's board.
One problem is that the proposal is structured as a leveraged buy-out and
Univa would be saddled with well over CDollars 1bn debt.
The Caisse says the proposal does not assure the integrity of Univa.

<TEXT>
SCHRODER Ventures, the venture-capital arm of Schroders, the UK merchant
bank, is to dilute its 51 per cent shareholding in Mitel through a public
equity offering by the Canadian telephone equipment maker.
Mitel said yesterday that it was in the process of filing a prospectus for a
common share issue underwritten by Scotia-McLeod, Midland Walwyn and Wood
Gundy.
The size and price of the offering will be determined in early March.
Mitel begins presentations to institutional investors and analysts in London
today.
Schroder, representing several international investment partnerships, bought
its stake in Mitel from British Telecom last year.
It has indicated that it will buy up to CDollars 10m (USDollars 7.9m) of the
newly-issued shares.
As a result, Schroder's shareholding is expected to be reduced, but it is
likely to remain the largest single shareholder.
Schroder paid CDollars 1 per share for the BT stake last June. Mitel shares
closed at CDollars 2.15 down CDollars 0.10 on the Toronto stock exchange
yesterday.

<TEXT>
VITRO, the large Mexican glass company, yesterday announced net profits of
602m new pesos (Dollars 200m) last year, 11 per cent less in real terms than
in 1991. Sales reached 10.32bn new pesos, a 2.4 per cent increase after
inflation.
The company blamed the fall in profits on the sluggish growth in Mexico and
the US, higher domestic interest rates and real appreciation of the peso.
Nearly half of Vitro's sales were in the US, making it particularly
vulnerable to a strong peso and a weak US economy.
During the year Vitro acquired two local glass companies - Vidriera Oriental
and Alum de Mexico - and bought ACI of the US. Without these acquisitions,
sales last year would have fallen by 3 per cent.
Mr Ernesto Martens, chief executive, said 1992 was 'a complex period due to
macroeconomic conditions', but said he hoped this year his company would
consolidate dynamic growth, reduce the level of indebtedness, and improve
productivity.
Vitro's margins fell particularly sharply in the US, in part due to
operating difficulties with Anchor Glass, its US subsidiary. Exports,
however, reached Dollars 377m, an increase in dollar terms of 7.4 per cent.

Desjardins operates nearly 1,500 retail banking branches, life and general

<TEXT>
HENKEL, the German chemicals, cosmetics and household goods group, recorded
a 10 per cent fall in profits last year, mainly due to the costs of
restructuring and acquisitions.
Pre-tax profits for the year ended December 31, 1992, fell to 'around
DM400m' (Dollars 250m) while total sales rose by 9 per cent to DM14.1bn.
Sales in Germany grew by 5 per cent and sales abroad rose by 16 per cent.
Turnover was boosted by a 53 per cent increase in sales of cosmetics, which
rose from DM1bn to DM1.5bn as a result of the acquisition from Sweden's
Nobel Industrier of Barnangen, the household and personal products company.
Henkel bought Barnangen early last year for DM900m. A company spokesman said
the fall in profits was mainly due to the cost of financing the acquisition
and to the expected bigger marketing costs for Barnangen products. Cosmetics
sales accounted in 1992 for 10.9 per cent of the group's total sales, as
compared with 7.8 per cent the previous year.
The group also suffered an undisclosed fall in the sales of chemicals
products, which had been hard hit by the appreciation of the D-Mark against
the dollar in 1992.

<TEXT>
TURNER Broadcasting System (TBS), the Atlanta-based cable television empire
controlled by Mr Ted Turner, yesterday reported a 30 per cent decline in net
profits for the last three months of 1992, to Dollars 30m.
Revenues in the 1992 fourth quarter rose to Dollars 538m from Dollars 402m a
year before.
The company's full-year net income fell to Dollars 78m from Dollars 86m in
1991.
Consolidated revenues for the whole of 1992 were 20 per cent higher at
Dollars 1.77bn, while operating profits for the year declined slightly, to
Dollars 289m from Dollars 297m in 1991.
TBS attributed the fall to special charges associated with the termination
of operations for the Checkout Channel, a cable service used in
supermarkets.
Without this charge TBS said operating profit for the whole of last year
would have risen by 3 per cent to Dollars 305m, while net profits for 1992
would have been Dollars 94m.
The operating profit of CNN, Headline News and CNN International, the news
channels, rose by 8 per cent in 1992, but the news division suffered an
overall fall of 8 per cent to Dollars 155m because of the Checkout Channel
charges.
Revenues in the news division were 12 per cent higher at Dollars 536m.
Operating profit for 1992 in the entertainment division was Dollars 176m, an
11 per cent rise over the previous year. Revenues in the division were 19
per cent better at Dollars 847m for the 12-month period.
Syndication and licensing revenues were 35 per cent improved in 1992 at
Dollars 259m, thanks largely to home video and theatrical revenues. However,
the division suffered a Dollars 15.7m loss, more than double the 1991 loss
of Dollars 5.5m.
The sports division produced Dollars 11.2m of operating profits, up from
Dollars 2.3m in 1991.
Sports revenues were Dollars 83.3m last year, compared to Dollars 53.2m in
1991.

FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Bramalea creditors approve
proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO leading groups of creditors of Bramalea, one of three property companies
controlled by Edper-Hees of Toronto, have approved its planned financial
restructuring.
The company expects other creditor groups to come into line, enabling it to
emerge from bankruptcy protection and return to profitability in 1994.
The two creditor groups comprise mortgage holders owed CDollars 800m
(USDollars 634.9m) and others with CDollars 1.5bn of claims against Bramalea
secured income properties. The banks, owed CDollars 1.4bn, have approved the
plan. The remaining creditor groups are to vote on the restructuring by this
evening.
Bramalea, a North American property and land developer, plans to sell
CDollars 2.2bn of assets in the next five years and exchange debt for
equity. The assets include nine US shopping centres, as well as office
buildings and shopping malls in Canada. This would reduce debt by half.
Trizec, a larger publicly-traded property company also controlled by
Edper-Hees will see its interest in Bramalea fall from 70 per cent to 20 per
cent, with the creditors taking effective control.
Elan Energy, the former Lasmo Canada and fully independent from Lasmo, the
UK energy group, is buying OMV Canada from OMV Gruppe of Austria for
CDollars 180m.
OMV Canada has reserves of 28.5m barrels of oil and 73bn cu ft of natural
gas, and has strong cashflow from production. Elan has developed its
directional drilling techniques in western Canada, and has become a
medium-size exploration, development and production group. It recently
bought producing properties from Chevron, Imperial Oil and Petro-Canada. Oil
production is running at about 20,000 b/d.
Lasmo sold its 55 per cent interest in Lasmo Canada last year in a public
offer. Then Lasmo Canada changed its name to Elan Energy.

FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Restructure scheme is unveiled
by TWA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANS World Airlines (TWA), the bankrupt and debt-laden US carrier, has
presented its long-awaited reorganisation plan, in which it told a Delaware
court it hoped to emerge from bankruptcy this spring.
The plan - presented by the airline and its official unsecured creditors'
committee - provides for the elimination of about Dollars 4bn in total
claims against TWA. It calls for the distribution of new TWA common and
preferred stock to the airline's creditors and employees and the issue of
new debt securities.
Under the plan TWA's creditors would receive cash and new debt and equity
securities. TWA employees would own 45 per cent of the common stock of the
reorganised airline; the employees have agreed about Dollars 660m of wage
and benefit cuts over a three-year period.
The remaining 55 per cent of common stock, as well as 100 per cent of
preferred stock and new debt securities, would be distributed to various
unsecured creditors.
Mr Glenn Zander and Mr Robin Wilson, TWA's co-chief executives, said the
plan set the stage for the airline to emerge from bankruptcy ahead of the
peak summer travel season.
They claimed it established the framework of a sound debt and capital
structure under which TWA could return to profitability.
Mr Charles MacDonald, chairman of the creditors' committee, called the plan
'a watershed event' and said that while negotiations would continue, the
filing of the plan meant the main elements had won general acceptance.
The next step is expected to be a court hearing on TWA's statement, to be
held soon. The plan cannot become effective without further bankruptcy court
proceedings and acceptance by TWA creditors.
The plan's strategy includes shrinking TWA operations to eliminate
unprofitable routes and reconfiguring the aircraft fleet.

based in Singapore

<TEXT>
WHIRLPOOL, the world's largest white goods manufacturer, said yesterday it
was setting up an Asian headquarters in Singapore to expand its presence in
the sector's fastest growing region.
The move is important for Michigan-based Whirlpool's strategy to become the
first global player in the white goods industry.
'With our position in the US, Europe and Latin America, two-thirds of our
strategy is in place. Asia is the one missing ingredient,' said Mr David
Whitwam, chairman and chief executive, at the Domotechnica appliances fair
in Cologne.
Whirlpool has subsidiaries in several Asian countries: an office in Hong
Kong that is developing its Chinese strategy and a manufacturing joint
venture in India.
It is the largest western player in an Asian white goods market dominated by
Japanese and Korean suppliers, but still has a market share of only 1 per
cent, said Mr Whitwam.
He predicted that within two years the Asian market for white goods would be
bigger than either western Europe or the US - where units sales were 42m and
40m respectively last year for the seven main types of large appliance.
Unit sales in Asia would grow by an average 6 per cent to 8 per cent a year
over the next few years, compared with an average 2 per cent to 3 per cent
in Europe and the US, he said.
The Singapore office would pave the way for a change in Whirlpool's
procurement strategy for Asia.
It imports white goods from Europe and the US, or purchases them from local
suppliers.
The new office will include product development staff who will design white
goods for Asia's many different markets, and manufacturing experts.
Mr Whitwam said Whirlpool would evolve towards expanding its manufacturing
in Asia through wholly-owned subsidiaries, alliances and joint ventures.
Whirlpool sells both upmarket Bauknecht machines and value-for-money Roper
products in Asia, which offered 'a broad array of opportunities', said Mr
Whitwam.
Whirlpool's brand strategy may not yet be as clearly defined in Asia as in
Europe or the US, he said, but the Whirlpool mid-market brand would be the
cornerstone.

<TEXT>
TRANSAMERICA, the San Francisco-based financial services group, yesterday
reported record fourth-quarter profits from continuing operations of Dollars
86.5m, thanks to strong performances from its consumer lending, leasing,
property services and life insurance operations.
The group's net income for the quarter, however, was only Dollars 11.9m,
after a Dollars 75m provision for estimated losses from the disposal of a
majority interest in its property casualty insurance operations, which will
be sold in the second quarter through an initial public offering of stock.
In the fourth quarter last year, TransAmerica incurred a loss of Dollars
94.5m in the wake of a Dollars 130m after-tax charge at its commercial
lending unit.
For the full year 1992, TransAmerica reported net income of Dollars 243m, up
from Dollars 50.1m in 1991. Excluding the provision for discontinued
operations and investment gains, the group's earnings last year totalled a
record Dollars 337.8m.
Among TransAmerica's various businesses, earnings from the consumer lending
operations set records for both the final quarter and year, while the
commercial finance operation bounced back into profit after four quarters of
losses in 1991.
The group's leasing operation reported a small increase in quarterly
earnings, and profits at its property tax services business were at record
levels.
On the insurance side, operating income from life insurance rose 25 per cent
in the final quarter.

FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Navistar reduces loss to Dollars
5m on improved sales
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AN increase in deliveries of medium and heavy trucks and diesel engines
helped Chicago-based Navistar International to trim its first-quarter loss
to Dollars 5m, or 5 cents per share, from last year's first-quarter deficit
of Dollars 32m, or 16 cents.
Mr James Cotting, chairman, attributed the improvement to higher sales and
reduced operating costs.
Sales revenue at the company, which is north America's largest truck
manufacturer formerly known as International Harvester, rose by 15 per cent
to Dollars 1.03bn in the quarter, up from Dollars 902m a year earlier.
Much of Navistar's sales gains reflected a 13 per cent increase in retail
deliveries, to 16,800 units in the quarter. Shipments of mid-range diesel
engines to other truck manufactures rose 18 per cent, and sales of
replacement parts rose 6 per cent over the first quarter of 1992.
Navistar said orders for its trucks continued to be strong in the second
quarter. As a result, the company revised upwards its projections for north
American medium and heavy truck sales. For 1993, it projects industry demand
for medium trucks and school buses will reach 129,700 units, about 10 per
cent higher than 1992. It is projecting heavy truck demand at 147,800 units
this year, an 18 per cent increase.
Navistar is in the middle of talks with its unions to restructure healthcare
and retirement costs. In January, Navistar employees represented by the
United Auto Workers Union ratified a new labour agreement.
The company's long-term debt in its manufacturing operations, as a
percentage of equity, rose to 33 per cent in the first quarter, up from 21
per cent in the same period of 1992.

FRAMATOME, the French state-controlled nuclear reactor group, is negotiating
with CEA-Industrie, another public sector nuclear concern, to buy a 20 per
cent stake in Technicatome, which specialises in nuclear motors for the
marine field.
The planned investment in Technicatome, which was a profitable business with
sales of about FFr1bn (Dollars 183m) last year, forms part of its ongoing
strategy of reducing its reliance on its declining traditional nuclear
activities.
Framatome on Tuesday disclosed a fall in net profits to FFr900m last year
from FFr980m in 1991 on sales down from FFr14.2bn to FFr12.5bn over the same

<TEXT>
LOBLAW, Canada's biggest food distributor and controlled by the George
Weston group, slowed a long slide in profits in the final quarter of the
fiscal year ended January 2 1993.
However, food price wars in eastern Canada and the US continued and Loblaw
took a special CDollars 10m (USDollars 7.90) charge to cover problems with a
US subsidiary recently sold.
Fourth-quarter net profits fell to CDollars 28.8m from CDollars 29.5m, on
revenues 19 per cent ahead at CDollars 2.4bn. Per-share earnings came to 33
cents in both periods. For the year, net profits fell 24 per cent to
CDollars 79.8m or 88 cents a share, from CDollars 104.7m or CDollars 1.17.
Revenues rose 8 per cent to CDollars 9.6bn.
Loblaw said it continued to improve market share and expected reasonable
growth this year.
Confederation Life, one of Canada's biggest insurers, has been hit by
property woes. Net profits for 1992 fell to CDollars 1.9m, after CDollars
161m of special charges, from CDollars 17.3m a year earlier. Revenues
slipped by nearly 10 per cent to CDollars 3.9bn. Commercial property
investments totalled CDollars 7.5bn or 40 per cent of assets.
Torstar, publisher of the Toronto Star, Canada's biggest daily newspaper,
earned net profits of CDollars 48.8m or CDollars 1.21 a share in 1992,
including a CDollars 54m special gain, against losses of CDollars 3.4m or 9
cents a share in 1991. Revenues rose 3 per cent to 921m. Newspaper
publishing was hit by lower advertising, but books improved, the group said.
Molson, the Canadian brewing and retailing group, plans to buy back up to
4.48m non-voting A shares and may propose a bye law to ensure that A
stockholders would participate equally with the voting stock in case of a
takeover. The buy-back will be financed with CDollars 180m received in a
brewing deal with Miller of the US.

shipping arm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
KVAERNER, the diversified Norwegian group with main interests in
engineering, shipping and shipbuilding, registered a fall in 1992 pre-tax
profit to NKr932m (Dollars 136.7m) from NKr1.12bn a year earlier.
The group will lift its dividend payment to NK5 a share from NKr3.
The weaker result was due to substantial losses by the group's mechanical
engineering and shipping divisions. Shipping operations plunged into a
NKr115m pre-tax loss last year from a NKr4m profit in 1991 while mechanical
engineering widened pre-tax losses to NKr232m from NKr51m.
Shipbuilding, which accounted for nearly 80 per cent of group profits,
increased pre-tax profit by NKr204m to NKr735m last year.
Group net revenue rose to NKr20bn from NKr18.7bn in 1991, but operating
costs increased to NKr18.4bn from NKr16.9bn.
Kvaerner forecast 1993 pretax profit to be on a par with last year's,
despite an expected weaker shipbuilding market.

FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Gehe in move to create Europe's
biggest pharmaceutical wholesaler

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GEHE, a leading German drugs wholesaler, yesterday announced a FFr800
(Dollars 144) per share agreed takeover offer for France's leading
wholesaler, Office Commercial Pharmaceutique.
The merger would create the largest European pharmaceuticals distribution
business, with sales of around DM14bn (Dollars 8.5bn) a year. The two
companies already have an alliance with AAH, the UK wholesaler. The deal
would ease access to other markets in the European Community and eastern
Europe, Gehe said yesterday.
The Stuttgart-based German group said it would go ahead with the takeover if
it received more than 50 per cent acceptances. It reserved the right to
press on with the bid if this level were not reached.
After Schering, Gehe is Germany's second-biggest quoted drugs wholesaler,
with annual sales of around DM5bn. In 1991, the last full year for which
results are available, it made pre-tax profits of DM175m.
While wholesaling accounts for around half of group earnings, drugs
manufacture provides a further 25 per cent, with the balance coming from
various mail order activities.
Gehe developed its mail order businesses, specialising in office and
warehousing equipment and operating as far afield as the US, during the
1980s.
Manufacture, mainly of generic pharmaceutical products has expanded
recently. It was boosted after German unification by the acquisition of
Jenapharm and a 60 per cent stake in Azupharma.
The group faces a squeeze from government plans to reduce health spending.
These include price cuts for pharmaceuticals and prescription limits.

FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: The slide from difficulty to
disaster - The crisis that has engulfed SE Banken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAD been known for some time that Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken was in
acute financial difficulty, but only yesterday did the full extent of the
crisis become clear. The SKr5.3bn (Dollars 711.6m) loss for 1992 dwarfed
anything that analysts had expected.
The forecast of huge credit losses this year and next made the picture even
bleaker. There was no surprise, therefore, that the government finally
confirmed that the bank needed state support.
The revelations do much to bear out the accuracy of a current Swedish joke,
which suggests that the difference between a good bank and a bad bank in the
country is about six months.
For the speed at which the crisis has overtaken Sweden's most prestigious
bank is stunning. A year ago, it made a SKr2.3bn profit. For the first four
months of 1992 it recorded a SKr600m operating loss - its first deficit.
After eight months, the loss had reached SKr2.6bn. But even this doubled in
the final four months to reach yesterday's extraordinary total.
That things deteriorated so quickly owes as much to the boom of the late
1980s as to the recession that followed. The collapse in property values has
been the single most important factor in the weakening of the Swedish
banking system, and SE Banken is paying a heavy price for its exposure to a
small number of big clients in the real estate sector  - just 15 customers
account for almost half of last year's SKr10.9bn lending losses.
SE Banken's plight means that of the larger commercial banks, only Svenska
Handelsbanken looks as if it has a realistic chance of surviving without
state aid. The government has already put up SKr67.5bn to support three
banks - Nordbanken, Gota Bank and Forsta Sparbanken - of which both
Nordbanken and Gota Bank are under state control.
Some analysts believe that only strong political objections will prevent SE
Banken falling into state hands.
'The problems at SE Banken are similar to those at banks the government
already owns. But the government doesn't want to own any more banks and
there is value in having more than one privately-owned bank,' says one
observer.
How much money the state puts up, and how much capital SE Banken can attract
through its own efforts, are the key questions. Conservative estimates
suggest at least SKr10bn will be needed to recapitalise the bank, although
some say the eventual figure will be much higher.
The state expects SE Banken to do as much as possible to resolve its
problems by raising new capital from private sources. But the bank is
equally keen to know the extent of government aid before it goes ahead with
any new share issue. A complex game is likely, in which each player tries to
force the other to show his cards first.
One possible outcome would be for the state to guarantee the assets in SE
Banken's 'bad bank' - the special division set up last month to house
non-performing loans - with additional share capital being raised from
private sources to strengthen the bank's healthy activities. Some of the
bank's shareholders, as the most notable casualties of the current crisis,
may prove reluctant to provide more funds.
Mr Bjorn Svedberg, SE Banken's chief executive, can play on the state's
reluctance to take over the bank - but he can also count on the state
driving a hard bargain as part of its determination to get a good deal for
the taxpayer and to ensure competitive neutrality. That could entail the
disposal of some of the bank's profitable activities.
Many are waiting to see what role the Wallenberg family, Sweden's biggest
corporate dynasty, might play in the outcome. The Wallenbergs' interests
currently hold only 8 per cent of SE Banken's shares, but there has been
speculation that this stake will increase as part of any reconstruction.
However, this would almost certainly force the group to dispose of other
shareholdings. There has also been speculation that the Wallenbergs might
sell their voting rights to a 39.6 per cent holding in SKF, the world's
biggest roller-bearing manufacturer.
Last month SE Banken carried out a sweeping reorganisation, and it is likely
that further moves will be made to cut costs further and to bolster the
capital base. Such actions are likely to include staff cuts and disposals.
But these efforts alone are unlikely to solve the bank's difficulties
without a broader upturn in the Swedish economy. There have been some
positive developments - including a recent fall in interest rates and the
devaluation of the krona - but the economy is still heading for another
difficult year.
The finance department and the bank agree that Sweden's banking crisis will
continue for at least another two years, with losses this year likely to
equal those of last year.
'Most of the problems in the sector should have been dealt with by the end
of next year,' Mr Bo Lundgren, the taxation minister, said yesterday. For
the moment, that is as optimistic an assessment as can be found of the
prospects for an end to Sweden's banking crisis.

FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Statoil tumbles by 40% to
NKr2.5bn for 1992

STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, yesterday reported a 40 per cent
slide in 1992 net profits to NKr2.5bn (Dollars 361.3m) from NKr4.1bn, caused
mainly by a big operating loss in petrochemicals operations. Low oil prices
and weak refinery margins also contributed to the downturn.
The company has proposed to cut its dividend payment to the state -
Statoil's owners - to NKr1.25bn from NKr1.4bn in 1991, but even at this
level the payout would rise to 50 per cent of net profits, from 34 per cent
in 1991.
Group operating income rose last year to NKr79.4bn from NKr78.3bn, but
operating profits fell to NKr12.5bn from NKr13.6bn in 1991. Petrochemicals
saw a NKr500m decline in operating income to NKr5.5bn as operating losses
widened to NKr438m from NKr30m.
Statoil also suffered financial charges of NKr1.6bn, up from NKr1bn in 1991,
which it blamed partially on a NKr489m loss on a swap arrangement in shares
in Saga Petroleum, Norway's biggest independent oil company.
The company issued a pessimistic outlook for its main markets in 1993 and
warned it would be unable to generate sufficient cashflow from operations to
finance immediate investment commitments.
'This imposes additional demands on the group's earnings and financial
strength,' the company said.
Ms Brit Rugland, vice-president of finance, said Statoil would seek to
borrow between NKr4bn and NKr6bn in 1993, including refinancing of existing
loans, and that investments would rise to NKr12bn from NKr7bn last year.
The company plans a major international expansion in exploration and
production operations in an effort to find fresh oil reserves to replenish a
sharp decline in production expected by 1995-96. 'Access to new commercially
recoverable reserves will strengthen Statoil's earnings in the long term,'
it said.
The group's estimated tax bill for 1992, at NKr8.5bn, is at last year's
level, but Statoil said its effective tax rate had increased to 77 per cent
in 1992, from 68 per cent in 1991.

FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Three-fold rise at Dyno despite
'difficult' year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DYNO INDUSTRIER, the diversified Norwegian group, yesterday reported a
three-fold increase in 1992 pre-tax profit to NKr160m (Dollars 23.1m) from
NKr54m a year earlier.
Group sales fell to NKr7.5bn from NKr7.7bn as Dyno experienced a 'difficult
year' in most of its main markets, caused by pressure on prices and the sale
of its construction machinery business.
Group operating profit rose by NKr26m to NKr329m and financial income
improved by NKr55m to NKr212m.
Plastics suffered an operating loss of NKr12m compared with a NKr69m profit
in 1991. The explosives division made progress in the US and Australia but
profits fell in Scandinavia due to low construction activity.
Leif Hoegh, one of Norway's biggest shipowners, yesterday revealed a sharp
fall in 1992 net profit to NKr173m from NKr368m in 1991.
Freight income fell by NKr138m last year to NKr2bn, but operating and
voyage-related expenses were the same as in 1991 at NKr1.5bn.
Leif Hoegh said its 1992 performance wes satisfactory but admitted to
difficult market conditions for combination carriers and container/bulk
vessels. Group operating profit fell by NKr153m to NKr309m in 1992.
The shipowner said that asset value increased last year to NKr2.3bn from
NKr2.2bn.

FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Italian engineer plans share
issue
</HEADLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FINMECCANICA, the Italian state-owned engineering group which is merging
with some listed subsidiaries, has revealed moderate gains in 1992 sales and
earnings and plans for a fundraising share issue.
The announcement came as shareholders of Finmeccanica's Alenia aerospace,
Elsag-Bailey automation and Ansal-do engineering subsidiaries approved the
merger proposals put forward last December.
Mr Fabiano Fabiani, Finmeccanica's managing director, said group net profits
rose by 7.7 per cent to L182bn (Dollars 121m) last year, while sales climbed
2.1 per cent to L11,200bn. Net debt climbed by 9.4 per cent to L5,320bn,
while interest costs jumped to L450bn from L297bn in 1991, largely due to
the sharp rise in interest rates in the second half of last year.
Finmeccanica unveiled plans to raise up to L891bn through a multi-tranche
capital issue over the next year. The proceeds would come from issuing 307m
new shares, with a nominal value of L1,000 each. The shares would carry a
L1,500 premium, which could be altered up or down by L400 a share, depending
on market conditions.
The Italian government has indicated it is ready to reduce its stake in
Finmeccanica, owned through the IRI state holding company, to below 50 per
cent, although no timetable has been set. Should all minority shareholders
in Finmeccanica's subsidiaries accept the share swap linked to the merger,
IRI's stake will fall to 86.6 per cent from 96.4 per cent.
The planned capital increase could dilute that further. IRI has said it will
spend L493bn underwriting new Finmeccanica shares. Rights to any remaining
stock will be ceded to a banking consortium, on terms yet to be revealed.
Mr Fabiani blamed the rise in Finmeccanica's net debts on the delays in
payment from public-sector clients in Italy.

FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: VW to control importing of Skodas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN yesterday took full control of the import and distribution of
Czech-built Skoda cars in the UK, following an agreement which ends months
of friction with the previous Czech-owned importer.
The agreement between Volkswagen-controlled Skoda Automobile UK and Skoda
(GB), which had imported the cars for more than 20 years, releases the
222-strong dealer network from contractual obligations to Skoda (GB),
allowing them to enter contracts with Skoda Automobile UK.
The deal opens the way for Volkswagen, which now controls Skoda and is
overseeing a Pounds 3.3bn investment programme in models and plant, to
pursue its plans to quadruple Skoda's UK sales to 40,000 a year. The
agreement means that Skoda (GB), owned by the privatised Motokov
International Czech foreign trade agency, will have no role in the business.
Skoda (GB) had been refusing to release dealers from their contracts while
it sought a role as sub-contractor to Skoda Automobile UK, which appointed
itself as the official importer/distributor in January. In particular, it
was anxious to operate, on the VW company's behalf, the import and
preparation centre at Kings Lynn, which had employed more than 100 people.
Skoda Automobile UK has opted instead to import the vehicles through
Southampton, which handles imports of cars built by SEAT of Spain - also
controlled by Volkswagen.
Preparation of both makes at the port has been subcontracted to Southampton
Vehicle Terminals with Richard Lawson Car Delivery Group, which is based in
Dundee and distributes SEATs from Southampton, taking on Skoda deliveries as
well.

FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: New man and cash call plan at Cupid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORTUNES of Cupid, the loss-making bridal wear company, are being
revived by a new man at the top and by Pounds 1.9m of new money.
The USM-quoted group yesterday announced Mr Richard Shaw's appointment as
chairman and chief executive alongside a rights issue and share
subscription.
His aims include expanding Cupid into lingerie and possibly changing its
name to help slough off a chequered reputation in the City.
About Pounds 1.25m will be raised in the 4-for-9 issue, at 28p a share.
Other new shares have been subscribed for by groups of individual investors,
including the Shaw family with 4.2 per cent of the enlarged equity and a
Guernsey couple called Cairns with 8.5 per cent.
It was also reported that losses for the year to March 31 could total Pounds
1.5m, compared with a Pounds 867,000 pre-tax profit last year. Early last
summer, before the last rights issue, pre-tax profit forecasts were in the
Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 1.7m range.
Cupid's share price, which fell to 35p last week when losses were predicted,
had already started to recover on hopes of new investment and new management
direction. It gained another 7p to 53p yesterday.
Mr Shaw said post-interest losses were about Pounds 800,000.
In the nursery division, two factories had been closed. The head office was
also being sold and the operation transferred to the Blackburn factory.
The exceptional costs of these moves, plus pay-offs to former and departing
directors, accounted for the remaining Pounds 700,000 of expected losses. Mr
Michael Murray, the founder, and his wife Sue, also a director, received
Pounds 100,000 when they departed in December - alongside a profits warning.
Mr Richard Lee, who has been chairman and chief executive in the interim, is
also leaving.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SWP Group recovered slightly in the six months to December with pre-tax
profits of Pounds 42,000, against a previous Pounds 31,000.
In the second half of the year to June 30 1992 the USM-quoted supplier of
components to the construction industry fell into losses.
Mr Robert Stickings, chairman, said trading conditions were extremely
depressed and the fall in the value of the pound had increased costs.
He added that there had been a modest increase in activity in recent weeks,
but prospects for the second half were still difficult to assess.
Turnover improved to Pounds 3.71m (Pounds 3.65m) for operating profits of
Pounds 126,000 (Pounds 98,000). Interest paid rose to Pounds 84,000 (Pounds
67,000).
Earnings per share were unchanged at 0.1p.

FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Leslie Wise falls to Pounds 2.5m as
increased costs hit margins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASED COSTS, following sterling's devaluation, cut margins at Leslie
Wise Group.
Pre-tax profits at the textiles concern fell 12 per cent, from Pounds 2.86m
to Pounds 2.52m, in the year to November 30 in spite of a 20 per cent
increase in turnover to Pounds 48.7m.
Mr Neil Wise, who took over as chairman at the turn of the year following
the death of his father Leslie, said sales had risen from start-up
operations and from exports. Overseas sales were ahead 30 per cent at Pounds
6.9m.
Mr Wise said the cost of materials bought in dollars or D-Marks had risen by
up to 25 per cent. Negotiations with suppliers and switching the country of
supply would ameliorate the situation. The price increases passed on to
customers might amount to 10 per cent.
Bad debts, including one arising from Berkertex's insolvency, totalled
nearly Pounds 150,000 and the closure of two out of seven start-up design
companies cost a similar amount.
He said bankers to smaller private companies, 'who have normally been
supportive, are acting mercilessly'.
If such a string of short-term problems could be avoided this year, margins
could be rebuilt.
Operating profit was just over 2 per cent down at Pounds 2.84m. Interest
costs rose to Pounds 321,000 (Pounds 51,000). Debt was increased by Pounds
470,000 of final deferred payments on acquisitions dating back to 1988-89.
Year-end gearing stood at 40 per cent on shareholders' funds of about Pounds
7m.
Leslie Wise supplies retail groups such as Burton and Etam. Mr Wise said
there were glimmers of hope of high street recovery but what was needed was
a sustained period of buoyant trading.
The final dividend is held at 2.25p to give an unchanged total of 4p.
Earnings per share slipped to 4.96p (5.8p).

FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: McLeod Russel launches hostile bid for
Wheway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MCLEOD RUSSEL Holdings, the paints producer and distributor, yesterday
launched a Pounds 14m hostile bid for Wheway, the struggling environmental
engineering group.
Wheway shareholders are being offered one McLeod share for every 10.
McLeod's shares yesterday fell 2p to 100p; Wheway's rose 1 1/2 p to 9p. The
offer values each Wheway share at 10p.
The two companies have been in talks since last September. However, McLeod
decided to go hostile after failing to reach agreement on price.
Mr Nigel Openshaw, McLeod chairman, said: 'Wheway has had a for sale sign up
for months. We have tried not to rub their noises in it, but this is a
generous offer and we cannot wait any longer.'
Wheway responded by urging its shareholders to take no action. Mr Brian
Long, who was recently appointed chief executive, said: 'We need more time
to reflect on possible alternatives.'
He made it clear that the company wanted to merge with a 'robust partner',
but first wanted to see if it could get a better deal for shareholders.
The company is already talking to other interested parties about a possible
merger.
Wheway, in need of refinancing after its costly move out of heavy
engineering, last year turned in a Pounds 3.5m loss after making a Pounds
2.8m pre-tax profit the previous year.
Its share price has fallen from more than 140p in 1989 to its current level
of 9p.
At the year-end its net borrowings were Pounds 16.3m, giving gearing of more
than 105 per cent.
McLeod, which has a 2.99 per cent stake in Wheway, increased its pre-tax
profit from Pounds 4.42m to Pounds 5.18m for the year to September 30.
It said an enlarged group would benefit from a rationalisation of costs and
the development of Wheway's clean air and environmental engineering
businesses.
The enlarged group, on a pro forma basis, would have had a combined annual
turnover of more than Pounds 123m.
Pro forma combined net assets and borrowings would have amounted to Pounds
57.4m and Pounds 6.2m respectively.

FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Alumasc restricted to Pounds 3.8m by
reliance on organic growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWTH AT Alumasc, the Kettering-based beer kegs, building products and
precision components group, slowed in the first half as pre-tax profits rose
by just 3.2 per cent from Pounds 3.65m to Pounds 3.77m.
In the last full year profits advanced 23 per cent.
Without contributions from the new acquisitions that characterised 1991-92,
Alumasc was dependent during the six months to December 31 on organic growth
and hence was more susceptible to the weakness of the economy.
Turnover improved to Pounds 24.3m against Pounds 23.6m. Earnings per share
rose to 16.5p (15.8p) and the interim dividend is increased from 3.55p to
3.7p.
Demand for building products, the largest of the group's three operating
divisions, slipped as general building activity continued to decline.
However, demand for beer kegs stabilised after a fall during the previous
year.
Volume fell slightly in the precision components business, although
customers have been placing dies with the company, a prelude to future
orders.
The group's financial position remains stable and Mr John McCall, chairman,
said it continued to seek acquisitions. Net cash balances rose by Pounds
1.5m to Pounds 4.9m, producing interest of Pounds 148,000.

FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Gold Greenlees calls for Pounds 15m -
Proceeds of rights issue will be used to fund acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD GREENLEES Trott, the marketing services group, is raising about Pounds
14.7m net in a rights issue to fund acquisitions.
The 1-for-3 issue of up to 6.49m shares is priced at 235p. The shares shed
12p yesterday to close at 288p.
Proceeds of the rights, a rarity in the depressed advertising sector, are to
be used for acquisitions planned in the next six to nine months.
Before allowing for the issue, net debt was forecast to be about Pounds 14m
by the April year-end. GGT has negative net assets.
Analysts believe the company is looking to acquire small agencies with a
European focus, either as subsidiaries or partners, in a move to balance its
growing activities in the US.
At Pounds 4.5m, GGT's pre-tax profits forecast for this year would be Pounds
900,000 up on last year (excluding exceptional prof-its), but well below
1990's Pounds 7.68m.
Last year's total dividend was 8.3p, with earnings per share of 17.28p. The
company's dividend forecast for this year is also 8.3p.
The rights issue is GGT's first for five years. It used its 1988 call to buy
Martin-Williams, a Minneapolis agency, as part of an expansion strategy in
the US Midwest and south-west.
US earnings last year accounted for half of GGT's gross profits. Among its
clients are Coca-Cola, Red Rock cider, Holsten Pils and Cadbury Schweppes.
Mr Michael Greenlees, chairman, said: 'Unlike Saatchi's and WPP, we have not
gone in for five-year earn-outs, but have paid for purchases over 18 months
or less. I want to continue on that basis.'
Mr Vignesh Padiachy, media analyst at BZW, said the issue was likely to be
well supported by shareholders. 'GGT is performing strongly in the US - with
margins of 20 per cent against a sector average of 8 per cent - and there is
plenty of recovery potential in the UK.'
Mr Greenlees said he saw 'considerable room for growth' in existing
businesses, not least GGT's non-advertising (mainly marketing) activities in
the UK, which last year accounted for nearly half of total UK earnings.
The rights issue has been fully underwritten by Kleinwort Benson.

FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Chelsea Building Society tumbles 49%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IMPACT of the slump in the south of England housing market on
southern-based building societies was shown yesterday when Chelsea Building
Society disclosed a 49 per cent fall to Pounds 4.1m in pre-tax profits for
1992.
The society's results are expected to be among the worst reported for last
year, although large falls are also expected to be disclosed by the Bristol
&amp; West and Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester societies over the next month.
Chelsea's fall in profits, from Pounds 8.1m in 1991, was caused by a 60 per
cent increase to Pounds 37m (Pounds 23.1m) in provisions for bad and
doubtful debts. Its gross provisions are now set at 2.9 per cent of gross
commercial assets.
Operating profits rose 29 per cent to Pounds 41.1m (Pounds 31.2m), partly
because of the widening of margins between savings and lending products in
the last quarter of the year. The ratio of costs to income fell to 38.7 per
cent (44.2 per cent).
Chelsea - the 17th biggest society with assets of Pounds 2.29bn - emphasised
that efforts to reduce arrears had led to a 20 per cent cut in borrowers
over six months in arrears. It predicted that provisions would be
'substantially reduced' in 1993.
Mr Peter Walsh, director and general manager, said Chelsea's provisioning
policy had been 'very prudent'.

FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: English &amp; Overseas Properties reduces loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGLISH &amp; Overseas Properties cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 2.32m to Pounds
707,000 in 1992, after charging exceptional items of Pounds 982,000, against
Pounds 2.48m, a sizeable part of which was provided at the half year.
As indicated at the interim stage, there is no dividend (1p). Losses per
share came out at 2.98p (14.24p).
Mr Jim Clark, chairman, said the company had taken steps to reorganise its
capital and reserves. Progress had been encouraging with one outstanding
matter to be resolved before the company could apply for court and
shareholder approval.
He said legal advice received indicated that such a reorganisation should be
successful, particularly as E&amp;OP's trade creditors were minimal and the cash
position was still strong at Pounds 4.7m.
Entering 1993 with the majority of its properties let and substantial cash
balances available for new investment, Mr Clark said medium term growth
prospects were encouraging.
Mr Clark said opportunities to acquire companies and properties where E&amp;OP
could add value were increasing and he believed 1993 could be the 'window of
opportunity' for such acquisitions.

FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Takeover Panel poised to freeze Airtours
bid timetable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TAKEOVER Panel is likely either today or on Monday to freeze the
timetable of Airtours' hostile Pounds 215m bid for Owners Abroad, its rival
tour group.
Owners Abroad would have had to produce its final Day 39 defence document on
Monday, but the Office of Fair Trading has yet to forward its recommendation
to the trade and industry secretary as to whether the bid should be referred
to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
In the event that the bid is referred, the offer will lapse; if the bid were
not referred, Owners Abroad would normally have two days to produce its
defence after the trade secretary delivered his ruling.
Removal of the threat of an MMC referral would refocus shareholder attention
on the value of Airtours share offer and partial cash alternative.
It would also throw a spot-light back to the intentions of Thomas Cook,
which is controlled by WestDeutsche Landesbank, the German state bank which
has large interests in the travel industry.
Thomas Cook's proposed tie-up with Owners Abroad, in which it would have
made a net Pounds 2m injection of cash in return for a 10 per cent stake in
Owners Abroad, had been put on hold until after shareholders have decided
whether to reject the Airtours' bid.
However, some City observers have begun to question whether Thomas Cook
would not tear up the existing strategic alliance agreement after Airtours'
final offer, in favour of buying a blocking - though not controlling - stake
in Owners Abroad.
Schroders has been advising Thomas Cook on its banking side and Thomas Cook
said it appointed James Capel as broking advisers early in the new year.
James Capel advised Thomas Cook when Midland Bank sold the travel group to
the Germans in 1991.

FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Ward loses Pounds 5m as purchaser
confidence sags
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ward Holdings, the housebuilder and property group, blamed the severe
recession for a pre-tax loss of Pounds 5.29m after exceptional charges of
Pounds 2.07m for the year to October 31.
This compares with a deficit of Pounds 14m after exceptional charges of
Pounds 12.2m, relating to the write-down in the value of the land bank.
Turnover remained static at Pounds 29.7m.
The final dividend is passed again - there was no interim. Losses per share
were 8.8p (19.1p).
Although Ward sold 10 per cent more houses than in the previous year, it
said there had been a further loss of house purchaser confidence. This was
due to falling house prices, increases in unemployment and business
failures, and exceptionally high levels of house repossessions and mortgage
repayment arrears.
The company was unable to dispose of certain investment property to reduce
its gearing.
It blamed the 'disappointing delay' on prospective purchasers failing to
complete after agreeing terms.
Agreement has been reached with its banks to extend its syndicate loans
through to May 31 1994.

FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: DTI considers disqualifying Edencorp
Leisure directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Trade and Industry is considering action to disqualify
directors of Edencorp Leisure, which went into receivership in 1991, from
acting in such a capacity for any other company.
The DTI made the statement following the publication of a report on events
surrounding the collapse of the group run by Mr Michael Wallace, a former
show business promoter.
The report investigated possible manipulation of the 1989 results, the
payment of fees without board approval and Mr Wallace's indebtedness to the
company.
Edencorp was brought to the Third Market in 1989. A series of acquisitions
followed in Portugal and the UK.
After reassuring shareholders on the company's gearing position, Mr Wallace
sold a large block of stock in 1990. He was forced to resign when it was
discovered he had received substantial unauthorised loans, totalling Pounds
600,000, from the company, the financial position of which was far from
stable.
In December 1990 Edencorp's shares were suspended at 12p. Mr Wallace resumed
control of the company in May 1991, but it was put into receivership in July
that year.
The report strongly criticised Mr Wallace, chief executive, and Mr Godfrey
Cook, finance director and company secretary, for their conduct.
The investigation found that Mr Wallace had withdrawn large sums without the
board's knowledge or approval, and without regard to the interests of
shareholders. Mr Cook had been negligent.
Ernst &amp; Young, Edencorp's auditors, and Mr Wallace also come in for
criticism in respect of the 1989 accounts, which were unqualified.
Advance sales of vouchers worth some Pounds 200,000 were included in the
1989 year, when the group reported net profit of Pounds 783,000, instead of
being deferred to future years. 'This leads to the conclusion that sales,
and consequently profits, were over-stated by at least Pounds 200,000.'
'It follows that the auditors' report that the group accounts gave a true
and fair view of the group's profit for the period is called into question,'
the investigators say.
They criticised Mr Wallace's role in the decision to include the advance
sales in the 1989 accounts. 'In our view Wallace improperly exerted pressure
to achieve the Pounds 900,000 profit target.'
The investigators also question the payment of a finder's fee of Pounds
140,000 paid to an acquaintance of Mr Wallace, related to an acquisition.
'The circumstances of the payment cast doubt on its propriety. Even if
genuine, it was, in our view, excessive.'
Although it is unlikely that any criminal actions will result from the
investigation, the report has been passed to two regulatory bodies: the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, and the Securities
and Futures Association.
The receivers, Touche Ross, are believed to have sold all the assets of
Edencorp and unsecured creditors are not expected to receive anything.

FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Kleinwort Benson ahead 66% - Advance to
Pounds 46.3m helped by cut in bad debt provisions to Pounds 7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KLEINWORT Benson's pre-tax profits recovered sharply in 1992,mainly because
of a drop in bad debt provisions from Pounds 39m to Pounds 7m.
The merchant banking group also disclosed that Mr David Peake, its chairman,
would retire at the next annual meeting on April 28, to be replaced by Lord
Rockley, currently a vice chairman.
Profits of the merchant banking group increased 66 per cent to Pounds 46.3m.
However, after-tax profits rose by only 10 per cent to Pounds 21.3m because
Kleinwort was forced to take an exceptional tax charge of Pounds 13.6m in
its profit and loss account as an adjustment to the accrued tax losses it
carries in its balance sheet.
Mr Jonathan Agnew, Kleinwort's chief executive, insisted that the
exceptional tax charge was an accounting nicety: 'It has no economic effect
on us.'
The charge relates to financial transactions carried out by Kleinwort in
1988 with the purpose of generating tax losses. It then included these
assets in its balance sheet as an asset.
In preparing the latest accounts, Kleinwort re-examined the transactions and
decided the losses should be removed from the balance sheet.
However, Mr Agnew said that Kleinwort would still be able to benefit from
the losses by reducing the tax it pays in future. The losses were now a
contingent off-balance sheet asset.
The growth in 1992 pre-tax profits was held back by a Pounds 10m charge to
cover the costs of the group's surplus off-ice space in the UK and the US.
The merchant banking and securities division pushed up profits from Pounds
24.7m to Pounds 38m, while the investment management and private banking
division suffered a small drop from Pounds 24.4m to Pounds 22.1m.
Within the merchant banking and securities operations, Kleinwort's Japanese
securities business made a loss and there was also a drop in profits from
the corporate finance department, which is the traditional heart of the
group.
There were sharp profit increases in the treasury operations and the
financing business.
The proposed final dividend is maintained at 10.7p, giving an unchanged
total for the year of 16p.
Earnings per share, excluding the exceptional tax charge, increased from
14.3p to 26.6p.
Mr Peake, 58, said he had been thinking about retiring 'for some months',
but other board members were putting no pressure on him to go.
He preferred to go now, to allow Lord Rockley, who is a few months older
than him, to do the job for a few years.
Lord Rockley is seen by Kleinwort executives as chairman for a transitional
period, while the next generation of senior Kleinwort executives acquire
more experience.
However, some Kleinwort executives said they were slightly surprised that Mr
Peake had not been replaced by Mr Simon Robertson, 51, who was appointed
deputy chairman last year.

FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Zantac continues to lift Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZANTAC, an ulcer treatment and the world's best-selling drug, was the main
reason for Glaxo's surprisingly good interim results, announced yesterday.
The drug's sales increased by Pounds 145m to Pounds 1.03bn, providing 45 per
cent of Glaxo's turnover growth.
Dr Ernest Mario, chief executive, said: 'People have been talking about the
demise of Zantac for the last six years. It's still doing well and it's
continued improvement is not a flash in the pan.'
Zantac's growth had been assisted by strong expansion in the US (up 14 per
cent) and Europe (up 18 per cent).
Although the drug was losing some world market share - 39 per cent in 1992,
compared with 40 per cent in 1991 - the market was still grow-ing at 14 per
cent, said Dr Mario.
Sales of respiratory products increased by 9 per cent to Pounds 512m,
representing 22 per cent of group turnover. The overall respiratory market
is growing at 13 per cent.
Dr Mario said there had been a 15 per cent fall in sales in the US due to
wholesale stocking in anticipation of price increases. European respiratory
sales increased by 16 per cent.
Sales of Ventolin, Glaxo's old asthma treatment, fell 1 per cent (4 per cent
at constant exchange rates) to Pounds 239m. Beconase, the newer asthma
medicine, increased 9 per cent to Pounds 223m.
Serevent, Glaxo's latest asthma treatment, added Pounds 9m sales to total
Pounds 32m. Mr Mario said this would be a big product - it had yet to be
launched in the US, Japan or Germany, the world's three largest markets.
Antibiotic sales increased by 21 per cent per cent. Zinnat, an oral
antibiotic, increased sales by 49 per cent to Pounds 160m.
Sales of Zofran, the anti-nausea treatment, rose 36 per cent, from Pounds
120m to Pounds 163m. US sales increased by 42 per cent.
Imigran, a migraine drug also known as Imitrex, generated sales of Pounds
35m. The full-year figures will include the first contributions from Germany
and the US.
The migraine treatment has been predicted by analysts to achieve outstanding
sales. However, Dr Mario warned the drug's use would not grow explosively.
The speed of registration had been disappointing, particularly in the US.
Research and development expenditure grew to Pounds 335m (Pounds 277m) and
was expected to reach about Pounds 735m (Pounds 595m) by the year end. The
group spends more than any other pharmaceuticals company on R&amp;D.
Operating margins for the first six months were 33 per cent, but were likely
to fall to 31 per cent because of additional marketing costs associated with
new drug launches, particularly in the US.
Investment income from Glaxo's Pounds 1.5bn cash-pile was Pounds 79m (Pounds
77m).
Dr Mario said if the group could find a reasonable investment for its cash
it would make it. There was little point in distributing funds to
shareholders because of the advanced corporation tax implications.
Earnings per share increased by 16 per cent from 16.7p to 19.4p, while
earnings per ADR rose 17 per cent to 68 cents (58 cents). The dividend is an
improved 7p (6p).

FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Control Securities' shareholders funds
deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROL SECURITIES, the property and leisure group, said yesterday that a
further write-down of property values and other exceptional costs totalling
Pounds 68.4m, had left the company with a deficit on shareholders' funds of
Pounds 31.8m.
It called an extraordinary meeting for March 17 to ask shareholders to
support the board's continued discussions with banks, bondholders and
creditors. The shares have been suspended since October 1991.
Mr Sydney Robin, chairman, said that the group's 'complex and delicate'
restructuring was taking 'considerably longer than had been anticipated'. He
said there were still some significant issues to be resolved.
However, he said that holders of the group's SFr200m (Pounds 92m) of bonds
would be offered equity in place of a quarter of the principal amount and a
new repayment date on the rest of 2000. The two issues, each of SFr100m,
have maturities in 1994 and 1997.
Banks which lent to Control Securities have security over the group's assets
and are not expected to swap any debt for equity. Control Securities is also
negotiating with Bass, the leisure group, from which it bought some Spanish
hotels in 1989. Bass was due to receive a final instalment of Pounds 11m
last September, but has not yet been paid.
The group announced interim results, for the period to September 30, showing
trading profits slightly lower at Pounds 17.2m (Pounds 17.7m) on sales 11
per cent higher at Pounds 56.2m.
However, interest charges of Pounds 17.2m (Pounds 12.8m) and the exceptional
costs left losses of Pounds 68.5m before tax (profit Pounds 4.4m). The net
loss was Pounds 62.1m or 16.73p a share (profit Pounds 2.1m and earnings per
share of 0.56p).
The exceptional costs included a Pounds 52.8m write down of property values.
This largely related to a valuation done at December 31 on a 'Red Book'
basis - complying with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors guidance
on property valuation - necessary before the company's shares could be
relisted.
The valuation basis assumes sales of properties within a short time period,
while Control Securities' business plan envisages a controlled sale of
assets over a longer period. Mr Robin said 'this valuation basis has been
the prime cause of the requirement for additional write-downs against UK
property values.' He said the directors believed they could realise better
values.
The exceptional items also included a debit of Pounds 14.4m covering the
effect on the principal value of the Swiss franc bonds caused by sterling's
devaluation. The group had covered its exposure to the Swiss franc until
mid-August, but could not continue to do so after that.
At the trading level, the property division contributed Pounds 6.6m (Pounds
7.5m), mainly because of a fall in rental income as some properties were
vacated when tenants failed. The leisure division made an unchanged Pounds
10.6m.

FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Bellwether backs down from approach
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bellwether Exploration, the Nasdaq-quoted resources company, yesterday
announced it had backed down from its hostile approach to Aberdeen
Petroleum, the USM-quoted oil and gas group.
Bellwether first approached Aberdeen with merger proposals last month on the
basis of 3.75 Aberdeen shares for each of its own.
Aberdeen's shares - which were 11p at the time of the approach - rose  1/2 p
to close last night at 15p.

FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Banks want to maintain Mirror's Labour
stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOUR banks which are majority shareholders in Mirror Group Newspapers
said yesterday that they would be 'very concerned' if the political stance
of the newspaper were altered from its tradition of supporting the Labour
Party.
National Westminster, Midland, Goldman Sachs and Lloyds have indicated that
they would become more actively involved in MGN's affairs if they feared
that the business was becoming unstable as a result of editorial changes.
The banks' comments come against the background of criticism of MGN from the
Labour Party, following the resignation this week of Mr Alastair Campbell,
the Daily Mirror's political editor.
Meanwhile, MGN last night denied that there was a boardroom rift over Mr
Campbell's departure, which has also attracted criticism from Mirror
journalists.
Mr Charles Wilson, MGN's editorial director, said there was no split between
Lord Hollick, the Labour peer, and Mr David Montgomery, brought in last
October to become MGN's chief executive.
Lord Hollick, chairman of the media and finance group MAI and Meridian, the
new television station in the south of England, has rejected recent reports
that he wants control of MGN. He declined to comment yesterday.
Mr Wilson said: 'Lord Hollick is in a difficult position as a member of the
Labour Party and a peer. He's with people at Westminster who are having
their concerns agitated by elements within the Mirror - and I don't mean at
boardroom level.'
He added: 'There is absolutely no indication at all that this paper is
drifting away from the Labour Party. We totally support the Labour Party.'
The future of the the former Maxwell newspaper group lies in the hands of
the four banks, whose 54 per cent stake is held by administrator Mr John
Talbot of Arthur Andersen.
The banks are communicating their views to the MGN board through Mr Talbot.
They received the shares as security for loans. Yesterday the shares closed
2p higher at 109p, valuing the group at Pounds 430m.
The figures compared with a 1991 flotation price of 125p, when the group had
a market capitalisation of Pounds 501m.
MGN's shares resumed trading last July at 53p, but have climbed steadily
since October as investors have been attracted by the cost-savings which Mr
Montgomery pledged to make.
However, analysts said they would be concerned if the new management team's
actions threatened MGN's valuable franchise on the left of the political
spectrum.
More than 150 Labour MPs signed a Commons motion criticising Mr Montgomery's
approach following the resignation of Mr Campbell.
Mirror journalists called for the resignation of Mr Montgomery and blamed
him for the paper's continuing fall in circulation.

FT  19 FEB 93 / RTZ makes Dollars 470m move into US coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, is moving into US coal with a
Dollars 470m (Pounds 331m) agreed offer for Nerco, the floundering natural
resources group 82 per cent owned by PacifiCorp.
Nerco's profitable coal units will be merged with RTZ's US Kennecott copper
and gold mining subsidiary but the Morgan Stanley investment bank will sell
the oil and gas operations.
Nerco's gold and silver mining interests have been up for sale for some
time. RTZ will look closely before deciding whether to go ahead with the
disposal process already in place.
Nerco's net debt at the end of 1992 was Dollars 692m and after the deal
RTZ's gearing will rise to about 60 per cent from 35 per cent. Mr Robert
Wilson, RTZ's chief executive, said: 'We shall move promptly to achieve the
planned asset disposals. Meanwhile, we expect this transaction to enhance
earnings even in 1993.' PacifiCorp has agreed to fund Dollars 225m of the
consideration and will be repaid from certain contract revenues of Nerco.
Through its 49 per cent-owned associate, CRA, RTZ already has coal interests
in Australia and Indonesia. Nerco owns two low-sulphur, open pit, steam coal
mines in the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming and has a 50 per cent
stake in a third. It produced 16.6m tonnes in 1992 and has reserves
totalling 580m tonnes, and more than 60 per cent of production is secured by
long-term contracts. Mr Wilson said demand for low-sulphur coal in the US
was expected to grow by 2 per cent annually and material from Powder River
was probably the lowest-cost in the world: about Dollars 4 a tonne to mine.
RTZ's share price closed 6p down after the news at 646p, possibly because of
market fears of a rights issue.
RTZ is offering Dollars 12 for each Nerco share. At the close in New York
Nerco's shares were up Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 11 1/2 . The US company also
announced a net loss of Dollars 551m on revenues of Dollars 578m after
write-downs totalling Dollars 714m. This left its net assets worth Dollars
247m.
Mr Euan Worthington, head of the mining team at S G Warburg, said: 'It looks
like a very good deal - if you want that sort of deal. But should anyone be
buying coal anywhere in the world, even reasonably high-quality coal?'

FT  19 FEB 93 / Takeover creates Europe-wide retailer: The deal between
Kingfisher and Darty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KINGFISHER'S takeover of Darty not only creates Europe's largest electricals
retailer, it could be a stepping stone on the way to its becoming the first
Europe-wide retailing group.
The deal was warmly welcomed yesterday by the City, and contained no
unpleasant surprises.
It values Darty's equity at FFr4.45bn (Pounds 560m). Kingfisher has agreed
to acquire the whole of the issued share capital of Financiere Darty, which
owns 95.3 per cent of the Darty retail group, for a cash payment of
FFr1.65bn and 68m Kingfisher shares. This will give Darty shareholders a
significant stake of between 10 and 12 per cent in Kingfisher.
Kingfisher will also take on borrowings valued at Pounds 477m on January 30.
It will make a cash offer for the 4.7 per cent of Darty which is held
publicly after consultation with the French authorities.
The UK group will strengthen its balance sheet with a Pounds 313m,
one-for-seven rights issue, at a price of 450p each.
The issue will be in two stages, with a first instalment of 225p payable by
March 15 irrespective of whether the takeover is completed. The second will
only become payable if the takeover is approved.
That would take Kingfisher's gearing to 66 per cent, but Mr James Kerr-Muir,
finance director, said he expected the group's strong cashflow to enable
this to be reduced by a 'significant amount' in a 'fairly short time'. He
said interest cover of six times provided further reassurance.
Analysts were enthusiastic about the deal. Mr John Richards of NatWest
Securities said in the long term it offered the prospect of creating the
first 'major European power-retailer'.
The two managements will work together closely, with Sir Geoff Mulcahy,
Kingfisher's chairman, joining Darty's board, and Mr Philippe Frances,
chairman of Darty, joining the executive committee of Kingfisher.
A first priority will be to examine areas of 'synergistic benefit' between
the two chains in areas such as information technology and logistics,
distribution and marketing. Mr Frances said the companies would be
considering strengthening their buying operations, but they were unlikely to
pool sourcing activities other than for their largest common suppliers.
The deal should also enable Darty to accelerate its expansion programme. Mr
Frances said the group planned to open 30 or 40 stores in France over the
next five years, and 40 new units thereafter, taking the total to about 200.
Darty also intends to extend its operations outside France, at present
restricted to a joint venture in Belgium with retailer New Vandenborre. Mr
Frances said it would not be moving into the UK but 'there are lots of other
European countries where we'd like to be'. Germany, Spain and Italy are all
seen as areas of potential growth.

FT  19 FEB 93 / SE Banken wins rescue pledge on 'substantial' losses warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SWEDISH government yesterday promised state support to rescue
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the country's leading commercial bank, after
it announced a SKr5.3bn (Pounds 489.4m) preliminary operating loss for 1992
and said it was facing two more years of heavy credit losses.
The bank warned that the value of its shares 'must be regarded as uncertain'
in the light of its prospects and the current depressed state of the Swedish
economy. Its shares fell SKr3 to SKr10.50.
The bank also warned of 'substantial' losses on loans for the next two
years. Doubtful loans tripled to SKr28.8bn, or 8 per cent of total
outstanding loans, from SKr9.6bn. The bank will not pay a dividend.
Soaring lending losses and erosion of its capital base have forced SE Banken
to seek state support. Its 1992 year-end 8.4 per cent capital adequacy ratio
was almost certain to fall below the 8 per cent legal minimum during 1993,
it stated.
The government pledged assistance 'if capital cannot be attracted to the
bank in any other way'.
Mr Bo Lundgren, taxation minister, said: 'The commitments of SE Banken will
be fulfilled on a timely basis. Thus the activities of the bank can continue
in the same way as today in relation to households, companies and other
creditors.'
SE Banken first revealed last December that it had approached the state
about possible financial support and last month it announced a sweeping
overhaul of its operations.
It is widely believed that the state will end up carrying a heavy portion of
SE Banken's bad debts while efforts are made to attract private capital. In
the last resort, the state could take over the bank as it did with
Nordbanken and Gota Bank.
Mr Bjorn Svedberg, SE Banken chief executive, said: 'I sincerely hope that
it will be possible to get government support in combination with new
private capital in forms which permit SE Banken to remain a privately owned
bank.'
The 1992 result is a sharp turnround from the previous year's SKr2.3bn
profit and follows a big jump in lending losses to SKr10.9bn from SKr4.8bn.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Ulcer drug helps Glaxo advance 16% to Pounds 819m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLAXO, Europe's biggest pharmaceuticals group, yesterday reported pre-tax
profits up 16 per cent from Pounds 709m to Pounds 819m for the six months to
December 31. The result was achieved on turnover up 16 per cent from Pounds
1.97bn to Pounds 2.29bn.
The main driving force behind the higher than expected profits increase was
the strong growth of the ulcer treatment Zantac, the world's best-selling
drug.
Glaxo attempted to clarify its ambitions in the over-the-counter (OTC)
non-prescription drug market. Dr Ernest Mario, chief executive, said he
apologised if the market had been confused about the company's strategy.
There have been rumours, following the appointment of Mr Arthur Pappas last
month, that Glaxo might be preparing a rights issue to acquire
Warner-Lambert in the US which has a large OTC business.
Dr Mario said the company had a number of products, such as Zantac, that
might be switched to the OTC market. Mr Pappas had been appointed to help
develop the group's capacity to conduct such switches. However, that did not
mean Glaxo would buy OTC products or other companies just to increase
turnover in OTC. This statement calmed the City's fears and Glaxo's shares
lifted 22p to 684p.
Glaxo had limited price increases to below the rate of inflation, Dr Mario
said. Group sales, excluding exchange rates, rose 13 per cent. Only 1 per
cent came from price increases, with 12 per cent from volume growth. Because
the group does not manufacture drugs in Puerto Rico, Dr Mario said it was
less exposed than other drug companies to any moves by the Clinton
administration to curb the island's tax haven status. He said Glaxo had new
products capable of driving volume growth. Sales of new products, including
Imigran, the migraine treatment, and Serevent, an asthma drug, rose Pounds
92m, while established drugs improved by Pounds 83m.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Sony profits fall 62% to Y50bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE continuing weakness of Japanese consumer spending and adverse currency
movements contributed to a decline in third-quarter consolidated sales and
profits at Sony, the Japanese electronics group.
Sales in the three months ended December fell nearly 4 per cent to Y1,082bn
(Pounds 6.3bn) from Y1,125bn previously. Pre-tax profits dropped more
dramatically by 62 per cent to Y50.6bn, although this was largely due to an
extraordinary gain following the issue of shares by Sony Music Entertainment
in the previous year. Discounting the effect of the 1991 extraordinary gain,
pre-tax profits fell by 27 per cent.
Europe showed the steepest decline of all Sony's important markets, with
sales falling by 10 per cent to Y310.8bn, although Japan followed closely
with an 8.6 per cent fall in sales to Y257.3bn.
In contrast, sales in the US were up 1.2 per cent to Y330.6bn, although this
was affected by the weakness of the dollar against the yen. In dollar terms
sales were up by 12 per cent.
Among products, video recorders and camcorders suffered the largest
reduction in sales of nearly 12 per cent. Audio sales also fell 6 per cent,
while TV sales increased by 10 per cent on the strength of worldwide demand
for computer displays from the computer industry and the popularity of
Sony's flatter screen TV in the US.
While music sales were down by 4 per cent, in dollar terms music
entertainment rose 16 per cent. Film entertainment, however, saw a decline
of 8 per cent even in dollar terms, although this was also due to an
extraordinary gain in the previous third quarter, Sony said.
Sony has not changed its projections for the next fiscal year since it
reduced its forecast in November to sales of Y3,950bn, or a 3 per cent
increase.
The company reports that sales of MiniDiscs, its new digital compact disc
format which is competing for the portable digital audio market with
Philips's Digital Compact Cassette, are strong. Sony is increasing its
initial monthly production of 30,000 MiniDisc units to between 40,000 and
50,000. The number of software titles is expected to rise to between 1,250
and 1,500 by the end of the year.

UNITED Biscuits, Britain's largest biscuit and snacks manufacturer, is
seeking to sell Terry's, its chocolate division, in a move intended to cut
debt and pave the way for further acquisitions.
Talks have been underway for several weeks with a number of prospective
buyers. They are understood to be most advanced with Philip Morris, the US
tobacco and food group, which owns Jacobs Suchard, the Swiss chocolate and
coffee company. Neither UB nor Philip Morris would comment.
Analysts estimate that Terry's, which earned operating profits of Pounds
3.2m on sales of Pounds 69m in the first half of last year, could fetch more
than Pounds 200m. The company has about 3 per cent of the UK chocolate
market as well as subsidiaries in France and Italy.
UB has made acquisitions in continental Europe, Australia and the US in the
past two years in an effort to strengthen its international presence in
biscuits and savoury snacks, which it views as its core businesses.
The company is considering bidding for the biscuits interests of Royal
Brands, a leading Spanish food company, which has been put up for sale by
Tabacalera, its state-owned parent. UB is also believed to have been in
talks with Derwent Valley Foods, a privately-owned UK snacks maker best
known for its Phileas Fogg brand.
However, UB's scope for further acquisitions is limited by its high gearing,
which rose to 88 per cent after last month's Pounds 47m purchase of
Bake-Line, a US biscuit maker. The company's total debt is currently about
Pounds 540m.
The sale of Terry's would take the recent consolidation of Europe's
chocolate industry a step further. Suchard, which was purchased by Philip
Morris for Dollars 3.8bn (Pounds 2.7bn) in 1990, successfully bid Dollars
1.5bn last autumn to acquire Freia Marabou, a Norwegian confectionery
manufacturer.
Though Suchard is one of Europe's leading chocolate producers, it has only a
small share of the UK market, which is dominated by Cadbury Schweppes,
Nestle and Mars.
Another possible bidder for Terry's is Hershey, the largest US chocolate
company, which has been seeking to expand in Europe. It had also sought to
take over Freia Marabou.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Paternoster Square proposal nears final clearance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the longest-running planning controversies in London neared an end
yesterday when Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, cleared the way
for the Pounds 800m redevelopment of Paternoster Square next to St Paul's
Cathedral.
Mr Howard has decided not to exercise his right to judge on the planning
applications to redevelop Paternoster Square, and the adjacent Sudbury
House. His decision will allow the Corporation of London to proceed with
granting planning permission as it intends.
The developer, Paternoster Associates, said construction at the seven-acre
site, of which Paternoster Square forms 4.2 acres, might start next year.
There have been growing doubts about whether Paternoster Square will be
redeveloped because of the depressed state of the commercial property
market, but the company said it wanted to start work 'as soon as practically
possible'.
Mr Howard said there was 'a pressing need for this largely vacant site to be
redeveloped in a way that enhances the setting of St Paul's Cathedral'. He
was satisfied that the current proposals for the two sites met this need.
The corporation referred the planning applications to Mr Howard in October
after resolving to approve them both. The scheme, which was revised in July,
includes 72,000 square metres of office space and 13,700 square metres of
shops.
The site has been controversial for more than five years, since the Prince
of Wales condemned the original modernist design for the redevelopment as
'deeply depressing'. Paternoster Associates' plan was unveiled by the prince
in May 1991.
Paternoster Associates is a partnership between Greycoat, the UK developer,
Park Tower Group of New York, and an affiliate of Mitsubishi Estate Company
of Japan. The group paid Pounds 160m for the site when it was acquired in
1989.
The group said construction would start at the earliest next year and be
completed by 1998. The redevelopment would replace buildings laid out in the
late 1950s following bombing near St Paul's in the second world war. Mr
Howard also approved proposals to convert the Harrods Depository in London
into a 141-bedroom hotel. The decision follows the recommendation of a
planning inquiry.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Former analyst hopes to keep power stations switched on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHRIS Rowland, as an analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd, acquired a
reputation in the City for a bearish outlook on some of the electricity
companies he followed. But there is nothing pessimistic about his view of
his own prospects.
To the surprise of his fellow electricity-watchers, he has quit his
lucrative job at the company where has worked for 10 years so that he can
attempt to run parts of five power stations that National Power, the
electricity generator, considers have had their day.
Mr Rowland, 37, and married with one child, insists the project is viable.
'I think I can make a go out of the five units which National Power wants to
close. I would always have regretted not making a try of it.'
National Power said yesterday that, although Mr Rowland had approached it
through his company, Cabah Energy, his initial offer was not commercially
attractive. However, National Power said it would consider future bids on
their merit.
Mr Rowland said talks were continuing and praised the company for
considering his approach. 'Many others in its position would not.'
As well as approaching National Power, Mr Rowland has applied to Offer, the
electricity industry regulator, for a licence to run the units.
Offer has already begun an investigation into whether National Power is
justified economically in closing the units.
Although most of Mr Rowland's former analyst colleagues expect Offer to back
National Power's decision, some believe it will say the units should be
offered for sale.
Mr Rowland said negotiations were at an early stage and various alternatives
were being discussed. He refused to comment on financing for the new
venture, or on the identity of any other partners.
'It is always going to be difficult to make money out of old power
stations,' said one colleague at another investment bank.
'National Power want to close these stations because they think they are no
longer economic to run. He is taking a big risk.'

FT  19 FEB 93 / US markets give mixed signal on economy plan: Bonds rise
sharply but share prices decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US markets gave President Clinton's package a mixed reaction yesterday.
Government bonds rose sharply but share prices ended a chaotic day mostly
lower.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond, the key indicator of
bond market performance, was up about a point at 101 9/32 .
Investors in fixed-income government bonds bid prices higher because they
believed that the tax-raising package would slow economic growth and
therefore stifle inflation. Low inflation helps maintain the value of their
investments.
But the prospect of slower economic growth troubled the stock markets. Mr
Will Brown, chief economist at JP Morgan in New York, said: 'The package
will act as a modest restraint on demand, but not of a magnitude likely to
derail a recovery.'
After fluctuating wildly for most of the day, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average finished down 10.0 at 3,3302.19. In early trading the Dow jumped 35
points, primarily a technical reaction from investors who felt that stocks
had been oversold during the market's big plunge on Tuesday.
Within hours, however, the Dow was showing a net decline of 35 points as
pessimism about the tax increases swept the markets, although it eventually
recovered most of the lost ground before the close.
The overall market view of President Clinton's economic proposals was
negative. Investors are concerned that the tax increases will hurt the
economy, and were disappointed that the president's deficit reduction
package was not tilted more towards spending cuts.
The hardest hit sector in the stock markets was airline shares, which fell
sharply on news of the energy tax and worries about the effect of higher
income taxes on demand for air travel. UAL fell Dollars 3 1/2 to 115 3/4 ,
Delta fell 1 3/4 to Dollars 46 7/8 and the parent company of American
Airlines dropped Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 57.
The rise in the price of the 30-year bond pushed the yield, or investment
return, down to 7.017 per cent, the lowest level it has been since the
government began issuing 30-year bonds in the late 1970s.
This makes it likely that US mortgage and corporate borrowing rates - many
of which are pegged to the yield on the 30-year bond and other
longer-maturing government securities - will come down over the next few
days.
The immediate reaction of the foreign exchange markets to the president's
speech was positive, with the dollar rising almost 3 pfennigs to DM1.6515 on
overseas markets late Wednesday night. In New York, however, trading was
more subdued amid confusion over what the Clinton package will mean for the
economy over the long term. At the close in New York the US currency had
slipped back to stand at DM1.6315, up about a pfennig.
Although most economists on Wall Street believe that higher personal and
corporate taxes will slow economic growth, and with it corporate earnings, a
few welcomed the president's economic proposals.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Europe will follow US lead over high-definition TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE will have to fall in line with the US on a transmission standard for
digital high-definition television, the EC industry commissioner has said.
Mr Martin Bangemann said there was no point starting a global battle over
advanced television standards by trying to set an exclusive EC standard.
His comments mark the end of the EC's costly standards-based HDTV strategy
and could mean that the US technology, which should be selected later this
year, will be adopted worldwide.
Mr Bangemann, who took over responsibility for HDTV last month, says the EC
should concentrate on salvaging the best elements of its ill-fated
eight-year programme to develop advanced, cinema-quality television. 'A
digital standard doesn't need to be set (by the EC),' he said. 'Global
standards are always the best solution.'
EC taxpayers have invested at least Ecu625m (Pounds 516m) in research and
development of analogue HDTV since 1986. Companies such as Philips of the
Netherlands and Thomson of France have also ploughed funds into developing
the EC standards, and are ready to mass-produce televisions to those norms.
The aim of exclusive technical standards for European HDTV was to gain a
head start against Japan and the US. But technological advances and
political opposition have meant that EC satellite transmission technology
has been almost overtaken by US digital standards.
Mr Bangemann believes digital technology could be developed by 1997. Unlike
EC analogue technology, digital standards can be used for broadcasts by
terrestrial television stations.
Britain is blocking further EC funding of Ecu500m over the next five years,
on the grounds that digital technology may arrive on the market earlier than
predicted. As a result, Philips announced last month it would not start
making HDTV televisions to European standards.
However, if the EC does adopt the US standard, the two principal EC
manufacturers will not necessarily lose because they are both involved in
one of the consortia bidding to produce the US technology. Philips and
Thomson also argue that the HDTV programme has had useful spin-offs.
Japan, which has concentrated on analogue HDTV technology, may also be
forced to adopt the US digital norms. Analysts estimate digital HDTV in
Japan and Europe will lag about five years behind the US.
Mr Bangemann is now seeking to amend the commission's plans to concentrate
on developing lighter, cheaper wide-screen televisions, and the conversion
and production of programmes for the wide-screen format.
The commission has asked the Danish presidency of the EC for a special
meeting of telecommunications ministers to debate the future of HDTV policy,
ahead of the scheduled council on May 10.

FT  19 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: RTZ
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ was clearly anxious to get its hands on Nerco's attractive US coal
reserves. The Dollars 1.2bn acquisition also includes a disparate package of
oil, gas and precious metals assets for which a buyer will have to be found.
That leaves a degree of risk. Gearing of around 60 per cent is not
unreasonable at this stage of the cycle, but it would do to make some
in-roads into debt through disposals before making another move.
If that can be achieved, RTZ looks sensible to add coal to its portfolio of
commodities. The low-cost and low-sulphur coal bought yesterday should be
less vulnerable to environmental legislation. With 60 per cent of the output
sold under long-term contracts, there is also some security of earnings.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's unseemly haste in cutting base rates after the release of
December's appalling unemployment figures now looks misplaced. Traditional
seasonal adjustments may have been rendered invalid by the length of the
recession. As a result, December's figures may not have been as bad as they
looked, while only cold comfort can be drawn from the better January data.
The trend rise in unemployment is still running at over 40,000 a month, far
higher than at a similar stage of previous recessions. The implications for
consumer confidence are clear.
There is, however, a silver lining. Productivity is now climbing rapidly and
may show double-digit growth once cyclical recovery starts. In manufacturing
industry, at least, that has all but offset wage inflation, which should
help counter the impact of devaluation. Yet if the near-term inflation
outlook is good, that is purely a function of the depressed economy. The
real inflation test comes later.

FT  19 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Kleinwort Benson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 5 per cent rise in Kleinwort Benson's shares yesterday is an obvious
mark of relief at its lower provisions. The rest of the story, though, is
not particularly reassuring, least of all the Pounds 13.6m exceptional prior
year tax charge. Kleinwort rightly asserts that this is a one-off accounting
item. It is simply moving a tax loss off its balance sheet. The credit will
now be carried forward as a contingent asset, making no difference to the
amount of tax it actually pays or to cash flow. But the change in treatment
suggests the credit should never have been on the balance sheet at all,
something that has taken Kleinwort's management years to correct.
Given the bank's strategic problems, one might have hoped for more
precision. Return on capital is not inspiring. Even without the exceptional
tax charge, net return on shareholders' funds is less than 9 per cent.
It is difficult to see where growth will come from, especially since
Kleinwort has been losing market share in mergers and acquisitions.
Kleinwort may be lucky with the markets. It had a good year both in gilts
and treasury business. But growth needs a more secure foundation than
privatising Argentine utilities. Some surplus capital could be put towards
acquiring additional fund management business, though that would mean a
hefty goodwill charge. A better idea might be for Kleinwort to give
shareholders back some money by again buying its shares in the market.

FT  19 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Kingfisher/Darty
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are two starkly different interpretations of Kingfisher's takeover of
Darty. The first suggests it is taking a wild punt in paying Pounds 560m for
a French service sector company currently toying with recession. The dangers
are heightened by Kingfisher assuming a further Pounds 477m of debt, writing
off Pounds 900m of goodwill, and increasing gearing to 66 per cent even
after a Pounds 313m rights issue.
The alternative view is that Kingfisher is acquiring a well-managed business
with market leadership and considerable scope for expansion. Darty's strong
income stream will quickly enhance Kingfisher's earnings. The price is
attractive at just 16 times Darty's forward earnings.
Which version is right depends on one largely unpredictable factor: how well
the two managements co-operate. The history of recent Anglo-French mergers
is poor. In this case, there are genuine grounds for optimism. First,
Darty's management has a firm financial interest in success, having been
paid mainly with Kingfisher paper. Second, Kingfisher is a flexible parent
more akin to a holding company than a traditional retailer, though this
approach also implies less immediate synergy benefit for Comet than the
market originally assumed. Third, the deal's architect is Sir Geoffrey
Mulcahy who has proved the near-personification of caution. His record
should win him the benefit of the doubt.

FT  19 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Glaxo's trusty tonic
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's interim figures were just what the doctor ordered for Glaxo's
sickly share price. Sales grew faster than the market expected, albeit
thanks to the old stager Zantac rather than the new generation products. An
overdue explanation of the company's sensible but modest ambitions in
over-the-counter medicines should snuff out speculation of a big acquisition
and rights issue. But that will do nothing to calm the market's fears of
tighter government regulation.
Despite ploughing ever more into research and development, Glaxo is
accumulating cash at the rate of Pounds 200m a year. In the context of total
profits of perhaps Pounds 1.7bn this year, the drag of a Pounds 1.5bn cash
pile is bearable. But sales are expected to grow faster than costs from here
on. Operating margins which are already over 30 per cent will, if anything,
increase. Glaxo will soon have to decide whether to pay higher dividends or
make an acquisition. Embarrassment of riches may leave it open to pressure.
With a stream of innovative new products on the way, Glaxo should be better
placed than most to withstand government brow-beating. Only a fraction of
sales growth in the first half came from price increases. Yet that does not
make Glaxo immune. Drug prices are actually falling in Japan. On a yield
close to the market average, Glaxo looks a relatively safe place to ride out
the uncertainty. But the sector will remain under a cloud until the scope of
President Clinton's crusade against healthcare costs is clear.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Mr Kohl faces the squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE ECONOMIC reconstruction of east Germany remains a severe problem
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
for Germany, its neighbours and the world. The German government is still
far from bringing about a self-sustaining recovery in the east.
Reunification-induced inflationary pressures have caused the Bundesbank to
keep short-term interest rates high since 1991, depressing economies across
Europe. The terms on which east German liabilities were converted in 1990,
coupled with east Germans' desire for west German incomes, have much
increased public financing needs.
East Germany has become the hole in the heart of the European economy.
Unless repaired, the damage will spread. A long European recession would
deliver the coup de grace to the Maastricht process. Additionally, it could
fatally undermine the Community's single market. Already it seems unlikely
that Germany will fulfil the fiscal conditions set at Maastricht for
economic and monetary union later in the decade.
Germany's slowdown has made corrective policies more difficult, yet more
necessary. The Bonn government expects zero growth for Germany as a whole
this year. The country has been living beyond its means. It now ranks
seventh in the EC in terms of GDP per head.
The 3 per cent wage rise agreed earlier this month for public sector
employees shows some willingness to tighten belts. Many large west German
manufacturing companies have been made uncompetitive by excessive wage rises
and the D-Mark's EMS revaluation. It would be realistic for workers in the
west to prepare for several years of real wage stagnation.
Labour costs
East German unit labour costs are 80 per cent above the west German level.
This has accelerated the industrial collapse east of the Elbe - a
significant factor behind the demand for large transfers from Bonn. Solving
the wage problem is an essential way of reducing the drain from east Germany
on public finances.
Now that east German wage tariffs are 73 per cent of those in the west, any
further catch-up can take place only over a long period. The preferable
approach would be to offer east German employers a wage subsidy to maintain
employment at relatively low wages. If east German workers insist on
maintaining the drive to equalise wages by 1994-95, Bonn must make clear its
response will be to cut subsidies for depressed eastern industries. Unless
wage costs are cut, the Treuhand's difficulties with privatisation will
grow.
Budgetary cuts
Next, Bonn must extend its medium-term budgetary cuts. Expenditure
reductions agreed so far do not match the need for radically overhauling
spending priorities. Overall federal expenditure totals for 1995-96 are now
5 per cent higher than the finance ministry proposed last summer. And the
government's budgetary arithmetic is based on highly optimistic assumptions
about GDP growth after 1994.
The government must also tap additional revenue sources. Chancellor Helmut
Kohl wants to delay further income tax increases until 1995. Holding back
from a tax increase this year makes sense. Ruling one out for 1994 does not.
The government should also take a far more imaginative line over
privatisation.
None of these suggestions is easy to enact. Reunification strains have
eroded traditional German policy consensus. So far, the Bundesbank's
international credibility has allowed Germany to finance very large
borrowing at relatively low long-term interest rates. But, unless Germany
takes adequate measures, the financial markets will demand corrective steps.
Debt of the size now being acquired by the public sector represents a heavy
mortgage.
Action will require an accord with the opposition Social Democrats, who,
because of their majority in the Bundesrat, have an effective veto over tax
legislation. Mr Kohl has been making heavy weather of trying to spread the
burdens of unity through negotiations on his 'solidarity pact'. He must now
recognise that room for manoeuvre, already small, could soon disappear. If
Germany's economic imbalances persist, the clouds over Mr Kohl's own future
will grow. But they will be small compared with the risk of storms over
Europe.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Budget for the supply side
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN ISN'T working. Despite the rise in seasonally adjusted unemployment
to just below 3m by mid-January, the Bank of England concluded in its
Inflation Report out this week that the government's target range for
inflation of 1 to 4 per cent is not secure. In any case, the question has
never been whether a recession lasting nine quarters would lower inflation.
The question is whether the UK can sustain non-inflationary growth. It is
against this test that the Budget offered by the chancellor on March 16
needs to be judged.
What is needed is neither a Budget for business nor a Budget for jobs, but a
Budget for the supply side as a whole. Such a Budget should not be designed
to alleviate each and every business complaint. Nor can it be a Budget
crammed with special incentives for supposedly worthy activities.
Macroeconomic stability should be at the heart of such a Budget. Instability
leads to waste. The excessive investment in property development of the late
1980s was, for example, one fruit of the UK's long inflationary history. The
government must offer a fiscal prospect that makes resort to inflation seem
highly unlikely. Tax increases seem necessary. The sole alternative would be
a dynamic recovery, combined with a credible programme of tight control of
public spending. Either way the chancellor has no room for 'giving' anything
away. The only question is how much he will have to take.
No chance for reform
In view of this dismal background, comprehensive fiscal reform would create
too many losers. But the fiscal predicament of the government also means
that most of the many and varied pet schemes of business lobbyists - relief
of surplus advance corporation tax, higher first-year capital allowances,
faster depreciation, higher thresholds for corporation tax, exemption from
taxes on long-term capital gains, tax relief for export promotion, higher
VAT thresholds, lower uniform business rates and abolition of inheritance
tax - are also unlikely to be adopted.
The lack of opportunity for reform is a pity, mostly because of the absence
of any chance for coherent reform after the first year of a new parliament.
The British tax system remains riddled with fundamental anomalies.
Notwithstanding the adverse background, a few changes may be helpful.
Personal equity plans could be extended to include interest-bearing assets
and Tessas might be made more flexible. For business, depreciation might be
indexed for inflation, VAT thresholds might be raised and the high rate of
tax of capital gains might be lowered or, better still, roll-over relief
might be offered. Nonetheless, the room for manoeuvre is small. The
Confederation of British Industry argues its proposals would cost only
Pounds 500m to Pounds 1bn and would be self-financing in the long term. A
Treasury faced with a need to borrow more than Pounds 50bn might regard this
as petty cash, but even petty cash mounts swiftly up.
Fiscal buttresses
On one point the Treasury should be firm. It is true that there is double
taxation of corporate income earned abroad because ACT cannot be set against
foreign corporation tax. But ACT is really just an income tax. It is far
from clear that UK residents should not pay income tax on profits earned
abroad by the companies they own. If the result is to lower the incentive
for corporations to invest abroad, so be it.
In the last resort, however, tinkering with taxation is secondary. The
government has taken the actions most needed by business, which were to
lower interest rates and let the exchange rate depreciate. The principal
function of this budget is, therefore, to provide the fiscal buttresses for
these changes in monetary policy.
The fate of business depends not on further fiscal hand-outs, but on its
will to control its own costs, the most important of which is for labour.
With the underlying increase in average earnings down to 4 3/4 per cent,
things are beginning to look encouraging at last. But control over pay must
continue well into the recovery. The fate of businesses lies in its own
hands and - given the long-term link between pay and jobs - so too does that
of the 3m unemployed.
This is the fourth of a series of leaders on the March Budget.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Seismic shock to the economic landscape: Public investment
and a heavier tax burden are the keynotes of the package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As an impassioned plea for a fundamental change in the nation's economic
philosophy, President Bill Clinton's address to Congress may prove to be of
historic significance. He argued, in effect, that Republican strategies
emphasising increased incentives for individuals had failed and that the
nation needed to follow a social democratic path, involving a greater
emphasis on public investment and a fairer distribution of the tax burden.
Mr Clinton bucked recent fiscal trends by becoming the first leader of an
advanced democracy to propose a big increase in the top rate of income tax -
from 31 per cent to nearly 40 per cent for the richest families. Adding in
state and local taxes, top earners will face an effective top rate of about
50 per cent. Most industrial countries have been striving to reduce top
marginal rates in a bid to improve economic efficiency.
Although Mr Clinton deliberately targeted the rich, he raised taxes on the
great bulk of American households - all families with incomes of more than
Dollars 30,000 a year - thus breaking one of his main campaign pledges.
However, because a significant proportion of the taxes will be used to
increase public investment in infrastructure, education and training, Mr
Clinton was not able to signal a wholly convincing reduction in the federal
deficit.
By fiscal 1997, some five years into a business cycle upswing, Mr Clinton
hopes to have reduced the deficit to slightly more than Dollars 200bn,
compared with nearly Dollars 300bn today. However, that still represents 2.7
per cent of gross domestic product, a significant drain on national savings
at a point in the cycle when the budget ought to be close to balance, if not
in surplus. Moreover, in all probability Congress will not accept all the
proposed spending cuts and tax increases.
And, as Mr Clinton rightly stressed, any hope of controlling the deficit in
the longer term requires the enactment of effective controls on healthcare
spending - a controversial issue on which a national consensus is as yet far
from assured.
The economic plan reflects two of Mr Clinton's deepest convictions:
A public sector-led switch from consumption to investment is essential to
revive long-term productivity growth and restore faith in the 'American
dream'. Social solidarity is important for its own sake. Mr Clinton is
telling affluent Americans that it is their duty to pay more taxes. He
probably would have raised taxes on the rich even if he had not needed more
revenue.
Yet recent economic figures are throwing doubt on the assumptions underlying
the Clinton plan, which was conceived largely as a response to the perceived
economic problems of the 1980s. Hearing his 'call to economic arms', you
might think the economy was still floundering in recession. In reality, the
downturn ended nearly two years ago and the underlying annual rate of growth
has accelerated to about 3 per cent. Business investment and profits are
rebounding strongly.
Jobs are admittedly not being created as fast as in previous recoveries. But
the labour force is growing far less rapidly, reflecting the absorption of
the 'baby-boomer' bulge in the workforce. The unemployment rate has already
fallen to 7.1 per cent from a peak of 7.7 per cent last year.
Productivity growth - the number one problem according to Mr Clinton - seems
to be staging a spontaneous revival. Productivity increased by 2.7 per cent
last year and at an annual rate of 4.0 per cent in the fourth quarter. These
were the best figures for two decades. Efficiency gains are occurring
throughout the economy, even in the sprawling services sector.
Against this economic backdrop, the Clinton plan looks flawed. With the
economic numbers improving, it is hard to understand why Mr Clinton is
determined to press ahead with a short-term fiscal stimulus worth Dollars
30bn, or about 0.5 per cent of GDP. Such a Keynesian boost to an already
debt-laden economy was no part of his campaign strategy.
When the aim is supposedly the creation of 500,000 jobs over two years, the
emphasis on investment incentives - a temporary credit for large companies
and a permanent credit for small companies - may prove unwise. There is a
danger that additional subsidies for capital, at time when rapidly rising
healthcare premiums are raising the cost of labour, will accelerate the
shift under way towards more capital-intensive forms of production.
It is also curious, and perhaps unprecedented, for an administration to call
simultaneously for stimulus and restraint. The attack on the deficit is long
overdue but it means that Mr Clinton will be taking purchasing power out of
the economy as his presidency progresses: he plans to raise taxes by about
Dollars 240bn over four years and make net spending cuts (after allowing for
the boost to public investment) of about Dollars 80bn. It seems naive to
expect consumers and companies to react joyously to the immediate stimulus
without taking account, today, of the 'austerity package' planned for later.
The net effect of the package could thus be mildly deflationary, even
allowing for some further decline in long bond yields. The risk of a
negative impact on growth has been heightened by Mr Clinton's disregard for
economic incentives. He had to cut the deficit but he did not have to rely
so heavily on increases in taxes. And having targeted taxes, he could have
tried to broaden the tax base rather than raise tax rates.
The energy tax was a modest step in the right direction but it will raise
only Dollars 22bn a year when fully phased in. It is no substitute for a
European-style value-added tax which could efficiently have raised a far
larger sum. This would have corrected the biggest anomaly in the US tax
system (the near complete absence of levies on consumption), while
inflicting no damage on incentives to save or invest. Mr Clinton instead
emphasised higher rates of income and corporate taxes, only partially
balanced by special concessions such as investment tax credits. In effect
this is a repeal of the admired 1986 Tax Reform Act, which sought to create
a 'level fiscal playing field' by eliminating loopholes and lowering tax
rates.
Mr Clinton may argue that considerations of fairness obliged him to raise
top rates of income and corporation taxes. This was certainly the easiest
course. But he could have preserved economic incentives by attacking the tax
concessions that favour the wealthy: for example, the tax deductibility of
pensions, health premiums and mortgage interest costs about Dollars 150bn
annually in lost revenue, which is nearly twice as much as Mr Clinton hopes
to raise when his rate increases are fully phased in.
Mr Clinton has been preaching the need for higher public investment, a lower
deficit and a fairer tax system from the day he announced his bid for the
presidency. All three goals are a legitimate reaction to the 'excesses' of
the 1980s and, if achieved, will bring US policies more into line with those
of other industrial democracies. Whether his package will boost growth or
transform the employment outlook is altogether more questionable.
Nobody can claim that Mr Clinton lacks courage, however. He is attempting
the most sweeping reshaping of the economic landscape since Ronald Reagan's
famous tax-cutting budget of 1981. The difference is that he sees government
as part of the solution rather than as part of the problem.

Every penny's now under scrutiny at Control Securities, what with newly
revealed negative net assets of Pounds 31.8m as well as debts exceeding
Pounds 250m. So the property company may well be regretting a certain Pounds
5,000 outlay in its last financial year.
The money was donated to the election fund of Labour MP Keith Vaz who has
championed the cause of depositors of collapsed bank BCCI. And who can
forget that on the last day of Control's 1992 financial year its then
chairman Nazmu Virani was arrested in connection with the BCCI affair?
But at least Control was fairly even-handed. It gave Pounds 1,750 to the
Liberal Democrat party too.

The decision to change chairman by Kleinwort Benson has been so discreet as
to camouflage the boardroom upheaval that has occurred at the old
established merchant bank which has lost its momentum.
David Peake, a member of the family and a banker, is handing over to Lord
Rockley, a few months older and a corporate finance man. Peake, who at 58
has been doing the job for a mere four years, stays on the board.
Considering that it was only last year that another corporate finance man in
the shape of 51-year-old Simon Robertson was promoted to be Peake's deputy,
he would have seemed the natural successor to a casual outsider.
But merchant banks are more collegiate than most outfits, and it seems to
have been felt that an Old Etonian city gent like Lord Rockley, a
vice-chairman, was the best bet to command the trust and confidence of the
troops. But will he take the tough strategic decisions needed to restore
Kleinwort to former glory?
Somehow, one suspects not.

Are you fat, addicted to rich food, averse to exercise, and perhaps even a
smoker? If so, the medical journal Lancet has some useful advice for you . .
. unless you happen to be French as wel1, and so probably know it already.
First, never let your low-density lipoprotein become oxidised because, in
that case, it will get busy helping to build up layers of fat that could
block your arteries.
Second, according to US and Israeli researchers, the perilous oxidisation
can be forestalled by taking in phenolic flavonoids, which act as
anti-oxidants.
Third - which the researchers suspect the French, at least, somehow know
instinctively - a pleasant way of absorbing phenolic flavonoids is to drink
a modicum of red wine. The goodness is not in the alcohol, however, but in
its other ingredients.

It's hard to quibble about the calibre of the Bank of England's latest
clutch of non-executive directors. Sir Jeremy Morse, recently retired
chairman of Lloyds Bank, is one of Britain's best bankers. Hambros' Sir
Chips Keswick is regarded as very sound.
How refreshing, too, to find a woman at last on the Court of the Bank of
England, although Frances Heaton's appointment suggests that life at the
Takeover Panel can't be all that busy at the moment.
Even so, the appointments do look a trifle incestuous. Morse and Keswick
both learnt their trade at the same place - Glyn Mills &amp; Co. Sir David
Walker, one of the outgoing Bank directors, has joined the board of Morse's
old firm Lloyds, and is expected to take his old job after a decent
interval. Moreover, Walker is an old Treasury hand and so is Frances Heaton.
Perhaps the government could have cast the net a bit wider. The Bank would
benefit from a greater variety of opinions. The problem with the latest
bunch is that there's probably nothing whatsoever they disagree about.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Observer: Bangemann bangs on
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'The truth is rarely pure, and never simple.' Few things are more aptly
depicted by Oscar Wilde's dictum than the attitudes to Britain of Germany's
Martin Bangemann, the European Community commissioner for industry.
For one example, take the charge that he is a would-be banner of British
bangers, not to mention prawn-flavoured crisps. It is false. Take for
another the complaint about his insensitive delivery of strongly worded
federalist speeches during the UK parliamentary seethings over Maastricht.
That is true.
But whatever the complications, he is evidently not going to change his
bruising bluntness where British sensibilities are concerned.
Witness the fluent English-speaker's response when politely asked during a
press conference to favour UK television viewers with an English version of
his comments on the impact of the EC's rescue package for the steel
industry. No, he replied, he had already dealt with the topic in German.
There seems no hope of stinging him with criticism, such as the sort that
emerged from a survey of 2,000 European industrialists, half of them from
Britain. A majority named him, along with Jacques Delors, as the EC
commissioners most biased in favour of their own narrow national interests.
How did Bangemann respond? He thumbed through his favourite Oscar Wilde
quotations, and took solace in: 'To disagree with three-fourths of the
British public on all points is one of the first elements of sanity - one of
the deepest consolations in all moments of spiritual doubt.'

FT  19 FEB 93 / President's search for the perfect wave: Jurek Martin
examines Clinton's big political gamble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most successful peacetime politicians catch the wave before it crests.
Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan managed it at the beginning of their
administrations, with very different policies at very different times. But
it was an instinct not possessed by Jimmy Carter, whose declaration in 1977
of the 'moral equivalent of war' on profligate energy use caught his nation
in a pacifist mode, and George Bush, who, lacking 'the vision thing', never
saw what swamped him.
Bill Clinton, just one month in office, thinks he has seen the wave forming.
Contrary to all the political evidence of the past 12 years, he is convinced
that Americans are ready to reverse the self-indulgence of the 1980s by
paying higher taxes in the greater cause of reducing the federal budget
deficit and the national debt. He is also offering short-term stimulus,
longer-term investment and bigger, if phased, cuts in spending than ever
proposed by Mr Bush. But the headlines yesterday are all about where the
average American's wallet is going to be hit.
It is a big gamble and a larger political presumption. Mr Bush lost last
November in good measure because he promised never to raise taxes and two
years later changed his mind. Across the country those politicians who have
trodden the same path have generally suffered.
In New Jersey, a good national microcosm, the Democrats lost control of the
legislature because of opposition to the tax increases advanced by Governor
Jim Florio. Even Senator Bill Bradley, the most popular politician in the
state, nearly lost to a nobody in 1990 because of his association with Mr
Florio. Out in California, where the tax revolt was born in the 1970s, Mr
Pete Wilson, the Republican governor and reasonable presidential aspirant,
has seen his stock plummet as a result of his determination to put the
state's fiscal house in order.
And yet last November, 62 per cent of the American public explicitly
rejected the policies advanced by President Bush, which were that there was
nothing chronically wrong with the nation that a naturally recovering
economy, still lower taxes and a few gimmicks such as a balanced budget
amendment could not cure.
In last year's campaign, Ross Perot, free of standard political constraints,
had no compunction in demanding sacrifices by all, including higher taxes
and more expensive energy. Mr Clinton, in pursuit of victory, may have
fudged on the tax front but he talked tough on the budget. Both put forward
cases for change on a serious scale.
Conventional political wisdom is that politicians rarely practise in office
what they preach in campaigns. Thus the dictum of Russell Long, the former
senator from Louisiana - 'don't tax you, don't tax me, tax that fellow,
behind the tree' - was for Washington a safe recourse. The reflex political
criticism is that Mr Clinton, in taking it out of 'you and me', has bought
himself big trouble.
But political reflexes, even from Republicans, may be questioned in this
strange era where public opinion is so influential but so subject to
persuasion and manipulation. Knowing this, and sensibly trying to co-opt Mr
Perot in advance, the Clinton team is giving his programme the hard sell in
every corner of the country.
Like any good populist pitch, this campaign will have its villains.
Borrowing again from Mr Reagan, who blamed his predecessor at every turn, Mr
Clinton will constantly disparage Mr Bush's 'failed' policies. He will copy
Mr Perot and portray a Washington stuffed with high-paid lobbyists, all
conspiring to preserve the status quo known as gridlock. He will
conveniently forget that some of the most effective of them represent
America's least affluent.
Just as 10 years ago Mr Reagan seduced the 'boll weevil' southern Democrats,
so Mr Clinton will target key Republicans, because, if he cannot hold all
his own party in line, he may need them. There are a fistful of senior
moderate senators - John Chafee, William Cohen, James Jeffords, John
Danforth, Nancy Kassebaum, Richard Lugar, even Robert Dole - who do not
necessarily dance to the music of Newt Gingrich, Jesse Helms and the rest of
the conservative band. These moderates prefer to influence policy rather
than denounce it and they just might cut some deals, especially on deficit
reduction.
But it will be hard. Neither Washington nor the country at large has yet
measured Mr Clinton's resolution. Some suspect he talks a better game - and
on Wednesday he was very fine - than he plays and can fold under pressure.
There are so many parts to his programme that he could well lose a couple of
battles early and suddenly lose control of the war. The reverse may also be
true. He is not only making waves, he may just have caught the big one.

FT  19 FEB 93 / After the accident: Jean-Luc Lagardere, chairman of Matra
Hachette, talks to David Buchan and David White
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the face of it, Jean-Luc Lagardere has shown amazing powers of recovery.
In the 1980s he managed to steer a bumpy path as chairman of two French
groups with illustrious names but very little else in common: Matra,
thrusting missile, electronics and transport equipment manufacturer, and
Hachette, venerable and far-flung publishing empire. Mr Lagardere stayed in
the driving seat as Matra was part nationalised and then denationalised. His
enthusiasm for adventurous new business always raised eyebrows.
Some of his initiatives, such as a foray into watchmaking, misfired. But
those flops were nothing compared with what was in store in the early 1990s,
'the big accident', as Mr Lagardere calls it - Hachette's investment in the
La Cinq television station, which folded last year, leaving the publishing
group with an exposure of FFr3.5bn (Pounds 440m).
He has since succeeded in recapitalising Hachette, merging the two groups,
still under his chairmanship, into Matra Hachette, and recasting the holding
company, which is the combined group's main shareholder, in a way that makes
his own position virtually unassailable.
Mr Lagardere is still the dashing entrepreneur with the permanent tan,
starry-eyed about new technology. He is an outsider to France's mainstream
political and business establishment, drawn from more elitist grandes ecoles
than the Ecole Superieure d'Electricite where he graduated as an engineer.
Matra, a postwar creation, has always been a parvenu on the French
industrial scene.
But Mr Lagardere is now 64. It is 30 years since he joined Matra as managing
director. He talks of younger generations of managers, of the 'apres moi'.
Above all, he is chastened by the past year's experience. He has promised no
more long-shot ventures. 'I am not going to make 20-year investments. You
have to have your return sooner.' He confesses that for the first time in
his life he is giving top priority to profit. Flanked by a high-powered
'group executive and strategic committee', he is trying to rebuild his
credibility in a financial world of which he is deeply suspicious.
He confidently predicts a tripling of Matra Hachette's net profit by 1996,
from last year's FFr350m to FFr1bn - although that would still be less than
2 per cent of sales. By then, he says, if it makes no more big acquisitions,
it will wipe out its debts of FFr3bn. The merger will bring 'big reductions'
in administrative staff in the group, which employs around 50,000. But, Mr
Lagardere adds: 'That is not something one boasts about.'
To argue the logic of an industrial grouping ranging from airborne missiles
to Elle magazine is something of an intellectual challenge. Defensively, Mr
Lagardere cites the example of General Electric of the US, with its NBC
television network. The activities of Matra and Hachette converge in the
field of electronic media, a target for future investment. Both sides of the
group serve a wide range of overseas markets. And people will take a company
more seriously when it can show, as Matra Hachette does, annual sales of
Dollars 10bn.
For Mr Lagardere's critics this is sophistry, an attempt to portray the
merger as something other than a rescue, a way of drawing on Matra's
cashflow to ease Hachette's debt burden.
The merger prevented the need for a fire sale; it enabled Mr Lagardere, as
the French say, to save the furniture.
Despite the television fiasco, he says he would have been in a position last
year to sell control of Hachette for seven or eight times the price he paid
when he took it over in 1980. But Mr Lagardere is far too attached to his
role as media mogul for that.
What the two sides of the group have in common are famous names. Its media
interests range from Woman's Day magazine in the US to the Europe 1 radio
station. Matra has always had prestige products, ranging from the Mistral,
France's answer to the US Stinger portable missile, to automated metro
systems.
For a time Matra also had a football club, Matra Racing de Paris, and in the
1960s and 1970s played a prominent part in Formula 1 racing, which Mr
Lagardere says brought it 'a fantastic image'.
It was in television that Mr Lagardere finally overreached himself. In 1987
he lost to the Bouygues group in bidding to take over the TF1 station. The
new channel, auctioned in 1990, was his last chance.
'La Cinq was an absolute booby-trap for us. The snare closed on me
completely,' Mr Lagardere says. He has no plans to return to television. 'In
my life I have made every kind of mistake. I never made the same mistake
twice.'
He wants to build on current activities where the group already holds a
leadership position - including the Espace family vehicle which Matra makes
for Renault. It has pooled its space activities with GEC-Marconi's and is
looking for a European partnership in missiles. Arms, Matra's original
business, may in a couple of years be overtaken in importance by urban rail
systems, Mr Lagardere says.
His attachment to the idea of Matra Hachette's 'nine professions' -
missiles, space, cars, urban transport, telecommunications, books,
newspapers, distribution and broadcasting - typifies what Anglo-Saxons often
find a mystifyingly Latin approach. He bridles at the word conglomerate. He
speaks of 'the culture of the enterprise', of 'development' rather than
'growth'.
The man who 'more or less created' Matra has stamped his name on the holding
company, now called Lagardere Groupe. His own shareholding in this company
is only about 15 per cent. About another 30 per cent belongs to personal and
business associates. But under the unusual structure of a limited equity
partnership - societe en commandite par actions - other shareholders
delegate powers to him as general partner, appointed for six years. In
return, Mr Lagardere assumes unlimited liability if things go wrong. He has
put his money where his mouth is.
Mr Lagardere talks of making the business 'unsinkable'. He does not want it
to die with him. 'I would like my group to stay around for a long time.'
Something he shares with his friend Lord Weinstock, managing director of
GEC, apart from their joint space venture and their personal interest in
racehorses, is having a son in his senior management team. What function the
31-year-old Mr Arnaud Lagardere will assume is still open, the chairman
says, but 'his role will be to guarantee the continuity of control of the
group'. Mr Lagardere pere envisages stepping down. But not, he says, quite
yet.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Letter: Arms sales - a sign of wider failure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof ALEXANDER KENNAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The request by Mr Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, to share western
markets for arms sales ('Russia offers US arms sales deal', February 16) is
a desperate attempt to earn foreign currency. The reason is the failure of
the commercial and technical competence within the former USSR to identify
what potential customers at home and abroad want, and how to design, make
and service such goods.
The remark that such income will be used to covert Russia's military
industries is also not new and is also pointless. I have worked in many
defence factories in the former USSR over the past few years and can testify
that, whatever is needed to convert them, it is not large sums of money to
buy new equipment. They have a lot of adequate machine tools and up-to-date
western and Japanese production equipment - much of it under-used, misused
and some still in its original packing cases outside in the yards.
Soviets, from Lenin onward, have had the illusion that salvation lies in new
'technology'. They treat it like a toy, whereas the heart of the matter lies
in the urgent need to change the mind set and improve radically their
business and technical competence in order to perform competitively and,
indeed, to supply their own hungry markets.
Conversion of the defence industries depends on that first; without it
investment will be wasted as it always has been in the communist command
economy.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Letter: Top managers should show the way in radical rethink
on pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WILLIAM WALLACE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Shares can go down as well as up, circulars from my bank and insurance
company have warned me since the collapse of the 1987 financial 'bubble'.
Can executive salaries do the same?
I have followed the debate in your columns on the troubles of the financial
sector; the mistaken judgments which led to over-lending to property
speculators and players of stock markets; the attempts to rebuild balances
by increasing charges to customers; and the laying-off of junior staff.
Entirely missing has been the question of whether the disproportionate
increases in top salaries of the early 1980s, justified on grounds of the
quality of judgment of senior executives, should be reversed.
I appreciate that a cut in remuneration for board members and general
managers would contribute only a little to redressing the balance of bank
reserves and profits. But such a signal that top management recognises its
share of the responsibility for the evident errors of the last decade, and
is prepared to share in the cuts and added burdens of the 1990s as fully as
it shared in the added profits of the 1980s, would do much to rebuild the
battered confidence of staff and customers. No such signal has yet been
given.
There is a wider point at issue. If the British economy is to hold to low
inflation - as bank economists exhort - attitudes to salaries throughout the
economy have got to change radically.
No stronger signal could be given of the acceptance of radical change than a
reversal of the continuing trend for top salaries to increase.
The Quaker families who laid the foundations for more than one of England's
clearing banks understood the importance of gestures and symbols, and of
demonstrating by the way they behaved the responsibilities they shouldered
towards their fellow men. I fear that their descendants have lost sight of
that sense of shared responsibility to the wider community. The impact on
bank profits of a 10 to 20 per cent cut in board remuneration would be
minimal. But think of the potential impact on the economy and on British
society]

FT  19 FEB 93 / Letter: Missing an HDTV trick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr BRIAN T EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'Searching for a clearer picture of the future' (February
11) did not mention that Britain's high definition television ideas are
probably the best in the world, though their implementation lags the US.
Americans who read my evidence on digital television - presented to the UK
home affairs committee in 1988 - saw an opportunity, invested in it and are
now looking for the pay-off. UK broadcasters took less notice; the EC
supported HD-MAC.
US digital television has taken a lead from the Japanese, who encourage
fast-track development by a mix of inter-company competition and
co-operation. In a few days we will find out which of the four remaining
teams of US engineers have designed the best new HDTV system.
We should spare a thought for the original front-runner in this race, the
Japanese, who have paid royalties to the US for their own use of the
existing 40-year-old American colour TV system. Ten years ago they set aside
public funds to develop a home-grown HDTV system to redress this balance.
The Europeans did the same.
It would appear neither strategy has paid off because both camps have
ignored newer ideas. Is public funding the common element that induces
selective deafness in those whose creativity was once beyond reproach? Brian

FT  19 FEB 93 / Hooked on glory drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government is cutting defence expenditure, expanding British
military commitments, and doggedly refusing to ask the basic question behind
this impossible equation. That question is: what is the proper role for a
medium-sized nation shorn of its empire and much of its former economic
strength?
You could argue that our contribution to the world's security should be
enhanced. If so, the government should halt the present run-down in our
military forces. Equally, you could say that a significant proportion of
Britain's military spending is devoted to the massaging of national
self-esteem, or, worse, to nostalgia. If that is the case, we spend too much
now, and plan to cut too little in the future.
The conundrum seemed easier to think through when the Soviet threat existed.
I remember a lunchtime meeting with the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher in her
room at the House of Commons. It was, I think, 1976. Sir, now Lord, Keith
Joseph was the other guest. As our hostess set about carving slices of ham
the two of them set about public spending. Their knives swished through the
air. Millions were chopped off this, that and the other departmental budget,
until, quite quickly, the two founders of Thatcherism had saved a billion.
In those days that was serious money. 'What would you do with the billion?'
I asked the then recently elected leader of the opposition. 'Spend it on
defence,' she replied at once.
She did. She became prime minister three years later. In 1978-79 the armed
forces' budget totalled Pounds 7.6 bn. By the time Lady Thatcher left office
in 1990 that cash outlay had very nearly trebled. In real terms the figure
rose by 28 per cent between Labour's last year and 1984-85. The
inflation-adjusted amount has since been declining steadily from the peak
achieved in the mid-1980s. By 1995-96 British spending on defence will be
back to the equivalent in today's money of what was being laid out just
before the Thatcher decade began.
This time, however, there is no overriding Soviet threat. Perhaps that
explains why others are cutting their defence budgets faster than we are. In
1992 average military spending in Nato was 2.9 per cent of gross domestic
product. The equivalent figure for the UK is expected to work out at 4.1 per
cent. Even France, at 3.6 per cent in 1990, is less ambitious than that.
Germany is planning to cut its defence force by about 40 per cent. Belgium
and the Netherlands, also Nato allies, are contemplating halving theirs.
Britain plans a cut of one-fifth. Against that our wholly professional army,
like that of the US, is more expensive than many of the Continental forces,
which depend on conscripts.
Under President George Bush the US planned to reduce its outlay on national
defence - down to 5.6 per cent of GDP in 1990 - by nearly 14 per cent
between 1992 and 1996. The equivalent British reduction is 11 per cent. The
additional cuts proposed by President Bill Clinton in his state of the union
message on Wednesday will further increase the rate of shrinkage of spending
by the Pentagon.
This is not to say that Britain is necessarily the profligate one. It
depends upon what the money is for. The government's master plan is Options
for Change, the name given to a review initiated in 1990. Lord Chalfont said
in the Lords last week that when the results of this review were announced,
'we were told that it was based upon fulfilling commitments to Allied
Command Europe, the dependent territories, Northern Ireland, and the defence
of the United Kingdom'. Yet within months Britain was undertaking
commitments in Yugoslavia and the Middle East 'which were nothing to do with
any of those four basic interests'.
It is not clear to me why we maintain 46,000 troops in Germany, and will
still have 23,000 when the current reduction process is completed in two
years. Do we really need to keep 3,300 troops in Cyprus, let alone little
support services around the portions of the world formerly coloured pink on
the maps? While the government thinks we do, there may be something in the
argument by the select committee on defence, in its report published 10 days
ago, that given what is asked of it Britain's army is more than fully
stretched.
The trouble is that the committee does not question those tasks. Nobody
does. The defence secretary, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, did not do so in last
year's statement on the defence estimates. The foreign secretary, Mr Douglas
Hurd, failed to do so in his otherwise thoughtful speech at Chatham House a
few weeks ago - the one that began, 'British foreign policy exists to
protect and promote British interests'. Yes, but what is Britain's proper
place in the world? Most of us can agree on the case for maintaining troops
in Northern Ireland, the need to insure against direct attack upon
ourselves, and the desirability of contributing to European defence forces,
particularly through Nato.
The rest sometimes seems to be determined by what gets first place on the TV
news. One minister has said, only half in jest, that 'we are all human; we
see an atrocity on the small screen and come into cabinet next day spouting
that something must be done about it'. Britain's role appears to be that of
joint second policeman to Uncle Sam, with France in an equal position. This
awkward squad is ever-poised to chase into every trouble-spot that manages
to catch the popular eye. As Mr Hurd said, the UN knows of about 25
substantial conflicts going on now. 'I suppose that world cameras cover 2 or
3 at a time,' he added. This made it all very difficult. The foreign
secretary has yet to state the government's criteria for choosing where, if
anywhere, to send British troops.
The answer is, of course, gut feel, the product of a lethal mix. Start with
ministers' sense of British history. Add a dollop of popular pressure. Pour
in our pride in our nuclear power, our permanent membership of the United
Nations Security Council and our prominence in most global organisations.
Add a dash of undying allegiance to the US. Wash over with deep tribal
memories of the days of empire, enhanced by dreams of a long string of past
victories. It is such desires that Britain's Conservatives need to assuage,
by means that Labour dares not thwart. Glory is an expensive drug. Britain
is still hooked.

Sir, With regard to your promotion 'Enjoy Club Europe: two for the price of

typical saying of the Viennese. Goesser is a Styrian beer and Gut, Besser,
Goesser is a slogan of the Steirerbraeu AG, a Styrian company, which
produces and promotes Goesser Bier. As a Styrian I would like to invite you
to Austria and taste the difference between the Styrian beer and the beer

FT  19 FEB 93 / Letter: Tax cap at 75% would help those in benefits trap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R A LEDINGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is reported that the UK government is prepared to 'think the
unthinkable' to narrow the fiscal deficit. Might I suggest that it considers
taxing the incomes of the poor at 75 per cent? This would in fact be a
reduction on the present maximum effective marginal rate of tax of 97 per
cent on the earnings of those people receiving benefits.
It would require no more than a new class of income, taxed at 75 per cent
and ignored for all other fiscal purposes, including entitlement to
means-tested benefits. Such a cap on the effective marginal tax rate is one
of the few ways of guaranteeing a means of escape from the benefit trap.
If the rate at which we effectively tax the income of those aspiring to
leave the benefit trap were reduced from the present maximum level of 97 per
cent there would be some incentive for the acceptance of part-time, low wage
or occasional employment. It would at least give benefit recipients greater
control over their own lives in a way that cannot be achieved by workfare.
The reported direction of the present review of social spending appears to
pose a severe danger of further expansion of the benefit trap. Enlarging it
without improving the means of escape can be described as, at best,
unthinking.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Letter: Time for a ferry regulator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From K D SHILLETO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Last year I wrote to the Office of Fair Trading regarding the huge and
unwarranted increase in Dover-Calais tariffs in 1992. For passenger vehicles
it was more than 30 per cent when inflation was below 10 per cent. Stena and
P&amp;O fares were almost identical. I suggested that this joint increase could
only be explained by the ferry companies' intention to raise passage costs
progressively so that they would roughly match eventual Channel tunnel fees.
The OFT rejected my argument, positing that the ferries could only compete
with the tunnel if they offered a substantial discount. This is naive.
Nobody knows what the tunnel charge will be but ever-increasing construction
costs must be reflected in the opening tariff. If Stena and P&amp;O find they
have misjudged tunnel tariffs, they can lower their own without pain and
claim virtue. In the meantime, they seek further operational integration to
buttress profits.
Who is to say that a duopoly does not already exist and that the tunnel
authorities do not welcome progressively higher ferry charges to justify and
underpin their own? Is it not time for a regulator - Ofship - and to gear up
for an Oftun?

FT  19 FEB 93 / Arts: John Osborne's 'Luther'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a week of early 1960s London revivals, the one that stands out is John
Osborne's Luther at the Hen and Chickens Theatre in Islington. Here is a
very well-written, serious, intelligent piece that should not have been
neglected for so long.
The play was first performed at the Theatre Royal in Nottingham, then at the
Royal Court in London, in 1961 when Osborne's reputation after Look Back in
Anger and The Entertainer was at its height. Albert Finney played Luther.
There was much discussion at the time of the apparent thesis that the
dissident priest was influenced by trouble with his bowels: he was said to
be an anal neurotic. Finney dominated the production.
Today Luther looks a gentler, wiser, more thoughtful play, more about
society as a whole than about one man's anger. Two thoroughly tenable
propositions emerge. One is that by challenging the Catholic Church so
savagely about its selling of indulgences, Luther set faction against
faction in a way that benefited no-one. The other is that he was the founder
of German power.
As Staupitz, the Vicar General of the Augustinian Order, remarks of Luther's
resistance to the ways of Rome: 'The world's changed. For one thing, you've
made a thing called Germany; you've unlaced a language and taught it to the
Germans, and the rest of the world will just have to get used to the sound
of it . . . You've made the body of Europe . . . All I beg of you is not to
be too violent.'
There is no hostility in that comment, just an acceptance by Staupitz,
played here as a genially wise old man by Patrick Godfrey, that Germany is
on the way up and Italy is on the way down. Note, too, the use of the word
'unlaced'; not 'unleashed' or anything savage like that, just a gradual
process of evolution from Latin to German. This is Osborne writing with
precise language and a remarkable grasp of history.
Ben Walden's Luther is on the whole a sympathetic figure: not because he is
a rebel whom everyone outside the Catholic hierarchy knows is right, but
because he evidently suffers from self-doubt. At the end he admits to
Staupitz that he really was not sure whether his denunciations of the Church
were fully justified. True, he suffers from constipation, but this is not
central to the interpretation of the character. Walden's performance gains
by not trying to take over the play.
Some of the speeches are very long: there is very little of the customary
Osborne knockabout. Yet here again is a tribute to his writing: he has
mastered his material and there are fine distinctions of character both
within the laity and the clergy. The one set-piece that might just remind
you of The Entertainer is Tetzel, the Dominican Inquisitor cheerfully
selling indulgences in the market square. The part is wonderfully played by
David King.
The production comes from the Operating Theatre Company directed by John
Link. It is now managing the Hen and Chickens Theatre. The next stage in a
pub theatre like this must be to improve the physical conditions. Stifling
enough for the audience, they must be almost unbearable for the actors -
particularly those in Luther wearing heavy clerical robes.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Arts: The Firebird - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Firebird was the first masterpiece created for Diaghilev's enterprise.
Based on a conflation of folk tales, it typified for the dazzled Paris
audiences of 1910 an essential and irresistible 'Russian' quality. The
artful combination of magic, terror, an enchanted garden and a Tsar crowned
before his people; the innovations of music and design; the splendour of
Fokine's danced spectacle made for rare theatrical excitement. And whatever
the changes in taste over the years since then, The Firebird has retained
its appeal: it speaks of a Holy Russia that has a powerful hold over our
imaginations as a land of fantastic and mysterious legend.
The Royal Ballet's staging of The Firebird was made in 1954 by Diaghilev's
regisseur, Serge Grigoriev, and his wife Lubov Tchernicheva. The production
was scrupulous, and it was enhanced by the fact that Tamara Karsavina, the
original Firebird, coached Fonteyn in her role. With Michael Somes as Ivan -
judging exactly the character's naivete and nobility - and with Svetlana
Beriosova an exquisitely beautiful (and Russian) Tsarevna, we saw how our
national company might restore some of the lost splendour of the Ballets
Russes. (Subsequent revivals of Les Noces, Les Biches were further proof of
this.)
The return of Firebird to the repertory last week was disappointing, a
routine and unthinking revival. After four decades, the spirit of the piece
seemed lost. There was no magic in Kastchey's garden at curtain rise: both
lighting and set looked dingy. Company performances, with the exception of
Fiona Chadwick's Firebird, were lifeless. Kastchey's horde had been
rehearsed in 'menace by numbers', and the group of Enchanted Princesses
smirked relentlessly beneath their tangled locks.
That the ballet is not beyond redemption was proved on Wednesday night when
Nina Ananiashvili made her debut as the Firebird. Despite an uninvolved
production, Ananiashvili found in the choreography a central image which is
the key to a role. Bolshoy training gave her reading a spaciousness of
theatrical and dynamic effect, so that steps, phrases were burnished,
glowed, and commanded the air. The bird's emotions - pride, fear, pleading,
her power over evil - were found in the movement, and grandly presented to
us. An essential nationalism in Fokine's choreography was clear as never
before with the Royal Ballet, and a central truth about Firebird as an
example of Russian art was re-affirmed. And, in poses of Ananiashvili's
head, we can see a passing resemblance to photographs of Karsavina's
dark-eyed beauty in this role. This was a true ballerina interpretation, of
a kind the Royal Ballet no longer chooses to show us.
It is good to report that Stuart Cassidy was a finely promising Ivan. He has
the simplicity of manners that are right for this peasant-prince, and the
proper aristocracy for the marriage-scene, culminating in the final raising
of his hand - one of the most potent and most beautiful gestures in all
ballet. Mr Cassidy did not cheat it of its force. Derek Rencher's Kastchey
is a study in reptilian malevolence and devilish humour, and is perfect.
As a modish note, I record that the Opera House programme includes two
full-page and unfathomable photographs of Viviana Durante, and, though the
subject's head and face are obscured, gives credit for 'hair' and 'make-up'.
How fascinating. How rewarding as news. But what about her toothpaste?
Nina Ananiashvili will be seen again at Covent Garden as The Firebird on
March 16

FT  19 FEB 93 / Arts: Blown out of proportion / A look at contemporary
British glass
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like Pallas Athene, studio glass was born fully armed. It did not emerge out
of a groundswell of independent glass-making activity but out of a workshop
held at the University of Wisconsin in 1962. The aim was to see whether
techniques could be developed that would enable an artist to work in glass
in the intimacy of a studio. Within a decade, over 100 glass programmes had
sprung up in the art schools of the US, and the implications for
glass-making were being felt across Europe and Japan.
In 1965, Sam Herman arrived in Britain from Wisconsin and his teaching,
first at Edinburgh and then at the Royal College of Art, inspired a new
generation to take up the blow-pipe. Given that Britain had no real
tradition of artists or designers working with glass manufacturers, as in
Sweden, France, Italy and Czechoslavakia, the vigour of the studio glass
movement in this country is all the more remarkable.
Contemporary British Glass at the Crafts Council surveys the achievements of
the last 25 years. It is an eye-opening, but also a perplexing and
disappointing show. Appropriately enough, it opens with Herman's 'Green and
Gold Bottle', a free-blown, organic-looking form that both illustrates the
appeal of manipulating bubbles of molten glass and reveals why the majority
of glass-makers here turned to more controlled 'warm' or 'cold' glass
techniques.
There is a beguiling purity about the glass made in the 1970s. The
American-born Steven Newell delights in contrasting transparency and opacity
in his clean-cut translation of a Mannerist Wunderkammer object, a 'horn'
cup and cover; and formal and technical purity combine in Pauline Solven's
sculptural 'Three Reed Stems'. This was an exciting period of technical
innovation and experimentation in hand-blowing, engraving, enamelling,
sand-blasting, cutting and casting. Virtuoso effects predominate, ranging
from Peter Layton's exquisite mottling to Diana Hobson's paper-thin mosaics
of textured pate-de-verre.
After such refinement, the strident colour, heavy curves and triumphant
scale of the 1980s comes as a rude shock. Vast, wobbly goldfish bowls of
streaky colour and self-conscious conversation pieces such as Steven
Proctor's pretentious 'Momentum' now seem as dated as fluorescent globular
lamps and squidgy PVC chairs.
One might have expected some sense of direction to emerge in the recent
work, which accounts for half of the show. Interesting technical experiments
continue, particularly in the combining of techniques and media. Pauline
Solven, for instance, builds colourful patterned structures out of
mould-blown units that are sawn, reassembled, sand-blasted and etched - and
are not so unlike some Elizabeth Fritsch ceramics. Keith Cummings and Anna
Dickinson often combine glass with metal, Tatiana Best-Devereux glass with
ceramic.
The problem here is that too few makers know what to do with their skill and
ingenious effects. At one extreme are the intricate pieces that degenerate
into over-fussiness, at the other are forms that simply do not know when, or
why, they should end.
The quest for significant form has not, however, escaped the contemporary
glass-maker. The modest group of black, African-inspired vessels on show by
Anna Dickinson have a rare presence and quiet power. There is a similar
assurance of handling in Steven Newell's boldly chased chargers.
What is striking about a lot of recent work is a new emphasis on content and
allusion: glass can no longer look like glass but has to be manipulated and
camouflaged to the point where it might be any other material. I cannot see
the point of, say, David Reekie's lost-wax cast figures of men poking their
heads out of windows; and what does one do with whimsies such as Diana
Hobson's feather-tipped mixed-media 'Rainbow Jester' other than invent some
kind of Post Modernist whatnot on which to display them?
What the last 25 years have shown is that it has not been practicable for a
glass artist to work in splendid isolation in his studio. Studio glass still
has an extremely small market and, apart from Pauline Solven who has had her
own studio since 1975, the most successful enterprises seem to be small
co-operatives like Covent Garden's The Glasshouse, where commercial ranges
offer an alternative to one-off pieces.
But this show has concentrated solely on one-off, domestic-scale pieces.
Part II, which surveys the emergence of large-scale, sculptural and
architectural glass, is scheduled for 1995.
Contemporary British Glass continues at the Crafts Council, 44a Pentonville
Road, Islington, London N1, until March 7

<TEXT>
This new play, for only two people, is a comedy about a common paradox: a
woman's need to be (a) dependent on (b) independent from a man. Less
obviously, it also concerns a man's need to be (a) independent from (b)
dependent on a woman. The breakdown of a relationship, and of both people's
nervous systems, is just around the corner throughout. Meanwhile, the
woman's nerves are in the foreground. She is irritable without him, is
irritable with him; she can't work with him there, can't work without him;
she can't go outside without him, can't go outside with him.
Not all of this is funny, or meant to be. And the play's skill lies in its
ambiguity of viewpoint. Much of the time, the woman, Betty, is enough to
drive anyone crazy, whereas her man, Brian, is a model of new-man patience.
Occasionally, though, you feel that her neurosis is a lot more interesting
than his endless courtesy. You also start to feel that he is actually the
more passive of the two; and that he needs her more than she him; even that
his very reasonableness is a safe facade he dare not drop.
Certainly his petty lies and conventional euphemisms enrage her. He comes
back from having an over-long drink with a friend who 'sends his love,' he
pretends he hasn't been smoking, and then he asks about her evening. 'The
Chippendales popped round,' she snaps. 'They fucked me senseless . . . They
send their love as well.'
Her rudeness is out of all proportion - yet you sympathise. Or do you? She
is terribly lifelike, and yet wholly absurd. She forever makes impossible
demands of him: even 'You don't pull down the barriers I put up for you.'
An incidentally remarkable feature is that the same woman, Debbie Isitt, is
the writer, director and actress. She plays Betty as a rapidly mumbling or
whining Brummie who seldom gets out of pyjamas; Brian (Mark Kilmurry) is a
more lucid speaker, a more natural communicator - altogether more wretchedly
normal. He gets things done; she cannot even post a letter for him. She
insists, however, that, for all her panicky incompetencies, she is capable:
'I could handle anything if it actually happened. It's just the thought of
it that I can't stand.'
The scenario at first seems so thin, and so nearly maddening, that you think
'This isn't enough for a play.' Soon, however, the absurd claustrophobia of
the relationship becomes so all-important that any sub-plot or extra
characters would only weaken its fabric. Eventually, we see that there is a
plot; that somehow the relationship has to change.
Betty isn't a little housewife; she is a modern woman with a career of her
own as a critical writer. The play interleaves her relationship with Brian
with her feminist scrutiny of the male/female relationships in Hitchcock
films. Here is one element that is too thinly fleshed out; Brian's work life
is another. Out of the Ordinary is only 90 minutes long, and one of the best
things about it is the way it ends - not with a feminist bang but a male
whimper.

Sergei Krikalev was the Soviet cosmonaut who watched the revolutionary
events in his country from space as he revolved around the earth. After
almost a year circling the planet he returned to a new country, called
Russia. He is interviewed in Arena (BBC2 at 9pm) which examines the history
of the Soviet space programme.
What the Papers Say is one of TV's longest running programmes, and since
1956 its annual awards to top press people have been among the most
respected. Lord McGregor, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission,
announces the 1992 winners at 11.15pm on BBC 2.
John Cole, the former political editor of the BBC, begins a new career as a
roving reporter as he travels the country talking to the unemployed in
Public Eye, on BBC 2 at 7.40pm. As well as analysis on the changing face of
unemployment he tries to offer some remedies.
On good nights The Word (Channel 4 at 11.5pm) is the most anarchic programme
on TV. It makes an art form of bad taste, but shows a welcome lack of
respect for big names.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Arts: Nagano's triumphant Mahler - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even 25 years ago, Mahler's Symphony no. 3 was heard only slightly more
often than his Seventh - which is to say, hardly at all. Together they
counted as his symphonies maudites, too 'problematic' to earn regular
performances. Then the Third began to enjoy the attention of a few mature
Mahler conductors, with some memorable results - and therewith too of
ambitious but less practised maestros, in whose hands the gigantic first
movement could seem arbitrary and brutal, and the final Adagio
sentimentally, intolerably drawn out.
Kent Nagano, who took the London Symphony through the work at the Barbican
on Wednesday, cannot be all that practised. Many another youngish conductor
with a reputation in contemporary music has reached back to Mahler by way of
expanding his range, and thus his career, and has come a cropper. When
Nagano offered a Mahler Ninth with the LSO a few years ago, however, it was
a precocious triumph of musicianship, and plainly of respectful, assiduous
attention to what the likes of Horenstein and Bruno Walter made of the
score. This time he did no less with the Third.
And even more: for there is really no 'definitive' reading of the Third,
what with its patchy public history (and its exacting budget - large
orchestra, women's and boys' choirs for just one movement and a strong alto
soloist for two, unskimpably costly rehearsal-time). At the end of the day,
a conductor of this work must sink or swim on the precision of his own
musical instincts. Nagano's were faultless.
Later, no doubt, he will define a larger-scale impulse in the opening
'Kraftig', and develop a finer chiaroscuro for the wry grandfathers'-dance
'Tempo di menuetto'. For now, he gave us far more than enough to be going on
with. That cataclysmic initial movement had a barely leashed, tooth-and-claw
power and an ironical feel for municipal-band sound, where many an
international name (I forbear to name them) engineers a mere sequence of
noisy assaults.
Nagano wound up the Knaben Wunderhorn scherzo to a wry height, and gave
impeccably sensitive support to his alto - Birgit Remmert, a towering
27-year-old who may well be the leading Erda in Wagner's Ring for the next
generation - in her Nietzsche soliloquy. The 'Angels' movement found the LSO
women's chorus brisk and clear, and the Southend Boys' Choir as boyishly apt
as they always are in this work (a bit eerie, that, since in the nature of
things their personnel must always be short-term members).
The Adagio reached a glorious apotheosis. Nagano paced it unerringly, from
the first bated-breath melodies to their grand final dress. Each subito
pianissimo in the flowing line clutched at one's heart; every new plateau
was attained by cogent steps. For the first time in my concert experience,
the grandiose, repetitive last pages were a mighty culmination instead of an
over-insistent redundancy.
Ingeniously, Ute Lemper had been recruited to preface the lengthy symphony
with a half-dozen Weill songs. She is a class act, supremely schlank and
importunately appealing in her little black dress, very high heels and husky
mezzo. Some of my colleagues object to the voice; I thought it served her
material very well, and well in tune.
What Lemper lacks, simply, is music-theatre experience without the aid of a
microphone - vocally character-building to an irreplaceable degree; and yet,
so far as one could judge in the Barbican (where she may have had an
unfamiliar mike), less sophistication in her address to it than many a
straight pop-vocalist can boast. Her lively intelligence struck through
nevertheless, and her performances struck home. It was a pity that her
German texts in the programme-book were so badly proof-read and garbled.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Management: An affair which refuses to become a marriage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE characteristically blunt words of Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's
chief executive: 'The British and the French have fought each other for a
thousand years'.
Their business and financial cultures are also virtual opposites. So it is
not surprising that they find it hard to handle cross-Channel corporate
marriages and joint ventures. All too often the two 'partners' war
constantly with each other until one side - usually the French - emerges
victorious.
That may seem a caricature of a set of very complex relationships, but it is
uncomfortably close to the truth. Witness two events this week: the
long-awaited decision of Britain's MB-Caradon, successor to the old Metal
Box company, to seek shareholders' authority to sell out of its packaging
joint venture with Carnaud; and a frank speech by Sir Alastair, whose
organisation is one of the few shining exceptions to the general rule.
Take Eurotunnel first. It has had to overcome a legion of differences
between the French and British ways of doing business, Sir Alastair told a
conference in London. These ranged from contrasting approaches to the
control of capital expenditure, to an entirely different attitude to
meetings. Whereas British managers attended them to thrash out decisions, he
said, 'the French go to find out what the boss has decided to do'.
That Eurotunnel has bridged such gaps is due, above all, to the openness and
trust which Sir Alastair and his opposite number established early in the
venture. But his remarks were based on more than just personal experience. A
long line of business school research studies, at both Limburg in the
Netherlands and Insead near Paris, has put the UK and France at opposite
poles on a whole range of cultural measurements.
In common with the Dutch, Swedes, Canadians and Americans, Britons feel
relatively independent of their bosses, for instance. But the French do not.
Likewise, the Anglo Saxons and North Europeans are much better than the
French at tolerating uncertainty - including over their own position in a
hierarchy.
Virtually the only similarity is in the degree of individualism, where the
French score almost as highly as the British. But for the French this is
associated closely with an individual's official, or 'positional' power,
points out Philippe Haspeslagh, an Insead professor who specialises in
mergers and acquisitions. 'In the UK an organisation is more a set of
relationships in which you earn the right to manage.'
That is only the start of this generally sorry saga.
Consider, next, the chequered history of takeovers and mergers, regardless
of nationality. A spate of consultancy and academic studies suggests that
the average success rate of all types of takeover is only around 40 per cent
 -and that includes the many straight acquisitions where one side is clearly
in charge from the start.
Even where the partners to a merger or joint venture are in closely related
activities and markets, problems frequently occur because they have very
different corporate cultures and styles of operating. It was this
discrepancy, at least as much as national differences, which caused many of
CarnaudMetalbox's early internal problems.
The neutral German-American who was brought in to run the group in late 1991
said the Carnaud managers were used to a 'naively decentralised' style,
while Metal Box had leaned too far in the other direction.
Such problems can also be exacerbated when, from the very start, one partner
sees its exit as a possible or even probable outcome. As Haspeslagh says,
this is often the attitude of the UK side in a Franco-British venture.
Whereas the UK partner is frequently a public company, with a price at which
its shareholders will ultimately sell almost any part of their business, the
French side tends to be a holding company controlled by a family - and its
supporting banks - for whom the enterprise is not an Anglo-Saxon dividend
machine, but a method for leveraging industrial power.
The most notorious recent example of the Franco-British gulf in attitudes to
investment and profitability was last year's fracas at the Arjo-Wiggins
Appleton paper combine.
This involved a tangled web of issues, including the sacking of the British
chief executive and the apparent ability of the French shareholder, with
only a 39 per cent holding, to dominate the board.
With an attitude to the share price which was cavalier in Anglo Saxon terms,
but prudent to the French, the result was a completely unexpected dividend
cut which sent UK stockbrokers into apoplexy.
In stark contrast is the relatively sunny short history of GEC-Alsthom, a
nominally equal partnership in power engineering. Here, the French now
occupy the two top jobs and three of the top five. It would be facile to say
that the French are completely dominant, but it must be doubtful whether the
partnership will develop the ideal culture: one entirely of its own.
Some people claim this has occurred at the company's great Swedish-Swiss
rival, ABB, although it actually feels far more Swedish than Swiss.
If a truly equal partnership is impossible even between such partners, what
hope is there for the French and the British, whose forms of capitalism and
culture are so very different? The lesson may be that, with occasional
exceptions, the two cultures are better at having affairs than at staying
married.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Management: Office work-out - Staff fitness is to be
encouraged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The offer - a generous rent reduction in return for surrendering a small
amount of office space - was too tempting to refuse. But as the head of the
London-based services company who negotiated it explains, the deal with his
landlord involved sacrificing an in-house gym.
'I can't remember any other issue on which our employees felt so strongly,'
he now admits. 'It was only when we secured corporate membership of a nearby
health club that the rebellion was finally quelled]'
The story is perhaps a salutary one for companies tempted to cut the size of
their financial contributions to staff sporting, recreation and health
facilities. Such perks are often justified on the grounds of improved
employee motivation - but by the same token managements which take the
benefits away risk a disgruntled workforce.
There is little evidence that head office accountants are seeking to prune
their employee sports and health budgets (as distinct from sports
sponsorship budgets). A poll of 10 randomly selected large British companies
this week revealed that boardrooms are certainly seeking to get better
value-for-money and better usage of corporate facilities - especially those
lavish sports grounds for traditional team games owned by the big banks and
oil companies. If anything, though, the trend towards encouraging staff
fitness and providing 'lifestyle consultation' packages seems to be growing.
Fitness for Industry, a London-based specialist consultancy 51 per cent
owned by the Forte hotel group, says demand for its corporate fitness
centres has seldom been greater. In the last six months FFI has opened five
new in-house fitness centre projects, including one for the international
oil group Conoco at Warwick and one for Vauxhall Motors at Luton.
Many companies are either reluctant, or unable, to disclose the overall cost
of their employee sporting and fitness amenities. Exceptions include BT,
whose annual sport and recreation budget is about Pounds 1.25m, and
Prudential Assurance, which reckons it spends around Pounds 200,000-Pounds
300,000 in the London area. BT says its spending on employee sport and
recreation has fallen in the wake of job cuts and general cost reductions;
the Pru has stopped using a west London sports ground because of low
attendances (due to staff concentrations elsewhere); while National
Westminster Bank, which owns two vast sports grounds in south London, wants
to make one of them more cost effective through non-staff membership and
more extensive outside use.
Underlying different corporate strategies is the realisation that employee
needs are changing. The leisure revolution has opened up numerous
opportunities in the last few years for individuals to pursue their own
interests, with the result that company regattas and sports days - with
prizes presented by the chairman's wife - now seem anachronistic. Boardroom
thinking increasingly reflects the view that a fit workforce is potentially
more productive.
Such a philosophy is much more widely accepted in North America, where
groups such as Du Pont and the Canadian Life Assurance company have reported
reduced absenteeism and lower staff turnover in the wake of corporate
fitness programmes.
Pacific Railroad found that 90 per cent of its workforce believed their
exercise programme made them more productive.
FFI's marketing-manager David Parks believes that companies are moving from
the position where they know the health and well-being of their workforce is
important to doing something about it.
In part he attributes recent demand to industrial relocation projects
planned in happier times which are being implemented as part of a corporate
cost cutting exercise.
'A health centre is often an integral part of a relocation package', he
says. Most of FFI's programmes incorporate a strong medical dimension; in
Vauxhall's case Parks says the company found a latent demand for more
health-related activity, as opposed to traditional social pursuits like
darts and snooker. Team building and better internal communications are
useful spin-offs from corporate fitness programmes, adds Parks. 'There is
nothing better for breaking down barriers than a director and a secretary
working side by side on different pieces of equipment,' he suggests.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Management: Linking sport with productivity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This month's emotional rugby victory by Wales over England seemed a good
moment to test the thesis that national sporting triumphs give business a
boost. The evidence from the principality is inconclusive.
The most authoritative word comes from Ken Jones, who played in the centre
for Wales 14 times. Now he is managing director of Takiron at Caerphilly,
the first Japanese company to arrive in Wales in 1972.
'Yes, a result such as the one with England gives a great boost, especially
to morale. And a happy worker is usually a better worker than a disgruntled
one. But industry is highly automated now and the ability of the worker to
increase his own productivity independently is restricted. In a highly
labour-intensive industry it is just possible there could be a surge of
output. The reality, though, is that everyone feels better, it's a little
easier to go to work, and to give more undivided attention to work while
there.'
Meirion Lewis, Welsh director of the Institute of Directors, said a good
result gives an industrial lift. 'In Wales, rugger permeates all levels of
society. A win imparts confidence and if we can get the rugger right it
provides a more optimistic outlook to the other things in life.'
Byron Samuel, operations director for South Wales Electricity, is sceptical
that the Cardiff Arms Park euphoria could translate into higher output. It
was impossible to quantify what happened the following Monday and attribute
it to the match, he said.
In Wales rugby has contributed to economic growth through its links with
Japan, from where investment has poured into the country. Welsh rugby teams
nurtured the game in Japan and made the name 'Wales' known there.

FT  19 FEB 93 / The Property Market: French capital losses - The Paris slump
is hitting banks hard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Paris is facing up to one of its worst property collapses. Climbing vacancy
rates and sharply falling values have created alarming difficulties for
French banks and developers.
Large financial restructurings are under way. In January, Mr Christian
Pellerin, a developer of large tracts of La Defense, the office complex just
outside central Paris, was replaced as chairman of Lucia, a property company
undergoing a FFr1.1bn (Pounds 130m) capital reconstruction. Also last month,
Pierre Premier, a developer, was forced to cede four-fifths of its property
portfolio to the banks after incurring heavy losses.
At the same time, the current round of results from banks are scarred by
large bad loans to the property industry. Banks' total exposure to the
industry is widely believed to exceed FFr400. Banque Paribas, which has just
increased provisions to 15 per cent on its own FFr27.4bn property lending
book, is not alone in facing up to heavy provisions. 'Statistics show that
provisions of 15 per cent may be necessary but this varies greatly from bank
to bank depending on the particular nature of the underlying credits,' says
Mr Arnaud de Menibus, executive vice-president of Banque Paribas.
Mr Robert Waterland, head of the Paris office of Jones Lang Wootton,
chartered surveyors, believes the problem is far worse. He says the banks'
write-downs will eventually exceed FFr100bn.
The banks' predicament stems from the speculative frenzy that gripped the
property market in 1988-89 when banks encouraged the upward spiral of prices
by lending large sums to speculators promoting ambitious schemes.
Many of the banks' heaviest losses have been on loans made to small traders,
the so-called 'marchands de biens'. 'The quality of the small traders' real
estate is abysmal,' says Mr Waterland.
Banks are also facing large losses on speculative ventures, notably in a
handful of large developments in central Paris. These new schemes were
conceived at a time when Paris had little vacant office space. The
completion of a large quantity of new offices this year could push the
office vacancy rate in the French capital close to 10 per cent. Banque
Paribas believes that the stock of empty offices in Paris could reach 4m sq
m by December; this volume would take four years to absorb on normal take-up
rates.
The rising vacancy rate, together with the slowing economy, have pushed
rents down by between 20 per cent and 30 per cent since mid-1991. At the
same time, interest from buyers has evaporated, pushing estimates of prime
yields up from less than 5 per cent to more than 6 per cent. As a result
capital values have fallen by some 40 per cent.
The Paris financial establishment is doing all it can to prevent a mood of
crisis from developing. 'French banks are not going to get into the
situation of Anglo-Saxon countries . . . There will be no Olympia &amp; York
here,' said a spokesman for the Association of French Bankers last year.
In an effort to prevent bankruptcies and forced sales of property, the banks
are refinancing ailing companies and, in some cases, taking possession of
property themselves.
In the case of the stronger banks, such as Banque Paribas, the intention is
to retain the property portfolios for several years before selling them,
perhaps through a stock market flotation. In other instances, the banks are
attempting to offload their repossessed property by selling it to companies
which they have financed with low-interest loans.
Another form of support is from the cross-holdings between banks, insurance
groups and property companies, which allow stronger parents to bail out
overstretched lenders and developers.
None the less, mounting concern has prompted banks and insurance companies
to appeal for government help. In December, Mr Michel Sapin, the French
finance minister, responded by announcing the following:
the relaxation of the agrement system, whereby tenants must obtain official
authorisation for large office moves. This system, designed to encourage
companies to relocate to the regions, curbed the take-up of space in Paris;
the reinstatement of favourable tax treatment of finance leases, which may
encourage owner-occupation;
an extension to the four-year holiday on the 20 per cent transfer tax which
is payable on property deals. This will ease the pressure on traders and
banks needing to sell property in the short term.
'Too little, too late,' was the market's general reaction to these measures.
'Positive and useful, but insufficient,' said the AFB. The industry is
continuing to pressure the government to do more.
Last week, Mr Camille Cabana, the deputy mayor of Paris, proposed a public
fund to lend money cheaply to developers in return for mothballing their
projects and preventing yet more new offices flooding onto the market.
But while the government may be prepared to help the construction industry
and residential property market, it will be loathe to bail out speculators.
The prospect of using public money to save the industry seems unlikely
except in the event of a further sharp deterioration of conditions.
But for the moment that eventuality is remote. Despite the banks' bad loans,
the problems are still far from jeopardising the financial system. Indeed,
there is a body of opinion which insists that the gloom is exaggerated.
'The economy is the strongest in Europe, the market is undersupplied with
decent products, tenants can move freely,' says Mr David Robinson of Richard
Ellis. 'When there is an upturn in the economy, the market will move
quickly.'
Mr de Menibus of Banque Paribas emphasises the underlying strengths of the
market. 'Even if we take a pessimistic view of the market, it is not like
the US or UK. It is a quite different crisis,' he says.
'Vacancy rates are much lower, prices have fallen to a sensible level, it is
a well-organised market, the institutions have the muscle to keep the market
at a reasonable level. The market can cope.'

FT  19 FEB 93 / People: Whittaker retires from Inchcape
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At 63, battle-scarred UK motor industry veteran Derek Whittaker has decided
to step back from the front line at Inchcape, the international services and
marketing group which has a range of motor distribution businesses
worldwide.
Whittaker is retiring from the board, to which he was appointed in 1986 to
oversee all Inchcape's motor business except its Toyota activities. But he
will continue to advise Inchcape on motor trade matters, as befits an
industry figure who has seen it all - including service with Ford and the
former British Leyland in the thick of the UK industry's trench warfare of
the 1960s and 1970s.
Whittaker who, as managing director of Leyland Cars, helped face down the
toolmakers whose strike came close to polishing off British Leyland for good
in the 1970s, is succeeded by another great industry survivor.
Reg Heath, who steered vehicle distribution group TKM back to health
throughout the 1980s, both before and during its acquisition by New Zealand
entrepreneur Sir Ron Brierley, is now poised to assume all of Whittaker's
responsibilities.
The ever-cheerful and widely-liked Heath has, however, been on the board
since last March, following Inchcape's own takeover of TKM, which continues
to sell around 50,000 cars a year through nearly 100 retail outlets.
For Heath, it's a long way from the dealer forecourts where he first saw
service with TKM's dealer subsidiary, Wadham Kenning, back in 1958.
For Inchcape, it's another significant break with the past. Whittaker is
leaving less than two years after the departure as Inchcape's chairman of
his old British Leyland managing director associate, the late Sir George
Turnbull.

FT  19 FEB 93 / People: Sandy Russell promoted
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sandy Russell has been appointed a deputy chairman of Customs and Excise.
The post, one of two deputies, is currently filled by Valerie Strachan who
succeeds Sir Brian Unwin as chairman in March.
Russell, 54, joined customs eight years ago as director, organisation,
before taking over as director, customs in 1990.
The directorship came at a time when customs was undergoing some of the most
radical changes in its 322-year history to pave the way for the single
European market. Russell was responsible for reforming the customs controls
at ports and airports.
The work involved moving revenue-collecting posts inland and changing the
role of investigation and detection from a barrier-like approach to that of
an intelligence-led service. 'It ought to be fairly evident that our whole
concentration has been on major prohibitions rather than the odd bottle of
hooch. Our effort isn't directed towards finding minor revenue evasion,' he
said of his task.
Before joining customs, Russell was responsible for pioneering the
government's financial management initiative at the Management and Personnel
Office and earlier had held senior posts in the Scottish Office. He will
retain control of the customs group in addition to becoming director general
internal taxation in his new position.

FT  19 FEB 93 / People: Three new directors at Bank of England
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Frances Heaton, the director general of the City of London's Panel on
Takeovers and Mergers, yesterday became the first woman director of the Bank
of England.
Two other non-executive directors were also appointed to the Bank's court:
Sir Jeremy Morse, who retired earlier this month as chairman of Lloyds Bank,
and Sir Chips Keswick, chairman of Hambros Bank.
Bank directors are appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of the Prime
Minister's office. John Major has adopted a policy of appointing women to
senior public posts wherever possible.
Heaton worked at the Treasury between 1970 and 1980, when she joined the
merchant bank, Lazard Brothers. She was seconded to the Takeover Panel last
year. 'The thing I am particularly pleased about in being appointed a
director is that it maintains a continuity between the Bank and the
Treasury,' she said yesterday.
One of the three retiring bank directors is Sir David Walker, the deputy
chairman of Lloyds Bank and a former Treasury official. The others are Sir
Brian Corby, chairman of the Prudential Corporation, and Lord Haslam, former
chairman of British Steel.
The court of the Bank of England usually meets once a month on a Thursday.
The non-executive directors serve as a sounding board for the Governor, but
do not get involved in setting interest rates and monetary policy or in the
minutiae of bank supervision.
Heaton, 48, says that there could be a conflict between her Panel
responsibilities and her new Bank role, if there were a takeover bid for a
bank. In that case, she would concentrate on her role of adjudicating on the
bid and absent herself from any Bank discussions of the takeover attempt.
Sir Jeremy Morse, 64, has had a long association with the Bank of England.
For ten years from 1965 he was an executive director of the Bank, before
joining Lloyds.
Both Sir Jeremy and Sir Chips both began their banking careers at Glyn
Mills, now part of Royal Bank of Scotland.

Gunpowder, the essential ingredient in today's fireworks, could soon be
replaced by a safer alternative.
Gunpowder is used as the lifting charge to propel the firework into the sky.
Now researchers at the Cranfield Institute of Technology, working for
Standard Fireworks, have developed an equally effective propellant which is
bound with a polymer which makes it less sensitive - and therefore safer -
and less expensive.
Cranfield's Alan Bailey has also developed an economical method of making
the coloured 'stars' that shoot out of roman candles based on memories of
jelly babies being made in a sweet factory.
There the jelly was poured into a mould of cornflour, which formed the outer
coating of the sweet. In the pyrotechnic version the cornflour is replaced
by 'igniter' material, which coats the metal pellets. Cranfield Institute of

<TEXT>
Algae burnt in power stations could provide cheaper energy than traditional
fossil fuels.
Engineers at the University of the West of England, in Bristol, have cracked
the problem of how to grow the chlorella algae cheaply enough to make power
generation feasible - filtering them from ponds is uneconomical.
They have used a 'Biocoil', a five-metre high vertical tube in which the
algae circulates, harnessing sunlight for photosynthesis. Sewage has proven
a particularly effective nutrient for the algae. The carbon dioxide produced
when the algae are burnt is redirected to help new algae grow, preventing
the emission of greenhouse gases.
The first power station could be in use within 18 months. University of the
West of England: 0272 656 261.
A novel fuel, which could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 15 per cent, is
now propelling buses in Canberra, Australia. Diesohol is a blend of diesel
(84.5 per cent), hydrated ethanol (15 per cent) and emulsifier (0.5 per
cent). The breakthrough, according to developers Apace Research, is the
emulsifier, which helps the diesel and ethanol mix. Apace Research:

FT  19 FEB 93 / Technology: Moving into deeper waters - Shell's new
production platform is a milestone for the oil industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of nature's less obvious amphibians has this week been inching its way
into the blue waters of the Mediterranean off Taranto on Italy's
south-eastern coast.
At almost 19,000 tonnes, the massive hull for Shell's new Auger production
platform in the Gulf of Mexico represents a milestone for the offshore oil
industry. As reserves in easily exploitable locations are gradually
depleted, oil companies are searching for new sources in more hostile
terrain, whether on land or ever deeper at sea.
The large rectangular structure, built by Italy's Belleli engineering group
at its Taranto yard, comprises four 49m-high, twin-core steel towers, linked
by a thick steel pontoon belt at the bottom and diagonal struts at the top.
Like a giant upturned table, the 109m-long and 88m-wide hull forms the lower
part of the new platform, which will stretch offshore oil production
technology to unprecedented limits.
The completed platform, due to start producing oil early next year, will sit
in 980m of water off the US coast. At that depth, it will beat by almost a
third again the previous record depth for a platform, and could represent
the first step towards a new generation of 'super' oil platforms capable of
operating at depths of up to 1,200m.
Working in such deep waters has obliged engineers to abandon previous
platform technology in favour of new solutions to address the problem of how
to create a structure which will be sufficiently tall, yet rigid enough to
permit oil to be extracted successfully and safely.
The offshore business has until now been dominated by two designs: the
familiar 'jacket' - tapering latticeworks of special steels, akin to a
modern Eiffel Tower, which are floated on barges to the production site and
then carefully tipped over so their feet sink to the sea bed. More recently,
large, heavy concrete platforms have been developed for the North Sea,
particularly by the Norwegians.
Both designs are still perfectly valid for shallow-to-medium-depth
operations, explains Umberto Pellegrini, Belleli's project manager for the
Auger contract. But as oil companies have pushed ever deeper to sea, the two
designs have been showing their limits.
A 900m-tall jacket would be prohibitively expensive owing to the amount of
steel required, he says. At that height, it might also be insufficiently
rigid. As for a concrete platform, its weight would make it wholly
uneconomic, he says. 'Tension leg platforms are the answer to the oil
industry's need to work in ever deeper waters. They combine stability and
size with relatively low weight and therefore lower cost, than conventional
designs,' he adds.
The first TLP was developed about seven years ago for Conoco's Hutton field
in the North Sea. Since then, two more have gone into operation in the Gulf
of Mexico and the North Sea. However, the Auger platform marks the biggest
and most expensive TLP to date. The hull alone cost around L200bn (Pounds
91m), while the deck, being built by McDermott, the big US engineering
group, will cost as much again. On to that must be added the separate
modules covering functions such as production and accommodation.
TLPs comprise a large floating metal hull - the upturned table - on top of
which the deck and modules are mounted. Although seemingly the simplest part
of the structure, the hull is in many ways the key to how a TLP works.
Because it floats, the hull requires no direct support from the seabed,
representing an obvious saving in weight, and therefore cost. But in order
to provide the necessary stability and rigidity, the TLP is attached to the
ocean floor by 12 steel tendons - in reality 12-inch steel tubes bolted
together in 100m-sections - which are put under tension to lock the platform
in place. A pair of anchors, stretching up to 3km from each leg, provides
further stability in the case of severe weather conditions, such as the
hurricanes which can sweep the Gulf of Mexico.
The floating technology is deceptively simple, yet lies at the heart of the
two key processes involved in preparing a TLP for use. Precisely controlled
ballasting and de-ballasting is needed for the first step, due later this
year, when the hull will be 'mated' with the superstructure at sea.
As no floating cranes exist which are powerful enough to lift an object as
heavy as the 20,000 tonnes of completed deck, the process will be carried
out by sinking the hull instead. Once in position, pumps in the four columns
will start bringing in enough sea water to lower the top of the hull to the
water line. In the meantime, barges carrying the superstructure will move
precisely into position over the submerged structure. By pumping out the
water, the hull and superstructure will gradually rise, eventually reaching
their desired operating height. Once there, the superstructure will be
welded to the hull at five special anchor points topping the four columns.
'It seems very simple, but it's actually very difficult, especially to avoid
bumping,' says Pellegrini.
Sophisticated ballasting techniques will also take centre stage when it
comes to tensioning the cables linking the platform to the sea bed. The
cables are put under tension by shedding ballast in the hull. Only once the
platform is fully stable can oil start flowing through the 24 pipes, known
as 'risers', which link it with the wells on the ocean floor.
Although the Auger platform uses technology which has already been tested
before, the depth at which it will operate means it represents a new
challenge compared with its predecessors. Moreover, it is the first TLP to
have its hull wholly assembled on land before being towed out to sea in one
piece.
Belleli made three of the four giant legs on the previous TLP, built for the
Snorre field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. But once fabricated,
they were shipped to the main contractor, where they were then joined to the
rest of the hull offshore.
Onshore fabrication will set the pace for the even bigger TLPs of the
future, the company thinks. Among projects believed to be under preliminary
consideration are new platforms for Shell in both the Gulf of Mexico and off
the Philippines, and for French oil companies off the Congo.
The new TLPs may have to operate in waters of up to 1,450m deep, stretching
existing techniques still further. If the orders come through, they will be
a godsend to an industry currently suffering from the downward phase of an
often highly cyclical business.
Low oil prices and worldwide recession, reducing demand for oil, mean new
orders for rigs and platforms have become scarce. In Belleli's case, the
almost simultaneous launching this month of the Auger hull and two big
modules for other platforms will leave the Taranto yard without work.
With only about half a dozen companies probably capable of building the big
TLPs of the future, Belleli's engineers are setting great store by the
experience they have gained so far. No other European fabricator has won a
similar order for the US market, which is still largely dominated by US
manufacturers.
However, even TLP technology could be nearing its limits - at least until
more experience is gained with the current generation of platforms in
operation. Pellegrini says extending current techniques to produce TLPs
capable of working in up to 1,500m is quite feasible.
The challenge lies in going deeper. 'That will require new techniques for
preparing the seabed templates to which the securing tendons are attached,'
he says. And even the most enthusiastic TLP engineers will want to see how
their latest brainchilds, such as the Auger platform, perform at sea over a
period of time before taking too big a leap further forwards.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government wrestles with problem at
'top of agenda' / A look at how Conservatives view the issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT as an issue in the Conservative party is a pervasive force,
long-standing and rarely forgotten - but frequently overshadowed as
Westminster's goldfish-bowl mentality flips excitedly between one political
furore and the next.
Yesterday was an exception. The jobless figures were raised by all but one
of the MPs called at a particularly fractious prime minister's questions.
Others briefed themselves on the plethora of government schemes as they
prepared to leave for the weekend.
'It is an issue which is of top concern for my constituents,' said Mr David
Lidington, the new Conservative for generally prosperous Aylesbury,
Buckinghamshire, as he left the chamber. He had just asked Mr John Major to
ensure British industry created jobs through greater competitiveness, not
meddling bureaucracy.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, spent much of yesterday in
broadcast studios. She had rehearsed her lines, telling the BBC:
'Unemployment is right on the top of the political agenda.'
More usually, unemployment rests lower in Conservative MPs conscience -
beneath, say, Europe or the future of the coal industry as immediate
concerns. The relentless rises make each month's figures unsurprising.
'Whats up? Apart from 3m unemployed, I mean,' said one, without thinking, as
he stepped from his car at the Commons' entrance, only for a guilty
expression to fall over his face.
Unemployment does not feature heavily in mail bags. 'If the TV shows a
tortured hedgehog I get 50 letters, they are pouring in on Sunday trading,
but, curiously, I get very few on unemployment,' said one Tory from a
south-east seat.
Tory messages about government's impotence, drummed in by a decade of
ministers since Mr Norman (now Lord) Tebbit, was employment secretary, have
taken root.
'People have got a realistic view of how much the government can do in the
short term - very little,' says Mr John Watts, Conservative chairman of the
Commons' Treasury select committee. 'They have seen all the quick fixes
under previous governments and they don't work.'
Tories have won the last three general elections with high unemployment.
Many Conservative MPs are confident that it will not be a huge electoral
liability next time, so long as the trend by then is downwards.
A Galbraith-like interpretation, based on the 'contented majority' in
well-paid work who, if constantly wooed, can keep the Tories in power, would
not be volunteered by many Tories. But, after winning last year against the
odds, the Tory vote is seen as robust. 'People do worry about the
unemployable sub-classes - but not enough to make them vote Labour,' said
one senior Conservative.
But the average Tory MP knows the debate is not that straight forward. In
the minds of an increasing number of the party's MPs, fears about rising
unemployment have become entangled with concern over escalating crime
figures.
Unemployment is also hitting harder than in the early 1980s in Conservative
heartlands - and among white-collar, home-owning workers.
Since the election, Mr John Major has put the importance of community and
society back onto the Tory agenda, stressing the importance of training and
creating opportunities for those entering the workforce. 'One-nation'
Conservatism is back in fashion.
Whereas Mrs Margaret (now Lady) Thatcher could blame past Labour
governments, the benchmark by which the current prime minister will be
judged against the criteria he himself has set.
Much as the right-wing of the Tory party may try to dominate the agenda with
ideas for privatisation and choice, Mr Major is also listening to ideas from
the party's wetter wings.
Mr Nigel Forman, the widely respected former education minister and MP for
Carshalton and Wallington, wants changes to benefit eligibility for the
unemployed who start education or training courses. The prime minister
agrees. An announcement is expected near the time of the Budget.
Only a brave Tory would be complacent. One political ally of the prime
minister was gloomy yesterday afternoon after the shouting in the Commons
chamber had abated: 'You can get get away with governing over high
unemployment once or twice, but three times . . ?'

FT  19 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Council house sales campaign
planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST publicity drive for more than six years to encourage council
tenants to take advantage of their right to buy their homes is being planned
by ministers.
Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, wants to launch the drive in
the spring, perhaps as early as next month. Television advertising and
leafletting all council tenants to ensure they are aware of the schemes on
offer are among the moves being discussed.
No new incentives are intended, but ministers believe that the fall in
mortgage rates and the rises in council rents have tilted the balance of
advantage for council tenants more towards buying instead of renting than it
has been for some time.
The move will be greeted with incredulity by the opposition, given that the
current number of housing repossessions is at a near record level, and is
also likely to re-ignite the controversy over government and political
advertising.
The timing of the initiative is broadly related to the new government rules
giving local councils a greater incentive to sell their property. Mr Norman
Lamont announced in the Autumn Statement that there would be a relaxation of
the rules, enabling councils to keep all the proceeds of any sales - instead
of just one quarter - for a limited period until the end of this year.
While the environment department insists the Cabinet Office rules on
advertising will be obeyed, the fact that the campaign may well get under
way not long before the sensitive six weeks before the local elections in
May, will intensify opposition attacks on it.
About 1.2m council homes have been sold in England since 1979. Out of 4m or
so council tenants, about 1.25m are not on housing benefit, and are thought
most likely to be interested in purchases.
The publicity will focus on the discounts, of up to 70 per cent off the
market value, available to council tenants, and the 'shared ownership' route
through which a tenant can buy part of his home.
The cash incentive scheme, by which a council tenant can receive a one-off
grant of up to Pounds 35,000 to move out of council accommodation into
buying a property in the private sector, will also be highlighted.
Mr Jack Straw, the shadow environment secretary, told a local government
conference yesterday: 'Whatever the rhetoric, the truth is that Tory housing
policy is motivated by dogma not democracy.'
He said that over 1.5m people lived in homes worth less than they paid for
them because they were encouraged to buy during the 1980s. The market alone
could not meet housing need, he added, and councils must continue to ensure
the direct provision of low-cost quality housing.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Council tax bills put at about
Pounds 500
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AVERAGE council tax bill in England is likely to be around Pounds 500,
according to a survey published today by Local Government Chronicle.
The average household bill from the 169 English councils which had set or
recommended their council tax by Wednesday will be Pounds 494.58.
The survey, carried out with BBC-TV News, covers the council tax for all but
one of the 39 county councils, 118 of the 296 districts, seven of the 36
metropolitan councils and six of the 32 London boroughs.
With most London and metropolitan councils still to declare their figures,
the final average is likely to be marginally higher than Pounds 495.
However, the final figure for the average council tax bill is likely to be
less in real terms than under the poll tax. It will also be less in cash
terms than the average household paid in the last year of domestic rates.
The highest figure so far is that for Newcastle City council: their council
tax figure will be Pounds 791.81 for a Band D property worth between Pounds
68,000 and Pounds 88,000. The figure is high because of the relatively low
property values in the area and the high proportion of single-person
households (43 per cent) entitled to a 25 per cent discount.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Minister seeks slimmer agencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT agencies should do more to reduce staff numbers and slim down
management, Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister, said
yesterday, John Willman writes.
Mr Waldegrave, addressing a conference of agency chief executives in York to
mark the fifth anniversary of the creation of agencies, acknowledged that
the Civil Service was growing again.
Figures recently published by the Financial Times showed that 21 of the
first 28 agencies had increased staff numbers since inception - by 12 per
cent overall.
Public expenditure pressures meant that agencies should be at the forefront
of increasing productivity, Mr Waldegrave said. He urged the chief
executives to use the managerial freedoms given to agencies to remove 'old
hierarchies in management' and tailor structures and pay to the needs of
their activities.
The minister also acknowledged concern among chief executives over legal
confusion on whether European legislation on employee rights in mergers and
takeovers applies to contracting-out of public services.
If it does, the contractor must take over the staff currently doing the work
at their existing pay and conditions.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Regions share burden of increase in
unemployment - PM under attack over rise in jobless / No slow-down in rate
of increase expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

HEADLINE unemployment rose last month to 3,062,065, the first time for
nearly six years that the total has breached 3m.
Adjusted for seasonal variations, the total is 2,995,100, having risen
22,100 in January.
And last month all regions of the UK, apart from northern England,
registered a rise in unemployment.
Although this 33rd consecutive monthly rise in the adjusted total is the
smallest since last June, employment department officials said there was no
sign the increase in unemployment was slowing.
January's headline or unadjusted total increased from December's by 78,726
in January. Much of the rise was due to seasonal factors. The total is the
highest since April 1987, while the seasonally adjusted figure was last
exceeded in January 1987.
A glimmer of good news for the government was that the underlying increase
in average earnings across the economy in December was a year-on-year 4.75
per cent, the smallest annual rise for 25 years.
The annual change in underlying earnings was 5 per cent in November, while
last April it was 7 per cent. The slower growth in wages may help the
Treasury to hit its target of keeping underlying inflation below 4 per cent.
There were 523,000 working days lost last year through labour disputes, the
lowest annual total since government records began in 1891.
Since the low point for seasonally adjusted unemployment in April 1990, the
number of people without jobs and claiming benefit has risen by 1.4m or 88
per cent.
The total in the south-east, including Greater London, rose by 11,800 in
January, accounting for more than half the monthly rise for the UK as a
whole. South-east unemployment has increased by 616,300, or 183 per cent,
since early 1990.
The total January increase was lower than expected and follows a large
60,300 rise in December. The average monthly increase during the three
months to January was 42,400, compared with the equivalent figure of 35,900
in the three months to October last year. In January, 10.6 per cent of the
workforce was without a job, up from 10.5 per cent in December.
Employment decreased by 32,000 to 4.32m in manufacturing in December. This
comes after falls of 25,000 in November and 10,000 in October. In the year
to December, average earnings in the sector rose by an underlying 5.5 per
cent, after 5.75 per cent in the year to November. In services the
comparable figure came down to 4.5 per cent from 4.75 per cent.
Output per person in manufacturing was up 6 per cent in December compared
with a year previously, the highest year-on-year figure since April 1989.
This reflects the relatively small fall in the sector's output while
unemployment has risen steeply.
Unit costs in the sector did not rise in the final quarter of last year
compared with the corresponding period in 1991, the first time this has
happened in six years.
Vacancies at government job centres fell by 4,400 last month to 104,000.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Departments preparing extensive
temporary work scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS to create thousands more temporary work places are being considered by
the government in response to rising unemployment.
The proposal, one of several made by the special committee on unemployment
chaired by Lord Wakeham, leader of the Lords, is being fleshed out by the
Department of Employment in consultation with the Treasury. Other proposals
are being costed and worked out in detail by several government departments
 -including education, trade and industry, and social security.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, has been given the
responsibility of taking a strategic lead in the reviews.
Separately, regional assistance is to be better targeted. The Department of
Trade and Industry is redrawing the map of 160 'assisted areas' - which
benefit from regional grants - to reflect changes in employment trends over
the past decade. The results are expected in April after consultations at
European Community level.
The DTI is also looking at how the government can further encourage
small-business start-ups.
At present some 29,000 temporary work places are offered on the Employment
Action scheme. From April its funding will be merged with Employment
Training, the main training scheme for the long-term unemployed. Offering
150,000 places at any one time, the Pounds 936m programme will be run by
Training and Enterprise Councils, which can select individuals for temporary
work, foundation training and occupational-skills training.
Participation on schemes will remain voluntary. It is understood that Mrs
Shephard has argued within cabinet that sanctions, such as the withdrawal of
benefit, can only be introduced if the unemployed have a wide menu from
which to choose.
The government is, for example, likely to lift the 21-hour limit on study.
Investigations are also under way as to whether the unemployed can be
offered more financial help in pursuing education.
In the longer term, sanctions may be introduced for targeted groups such as
the 18-to-24-year-old long-term unemployed, a group the government wants to
lead back into the workforce before too many become unemployable.
The Confederation of British Industry is considering whether it should
recommend to the government that this age group should accept compulsory
training for benefit. However, previous studies have suggested that once
training is compulsory 'timewasters' bring inertia to programmes.

<TEXT>
The unemployment total is now higher, in absolute terms, than it was at the
pre-war peak in January 1933 of 2.97m.
Unemployment is higher in London than in Scotland and Wales combined.
A government survey found 55 per cent of the unemployed in London and the
south-east ready to accept a job paying less than Pounds 175 a week.
2m new jobs will be needed between now and the end of the decade if
unemployment is to fall back to the 1990 level of 1.6m.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Fresh legal doubt over Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENEWED DOUBT was last night cast over the government's legal verdict on
Labour's amendment to include the social chapter in the Maastricht bill when
Mr Paddy Ashdown released a legal opinion 'totally at variance' with the
advice given by the government's law officers.
In an open letter to prime minister John Major, the Liberal Democrat leader
said the opinion by Mr Anthony Lester QC reached a 'wholly different'
conclusion from that given by the law officers.
This raised questions related 'not just to the Maastricht bill, but to the
quality of advice offered by the attorney-general,' he said.
Mr Major last night turned down a request by Mr John Smith, the Labour
leader, for the publication of the apparently conflicting advice on the
amendment given by the law officers and the Foreign Office.
The request, echoed by Mr Ashdown, followed the government's U-turn in the
Commons last Monday when it admitted that its original advice - that the
amendment would wreck the treaty - had been mistaken.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, had set out the government's view on
Monday, Mr Major said. Government law officers would be on hand in future
when Maastricht was debated.
Separately, ministers have accepted if Labour's amendment is passed they may
have a problem in meeting the administrative costs of the social chapter,
for which Britain could be liable despite its opt-out. The government might
not have the parliamentary authority to make the payment.
The issue has been raised by Sir Teddy Taylor, a leading Tory Euro-sceptic,
in a letter to Mr Hurd. Ministers do not believe it can prevent ratification
of the Maastricht treaty, however.
Mr Ashdown says the new opinion highlights Section 6 of the European
Assembly Elections Act 1978, emphasising that parliamentary approval is
required for any treaty which extends the power of the European Parliament.
This is 'clearly applicable to the Maastricht treaty and its protocols', Mr
Ashdown said. He described Mr Hurd's Commons statement as 'curious and
perplexing'.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR and Liberal Democrat MPs mounted a sustained onslaught against Mr
John Major, the prime minister, in the Commons yesterday, accusing him of
personal responsibility for allowing unemployment in Britain to exceed 3m
again, Ivor Owen writes.
During furious exchanges Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, charged the prime
minister with standing 'idly by' as the numbers out of work increased during
each month of his tenancy of 10 Downing Street.
Renewed assurances that the government was determined to bring down
unemployment were brushed aside by Mr Smith, who called in vain for Mr Major
to repudiate the 'heartless' comment by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
that unemployment was a price 'well worth paying' for bringing inflation
down.
To government cheers, Mr Major insisted that there was no purpose in Labour
MPs expressing concern about unemployment when they were committed to
policies that would put more people out of work.
Before lecturing the government, he said, they should drop their support for
the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty, the introduction of a minimum
wage and a 'windfall tax' on the profits of the privatised utilities.
But Mr Smith said it was 'economic madness as well as a social tragedy' that
unemployment had again exceeded 3m. He attacked the prime minister for
seeking to evade his responsibility.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, joined in the assault on
the prime minister and demanded: 'Why is it that you always use your time
telling us what the opposition say instead of what you are going to do?'

FT  19 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory MPs warn Clinton on Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US PRESIDENT Bill Clinton was warned not to 'meddle' in the affairs of
Northern Ireland by Tory backbenchers in the Commons yesterday.
With varying degrees of irony Mr John Bowis (C Battersea) and Mr Nick Budgen
(C Wolverhampton South West) suggested that the principle of reciprocity
should apply in the event of any American interference in the province.
Mr Bowis said an envoy as a 'fact finder' and a supporter of the British
government's policy on Ulster would be welcome. 'But if he (Clinton) sends
somebody to meddle, then it would be as offensive as this country sending
somebody to look into the problems on the Mexican border.'
But Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, who hopes to meet
new US officials in the next few months, played down their fears.
He said it was his experience that people who visited Northern Ireland
seeking to find out the facts of the situation went back 'wiser and
happier'.
He recalled that the members of one American delegation had publicly
announced that it would be their purpose to correct in the media the 'wholly
false impression of Northern Ireland' current in the US.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Higher ceiling for questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yest-erday raised the advisory cost limit for answering
parliamentary questions from Pounds 400 to Pounds 450 - an increase of 12.5
per cent, David Owen writes.
In a written answer, Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the
Treasury, also advised that the average cost of preparing parliamentary
answers had risen to Pounds 94 for a written question and Pounds 218 for an
oral question.
He said the advisory cost limit, which was last increased in 1992, was
'intended to act as a threshold for disproportionate cost.'

FT  19 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Date for first unified Budget
brought forward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DATE for the first unified budget has been brought forward from early
December to late November to give government departments and councils more
time to plan for the following financial year.
From summer 1994, ministers are also likely to begin making a summer
economic forecast, to make up for the compression of the existing two
forecasts - at the Budget and at the Autumn Statement - into one occasion.
The form of the summer forecast has not been finalised, but using one of the
periodic Treasury bulletins is one option. Ministers are expecting to
concede a request from Labour that this should be accompanied by a
commitment to providing time for Commons debate.
Until now, the Autumn Statement has been in the first half of November.
Local authorities had warned that if announcement of spending plans slipped
into December, their budget process would be hard pressed.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, also gave details yesterday of two related
changes to legislation.
The September retail prices index, rather than the December RPI, is to be
used for indexing income tax personal allowances and uprating other tax
limits and thresholds. Published in mid October, it is already used for
indexing social security benefits.
The deadline for parliament's discussion of the finance bill will be moved
forward from August 5 to May 5.
Other changes as a result of the move to a unified Budget are likely to
include a shorter, and perhaps more relaxed, period of pre-Budget purdah,
which will not start until after the party conference.
The government may also try to compress the week-long general debate at the
start of the parliamentary session in November, since it will be followed
almost immediately by the week-long economic debate after the Budget.

RAILWAY privatisation will lead to the publication of dozens of different

The government said that franchisees operating state-subsidised services

much the same way as BR does now. Operators of unsubsidised services will be

FT  19 FEB 93 / Future of Digital's Irish and Scottish plants in the balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, TIM COONE and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   EDINBURGH, DUBLIN, SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DIGITAL, the US computer maker, is thought likely to decide in the next few
days whether a plant in Ireland or one in Scotland is to be the victim of
retrenchment in its European computer manufacturing operations. The
Massachusetts-based company is poised to decide between concentrating
production of its new Alpha computers at its plant at Ayr in south-west
Scotland or at Galway in western Ireland.
It is likely that the plant which loses will be closed, and the winning
plant might gain several hundred new jobs as work was transferred from one
facility to the other. The company plans to reduce its worldwide payroll to
about 90,000 from 108,500 at the end of last September.
Both plants make mini-computers and personal computers. The Ayr facility
employs 980 people and that in Galway some 1,200.
Officials from Locate in Scotland, the inward-investment division of
Scottish Enterprise, and from the Industrial Development Authority in
Ireland have been in constant touch with Digital in the hope of swinging the
decision in their favour.
But there was no indication last night from Locate in Scotland that a
decision in favour of Ayr was expected.
The Irish authority said it would be 'a disaster' if Digital decided to pull
out of Ireland.
Digital is refusing to comment beyond repeating a statement issued in
December that a review of European manufacturing which would involve
redundancies was under way. The company said no decision would be announced
this week. Other sources say that a decision will be made today and
announced next Tuesday.
Digital's plant at Ayr is regarded as one of the most successful and
productive electronics factories operated by multinational companies in
Scotland. Last year Digital opened a plant at South Queensferry near
Edinburgh to make semiconductors. Both these factors make some industry
observers believe that the decision between Galway and Ayr will go in Ayr's
favour.
The company was one of the first electronics companies to be established in
Ireland. In the past two years, however, it has closed one plant and shed
300 jobs, and it is thought that its older VAX computer production line at
Galway is the most likely to be axed.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Salvation Army row gathers pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TILEN Securities, the firm at the heart of an alleged Pounds 6m fraud, is
neither registered in Britain nor authorised to conduct investment business
here, regulators said yesterday.
Two individuals named in a writ filed by the Salvation Army, Mr Stuart
Christopher Ford of Birmingham and Mr Gamil Naguib, are also not authorised
to conduct investment business, the Securities and Investments Board stated.
The firm is also named in the writ.
According to the Charities Commission, trustees of charities are required to
conduct investment business only through firms authorised under the
Financial Services Act. The Salvation Army confirmed through its public
relations advisers Lowe Bell yesterday that one of its officers had been
suspended with pay pending the outcome of an internal investigation. The
charity declined to name the officer.
The Salvation Army has retained the accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand and
City solicitors Slaughter and May to investigate the disappearance of the
funds. It is believed a worldwide injunction freezing individual and
corporate assets is being sought in connection with the writ.
Last month the Salvation Army succeeded in obtaining an order to freeze
assets held in Luxembourg. Assets of about Dollars 520,000 (Pounds 366,200)
were frozen.
The Salvation Army has notified the Metropolitan Police and is preparing
documents, which are expected to be delivered to the police early next week.
Meanwhile, neither the Salvation Army nor its advisers know the whereabouts
of the individuals named in the writ, and private investigators have been
retained to assist in the search.
The Salvation Army has declined to give any details of the timing or nature
of the alleged fraud.
The charity, which is the largest provider of social services after the
government, last year had an income of almost Pounds 80m of which Pounds 12m
came from public donations. It is the sixth-largest UK charity - only the
National Trust, Royal National Lifeboat Institution, Oxfam, Imperial Cancer
Research Fund and Cancer Research Campaign are larger.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Corporation of London, the local authority for the City, yesterday
decided to campaign to retain St Bartholomew's hospital's 24-hour accident
and emergency facilities.
A meeting of the Court of Common Council, the equivalent of a meeting of the
full council in a London borough, expressed the 'gravest misgivings' at
Tuesday's announcement on London healthcare by Mrs Virginia Bottomley,
health secretary, which has put the future of Bart's in doubt. Mrs Joyce
Nash, chair of the corporation's health and social services committee, said
the City would risk damage if the proposals made it seem less attractive as
a financial centre.
Bart's managers have decided to enter discussions on a merger with the Royal
London hospital. That was opposed yesterday by the Bart's Patients' Campaign
which has been fighting to save the hospital.

FT  19 FEB 93 / OECD criticises health reforms
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE introduction of an internal market in the health service is unlikely to
reduce waiting times for hospital operations significantly, says a report
from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
The Paris-based OECD has examined reforms in the UK and three other European
countries which use market-type mechanisms to control the cost of hospital
treatment.
The authors found that the reforms have contributed to greater efficiency
and helped healthcare systems become more innovative. Health service
managers also welcomed the greater freedom.
However, the report concludes that there is only limited scope for reducing
waiting times for operations in the UK unless the 'chronic scarcity of
resources' is addressed. The OECD says the internal market will highlight
the shortage of funds which creates long waiting lists for hospital
admission.

KODAK, the US-based photo-graphic and office equipment supplier, is
investing Pounds 16m in a new factory on Merseyside after deciding against
alternative sites in France and Germany, Alan Cane writes.
The factory is expected to create 40 jobs in the area and will make toner,
the fine black powder used to produce photocopied images, for customers
throughout Europe. At present, Kodak manufactures toner in the US and ships
it to Europe.
The new plant will be located on Kodak's existing 37-acre site at Knowsley
Industrial Park, where it has been manufacturing photographic chemicals
since 1949. Construction will begin in the spring.
The Department of Trade and Industry helped to secure a regional development
grant of Pounds 700,000 towards the cost of the project.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Environmental groups torn by divisions on pits battle: The
'green' organisations in a quandary over the issue of closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the conflict over the future of Britain's coal industry, the
environmental movement has not had a good war. The leading pressure groups
have been unable to present a united policy and have appeared ambivalent
about whether coal mines should close.
They have not been short of targets - the Commons environment committee last
week accused Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, of ignoring
environmental issues in his October announcement that he planned to close 31
pits.
It is surprising that the environmental case has not been put more
forcefully in a country where 'green' pressure groups command wide support.
Moreover, the issue of energy use had a high profile last year, with the
risk of global warming from burning fossil fuels at the top of the Rio Earth
Summit's agenda.
Policy differences prevented the environmentalists making a joint response
to the pit closure announcement. The debate over the closures put them on
the spot because it forced them to choose between competing goals.
The environmentalists' instincts have been anti-coal because of the carbon
dioxide produced by burning it. The government committed itself last year to
stabilising levels of carbon dioxide at 1990 levels by the year 2000, and
the pit closures appeared to make those targets easier to reach.
The two leading environmental groups, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth,
want the use of fossil fuels such as coal, gas and oil cut sharply 'in the
long term'. But they also want the government's white paper on coal,
expected in the next few weeks, to preserve some of the 31 pits for a few
years.
Greenpeace, which has 400,000-plus supporters, argues that 'the immediate
priority must be the closure of nuclear power, not the coal mines'. It wants
a larger share for coal in the electricity generation market to be created
at the expense of nuclear power. It maintains this opposition to nuclear
power - one of its most passionately held policies - even though nuclear
power does not emit carbon dioxide, and a nuclear accident would affect many
fewer people than global warming.
Mr Clive Bates, Greenpeace's energy campaigner, defends its priorities. 'The
probability may be low, but there just isn't a socially acceptable nuclear
accident,' he says.
Friends of the Earth, with about 250,000 supporters, also opposes nuclear
power. But its desire to see pits spared is prompted largely by concern for
the mining communities.
Greenpeace says pointedly: 'We don't have a view on mining jobs - we stick
to environmental questions.' But Mr Simon Roberts, FoE energy campaigner,
argues that 'the impact of changes to improve the environment should be
spread more evenly across society - yes, that is a political point we're
making'.
The long-term solution favoured by both groups is investment in energy
efficiency and 'renewables' - wind, solar and wave power. Here there is some
common ground with the government, which is running a campaign to persuade
households to save electricity. The Department of Trade and Industry has
also suggested a growing though small role for renewables.
FoE says the energy-efficiency schemes it favours could save nearly half the
UK's use of energy, apart from in transport, by 2005.
The groups are optimistic about renewables in spite of the trade and
industry department's estimate that the cost of power is generally two to
three times that generated by present sources. Both groups hope costs might
fall with more research, but suggest that even if renewables are not
competitive the extra cost should simply be paid.
Other parts of the 'green' movement are less certain about renewables. The
Campaign for the Protection of Rural England has expressed unease about
wind-turbine towers on hillsides or tidal barrages changing the shape of
estuaries.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Government delays release of coal survival plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, JOHN MASON and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has been forced to delay publication of its plan for the coal
industry until next month, suggesting MPs may not have the chance to debate
it until after the Budget on March 16.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is still struggling to
secure the consent of the two main electricity generators in England and
Wales to take an extra 65.5m tonnes of British deep-mined coal over five
years.
This is the amount the government believes is necessary to win backbench
approval for its rescue plan. The generators have offered to take 40m tonnes
at subsidised world prices, and an extra 15m providing the government pays
for the cost of stocking it. It also emerged yesterday that British Coal has
decided not to appeal against a High Court ruling that its decision in
October to close the 10 most threatened pits was unlawful.
It decided against the appeal after mining unions yesterday failed in a
separate High Court attempt to challenge consultation procedures to be used
by British Coal over the 10 pits.
The National Union of Mineworkers and Nacods, the pit deputies' union, had
accused British Coal of having no intention of entering into genuine
consultations and challenged its use of mining engineers John T. Boyd to
review the threatened mines.
Lord Justice Glidewell - who last December ruled the original closure
decisions unlawful - dismissed the unions' request for new court orders to
ensure independent scrutiny of the closure programme.
The High Court had no jurisdiction over the matter and British Coal had yet
to decide finally on the form of consultation to be used, Lord Justice
Glidewell said.
British Coal, explaining why it had decided against an appeal against the
December decision, said it did not want to be distracted from the
consultation process.
The government's inability to publish a white paper on coal before next
month demonstrates the difficulties it faces in deciding on the future of
the industry.
Last month Mr Heseltine said he wanted to publish the white paper as early
as possible in February.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Heseltine still has aces up his sleeve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY remaining expectations that Mr Michael Heseltine would emerge as a
knight in re-polished armour from the coal industry debacle have been
dispelled by his latest rows with the power generators.
The struggle between the trade and industry secretary and the generating
companies National Power and PowerGen has underlined again how the political
crisis created by last autumn's pit closure programme left the government in
a no-win position. As one of Mr Heseltine's cabinet colleagues commented
recently: 'It was never a game which we could win. We are in the business of
cutting losses.'
But ministers believe it is still too early to say whether the generators'
refusal to bear any of the costs of salvaging about a dozen of the 31 pits
earmarked for closure threatens even that damage-limitation exercise. Mr
Heseltine still has a powerful card to play.
Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, is warning Mr Heseltine
that his own duties to shareholders come before the government's concerns to
placate its backbenchers. The generators will buy and stock extra coal only
if Mr Heseltine picks up every penny of the bill.
There is recognition in Whitehall that the generators' position appears
impregnable. Mr Heseltine has no legal powers to enforce any contract
between British Coal and the generators.
He can threaten new legislation, but the companies are as aware as anyone at
Westminster that the government is keen to avoid months of protracted
Commons debates.
But National Power and PowerGen also know that Mr Heseltine can be pushed
only so far. He could retaliate if negotiations on an expanded coal contract
broke down.
The unspoken threat to the generators is that he might respond by seeking to
break up the duopoly established when the industry was privatised two years
ago.
It is not a threat that can be made explicitly: even hinting at the
possibility of retaliation through a Monopolies and Mergers Commission
investigation would leave him vulnerable to a challenge in the courts.
But the threat is there nonetheless, confirmed by senior ministers with nods
and winks.
There is little doubt at Westminster that if National Power and PowerGen did
not strike a deal acceptable to the government, Tory backbenchers would soon
clamour for an MMC inquiry.
Mr Heseltine's position has been strengthened by the fact that most of the
cabinet disputes over coal have ended.
Leaks about disputes with the generators may actually have helped the
government. The message that there are no easy options has percolated down
to potential Tory rebels at Westminster.
Mr Heseltine will not survive this trauma untarnished. But he looks set to
survive, nevertheless.

<TEXT>
CAR and commercial vehicle production has made an 'encouraging' start to the
year, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said yesterday.
But statistics for January released by the SMMT and Central Statistical
Office showed no firm signs of the output growth in cars that the SMMT has
forecast for this year. It has predicted that the UK-based industry will
make 1.4m cars this year, 110,000 more than in 1992.
Car output rose by 14.57 per cent on a year-on-year basis last month to
109,124 from 95,245, the SMMT said.
Direct comparisons are difficult, however, mainly because January this year
covered five weeks' production compared with four last year.
Seasonally adjusted figures compiled by the CSO show last month's car output
to be marginally lower than in the same month last year - 99,400 against
100,700.
But production in the current and coming months is expected to increasingly
to feel the benefit of the introduction of Toyota's car plant at Burnaston,
Derbyshire, and Honda's plan at Swindon, Wiltshire, and also of Nissan's
planned output growth.
Rover Group stated this week that it is doubling Maestro and Montego output,
and will soon start production of the 600, its own version of the Accord
that Honda has begun building at Swindon.
Rover's contention that it is increasing output mainly to cope with higher
export demand appears to be supported by yesterday's statistics. They show
production for export, at 50,292, up 21.21 per cent from the previous
January's 41,492.
Commercial vehicle output in the month rose 14.81 per cent to 16,400, but
with production for export down 3.09 per cent to 9,734. The CSO's seasonally
adjusted total commercial vehicle figures showed that output was down 2.2
per cent.
This month's commercial vehicle figures are almost certain to be badly
affected by the halting of production at UK truck market leader Leyland Daf,
following its collapse into receivership.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Lloyd's faces big rise in pollution claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London faces a substantial increase in possible claims from US
pollution, damaging further the prospects of the insurance market.
Lloyd's syndicates have already put aside more than Pounds 1bn to pay claims
from US pollution cases and are likely to need to increase their reserves
again following an estimated 30 per cent surge in claims notifications
during 1992.
'It is a young problem in terms of insurance but it is still growing,' said
Mr Alan Pollard, chief executive of Syndicate Underwriting Management. SUM
handles claims on behalf of more than 80 syndicates which are no longer in
business and about 17 per cent of all pollution claims at Lloyd's. The
run-off company, which is owned by the Lloyd's corporation, received
notification of 13,000 claims last year compared with 10,000 in 1991. The
corporation regulates and services the Lloyd's market.
Mr Pollard predicts that many more syndicates will be forced to keep their
accounts open for 1990 when they report results for that year this June.
This is because of uncertainty about pollution, asbestosis and other
so-called 'long-tail' liabilities, which sometimes arise on policies
underwritten more than 30 years ago.
These long-tail claims have added to Lloyd's losses in recent years, which
are set to exceed Pounds 4bn for the three years 1988 to 1990.
One leading underwriter said last week: 'Half the professionals on the
market think that (claims from US) pollution is the end of the world as we
know it.'
In a separate development Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of Lloyd's,
has announced the loss of a further 300 jobs at the corporation.
Mr Middleton aims to reduce staff numbers by a further 300 to 1,600 before
the end of the year. Since taking over last September, he has cut 300 jobs
as part of a Pounds 29.5m cut in the budget to Pounds 115m.
'There is a vital need for us to help to restore the competitive edge of the
Lloyd's market,' he said.
Other changes which were reported yesterday include a reduction in
management layers from 15 to six, and introducing performance pay and a
staff appraisal system. The government is seriously considering scrapping
proposals for a register of contaminated land, one of the most bitterly
contested part of the government's environment policy, after criticism that
it could blight property values.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Rail workers union warned on racial bias
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMISSION for Racial Equality has told the RMT transport union that it
must take action before September to prevent race discrimination or face a
full investigation.
Allegations of discrimination were made during a dispute over selection
procedures two years ago between British Rail and Asian guards at Paddington
station in London.
Eight guards complained to the commission that they experienced
discrimination in their attempts to become train drivers. It was also
claimed that the union failed to take adequate action to support them in
spite of repeated requests.
BR has since been working on selection procedures with the commission, which
has also been examining evidence of discriminatory practices by the union.
The union said it would monitor the ethnic origin of its officials and
members, take action to deal with under-represented racial groups and train
officials in how to tackle discrimination in the workplace.
The commission has agreed to suspend its investigation but said that if the
union did not make satisfactory progress by the end of September, it might
be issued with a legally enforceable non-discrimination notice.
Ms Mary Coussey, the commission's employment division director, said the
complaints by the Asian guards were 'a reminder that both sides in
employment - management and the unions - have an equal responsibility' to
work to eliminate discrimination.
Mr Vernon Hince, RMT senior assistant general secretary, said the union
welcomed the opportunity to work with the commission.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Polluted land register in doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is seriously considering scrapping proposals for a register
of contaminated land after criticism that it could blight property values
across industrialised parts of England and Wales.
The proposals have been one of the most bitterly contested parts of the
government's environment policy. There have been claims that the register
would depress property values, trigger a flood of legal claims and set back
efforts to regenerate derelict land.
There have been protests about the inclusion of all land which had been used
by specified types of industry, regardless of whether the land had actually
been polluted.
Earlier this month an advisory committee of prominent business people warned
the government that banks were increasingly worried about taking land as
security for loans in case they became liable for the cleaning-up costs.
An announcement on revised proposals is expected in two weeks. Ministers are
understood to favour a register based on planning applications.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Microchip breakthrough in Cambridge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A UK-Japanese research team in Cambridge has made a breakthrough in
semi-conductor technology which promises computer memories of vastly greater
capacity than the microchips now available.
The development is expected to open new frontiers for portable computers
including the storage of sound and moving video images.
Researchers from the Japanese company Hitachi Europe and Cambridge
University's Cavendish Laboratory yesterday published their preliminary
findings. A 'bit' of information - equivalent to a '1' or '0' in computer
binary code - can now be stored by a single electron in a microchip. Today's
memory chips take about 500,000 electrons to store one bit.
A single-electron memory would consume much less power than conventional
memory chips. The implications for personal computers, especially portable
machines, are immense. One prospect is the first terabit (thousand billion
bit) memory chip.
This has not been possible until now because even the most advanced
semiconductor memories consume about a tenth of a watt in power; a single
thousand-billion-bit memory chip using this technology would run as hot as
five two-bar electric fires.
Using the new Cambridge technology, power consumption would be less than a
tenth of a watt, making possible notebook computers with virtually unlimited
storage capacity.
Dr Kazuo Nakazato, Hitachi's senior researcher, explained that storing data
which requires a tennis court's worth of microchips today, could be achieved
in a single electron memory the size of a 50p piece. Professor Haroon Ahmed
of the Cambridge microelectronics research centre said there were many
problems to be solved before commercial single-electron memories would be
feasible.
The Cambridge experiments work only at temperatures close to absolute zero
(minus 273 deg C) and the scientists are now attempting to develop chips
which will operate at room temperature.

after claiming that they had won improvements on job security.
Unions said Peugeot Talbot had agreed not to make enforced redundancies and
officials decided the improvement should be put to the workforce in ballots
next Monday and Tuesday.
The company refused to improve a two-year offer of 3.5 per cent on pay now
and 3.5 per cent or the rate of inflation next year.
Shop stewards will hold meetings with workers tomorrow before the balloting

FT  19 FEB 93 / Industry's unstoppable slide: FT study shows that Britain
cannot count on manufacturing for an export-led recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF Mr John Major is looking to industry for an export-led recovery he may be
disappointed, a Financial Times study has found. The trade gap in
manufactured goods is likely to continue in spite of recent efforts to
promote exports.
A survey of industrial sectors over the past 20 years by FT reporters shows
that some sectors now in deficit, such as motors and electricals, are
reviving as a result of foreign investment. However, the decline of other
sectors could offset any such gains.
Britain went into deficit in manufacturing trade 10 years ago, and the
deficit widened last year in spite of the recession. There is now a long
list of products in deficit that were in surplus 20 years ago. Besides
motors and electronics, sectors which have moved into deficit include
textiles and furniture. Individual items in deficit range from nuts and
bolts to bicycles, cigarette lighters and pianos.
It is not an easy problem to grapple with. Guinness recently announced
rationalisation and job losses in the Scotch whisky industry. It is to spend
Pounds 25m on new automatic bottling equipment, all from abroad. 'It is
virtually impossible to buy high-speed, sophisticated bottling equipment in
the UK,' Guinness said this week. 'The technology is in the hands of the
Germans.'
The FT's findings, which will be published in a two-part series starting on
Monday, show that even in sectors still in surplus the pattern is one of
decline. The most commonly cited example of British industrial success in
world markets is pharmaceuticals, which last year contributed a trade
surplus of about Pounds 1.3bn. In 1970 exports of pharmaceuticals exceeded
imports by a factor of four. By 1980 it was a factor of three, and last year
exports were less than double imports.
There is a similar pattern in chemicals, which are also in surplus overall.
In the 1980s the industry cut production of petrochemicals sharply following
heavy losses in the previous recession. As a result it was unable to supply
demand in the boom conditions at the end of the decade. Import tonnage of
PVC, a basic plastic used in the construction industry, trebled between 1980
and 1991 while export tonnage halved.
It is unlikely that the devaluation of sterling since last September will
help. In 1970, when manufactured imports were only two thirds the size of
exports, sterling stood at an average DM8.74 and Dollars 2.40. Since then,
devaluation and a declining trade balance have gone hand in hand.
The brightest spots in the picture are motors, where massive Japanese
investment is expected to plug the deficit by the mid-1990s, and in
electronics, where Britain is benefiting from foreign investment in consumer
electronics, semiconductors and personal computers. However, business
location experts do not think the UK will continue to enjoy the lion's share
of inward investment into Europe.
Mr David Rees, location specialist with Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm,
said: 'In the next five years, I think Britain will continue to earn a high
share of manufacturing projects relative to the size of its economy. But I
do not believe it will retain its lead.'
The reason he says is low-cost competition from eastern Europe and greater
efforts by other western European countries to attract investment.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Take-up of mortgages falls sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPORTS from estate agents of increasing activity in the housing market were
undermined yesterday by figures from building societies showing a fall in
the number of people committing themselves to new mortgages last month.
The value of net new commitments to society mortgages last month fell to
Pounds 1.55bn from Pounds 1.89bn in December. The December figure was
revised downwards from an earlier estimate of Pounds 1.99bn which had been
taken as a sign of modest recovery.
The value of net new commitments last month was lower than in any month last
year, when the lowest monthly figure was Pounds 1.8bn in September. The
value last month was also heavily down on the Pounds 2.27bn of net new
commitments made in January last year.
The Building Societies Association said increased interest among housebuyers
had not yet emerged. 'There is no evidence of recovery in the housing market
on these figures,' said Mr Adrian Coles, the association's head of external
relations.
Mr Coles said the fall in new commitments was 'not un-expected' because
buying was traditionally subdued in January. The activity reported by
housebuilders and estate agents would probably be reflected in future
figures.
He said the fall might also reflect a decline in the share of mortgage
lending done by societies. The cut in base rates has enabled lenders such as
banks taking funds from wholesale markets to undercut retail-funded
mortgages.
Gross mortgage lending for January fell to Pounds 1.8bn from Pounds 2.14bn
in December. But net advances - gross advances minus the repayment of
mortgage principal - increased slightly to Pounds 528m from a revised figure
of Pounds 474m in December. Societies' deposits were more encouraging. They
achieved a net inflow of retail funds of Pounds 363m in January after an
inflow of Pounds 117m in December. The January figure alone was above the
total annual inflow of Pounds 295m last year.
The retail inflow was the highest in a single month since October 1991. Mr
Coles said the inflow was 'particularly welcome' given renewed competition
from National Savings because of government efforts to attract retail funds.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE DAY the government announced a further fall in manufacturing
employment, the English Tourist Board launched a Pounds 230,000 campaign to
attract visitors to sites associated with Britain's industrial heritage.
The 'Experience the Making of Britain' programme boasts 250 attractions,
featuring existing industries, those that have disappeared and some that are
under threat. The latter are exhibited in the British Commercial Vehicle
Museum in Leyland, Lancashire, and the Yorkshire Mining Museum in Wakefield,
West Yorkshire.
The campaign includes 500 special events, from a Friends of Thomas the Tank
Engine weekend to a demonstration by leading glassmakers. Financial support
has come from Grand Metropolitan, Hanson, the Electricity Association,
British Nuclear Fuels and Marks and Spencer.
Mr William Davis, the board's outgoing chairman, said: 'The campaign is much
more than just a backward look at our industrial achievements and the way we
once lived. Tourism and industrial heritage are an important force for the
regeneration of some of today's communities.'

inflow of Pounds 117m in December. The January figure alone was above the
total annual inflow of Pounds 295m last year.
The retail inflow was the highest in a single month since October 1991. Mr
Coles said the inflow was 'particularly welcome' given renewed competition
from National Savings because of government efforts to attract retail funds.
Societies did not pass on the whole of the 1 percentage point cut in base
rates to savers last month in order to protect themselves against customers
transferring money to National Savings and equity-based investments.
Mr Coles said this would probably have a stronger effect in future months.
National Savings funds were also increasing, indicating a broader
willingness to save.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Caution greets lending increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANK and building society lending rose unexpectedly last month, but certain
factors cast doubt over whether the rise was a sign of economic recovery.
The Bank of England reported that bank and building society lending to the
private sector increased by a seasonally adjusted Pounds 4.1bn in January
after a Pounds 74m drop in December. The increase was double City
expectations and substantially higher than the Pounds 1.5bn average of the
previous six months.
But hopes that this might signal a robust recovery in demand were tempered
by doubts about the methods of seasonally adjusting the figures.
In addition M4, the UK's broad money measure that includes bank and building
society deposits, increased by only 3.2 per cent in the 12 months to
January. This was the lowest increase in the measure since records began and
well below the government's 'monitoring range' of 4 per cent to 8 per cent
growth.
The British Bankers' Association, representing the UK's nine largest banking
groups, said the groups' lending to the private sector increased by a
seasonally adjusted Pounds 2.13bn in January after a fall of Pounds 1.71bn
in December.
Lord Inchyra, director-general of the association, said the January increase
in bank lending was the biggest since October. 'It would probably be unwise
to interpret this welcome rise in lending as providing evidence of an upturn
in the economy,' he added.
City analysts said lending figures over the past year have established a
pattern of weak growth or falling lending at the end of each quarter
followed by sharp growth in each subsequent month. This indicates that the
seasonal adjustment procedures are not working satisfactorily, they said.

FT  19 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Mood lifts in EC-US public procurement row
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A POSSIBLE solution to the dispute between the US and the European Community
over telecommunications and other government procurement contracts was
raised by negotiators yesterday based on 'comparable, effective and lasting
access' to each other's markets, and equal treatment to each other's
exporters.
Negotiators agreed after two days of discussions in Washington that the EC
could exempt US companies from rules which discriminate in favour of EC
bidders for procurement contracts 'if we have comparable access to the US
market'. They plan to meet again in Brussels on March 11.
The clash over public procurement flared last month after the new US
administration threatened to bar European companies from bidding for federal
contracts in the US unless European procurement regulations favouring local
manufacturers were dismantled. It set March 22 as a deadline for EC action.
EC officials conceded in Washington after this week's discussions that there
were 'obstacles in the way' of US companies competing for EC procurement
contracts, but insisted that the market was opening up, and 'serious trade
is being done'.
But they also insisted that systemic differences made it difficult for US
officials to recognise the obstacles that existed for foreign companies to
compete for US procurement contracts. Among these are 'Buy America' laws
used in some federal contracts, and by 37 state governments in the US;
special monopoly privileges under which companies such as AT&amp;T operate; and
the arbitrary use of design standards to keep foreign companies at bay.
'We are trying to find out whether two systems which are completely
different in design - ours based on rules and regulation, and the US system
based on private sector competition - can produce comparable results in
terms of market access for foreign companies,' said Mr Jorn Keck, who headed
the EC negotiating team in Washington.
In response to US arguments that large US private sector telecommunications
operators such as AT&amp;T, MCI-Sprint, GTE or the 'baby Bells', should not be
subject to procurement rules because they are not government run, Mr Keck
said: 'We don't care whether a company is private or not. What really counts
is not ownership, but government regulation, and whether a company has
special or exclusive rights.
'When you look at AT&amp;T, you see they are operating under special privileges,
under monopoly conditions. We need to look at their procurement behaviour
because it is not what you would expect in a free market.'
Officials say they have agreed a text from which to continue negotiations on
telecommunications contracts.

<TEXT>
SIR LEON BRITTAN, the EC external trade commissioner, yesterday warned the
US against cluttering the Uruguay Round of world trade talks with new issues
and fresh conditions, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. But the European
Commission welcomed President Bill Clinton's call, in his State of the Union
address on Wednesday night, for an expansion of world trade and a successful
conclusion of the talks.
Speaking in Cheshire in Britain last night, Sir Leon said Mr Clinton had
given 'a clear lead' to the final stage of talks, when he announced last
week he would ask Congress to extend the administration's 'fast-track'
negotiating authority.
Sir Leon met Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, for the first time
in Washington last week, and described him yesterday as 'an open, agreeable,
but tough negotiator'.
He said any extension of the Clinton administration's negotiating mandate
should be short and free of fresh conditions. 'If new issues are now being
suggested, they should not be the pretext for delaying or complicating the
present Round,' he said.
'The newly identified issues of today can readily be put on the agenda for
discussion in the immediate aftermath of the present Round.'
Sir Leon repeated that he was confident of a Gatt agreement, but warned that
there was 'a difficult end-game ahead', and said negotiators should expect
'a period of turbulence' before any deal was struck. 'But getting there will
require persistence, resolution and determination.'
The commissioner said the US should resist the temptation 'to seek
protectionist short cuts to economic recovery', and he said bilateral
difficulties in trade between the US and the EC - for example, on steel and
public procurement - should not be tackled unilaterally.

CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl arrived in New Delhi yesterday on a four-day visit,
primarily to strengthen economic ties between Germany and India, and to
explore the business opportunities afforded by India's new economic reforms
programme.
While in India, he and the 20 German businessmen accompanying him will visit
the Indian Engineering Trade Fair. Germany was one of the first countries to
send a business delegation to India when India opened up its economy to
foreign investors last year.
Germany is India's largest EC trading partner, accounting for about 8 per
cent of its total trade. Germany's exports to India totalled Dollars 1.5bn
(Pounds 1.04bn) and imports Dollars 1.7bn in 1991. In the first half of
1992, trade was virtually in balance at about Dollars 900m each way.
Finished goods, like leather products, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, cotton
and silk garments comprise some 85 per cent of India's exports to Germany;
imports are mainly industrial machinery and fertiliser components.
India has received more than DM10bn in financial and technical assistance
from (West) Germany since bilateral development co-operation began more than
30 years ago.
Mr Mr Hans-Georg Wieck, German ambassador, said his country was looking
towards Indian companies as potential partners in the machine tools,
equipment and manufacturing sectors.
The fair, a biennial event, organised by the Confederation of Indian
Industry, an autonomous association representing some 2,600 Indian companies
in the public and private sectors, has generated business inquiries worth
Rs17.16bn (Pounds 405m) in the first three days, a record for the fair. The
fair's success, especially in industrial engineering goods and machine
tools, reflects India's changed business environment, say the organisers.

ERICSSON, the Swedish telecommunications group, said yesterday it had won a
Dollars 150m (Pounds 104m) contract to expand a mobile telephone system in
Guangdong province - the largest Chinese order for a cellular system, it
claimed.
The order will more than double the capacity of the network operated by
Guangdong Mobile Communications, enabling it to serve 240,000 extra
subscribers. The contract calls for the delivery of radio channels, mobile
switching centres, data bases and radio link equipment by the third quarter
of this year.
Ericsson, the world's leading supplier of cellular telephone systems,
already has a strong presence in China. Apart from being the sole supplier
to Guangdong, it has recently won contracts to supply Beijing, Tianjin,
Guangxi and Hebei. The new order means mobile phone systems have a capacity
to serve around 500,000 Chinese subscribers.

FT  19 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Keating plays the grand trade policy card
/ A look at Labor's pre-election vision of an Australian role in a new
integrated Asian Pacific market grouping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN it comes to electioneering, few political leaders have a greater sense
of the value of a dramatic gesture than Mr Paul Keating, the Labor prime
minister of Australia.
Launching his party's trade policy for Australia's forthcoming federal
election, Mr Keating unexpectedly proposed the creation of an integrated
Asia Pacific market of 2bn people.
Such a market would account for half of global economic output and 40 per
cent of world exports, making it by far the largest of the world's trade
groupings.
In addition to Australia and New Zealand, it would include the six countries
of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean), the three members of
the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), Japan, South Korea, China,
Hong Kong and Taiwan.
From Canberra's point of view, the Keating plan is a natural development of
Apec, the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum initiated by Australia
and the US in 1989.
Apec, which includes all of Mr Keating's target countries except Mexico, has
become the main focus of Australian trade promotion efforts, mainly because
it accounts for 70 per cent of Australian exports.
But Australian officials have become increasingly worried about the
potential impact of a breakdown of the Uruguay Round talks in the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on intra-Apec trade.
There is particular concern that the US might seek a series of bilateral
trade deals offering preferential access to Nafta, which could be used to
discriminate against Japan, Australia's biggest trading partner. Mr Keating,
who has assured Tokyo of Australian support in such a dispute, warned the
Clinton administration that it risked 'accumulating resentment and
resistance' if the benefits of such deals flowed mainly to the US.
The alternative, he said, was 'an open economic association in the Asia
Pacific region, in which its economies were by degrees integrated to create
the world's most dynamic zone of production.'
Mr Keating's proposal was intended to contrast Labor's enthusiasm for
integration with the Asia Pacific region with the more conservative approach
of the Liberal/National Party opposition, which puts more emphasis on
traditional links with Europe and North America.
However, as Mr Keating acknowledged, there are obstacles to the development
of a cohesive trading bloc based on the loosely knit Apec grouping.
Professor Richard Snape, head of the economics department at Monash
University, concluded in a report on Australia's trading options that the
size and diversity of Apec meant that negotiations on a comprehensive trade
agreement would face the same problems as the Uruguay Round.
For example, the US, Canada, Japan and South Korea are unlikely to make
further concessions on agricultural trade than they have already made within
the Gatt framework.
In addition, Apec already includes three incompatible trading blocs - the
Asean free trade area, Nafta and the Closer Economic Relations (CER)
agreement between Australia and New Zealand.
Professor Snape's report also concluded that successful regional trading
blocs usually exhibit a high degree of geographical proximity, similar
levels of per capita gross national product and cultural affinity.
Recognising these problems and differences, Mr Keating suggested that Apec
should initially seek harmonisation of trading and technical standards,
competition regulations and corporate law, business practice, investment
rules, and professional qualifications.
Even this would be a substantial achievement in a region containing
economies as divergent as communist China, the US and Japan. The Asean
countries, for example, have found reducing protection difficult, and
Australia and New Zealand have so far failed to harmonise company and
taxation law.
Senator Gareth Evans, the Australian foreign affairs and trade Minister,
said yesterday that Apec was 'a very significant counter weight to the ever
present pressures at work to break the world into three warring trade blocs,
built respectively around the yen, the US dollar and the D-Mark.'
However, he played down the prospects of economic integration, conceding
that it would be 'some time' before the concept of an Asia Pacific free
trade area becomes 'even remotely' a reality.
'Our position is that in the meantime we should do nothing to inhibit the
development of genuinely regional arrangements, and nothing which cuts
across Australia's basic self-interest in achieving further trade policy
integration with the economies of East Asia,' he said.
This approach is less ambitious than the Prime Minister's grand vision of a
pan-Pacific common market. But it seems more achievable. It is also
supported by the opposition parties, which have backed away from suggestions
that a coalition government might seek membership of Nafta in preference to
developing Apec.
Whichever side wins the election on March 13, Apec will remain important to
Australia as the only mechanism which offers Canberra a seat at the regional
table.

FT  19 FEB 93 / The Clinton Economic Plan: Energy industry warns of heavy
cost - Levy on fuel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US energy industry yesterday responded to the economic package with a
blast of harsh rhetoric, warning that the proposed levy on petrol, heating
oil, gas and coal could damage the economic recovery and cause a loss of
jobs.
President Clinton's newly announced energy tax, based on the heat content of
fuels, is aimed at avoiding a politically controversial tax on petrol and
spreading the higher energy costs between industry and family homes.
Instead, the tax would be levied on the thermal content of fuels and,
according to US Treasury officials, is expected to raise net revenues
estimated at Dollars 22bn a year once it is fully in force.
The tax would be imposed at a rate of 25.7 cents per million British thermal
units on coal, nuclear energy and gas, and at a much steeper rate of 59.9
cents per million BTUs on oil. The administration plans to phase in the tax
in three stages, charging one third of the full rate from July 1, 1994, two
thirds a year later, and the full rate from July 1, 1996.
When fully phased in, the tax is expected to add 7.5 cents to the price of a
gallon of petrol, 26.25 cents to a thousand cubic feet of natural gas, and
Dollars 2.25 to the monthly electricity bill of an average household.
Mr Charles DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute (API),
claimed, however, that it 'really amounts to a thinly disguised gasoline
(petrol) tax, one that would seriously harm economic recovery and be a
job-killer on a mammoth scale'.
Mr Di Bona, in effect the energy sector's top Washington lobbyist, argued
that the tax could reduce gross domestic product by Dollars 170bn over five
years and cost 600,000 jobs.
The API said it did not accept administration estimates of the cost of the
new tax 'because we do not believe the additional costs can uniformly be
passed through on all petroleum products'.
The tax was also attacked as burdensome to middle class families. Jobs that
might be endangered were in the Midwest, South, Southwest and Rocky Mountain
states because of the energy-intensive industrial and agricultural
operations there.
In Oklahoma, part of the energy sector's heartland, Mr Larry Nichols,
chairman of independent oil and gas producer Devon Energy, reflected the
API's views. He thought the proposal was biased against companies like his
because a number of the costs could not necessarily be passed on to
consumers.
The US coal industry reacted cooly. But Mr Steve Anderson of Westmorland
Coal said 'a carbon tax would have been much worse for us', a view echoed by
Mr John Grasser of the National Coal Association, who said: 'Coal prices
will rise by about 25 per cent at the mine. Under a carbon tax it might have
doubled.'
He was also sceptical that coal use would fall as a result of the tax.
'Eighty per cent of our coal goes to the electrical utilities, and the only
competitor is gas which will be hit with exactly the same tax.'

FOREIGN COMPANIES with US operations reacted with a mixture of concern and
relief to President Clinton's proposed corporate tax changes.
Foreign companies have been particularly relieved to see a retreat from Mr
Clinton's strong campaign rhetoric to recoup up to an extra Dollars 45bn
over four years from overseas companies operating in the US. That figure has
now been revised down to just Dollars 3.8bn over six years.
But they have expressed worries about the Dollars 38m additional expenditure
to be made on hiring new investigators in the US Internal Revenue Service
and increasing their audits on foreign companies to ensure compliance.
That will mean extra expenditure by companies in ensuring adequate
documentation to prove that they have been filing accurate, fair tax
returns.
'Generally British companies are still very concerned and nervous,' said Mr
Peter Dickinson, head of international tax at accountants Coop-ers &amp;
Lybrand. 'It is going to be much more expensive to operate in the US now and
the economic case for investing there has clearly been reduced.'
'One company I have spoken to said this would be a frightful additional
burden,' said Mr Dickinson. 'The feeling is the IRS has had enough
ammunition in the past. Any more pressure will be intolerable.'
Companies would also take a direct hit to their earnings from the 2 per cent
basic increase in corporation tax to 36 per cent.
Mr Mike Wort, of Wellcome, the pharmaceutical company with US manufacturing
operations, said: 'In the short-term there is little we can do. We plan no
significant changes and we have no intention to pull out. The US is still a
profitable market for us.'
However, Japanese groups with US operations were more sanguine. In Tokyo,
Honda, with two US factories employing 15,000 workers, said of the
possibility of more auditing of their figures: 'This is nothing for us to
worry about. We have been following US law.'
Toyota, the leading Japanese car maker, which has four factories in the US
employing more than 10,000 employees said: 'We have contributed a lot to the
US economy, we are not worried about it at all.'
Sony, Sanyo and Matushita, the electronics groups, which together operate 20
factories in the US all said they were not concerned about the plans. All
the companies said the proposals would not affect plans for further
investment in the US.
Mr Edward Streator, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in London,
said: 'I think people are obviously concerned about how much of a ripple
effect these proposals will have. But my hunch is the effects will be
slight.'

FT  19 FEB 93 / The Clinton Economic Plan: Shift in debt maturities - Bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Clinton's deficit-cutting plan may include a reduction in the
maturities of debt issues by the US Treasury, in an attempt to reduce heavy
interest costs.
Mr Leon Panetta, budget director, has projected Dollars 11.5bn in savings
over four years by shifting debt maturities.
Savings are possible because short-term interest rates in the US are
substantially lower than long-term rates. The benchmark 30-year long bond
yields 7.04 per cent, compared to the bond-equivalent yield of 2.94 per cent
on three-month Treasury bill. The wide margin reflects last year's
short-term interest rate cuts and fears about the future impact of the
budget deficit and inflation.
Mr Panetta tried to reassure the markets on Wednesday night by saying any
change in the debt mix would be made gradually.
Analysts, however, say a shift in debt to the short end of the yield curve
could be short-sighted, and would expose the huge US debt to increased
reinvestment risk. 'The Dollars 11.5bn savings would come only if all things
remain constant, and nothing does,' said Mr Frank Sannella, credit market
analyst at Stone and McCarthy Research Services.
The Treasury runs the risk of missing out on relatively cheap long-term
rates while driving up the cost of short-term debt.
'With interest rates as low as they are, its time to lock in on the long
end, which is what many corporations are doing right now,' said Mr Daniel
Smith, president-elect of the American Bankers Association.

advances - January Indicators
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US CONSUMER prices jumped by 0.5 per cent last month, well above the revised
0.2 per cent advance of December and the steepest monthly increase in the
last two years.
Other statistics released yesterday showed continuing strength in industrial
production, up 0.4 per cent in January, another decline in the weekly claims
for unemployment benefits and a small reduction in the December trade
deficit.
Principal factors behind the rise in retail prices were more expensive
vegetables, petrol, tobacco and clothing. But even excluding food and
energy, whose prices tend to be more volatile, the so-called core consumer
inflation rate also rose by 0.5 per cent.
Although the increase exceeded the expectations of analysts, January itself
is often a statistically unreliable month and there was no immediate
inclination to see in these figures a resurgence of general inflation. Last
year consumer prices rose by a modest 2.9 per cent and President Bill
Clinton's new economic proposals assume no additional inflationary
pressures.
The 0.4 per cent increase in industrial production, following revised gains
of 0.2 per cent and 0.5 per cent in December and November respectively, is
more consistent with the general picture of an economy modestly on the mend.
Increased output of cars and car parts accounted for about a half of the
advance in the index, but production of consumer goods, business equipment
and construction supplies also recorded advances. Total industrial capacity
usage in January rose by 0.2 percentage points to 79.5 per cent, the highest
since October, 1991.
The US trade deficit in December fell to Dollars 6.95bn (Pounds 4.81bn) from
the revised Dollars 7.35bn of the previous month. This brings the cumulative
deficit for the full year to Dollars 84.34bn, up from Dollars 65.40bn in
1991. The weakened economies of the main US trading partners and the
domestic recovery presage a wider deficit in 1993.
In the year, the sensitive US trade deficit with Japan rose to Dollars
49.4bn from Dollars 43.4bn in 1991. It thus accounted for nearly 60 per cent
of the worldwide deficit.
The US surplus with the European Community also dropped sharply last year to
Dollars 6.19bn from the Dollars 16.42bn of 1991. In December the US ran a
deficit with the EC of Dollars 308m, half that of November.

THE Clinton economic package would enable the US to hold its head up high in
international negotiations and promote its agenda of global growth more
effectively, a Treasury official claimed with evident satisfaction.
He said the package, which included a planned halving of the budget deficit
as a percentage of gross domestic product over the next four years, was a
'real response' to calls for tough US fiscal action from trading partners.
It would set the tone for better international economic relations.
Foreign governments should note that the Clinton strategy was 'consciously
internationalist'. The goal was to improve US economic performance not by
erecting protective walls to foreign products or capital, but by domestic
reforms that raised US productivity.
The plan offered a real hope of lower long-term US bond yields and faster
growth of output.
In recent years, US economic diplomacy has been hampered by its failure to
take the tough budgetary medicine advocated by its trading partners and by
international bodies such as the OECD and the IMF.
Since being nominated as Treasury secretary, Mr Lloyd Bentsen has repeatedly
said he would try to revitalise economic co-operation between the Group of
Seven industrial countries. He is attending a G7 meeting of finance
ministers and central bankers in London on February 27.
He seems likely to press European governments to lower interest rates
towards the low levels prevailing in the US and Japan as part of a
co-ordinated strategy to promote global growth.

deficit pleasures - US Business

US BUSINESS leaders appeared divided yesterday in their initial assessment
of the Clinton economic package. Many expressed concern that it could damp
the fragile recovery but others voiced support for its goals of creating
jobs and reducing the country's budget deficit.
Among the new financial burdens for business are an increase in the top
corporate tax from 34 to 36 per cent, a slashing from 80 to 50 per cent of
the deductions that may be taken for meals and entertainment, and a
cancelling of deductions for executive pay of more than Dollars 1m, for club
dues and for lobbying expenses. Tax credits for the purchase of new
equipment were also part of the proposal.
The three main carmakers in Detroit offered conditional support for Mr
Clinton's proposals. Mr Robert Eaton, chairman of Chrysler, called it 'a
tough package' but said this was needed in view of the size of the deficit.
Mr Harold Poling, chairman of Ford, noted that no one liked tax increases
because they could have a serious effect on economic recovery. But he
thought Americans might be willing to make the sacrifice for a period of
time.
General Motors stressed that the package should be analysed in its entirety
rather than in terms of how it affected individuals.
The computer and electronics sector was also divided. The most prominent
support from any US business leader came from Mr John Sculley, chairman of
Apple Computer and a self-professed Republican voter who sat next to Ms
Hillary Clinton during the president's speech and applauded before the
television cameras.
Mr George Fisher, chairman of Motorola, said that while he was 'quite
willing to pay more taxes' on a personal level, the increases in corporate
taxation were 'very shortsighted'.
Mr Craig Barrett, chief operating officer at Intel, hoped the higher
corporate taxes would not wipe out the benefits of investment tax credits.
Mr Bryan Little, director of government relations for the US Business and
Industrial Council, said 'the tax increases Clinton proposes will stifle
this economy and serve only to shut down small businesses and put people out
of work'.
The American Farm Bureau applauded the president for tackling the deficit,
but said US farmers and ranchers were disappointed that the package relied
so heavily on tax increases rather than spending cuts.
In Chicago, Mr Patrick Arbor, chairman of the Board of Trade, endorsed the
energy tax rises, but said he was concerned at new charges on futures
transactions and would lobby against it.
The view of small business was summed up by Mr Jackson Farris, chief
executive of the National Federation of Independent Business. He said the
package would do more harm than good to small businessmen because of taxes,
paperwork and regulatory burdens that could stifle the economic recovery.
As Clinton administration officials fanned out across the US to help sell
the package, Mr Robert Rubin, the former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs who is
chairman of the National Economic Council, went to Wall Street yesterday for
a lunch meeting with chief executives from 20 top banking groups.
Mr James Harmon, chairman of Wertheim Schroder and one of Mr Rubin's guests,
termed the package 'bold and courageous' and predicted that it would
eventually be approved by Congress.
Mr Harmon called the increase in corporate tax rates 'not so serious' and
added he did not think the overall package would dampen the US recovery.
Support for Mr Clinton's proposals also came from several trade union
leaders. Mr John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO union that represents one
million workers in the service sector, praised Mr Clinton for coming forward
'with an economic plan that puts working people and their futures first and
sets the priorities of this nation straight again'.

FT  19 FEB 93 / The Clinton Economic Plan: Europeans still agonising over
carbon taxes - EC Energy Policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US energy tax measure removes one obstacle to the introduction of
European energy and carbon taxes, but many impediments remain.
Unlike the US proposals, the European initiatives have so far been driven
more by environmental pressure than a need to raise money.
The European Commission has proposed a tax on energy and on its carbon
content to encourage efficiency and to discourage the use of fossil fuels
which emit carbon dioxide and could contribute to global warming. EC
countries are committed under the convention signed at last July's Earth
Summit in Rio de Janeiro to find ways of stabilising emissions of carbon
dioxide at 1990 levels by the year 2000.
However, the EC proposals are conditional on most industrialised countries
adopting similar ones, to avoid handicapping European industries. In
addition, there have been disagreements between EC countries about the best
form of these taxes.
Poorer countries want them directed only at the heaviest polluting countries
 -the industrialised ones - while a UK Treasury minister said in parliament
on January 15 that Britain was 'not yet convinced that a Europe-wide tax was
a necessary or appropriate response to global warming'.
Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the new EC environment commissioner, said in a
recent interview that the difficulty of getting internal agreement within
the EC, as well as with other industrialised countries, meant that proposals
for the taxes were unlikely to make much progress this year.
In the form originally proposed, the EC energy and carbon taxes had most
impact on the energy sector. However, intervention by governments in their
power generation markets, such as the present UK coal review, could impede
the working of the tax.
The UK parliamentary select committee on the environment last week argued
that a carbon tax would be of little use in persuading electricity
generators to switch to cleaner fuels if the UK government was proposing to
subsidise coal.
The US decision has removed the European fear of competitive disadvantage.
However, any hopes that this will speed up European negotiations may be
premature.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Personal tax deductions would no longer be available for executives paid
more than Dollars 1m a year.  Club dues would cease to be tax-deductible.
Only half the cost of business meals and entertainment would be
tax-deductible, down from 80 per cent.
Lobbying expenses would no longer be allowable against tax, hitting one of
Washington's most active industries.  Extra tax yield by 1998: Dollars 978m.
A package of measures to encourage investment in real estate would cost
Dollars 5.5bn in the next six years.  Most of this would come from a
permanent extension of tax relief on mortgage revenue bonds, though there
are also proposals to modify tax rules governing real estate investment by
pension funds, among others.
A temporary investment tax credit would be available to large companies for
1993 and 1994, while companies with a turnover of less than Dollars 5m a
year would get a permanent tax credit.  The package is expected to cost
Dollars 9bn next year.
Further measures to encourage businesses to invest would include a permanent
extension of the tax credit for research and experimentation (tax cost this
year: nearly Dollars 1bn) and a modest extension of depreciation allowances
(at a total cost of Dollars 1.6bn over five years).
Investments in small businesses (those worth Dollars 25m or less) would
qualify fir a 50 per cent capital gains tax exemption, provided they were
held for at least five years.
A tax credit available to companies operating in US possessions would be cut
back, affecting mainly pharmaceuticals companies and other manufacturers
operating in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.  These companies would
between them pay Dollars 7bn more in taxes by the end of 1998.
Securities dealers would have to adjust their inventories of securities to
market prices for tax purposes, forcing them to recognise book profits.
This tax on Wall Street would bring in more than Dollars 1bm a year once it
is fully phased in, from 1995.

<TEXT>
JAPANESE and European business and political leaders yesterday gave a warm
welcome to President Bill Clinton's plans to cut the US federal budget
deficit.
Mr Yohei Kono, Japanese cabinet secretary and acting foreign minister, said:
'I sincerely hope the US will renew itself. This is the first US president
to ask the American people to share the pain.'
Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner, called the package
'encouraging and full of promise' - the most serious effort in years to
tackle the federal deficit.
Mr Martin Wassel, economics director of the International Chamber of
Commerce in Paris, said: 'Clearly America had to tackle these deficits.
There may be a weakening in growth prospects in the short-term but in the
longer term it will be healthy for the US and the world economy.'
The European Commission yesterday also set aside worries that the package
could postpone a US-led world economic recovery.
Mr Christophersen singled out for praise Mr Clinton's short-term stimulus
aimed at creating 500,000 jobs by 1994, through a temporary investment tax
credit and accelerated public spending on housing, infrastructure and
education. These measures were similar to the EC's growth package combining
incentives for public and private investment, he said.
Despite the initial welcome, some EC officials expressed disappointment that
Mr Clinton had failed to use his State of the Union address to endorse the
Commission's call for an early summit of the Group of Seven industrialised
nations to promote world growth.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC external economic relations commissioner, welcomed Mr
Clinton's commitment to successful completion of the Uruguay Round, which he
said he had expected after his talks with US officials in Washington last
week. But in a speech to a local Conservative party meeting in England,
copies of which were issued to the press, Sir Leon said a period of
turbulence lay ahead before a Gatt deal was clinched.
In spite of the plan's welcome in Japan, it is bound to add to pressure on
the country to open up its markets more and cut its ballooning trade surplus
with the US.
Tokyo has been pressing the US to cut the federal deficit for the past four
years through the long-running Structural Impediments Initiative talks,
insisting this was essential to cut the Japanese trade surplus with the US.
Mr Clinton's promise to cut the deficit will also add pressure on Japan to
bring forward a special package of measures to stimulate its depressed
economy and increase demand for imports.
A senior official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said
the combination of deficit reduction and subsidies for industrial research
and development would help boost the competitiveness of US industry.
Business leaders acknowledged Japan would soon face increasing pressure to
respond to the Clinton plan. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, head of the Keidanren, the
largest employers' association, said Japan should contribute to the stable
growth of the world economy through expanding domestic demand and opening
its markets.

FT  19 FEB 93 / The Clinton Economic Plan: Administration presses for a
minimum of amendments - Congress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has called on Congress to deal with his economic
programme as a complete package, instead of picking apart each component.
'I ask you all to begin by resisting the temptation to focus only on a
particular spending cut you don't like or some particular investment that
wasn't made,' Mr Clinton implored in his speech to both houses of Congress
on Wednesday night. But the legislative realities could mean that this will
be difficult to achieve.
The current strategy is to pass a package of immediate spending measures,
intended to boost the economy in the short term, in the form of a
supplemental appropriations bill. Congressional leaders hope they will be
able to get this through House and Senate committees in four to five weeks.
All of the tax measures proposed by Mr Clinton would then be rolled together
into a budget proposal, to be laid before Congress by the administration on
March 23, and pushed through in the form of a budget reconciliation bill.
Some members of congress had favoured attaching at least some of the
proposals to a bill to raise the legal limit on the federal debt - which
must pass sometime before the end of March, when the current Dollars 4,145bn
(Pounds 2,871bn) ceiling will be breached.
But this bill, as well as legislation to extend benefits for those who have
been unemployed for a long time, is expected to be passed 'clean', without
extraneous amendments.
President Clinton also called in his speech on Wednesday for a number of
other legislative items, including gun control, tougher measures against
crime, campaign finance reform, curbs on lobbyists and easier voting
registration.
Democratic leaders hope they can begin hearings on the reconciliation bill
at the end of March and start to mark it up in detail at the end of April.
The goal is to have it passed and sent to President Clinton for signature
before Congress goes on holiday in August - though many congressional
staffers believe they will be lucky to complete the bill before the autumn.
Congressman Richard Gephardt, the leader of the House Democratic majority,
is understood to want to add in to this bill the comprehensive reform of the
healthcare system that Mr Clinton has promised to produce by May. Many
others in Congress believe a healthcare reform package will, realistically,
not be completed until next year.
One fear for the package is that members of Congress could amend it to
death, adding their favourite tax provisions and exemptions.
The House ways and means committee, which has primary jurisdiction over tax
legislation, is expected to remain relatively disciplined. Members who want
to propose amendments that will cost money must simultaneously propose
offsetting spending cuts to pay for them.
Once it gets to the Senate, the legislation could become more difficult,
even though budget rules, which are tighter than usual senate rules, allow
only germane amendments.
'There are a zillion tax proposals sitting over there, many of which are
plain mischievous,' a House staffer said.

FT  19 FEB 93 / The Clinton Economic Plan: A speech to have them rocking in
the aisles - Presidential rhetoric and flair attract wide support and leave
the Republicans floundering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RONALD REAGAN did not like it, Ross Perot thought is was 'excellent' but a
little short on detail, Jack Kemp, sitting in the middle, loved its
'rhetoric and goals' but was sure it would not work and Paul Tsongas happily
confessed that 'the person giving it is not the man I campaigned against'.
Some of Washington's most conspicuous pundits, ever grudging in their
praise, conceded it served a purpose.
According to two overnight polls, three quarters of those surveyed approved
its proposals, six out of ten 'enthusiastically'. One local TV station,
camped in an old people's home, reported universal admiration and a
willingness to contribute. A Washington Post editorial judged it 'well
balanced and sturdy'.
The joint session of Congress and assorted dignitaries - with Mr Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, accorded the singular seat of
honour between Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mrs Tipper Gore - interrupted
it with applause no fewer than 75 times, probably a modern record. The fact
that it featured the first Democrat to give a State of the Union address in
13 years is only partial explanation.
It is hard to recall Mr Bill Clinton writing or delivering a better speech.
He looked presidential, spoke well and pulled off the formidable trick of
simultaneously engaging his audiences in Congress and watching on
television.
There were several high spots, starting with the rhetorical call to arms.
'If we do not act now,' he proclaimed, 'you will not recognise this country
ten years from now.' And again: 'The test of our programme cannot simply be;
what's in it for me? The question must be: what's in it for us?' This
probably explained why Mr Reagan, writing in the New York Times in advance
of the speech, dismissed it as a repeat of 'the failed liberal policies of
the past'.
Mr Clinton also cleverly engaged the Republican party, first by declining to
blame it for anything and second by challenging it to improve his proposals.
'I did not seek this office to place blame. I come here to accept
responsibility. and I want you to accept responsibility with me. If we do
right by this country, I do not care who gets the credit for it.'
Anticipating the predictable 'tax and spend' Republican riposte delivered
later by Congressman Bob Michel, the House minority leader, the president
had them rocking in the aisles when he declared 'all those who say we should
cut more should be as specific as I have been'.
When Republicans guffawed at his assertion that the Congressional Budget
Office figures were 'independent', Mr Clinton was ready: 'Well, you can
laugh, my fellow Republicans, but I'll point out that the CBO was normally
more conservative in what was going to happen and closer to right than
previous presi-dents have been.' The aisles rocked again.
The Republicans, therefore, have been served notice to come up with some
alternatives; no easy process for a party deeply riven by its own
ideological battles. Pretty much all Mr Michel could say, apart from
defending the economic policies of Mr Reagan and Mr George Bush, was that
his party would be listening to the voices of the people.
But Mr Perot, who can reasonably lay claim to have his finger on the
nation's pulse and who was personally briefed in advance by Mr Clinton,
said: 'I expect the American people will react very favourably' and would
not object to paying higher taxes if they were fair. The president could
have expected no more for the moment.
Mr Perot's only aphoristic admonition was to Congress, which also suits the
president well. Noting that 'the president does not pass laws,' Mr Perot
said that 'giving Congress money is like giving your friend who is trying to
stop drinking a liquor store'.
A lot of the drinking in Washington is, of course, done by lobbyists, whom
Mr Clinton duly threatened by calling for a bill ending lobbying tax
deductions and enforcing stricter registration.
Undeterred, however, some were quick to throw down their own gauntlets, with
their congressional allies voicing support. Thus both Mr John Sturdivant,
represent-ing government workers, and Congress-man Steny Hoyer, the Democrat
from Maryland who heads the subcommittee handling the federal workforce,
said Mr Clinton's proposal to freeze federal pay was 'unacceptable' and
would be dropped.
But such storm clouds could not take much away from Mr Clinton on a night
when he was firing on all cylinders. Last night, far removed from the
grandeur of the chamber of the House, he was bedding down in the extreme
modesty of the Comfort Inn in Chillicothe, Ohio, which will not have a
presidential suite and where rooms normally go for around Dollars 30 (Pounds
21) a night. This symbolism is just as important.

FT  19 FEB 93 / The Clinton Economic Plan: Soaring costs that have to be
tamed - Healthcare
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's economic plan was like a book with a missing
chapter.
All efforts to revive the economy would fail, Mr Clinton warned in the most
moving passage of his address to Congress, if the country failed to take
bold steps to reform the healthcare system.
He said the nation already spent 30 per cent more of national income on
healthcare than any other industrial country, yet was unique in failing to
provide a basic package of benefits to all citizens. On present trends,
healthcare would absorb 20 per cent of the economy by the year 2000.
The figures released this week showed that the planned halving of the budget
deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product by fiscal 1997 would
represent only a temporary fiscal victory if healthcare is not reformed.
Double-digit increases in spending on federal health programmes would result
in steep rises in the deficit by the end of the decade.
But while identifying the nation's most pressing economic problem, Mr
Clinton is not yet in a position to give a clear indication of the type of
solution the administration will recommend. Wednesday's plan imposed some
relatively minor new curbs on payments to doctors and hospitals under the
Medicare and Medicaid programmes for the elderly and poor and increased
funding for a variety of preventive health programmes such as children's
immunisations.
But a full-scale restructuring of healthcare awaits the findings of the
presidential task force headed by Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton. It is expected
to make recommendations by May.
The centrepiece of the reform is expected to be some version of a system
known as 'managed competition'. Mr Clinton has indicated that he wants
people to be grouped into large healthcare purchasing co-operatives that
could negotiate good quality and cost-effective care from competing
providers in the private sector.
At issue is the degree to which such institutions would be subject to direct
regulations. The administration is examining the feasibility of various more
direct controls on the price and volume of services that hospitals and
doctors can provide.
One option would be to extend regulations now applying to federal schemes to
the private sector.
But any changes are likely to provoke strong opposition, if only because
cost controls in effect mean controls on the incomes of physicians,
hospitals, insurance companies and drug companies, all of which are well
represented by Washington lobbyists.
In the short run, there is no prospect of cost controls saving money.
Indeed, fears are growing that the planned extension of health care benefits
to the 37m Americans without insurance cannot be financed without a new wave
of tax increases of between Dollars 30bn and Dollars 90bn (Pounds 21bn and
Pounds 63bn).
Companies fear that directly or indirectly they will be asked to pick up a
large chunk of the costs of extending insurance.
But until Mr Clinton writes the healthcare chapter of his reform, his
economic package remains an unfinished work, lacking full credibility.

FT  19 FEB 93 / The Clinton Economic Plan: Deficit reduction package puzzles
analysts - Defence Spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's deficit reduction package includes substantial
savings on defence spending over the next five years, but military analysts
are puzzled by the details of the defence budget plan.
Mr Clinton proposes a steady decline in defence budget authority from
Dollars 274.3bn (Pounds 193.1bn) in the current fiscal year to Dollars
263.7bn in 1994 and Dollars 248.4bn in 1997, rising again to Dollars 254.2bn
in 1998.
Over the five years from 1994 to 1998, this plan would cut a cumulative
total of Dollars 127bn from the defence budget projections of former
President George Bush.
But the Bush spending plan, according to a report by the General Accounting
Office, does not recognise additional expenses of over Dollars 35bn in
potential weapons systems overruns, Dollars 12bn resulting from Congress
delaying programme cancellations, Dollars 5.4bn for industrial conversion
and Dollars 24.5bn for cleaning up hazardous waste on defence property. It
also assumes Dollars 53bn in management savings, most of which the GAO says
may not be achieved.
With little time to produce a complete budget proposal, Mr Les Aspin, the
new secretary of defence, appears to have done exactly what he used to
complain about when he was chairman of the House of Representatives armed
services committee. Instead of building a US defence plan from the bottom
up, he has simply cut from the existing pattern, in effect asking each
service to come up with a specified amount of savings, rather than radically
reviewing each branch's size and roles.
This approach, which remains to be fleshed out with details of the specific
weapons programmes that are to be cut, seems likely to reduce the US armed
forces to around 1.4m people, 200,000 less than projected under the Bush
plan.
Some outside groups that have proposed a more fundamental reassessment of
the structure of the US armed forces believe this year's budget is a timid
first step.
'This is the first chance of a new administration coming in after the end of
the Cold War to make real changes, and they are not even attempting it; they
are tinkering around the edges,' said Mr Marcus Corbin, a budget analyst at
the Centre for Defence Information, a defence policy group founded by
retired military officers.
With more time, Mr Aspin may prepare a more root and branch review for next
year's budget, but some wonder whether the administration will by then have
lost momentum and missed the chance for substantial defence revisions.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Ron Brown, commerce secretary, yesterday set off to promote the
president's plan in speeches in New York and Chicago with 'a big smile on my
face'.
The Commerce Department is a winner from the spending and cuts package
proposed by President Bill Clinton to spur US technology and manufacturing
competitiveness.
Mr Brown told Chase Manhattan's technical centre in Brooklyn, New York, that
the reaction to Mr Clinton's night speech unveiling the plan 'makes me know
that we are on the right track'.
He said creating more jobs was a primary goal of the Clinton administration.
Tax benefits for corporations in high technology investment would help
achieve that, especially among small businesses, he added. He noted that
small businesses accounted for most American jobs, but did not say how the
package would help big corporations, which have been cutting their payrolls.
He described the speech as 'a call to arms. . . ,' saying it was 'a bold
approach, an honest approach.' Mr Brown said that while there were some
battles ahead, he thought the package would be enacted.
In the short-term, his department will get Dollars 358m (Pounds 252m),
including Dollars 117m for advanced technology and computer programmes,
Dollars 81m for modernisation of the weather service, and Dollars 94m for
economic development.
Another Dollars 64m will go to the development of telecommunications
'superhighways' - a pet project of Vice-President Al Gore - which would
establish computer networks between libraries, foundations, businesses and
individuals.
For the first time, the department will get sufficient funding to support
the concept private-public sector partnerships. It will increase the number
of 'manufacturing technology centres' from seven to more than 100. These
will spread the benefits from the department's advanced technology
programme, a scheme of matching grants to promote research and development.
The department will get Dollars 80m for its role in defence conversion - in
addition to Dollars 50m already planned - from the Pentagon.
It will lose Dollars 6m from the export control programme which helps to
curb nuclear and chemical weapon proliferation. Another Dollars 65m will be
cut from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

<TEXT>
The latest joke from New York is that the new definition of the wealthy is
anyone who isn't homeless.
 -Mr Mike Cowan, chief administrative officer at Merrill Lynch in London
I'm a Republican, but this represents an honest attempt to deal with the
underlying problems of the US. I'm going to be a loser and so are most of
the other people I know, but I live pretty well.
 - Mr Edward Streator, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in
London
I'm not all that upset about the increase. Living in the UK for a year and a
half I realise that we Americans have had a very low rate of tax in the
past. - Mr Bruce Lassman, head of the US tax desk at accountants Ernst &amp;
Young in London
I'm a supporter of Clinton and I always felt tax increases were necessary.
For 12 years we've been getting away from the social problems, the
homelessness. . . state health care has to be improved, the deficit has to
be attacked and I think Americans will accept that.
 - Mr Jeff Burke, who works for a US investment bank in London
I'm concerned about tax, but you have to strike a balance between taxes and
spending. In the past 12 years the administration has done nothing to help
the distribution of wealth. These are bold steps.
 - Mr Joseph V. Missett, who moved to London to trade crude oil
It will affect me deeply. I'm shattered. We're already paying high taxes -
I'm paying at least 31 per cent.
 - Marianne, a currency trader in New York

FT  19 FEB 93 / Japan closer to an enhanced UN role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN may become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council
after a wide-ranging review of the Council's structure, Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, UN secretary-general, said yesterday.
'There is a lot of possibility of Japan having a permanent seat, but it is a
decision of the member states,' Mr Boutros Ghali said at the end of a
four-day visit to Japan.
The country's case for a permanent seat was also backed by Chancellor Helmut
Kohl of Germany, who begins a visit to Tokyo in a week's time.
Mr Kohl told a Japanese television interviewer that it was natural that
Japan should become a permanent member, following changes to the make-up of
the Council, to reflect the rise of Asian economic power.
Germany itself is seeking a permanent seat on the Council.
Mr Boutros Ghali's comments may well rekindle debate over reform of the
Security Council, which has 15 members and five permanent members. The UN is
canvassing its 180 members their views on the subject.
Any reform must be backed by the five permanent members, at least nine of
the overall membership, and two-thirds of the General Assembly.
It could, however, be subject to a veto, perhaps from Britain or France,
neither of which is enthusiastic about Japanese permanent membership. It
might also open up a flood of applicants from other states claiming such
status.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, recently supported reform of
the Council through agreement among its members, which would allow Japan a
permanent seat.
His remarks provoked a sharp response from the British government, a
permanent member, which is concerned it may lose its seat under a
restructuring.
Mr Boutros Ghali seemed intent on wooing Japan, partly because a greater
Japanese involvement in the UN might ease some of the organisation's
financial pressures.
The secretary-general said he would welcome Japanese peacekeepers as part of
the UN operations in Mozambique, as a step towards Japan deepening its
involvement with the organisation.
Japan's involvement in peacekeeping activities was not, however, a
precondition for it gaining a permanent Security Council seat. Japan's first
peace-keeping unit took up its post in Cambodia last September, after years
of agonising over whether such a role was appropriate under a pacifist
constitution.

FT  19 FEB 93 / 'Woman of Fashion' sells for Dollars 1.98m: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'LA MONDAINE', or 'The Woman of Fashion', by James Jacques Joseph Tissot,
depicting a girl at a smart party being helped out of her fur coat by her
elderly lover, sold for Dollars 1,982,650 (Pounds 1.38m) at Sotheby's in New
York on Wednesday, an auction record for the 19th-century French artist.
It was one of the 15 'Women of Paris' paintings Tissot completed in the
1870s, portraying the self-confident 'New Woman' of the Third Republic: the
young girl at the centre of the painting boldly holds the gaze of the
viewer.
The picture came from the collection of the Toronto industrialists Joey and
Toby Tanenbaum, selling near the top of its estimate.
Two other paintings from the series were also sold by the Tanenbaums. 'Sans
Dot' ('Without Dowry') shows a young widow in black offering herself for
inspection in a park, and went well below its Dollars 1.2m-Dollars 1.8m
estimate, at Dollars 882,500. 'The Sphinx', an inscrutable young woman on a
couch, fetched the same sum, also selling below target.
Obviously, Sotheby's was expecting too much from a still convalescent art
market.
Even so, with a sale totalling Dollars 10.2m and only 15 per cent unsold, it
will be pleased with one of the first big art auctions of 1993, and one in
which successful bidders now have to pay a 15 per cent premium, instead of
10 per cent, on top of the hammer price.
A record price of Dollars 800,000 (way above the top estimate of Dollars
360,000) was paid for 'The Mirror' by the British artist Sir Frank Dicksee.
It was bought by the London dealer Macconall-Mason who advises Sir Andrew
Lloyd Webber, the leading buyer of Victorian art. It shows a young girl
staring at herself in a hand mirror.
Belle-Epoque and orientalist pictures did best in a sale of pictures likely
to appeal to first-time buyers enjoying a revival in the US economy.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Kuwaiti MPs open a magic cave: National assembly flexes its
muscles over foreign investments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the first time in Kuwait's history, a small group of elected
representatives will examine the state's books.
Under a law formally promulgated in Kuwait last week, all state-owned
companies and investment organisations, must now pass their accounts to the
auditor general. He must then pass them to a committee of Kuwaiti MPs.
The law, which will also toughen penalties for misuse of public funds, is
likened by its drafter, Mr Hamad al-Jouan, chairman of the National
Assembly's legislative committee, to the secret word with which Ali Baba
opened the magic cave. 'With this law we have invented our secret word for
that cave to open.'
The cave, of course, contains Kuwait's rich - if these days diminished and
scandal-tarnished - trove of overseas investments, most of which are managed
by the London-based Kuwait Investment Office. 'Since the earliest days of
democracy in Kuwait, people have been asking what KIO was doing,' says Mr
al-Jouan. 'But parliament has never had the strength to make such a law a
reality'.
That changed last October, when Kuwait's 84,000 eligible voters returned
what many of the 50 elected MPs consider to be the Gulf state's most
powerful National Assembly ever - and certainly the most powerful assembly
in the Gulf. In three-and-a-half months, the assembly has mandated
parliamentary scrutiny of the state's accounts, and embarked on an unsparing
examination of what went wrong in the days leading up to the Iraqi invasion
in August 1990. Next it wants a decisive say in determining economic
policies.
In a country which has seen almost as many suspended parliaments as sitting
assemblies since the 1962 constitution came into force, MPs finally appear
to have won a measure of real governing power.
This is not a development which will bring hails of joy in neighbouring
capitals, where vaunted steps towards wider political participation more
closely resemble a reluctant shuffle.
Nor is it entirely to the liking of the ruling al-Sabah family. However,
since their return to liberated Kuwait in 1991, they have had little choice
but to accommodate a profoundly changed public mood.
In part, this reflects anger at the way the al-Sabah handled the crisis
before the invasion, and its indecision afterwards. However, increasingly,
it reflects growing suspicion that al-Sabah hands have not been the safest
for guaranteeing the security of Kuwait's endowment to its future
generations: being its foreign investment bounty.
The emergence since the end of the Gulf war of a stream of embarrassing
revelations about Kuwait's overseas investments, which topped Dollars 100bn
(Pounds 69bn) before the Gulf war, not only helped sweep an opposition
majority into the National Assembly, but gave the new MPs a considerable
lever over the ruling family.
It already appears that some members of the al-Sabah family may face
prosecution for their part in the Dollars 4bn losses of Grupo Torras, KIO's
Spanish holding company.
Meanwhile, Kuwait's public prosecutor is helping to prepare a criminal law
suit against former KIO executives in London.
'This affair runs very deep,' says one western diplomat.
The government has said it will do its utmost to uncover and punish all
wrongdoing at KIO - whatever the family names of anyone found guilty. It has
also agreed to allow the assembly freedom to conduct its own investigations.
But if the al-Sabah have agreed to cede some of their governing power to the
National Assembly, the parliament in its turn appears to have come to an
understanding with the 'political leadership' in the family.
In the words of one eminent MP: 'We're saying give us more power to
supervise our wealth and our future, and in return, the government can look
after the investigation and punishment of its own.'
This, in essence, appears to be the deal being cut between Kuwait's
assertive new parliament and its ruling family.
'The National Assembly understands our ruling family very well,' says Mr
al-Shatte. 'It also remembers the suspensions of previous parliaments, and
we have decided not to push affairs to a confrontation'. But he adds
something of a warning. 'We will also not accept mistakes by important
people which could be considered crimes.'
Kuwait lives in too unstable a region to wish to damage entirely the
credibility of its rulers.
As a local diplomat says: 'Whatever internal conflicts there may be here,
there is unity towards the outside world. And there has to be.'

FT  19 FEB 93 / Government buys time until snow melts: Tajikistan's old
guard is trying to confront economic ills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVING quieted its civil war, the ex-Soviet Tajikistan government is trying
to arrest the republic's devastating economic decline, and exploit its oil,
gold and cotton.
But success is far from assured, hinging on whether Islamic-dominated
opposition forces, now trapped behind deep winter snows, will regroup in the
spring.
In a promising region with largely untapped natural gas and oil reserves,
the ramifications of new fighting go far - Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and Tajikistan's neighbours are more worried than ever that instability will
spill over their borders.
The chief source of their anxiety is the presence of thousands of Tajik
fighters in rebel training camps in Afghanistan, who are expected to try to
return home in the spring. Already, hundreds of fighters and thousands of
arms have come over the border.
Against this backdrop, Mr Imamali Rakhmanov, the Tajik leader, is leading a
Commonwealth of Independent States' effort to hold the line against upheaval
in otherwise quiet, conservative Central Asia. His Commonwealth allies are
providing prodigious military assistance.
'If we manage to seal the border and stop the weapons coming from
Afghanistan for one or two months,' Mr Rakhmanov said, 'we'll be able to
manage our other problems.'
Two years ago, rigid communism in Tajikistan began to give way to a
democratic and Islamic state. But a year ago the Soviet Union collapsed, and
in its poorest republic a series of coups, counter-coups and civil war
ensued. The trouble shattered the nation of 5m people, tucked between China,
Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. About 7 per cent of the population, or 350,000
people, were displaced, with about a quarter of them fleeing to Afghanistan.
In November, the tide turned. The old-guard Soviet leadership reasserted
itself, crushed its Islamic-dominated enemies, and by December retook power
in the capital of Dushanbe. Today, the civil war is calmed, and the
government is conducting operations to try to finish off its opponents.
Assistance has been provided by those who, like Tajikistan's old communists,
have the most to gain. Both Uzbekistan and Russia deny any combat role in
Tajikistan. But military officials, diplomats and independent foreign
observers, say both republics have been on the front line with Tajik forces.
Mr Rakhmanov considers the Tajik opposition forces the greatest threat to
his government's efforts to reverse an economic decline that, next to
Armenia's, is the ex-Soviet Union's worst.
The year of fighting prevented the harvest of 70 per cent of the 1992-93
cotton crop, or 600,000 tonnes, costing a potential Dollars 200m (Pounds
138m) in foreign exchange, according to the government. The instability,
plus a shortage of material and spare parts, reduced aluminium production in
the last year by one-third, to 340,000 tonnes from the expected output of
500,000 tonnes; which cost Tajikistan Dollars 170m in potential foreign
exchange. Wheat was not planted at all in the autumn, and light industry
closed down entirely eight months ago in southern Tajikistan. Mr Rakhmanov,
however, talks of building up a prosperous republic.
The first foreign deal has been with the American company Kerry Energy.
Kerry has won a Dollars 32m contract to refurbish oil wells and build a
refinery in Tajikistan's industrial north, between Kenibadan and Isfaran.
The deal is meant to restore Tajikistan's Soviet-era oil production of 400m
tonnes a year, from its current output of 40m tonnes, and then to develop
new reserves.
Much of the rest still must be proven. Satellite photographs indicate other
oil and natural gas deposits in southern Tajikistan, Mr Rakhmanov said, and
silver deposits are also being explored. Iron ore has been found in
Leninabad - one field contains 60m tonnes - and gold deposits are being
examined at Penjikent. Tajikistan also plans to plant an additional 1.6m
hectares to cotton.
However, few people believe that anyone can seal the porous border with
Afghanistan. and most observers expect the war to rage again in the spring.
Still, Mr Rakhmanov - and his Commonwealth allies - plan to try.
'This is the anointed government. Every one wants this government to work,'
said a diplomat in Dushanbe. 'If they can bring these fighters under
control, they will have the thing wrapped up.'

THE new US envoy to the Bosnian peace talks, Mr Reginald Bartholomew, said
yesterday the US did not want to replace the Vance-Owen efforts to broker a
settlement, but to contribute to a solution.
He gave this assurance after his first meeting with Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord
Owen, the international mediators on the former Yugoslavia. He spent two
hours in intensive discussions on the Vance-Owen plan for dividing Bosnia
into 10 largely autonomous provinces.
'We are not here to supplant the process,' Mr Bartholomew said afterwards.
His remarks confirmed the impression given by Mr Warren Christopher, the US
secretary of state, when he announced Washington's new policy on Bosnia last
week, that the US did not have a ready-made alternative to the Vance-Owen
plan, in spite of its reservations about certain of its provisions.
Mr Bartholomew had talks last week in Moscow, during which Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, underlined his support for the
Vance-Owen plan.
The US envoy is not expected to propose any major modifications in their
plan. But it is probable he will join them in proposing some modest changes
to their proposed map, so as to make the provincial boundaries more
acceptable to the Bosnian Moslems.
Mr Vitaly Churkin, the new Russian envoy to the Bosnian peace talks, was due
to meet the international mediators, including Mr Bartholomew, later in the
day. But there was no sign that representatives of the warring parties,
except Mr Mate Boban, the Bosnian Croat leader, were ready to resume the
talks, which were in abeyance pending last week's US policy announcement.
Bosnia's Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic is due to visit Washington at
the weekend but has not announced firm plans to go to New York. It is
understood that US officials will try to persuade him to resume his
participation in the peace talks as soon as possible. Mr Radovan Karadzic,
leader of the Bosnian Serbs, has declined to rejoin the talks in the absence
of Mr Izetbegovic.

MITSUBISHI Heavy Industries yesterday became the latest Japanese company to
announce a big cut in its workforce in response to the worsening Japanese
economy.
The company, Japan's largest heavy machinery manufacturer, said it would
reduce the number of employees at its Mihama plant in Hiroshima by about 10
per cent, or close to 400 workers, to meet an equivalent fall in demand for
products made at the plant.
Last autumn, the company sent a number of employees working at its
machine-tool plants temporarily to Mitsubishi Motors, a fellow member of the
group.
Mitsubishi Heavy said it aims to curtail its Mihama workforce over two years
through natural wastage, reduction in graduate intake, and by transferring
staff to affiliated companies.
The move highlights the spreading impact of the slowdown in Japan's economy
on the nation's workforce.
The downturn has not yet led to huge redundancies, but Japanese companies
have been encouraging older employees to retire early, transferring staff to
affiliated companies and restricting the intake of graduates.

GENERAL Philippe Morillon, French head of the United Nations protection
force for aid convoys in Bosnia, yesterday ordered his troops to go ahead
and deliver emergency supplies to a besieged Moslem enclave in eastern
Bosnia - regardless of suspension of relief operations by the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees.
The UNHCR in Belgrade welcomed the efforts of Gen Morillon. 'If he gets
through it will be good news for the people of Gorazde,' said Ms Judith
Kumin, head of the Belgrade UNHCR office.
Diplomats said the independent initiative of Gen Morillon reflected possible
splits between the UNHCR and some of the national contingents of the UN
peacekeeping forces. One diplomat described Gen Morillon as a 'loose
cannon'.
UN forces on the ground in Sarajevo were reportedly stunned by the decision
on Wednesday of Mrs Sadako Ogata, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, to
halt relief operations in all Serb-held parts of Bosnia and air and land
convoys to Sarajevo.
Serb commanders yesterday pledged to allow a convoy to travel to Gorazde
today after Gen Morillon met Bosnian Serb commanders in Rogatica, about 30
miles north of Gorazde.
Gen Morillon promised Serbs that the road to Gorazde would be repaired,
according to the UNHCR Belgrade office.
Eight UNHCR convoys over the past four months have reached the mainly Moslem
Gorazde, in a Serb stranglehold since war erupted in April.
UNHCR officials yesterday said warehouses in Sarajevo, which are at
capacity, would be unlocked in an attempt to provide food for some 380,000
people trapped in the Bosnian capital. The Bosnian government last week said
Sarajevo would refuse further aid shipments until the UNHCR succeeded in
reaching some 100,000 Moslems besieged in eastern Bosnia, some without
outside relief since the war began.
Bosnian Serb commanders have repeatedly refused to allow the passage of UN
humanitarian relief for Moslem enclaves.
Serb commanders for four days this week stopped another convoy bound for
Cerska, eastern Bosnia, because of fighting in the region.

<TEXT>
HONG KONG'S business community was last night taken by surprise when Mr
Richard Allen, the man who has overseen the construction of Hong Kong's new
airport for the past two years, was replaced as chief executive of the
Provisional Airport Authority (PAA), Simon Holberton writes from Hong Kong.
The PAA said that Mr Allen would be succeeded as chief executive today by Mr
Hank Townsend, a senior executive of Bechtel Corporation. Mr Townsend was
until recently an adviser to the Hong Kong government on its HKDollars 175bn
(Pounds 16bn) airport and related infrastructure projects.
After a meeting of the board of the PAA, the authority released a statement
saying Mr Allen was leaving by mutual agreement. In two years Mr Allen built
up the PAA from nothing to an organisation employing 200 people. He was seen
as less successful in building harmonious relationships with the PAA's
contractors.
The airport project, expected to cost in excess of HKDollars 60bn, has been
dogged by the long-running dispute between Britain and China about the
colony's political development. This row has cast doubt over the PAA's
ability to complete the project before Hong Kong reverts to Chinese
sovereignty in 1997.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Economists take control until the snow melts: Old guard
confronts Tajikistan's economic ills during a lull in fighting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVING quieted its civil war, the ex-Soviet Tajikistan government has
embarked on an ambitious economic programme, including oil, gold and cotton
projects. But success is far from assured, hinging on whether
Islamic-dominated opposition forces, now trapped behind deep winter snows,
will regroup in spring.
In a promising region with largely untapped natural gas and oil reserves,
the ramifications of new fighting go far - Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and Tajikistan's neighbours are more worried than ever that instability will
spill over their borders.
The chief source of their anxiety is the presence of thousands of Tajik
fighters in rebel training camps in Afghanistan, who are expected to try to
return home in spring. Already, hundreds of fighters and thousands of arms
have come over the border.
Against this backdrop, Tajikistan leader Imamali Rakhmanov is leading a
Commonwealth of Independent States' effort to hold the line against upheaval
in otherwise quiet, conservative Central Asia. But he is not doing it alone.
His Commonwealth allies are providing prodigious military assistance.
'If we manage to seal the border and stop the weapons coming from
Afghanistan for one or two months,' Mr Rakhmanov said in an interview,
'we'll be able to manage our other problems.'
Two years ago, rigid communism in Tajikistan began to give way to a
democratic and Islamic state. But a year ago the Soviet Union collapsed, and
in its poorest republic a series of coups, counter-coups and civil war
ensued. The trouble shattered the nation of 5m people, tucked between China,
Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. About 7 per cent of the population, or 350,000
people, were displaced, with about a quarter of them fleeing to Afghanistan.
In November, the tide turned. The old-guard Soviet leadership reasserted
itself, crushed its Islamic-dominated enemies, and by December retook power
in the capital of Dushanbe. Today, the civil war is calmed, and the
government is conducting small operations to try to finish off its
opponents.
Assistance has been provided by those who, like Tajikistan's old communists,
have the most to gain. Both Uzbekistan and Russia deny any combat role in
Tajikistan. But military and diplomatic sources, and independent foreign
observers, say both republics have been on the front line with Tajik forces.
According to these sources, since October, Uzbekistan has sent MiG and Sukoy
fighters and attack helicopters on numerous bombing runs on behalf of
Tajikistan's old guard. In some cases, Uzbekistan has also sent troops to
battle the Islamic-dominated forces, the sources say. Russian tank forces,
the sources say, participated in combat operations in January and this month
in opposition strongholds east of Dushanbe, at Obigarm, Rogun and Ramit
Canyon.
Russia has also agreed to send an additional 2,000 troops to seal the border
with Afghanistan. Afghan rebels have armed, trained and even led some of the
Islamic-dominated forces into battle. Right now, the opposition is
concentrated in the snowbound town of Komsomolabad and across the border in
Afghanistan, where about 5,000 Tajik opposition fighters are believed to be
awaiting the spring thaw.
Mr Rakhmanov considers these forces the greatest threat to his government's
efforts to reverse an economic decline that, next to Armenia's, is the
ex-Soviet Union's worst.
The year of fighting prevented the harvest of 70 per cent of the 1992-93
cotton crop, or 600,000 tonnes, costing a potential Dollars 200m (Pounds
138m) in foreign exchange, according to the government. The instability,
plus a shortage of material and spare parts, reduced aluminium production in
the last year by one-third, to 340,000 tonnes from the expected output of
500,000 tonnes; which cost Tajikistan Dollars 170m in potential foreign
exchange. Wheat was not planted at all in the autumn, and light industry
closed down entirely eight months ago in southern Tajikistan.
Mr Rakhmanov, however, talks of building up a prosperous republic.
The first foreign deal has been with the American company Kerry Energy.
Kerry has won a Dollars 32m contract to refurbish oil wells and build a
refinery in Tajikistan's industrial north, between Kenibadan and Isfaran.
The deal is meant to restore Tajikistan's Soviet-era oil production of 400m
tonnes a year, from its current output of 40m tonnes, and then to develop
new reserves.
Much of the rest still must be proven. Satellite photographs indicate other
oil and natural gas deposits in southern Tajikistan, Mr Rakhmanov said, and
silver deposits are also being explored. Iron ore has been found in
Leninabad - one field contains 60m tonnes - and gold deposits are being
examined at Penjikent. Tajikistan also plans to plant an additional 1.6m
hectares to cotton.
However, few people believe that anyone can seal the porous border with
Afghanistan, which runs along the Amudarya river, and most observers expect
the war to rage again in spring. Still, Mr Rakhmanov - and his Commonwealth
allies - plan to try.
'This is the anointed government. Every one wants this government to work,'
said a diplomat in Dushanbe. 'If they can bring these fighters under
control, they will have the thing wrapped up.'

The prolonged downturn has not yet led to huge redundancies, but Japanese
companies have been restructuring their workforces by encouraging older
employees to retire early, transferring staff to affiliated companies and
restricting graduate intake.
A phone hotline for employees sponsored by a group of lawyers specialising
in labour relations has received nearly 500 calls, many of them from
white-collar workers.
Japanese newspapers report that a majority of the calls to the hotline were
from manager-level employees facing pressure to take early retirement or
redundancy.
The social stigma still attached to corporations which resort to drastic
redundancies has led most companies to stress that the decision to leave is
entirely up to the individual.
IBM Japan, for example, which launched a second career programme for people
aged 50 or older, said it had no target for staff reductions, although 3,000
employees would be eligible for the financial support offered under the
programme.

in what could be an unprecedented joint operation between former Cold War
enemies, Reuter reports from Brussels.

<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S relaunched reform programme faced its first big challenge
yesterday, as the naira fell sharply against the dollar and state
governments began conceding demands for 45 per cent pay rises.
The government promised in January to trim spending and cut the budget
deficit, reduce inflation and curb money supply in an effort to put the
economy on a stable footing before the planned handover to civilian rule in
August.
At yesterday's Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) foreign exchange auction, the
dollar sold for 24.99 naira, compared with 20.56 naira at the CBN's last
sale on January 19. Bankers blamed the decline on high inflation and a
continuing shortage of foreign exchange. Fewer than 18 of the 80 banks that
bid at the Dutch auction were successful. The central bank was reverting to
the system scrapped two years ago of competitive tendering by the banks. It
has cancelled all but two of its scheduled weekly foreign exchange sales in
the past two months.
Fears the counter-inflationary policies set out in the January budget will
be undermined were raised yesterday when Lagos state administration joined
Yobe and Katsina States and gave way to 45 per cent wage claims. Other
states are expected to bow to pressure from striking employees.
Last June, the federal government announced a 45 per cent pay increase for
its staff. Union leaders have warned that further wage demands should be
expected, saying the awards should be treated as an interim measure.
Inflation at present exceeds 45 per cent.
The naira, which exchanged for more than a dollar in the early 1980s, was
devalued by 41 per cent last March to close a gap with the parallel market.
It is worth less than five cents today. In March the CBN reformed its
foreign exchange system to make itself an active participant in the market,
buying and selling foreign exchange at market rates.
Mr Ernest Shonekan, chairman of the country's transitional council, is
expected to stress the importance of keeping to budget targets when he
addresses a conference on the economy beginning in Abuja today.

<TEXT>
THE African National Congress yesterday backed away from confrontation with
the South African government over a proposed plan for multi-racial power
sharing.
The organisation's policy-making national exeuctive committee yesterday
decided to endorse the plan, which calls for a multi-party interim
government to rule until the end of the century, reversing an earlier
decision to refer the deal back to its membership for approval.
Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC Secretary General, said the decision had been
unanimous. However as he spoke in Johannesburg, Mr Chris Hani, a prominent
ANC leader and general secretary of the South African Communist Party,
contradicted him in a speech in Cape Town, saying the ANC would share power
with the National Party in a 'government of national unity' only for about
nine months - the time it would take to write a new constitution - and not
for the five years announced by Mr Ramaphosa.
Mr Ramaphosa's success at pushing the deal through the national executive
could give a boost to multi-party negotiations on a new constitution, with
the first round of talks due to take place next week. However, there are
many crucial issues which remain unresolved in the outline agreement due to
be debated in the talks, including whether power-sharing in the interim
government should be voluntary or compulsory.
Another area of dispute will be the cabinet mechanism for decision-taking:
Mr Ramaphosa insists that the majority party will dominate cabinet except in
certain limited cases where a two-thirds majority will be required.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Japan may be permanent Security Council member
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN may become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council
after a wide-ranging review of the council's structure, Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, UN secretary-general, said yesterday.
'There is a lot of possibility of Japan having a permanent seat, but it is a
decision of the member states,' Mr Boutros Ghali said at the end of a
four-day visit to Japan.
The country's case for a permanent seat was also backed by Chancellor Helmut
Kohl of Germany, who begins a visit to Tokyo in a week's time.
Mr Kohl told a Japanese television interviewer that it was natural that
Japan should become a permanent member, following changes to the make-up of
the Council, to reflect the rise of Asian economic power.
Germany itself is seeking a permanent seat on the Council.
Mr Boutros Ghali's comments are likely to rekindle the debate over reform of
the Security Council, which has 15 members and five permanent members.
The UN is in the midst of asking its 180 members their views on the subject.
Any reform would have to be supported by all five permanent members, at
least nine of the overall membership, and a two-thirds vote of the UN
General Assembly.
It could, however, be subject to a veto, perhaps from Britain or France,
neither of which is enthusiastic about Japanese permanent membership.
It might also open up a flood of applicants from other states claiming
similar status.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, recently supported reform of
the Council through agreement among its members, which would allow Japan a
permanent seat.
His remarks provoked a sharp response from the British government, a
permanent member, which is concerned it may lose its seat under a
restructuring.
Mr Boutros Ghali seemed intent on wooing Japan, partly because a greater
Japanese involvement in the UN might ease some of the organisation's
financial pressures.
The secretary-general said he would welcome Japanese peackeepers as part of
the UN's operations in Mozambique, as a step towards Japan deepening its
involvement with the organisation.
Japan's involvement in peacekeeping activities was not, however, a
precondition for it gaining a permanent Security Council seat.
Japan's first peace-keeping unit took up its post in Cambodia last
September, after years of agonising over whether such a role was appropriate
under the pacifist constitution. It is barred from combat zones.
'Those with more economic and political power have more responsibility than
others,' the secretary-general added. 'Important countries have important
responsibilities. We need more participation from major countries. Japan is
a great power and we need its participation.'
The UN's credibility would be damaged if it was seen to be too much
influenced by a single power such as the US. Japan should become more
involved in the UN's activities to reinforce its international credibility.
'If the United Nations is under the influence of one power, this is because
that country is very powerful and because other countries are not paying
enough attention to the UN.'

FT  19 FEB 93 / Output plunges amid call for national postal strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE continuing deterioration in the French economy was highlighted yesterday
by news of an unexpectedly steep 1 per cent fall in industrial output in
December compared with November.
The drop in December pushed the production index to its lowest level since
October 1988, according to INSEE, the state statistics institute.
The news came as the government yesterday stepped up efforts to try to end
the strikes and stoppages by postal workers which are creating chaos in
France's mail service.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, prime minister, said he had told Mr Emile Zuccarelli,
the post office minister, to 'do his best' to ensure that talks got under
way 'as quickly as possible.'
However, a few hours after the prime minister's remarks, union negotiators
broke off talks with the Paris post office and called for an all out postal
stoppage in the city today.
The strikes, against plans to lay off 3,000 workers, come at a sensitive
time for France's socialist government which is braced for a crushing defeat
by the conservative opposition in next month's parliamentary elections.
The socialists, battered by gloomy economic news, are anxious to prevent
further damage to the economy. A prolonged mail strike would seriously
disrupt French business, which accounts for 85 per cent of the country's
post and is already suffering in the economic slowdown.
Industrial output in December was 3.7 per cent lower than in December 1991.
Worst affected was manufacturing, with output 2.8 per cent down on November,
mainly due to a steep fall in car production.
The INSEE figures, which come little more than a month before the first
round of voting in France's parliamentary elections, have fuelled fears that
the combination of high interest rates, a strong franc and the gloomy
economic environment in Europe is intensifying pressure on French industry.
Earlier this week the Bank of France's monthly business survey suggested
that the trading climate had been even tougher in the opening weeks of this
year. The consensus in the survey was that output had fallen even further in
January than in December and that stocks had risen sharply across most areas
of French business.
Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, chairman of Rhone-Poulenc, France's flagship chemicals
company, has warned that the European economy was unlikely to recover until
1994.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Mitterrand cagey on new left alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand last night responded cautiously to the call by
Mr Michel Rocard, former prime minister and potential presidential
candidate, for a new centre-left alliance of Socialists, ecologists and
Communists after next month's parliamentary elections.
Mr Rocard, who had previously adopted a low profile in the electoral
campaign, called this week for replacement of the Socialist party by 'an
open, extrovert movement. . . gathering all those who share the values of
solidarity and the goal of progress'.
The president said on French television that 'anyone has the right to create
a new coalition' but that the first priority should be to 'reunify and
strength the existing party'.
Other senior Socialists, now steeling themselves for a humiliating election
defeat by the conservatives, welcomed Mr Rocard's initiative.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, prime minister, said he agreed with him but suggested
the momentum of the new movement should be used to help the left in the
electoral campaign.
Mr Brice Lalonde, former Socialist environment minister and now head of the
Generation Ecologie movement that has eroded Socialist support, praised the
speech as the precursor to forming a new democratic movement in France.
Mr Bernard Kouchner, the popular but non-partisan health minister, said Mr
Rocard's ideas were 'really exciting'. Liberation, the centre-left
newspaper, applauded him for his 'calculated risk' and for recognising the
changes in the French political landscape.
The response of the traditional left was more muted. Mr Laurent Fabius,
first secretary of the Socialist party, whose presidential prospects have
been clouded by his involvement in the Aids-contaminated blood scandal, said
the party's membership should decide the future of French socialism.
Mr Antoine Waechter, head of the Greens, the old-style ecologists, said his
party had 'no intention of participating in the renewal of the Socialist
party or of the left.'
The French Socialists, flagging in the opinion polls and battered by
scandals, have fallen prey to the same sort of identity crisis that beset
the Britain's Labour party in the 1980s and is now preying upon the Italian
left.
Mr Rocard's call follows months of internal debate about the French left's
prospects after the elections, with prominent figures, notably Mr Kouchner,
having already alluded to the possibility of an alliance with the
ecologists.
President Mitterrand yesterday accused Britain of disloyalty for failing to
accept the European Community's social charter, saying this was leading to
cynical exploitation of workers in member states.
Citing the case of Hoover, which is sacking 600 French workers and moving
production to Scotland where labour is cheaper, he said Britain was
encouraging a kind of competition that went against the spirit of the EC.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Tough task for Hungarian minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE may never be an auspicious moment to become Hungarian finance minister
but Mr Ivan Szabo is taking over at a particularly critical time.
His appointment followed the surprise resignation of Mr Mihaly Kupa, a
maverick technocrat who often clashed with other ministers.
Mr Szabo, a 59-year-old former engineer and industry minister, inherits an
economy bumping along the bottom after a long and deep recession. The
collapse of domestic demand and trade with east European neighbours has
caused gross domestic product to fall 18 per cent over the three years to
1992.
The influx of Dollars 4.8bn in foreign investment since reforms began and
the double-digit growth in exports to the European Community have not been
enough to power the economy. Faint signs of a recovery in industrial output
in the autumn, which had revived hope, have lost momentum.
On the day Mr Szabo was named, unemployment figures climbed to a record 13.3
per cent. Also came the embarrassing announcement that inflation rose to an
annual 25.9 per cent after a batch of Vat and price rises in January.
Political pressure on the new finance minister will mount as elections in
1994 approach. The Hungarian Democratic Forum, the governing conservative
party of prime minister Jozsef Antall, languishes around the 10 per cent
mark in the opinion polls, blamed for falling living standards.
Economic woes, and the public perception that former communists are making
fortunes as entrepreneurs, have also boosted the populist far-right.
The prime minister hopes that the moderate Mr Szabo will boost his wing of
the party and position the Forum to take credit for the economic recovery
forecast for later this year.
There is however another awkward legacy facing the new finance minister. The
International Monetary Fund is maintaining the freeze on a SDR1.14bn (Pounds
1.1bn) credit package until Hungary agrees to cut spending and reduce a
budget deficit of Ft197bn (Pounds 1.6bn) in 1992, nearly triple the target
level.
The finance ministry changed hands the week after an IMF delegation left
Budapest unconvinced of the government's commitment to curtail benefits such
as family allowances, free health care and education.
Mr Szabo moved quickly on his nomination to re-assure observers that fiscal
policy would not fundamentally change under his stewardship - indeed that
the government had to persist with unpopular measures - and that Hungary
would continue to seek agreement with the IMF.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Yeltsin plea to nation for support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S President Boris Yeltsin yesterday appealed to the nation to support
his version of a constitution if a referendum on who rules the country
becomes necessary.
Speaking on television, he outlined the constitutional agreement he is
seeking in tough negotiations with parliament on shaping the balance of
power.
However, parliament seems certain to reject his proposals because of his
demands that the government take sole charge of economic reform and control
of the central bank. They amount to a neutering of parliament, with the
added insult of taking from it the decision about a new constitution and
giving it to a constituent assembly.
Mr Yeltsin said there were forces, 'inherited from the old system and. . .
responsible for nothing', who were benefiting from the crisis' - a clear
reference to parliament, elected during the Soviet period.
He endorsed a referendum 'in which the people can have their say' as the
only way out of a power crisis if negotiations fail with the team selected
by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker.
Mr Yeltsin reminded his audience that he had tried many times to get
agreement with the Supreme Soviet on a respite from the constant power
struggle. Only when the threat of a referendum was held above their heads
did they agree to negotiate, he said.
He supported early elections, he said, once an election law had been adopted
 -with elections for parliament in the spring of next year, and for
president in the spring of 1995. 'To hold the two elections at the same time
would risk destabilisation,' he said.
The president knows, however, that he is launching an appeal for support at
a time when indifference, even disgust, with politics is running high and
when his own popularity ratings are at their lowest.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Krupp Stahl poised to close two big steel plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KRUPP STAHL, one of the best known names in the German steel industry, is
set to shut down its entire output of some steel products, with the loss of
4,000 jobs in the heart of the Ruhr industrial region. Two of its plants
face closure.
The announcement came as thousands of steelworkers demonstrated in steel
towns against imminent job losses throughout the industry and as Mr Gunter
Rexrodt, economics minister, held crisis talks with steel industry leaders
to agree a common strategy for next week's meeting of EC industry ministers
in Brussels. That meeting is meant to decide on a Community-wide plan to
reduce steel capacity.
The talks showed clear differences between Mr Rexrodt and the industry on
how far imports of cheap steel from eastern Europe should be restricted to
protect the west European industry during the restructuring process.
Krupp Stahl said that only last minute developments in talks with rival
steel producers, including Thyssen and Saarstahl, could prevent a final
decision to close its steel plants in Siegen and Hagen being taken at the
end of March.
'We are standing on the brink of closure there if there are no new
developments in the very near future,' Mr Gerhard Cromme, chairman of the
Fried. Krupp group and the newly merged Hoesch-Krupp combination, told
demonstrating steelworkers outside the Hoesch Stahl headquarters in
Dortmund, where an emergency board meeting was also under way.
Krupp Stahl, which provides almost half the turnover of the Fried. Krupp
group, said the management had concluded the only solution to the latest
steel market downturn was to give up its manufacture of steel sections such
as pipes and girders, which totalled almost 550,000 tonnes in 1991. The
company produces 3.6m tonnes of flat steel products, which would not be
affected.
The parent group has said it will decide whether to close an integrated
steel plant belonging to Hoesch Stahl in either Dortmund or
Duisburg-Rheinhausen in the next two weeks, as the company seeks a drastic
cut in its steel-making capacity. The company said last night the decision
would be taken as soon as the production and sales figures for February were
known.
The Krupp statement said final calculations on the viability of its output
of steel sections - all of which are high quality, special steels - had not
been made. It was possible that some residual activities could be kept going
during the closure process. The co-operation talks with Thyssen and
Saarstahl might also offer some relief.
It is estimated the restructuring may cost 30,000 steel jobs in west Germany
and another 10,000 in the east.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Europe's other steel industry reels: Output has halved as
markets collapse to east and west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON, CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI, NICHOLAS DENTON and PATRICK
BLUM
</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THROUGHOUT central and eastern Europe a bloated steel industry is in the
throes of a painful contraction proportionately far greater than that facing
the industry in western Europe.
Steel output in the region has virtually halved, and employment fallen by a
third, over the last three years, as a result of the collapse of military
spending and the impact of macro-economic 'shock therapy'.
Furthermore, hopes of increased sales to the west, to compensate for the
loss of the Soviet market, have been dashed by US and EC anti-dumping
measures. East European imports last year accounted for less than 3 per cent
of the EC market, despite rapid growth in the export of flat steel, pipes
and other products.
The position is likely to be exacerbated further by the latest EC proposals
to ask eastern European countries to impose minimum prices on steel exports
 -or face anti-dumping duties.
Deprived both of former artificially low Soviet energy and raw material
supplies and the demand for armaments, the steel industries of Poland,
Hungary, the Czech and Slovak republics, Romania and Bulgaria are all
involved in down-sizing and plant closures on a large scale.
Poland's steel-consuming shipbuilding industry now has full order books
until 1995 and steady economic growth is expected to resume this year, after
three traumatic years of decline, but it still plans to cut steel capacity
from the present 16m tonnes to 11m tonnes of raw steel before the turn of
the century. By then, employment will be down to 43,000 from the present
110,000, itself 50,000 down on mid-1980 levels.
The Ostrowiec and Szczecin mills are to be closed. Parts of the Batory,
Bobrek, Buczek and Bankowa plants in Silesia will also be shut down.
Meanwhile, two of the largest integrated steel plants, at Katowice and
Krakow, are to be merged into one smaller company with the installation of
modern continuous casting lines.
At present, the bulk of Polish steel comes from outdated and polluted
open-cast equipment, with only 7 per cent produced by continuous casting.
The old plant is to be replaced by electric arc furnaces and scrap-consuming
mini-mills under a Dollars 4.5bn modernisation plan.
The plan predicts that by the end of the century Polish steel exports, at 2m
tonnes, will be below the 2.5m tonnes of 1990, while imports will have risen
from 300,000 to 1.1m tonnes. Last year, Poland earned around Dollars 460m
from its steel exports, mainly to Germany and other EC markets. But the main
development was the sale of Huta Warszawa to Lucchini of Italy, which is
investing Dollars 200m in a modern strip mill to produce steel sheet for the
new Fiat car plants in Poland.
With plenty of indigenous coal supplies, but little iron ore, the east and
central european steel industries are all heavily dependent on ore supplies
from Russia and the Ukraine. Both Huta Katowice in Poland and the East
Slovakian steel plant at Kosice in Slovakia are directly linked by rail to
Krivoi Rog in south eastern Ukraine. But future supplies to the plants hinge
on completion of a new pelletisation plant whose construction has been
abandoned by Germany and others.
Until now the Czech and Slovak steel industries have resisted contraction
better than their competitors elsewhere in central Europe, with output
declining from 15m tonnes in 1989 to around 11m tonnes in 1992. The main
steel plants in Bohemia and Moravia are particularly well-placed to supply
cheap steel for the construction boom taking place in eastern Germany.
In comparison, output by the Romanian industry, which is the third largest
in eastern Europe, has fallen by 60 per cent from 14.5m in 1989 to an
estimated 5.3m in 1992. Romania has become the main partner in the Krivoi
Rog project because of its dependence on Ukrainian supplies. Meanwhile, the
industry is battling to keep up production and find markets for its steel in
the Middle East rather than the EC.
It is a similar story of sharply falling output among the smaller producers
such as Bulgaria and Hungary.
Plagued with energy and raw material shortages the Bulgarian industry has
seen output halve to under 1.5m tonnes in 1992 with mills reduced to seeking
hire-rolling contracts to provide minimum employment.
In Hungary, capacity and output have both fallen by over 50 per cent over
the last three years as part of a broader strategic shift out of energy and
raw material intensive sectors into lighter industry and processing. Output
has fallen from 3.7m tonnes in the mid-1980's to 1.6m tonnes last year when
employment was down to 23,000 from 61,000.
Only two steel-making centres survive, at Dunaujvaros on the Danube and
Dimag at Diosgyor in eastern Hungary. A third steel centre at Ozd has closed
down but might re-open as a much smaller scrap-based mini mill of around
400,000 tonne capacity.
Heavy investment by General Motors and Suzuki have created new demand for
high quality sheet steel for the new car industry. But the future of heavy
steel making plants such as Dimag is problematical. Heavy investment is
required to reduce capacity from the current 1m tonnes to around 600,000
tonnes using modern convertor technology.
However, finding the resources for this type of modernisation is going to be
hard. For while the EC's rescue package may have offered new hope to western
European steelmakers, it has served to push their eastern counterparts even
further out into the cold.
The type of integration and cross-investment beginning to emerge among
eastern and western producers in other industrial sectors is not going to
come easily to steel.

MR Martin Bangemann, the EC industry commissioner, yesterday signalled that
an active telecommunications policy would spearhead Commission attempts to
boost industrial growth in the Community.
The commissioner said priority during the Commission's two-year term should
be given to strengthening the competitiveness of EC industry. Outlining his
work programme for 1993, Mr Bangemann said telecoms was one sector in which
'we can move very quickly to create new demand immediately'.
Mr Bangemann added responsibility for telecommunications to his industry
portfolio in the Commission reshuffle last December. The change has given
him control over Commission policy on information technology,
high-definition television (HDTV) and telecoms liberalisation, as well as
more than 40 per cent of the funds available to business through the EC's
research and development programmes.
Mr Bangemann intends to concentrate on improving cross-border telecoms
networks linking national administrations, and developing a compatible
Community-wide integrated services digital network (ISDN), which should lead
to clearer, faster, cheaper and more reliable telecommunications.
The Commission is also close to finishing consultations with industry and
consumers on how to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of ordinary
telephone calls in the Community. Mr Bangemann said yesterday he was opposed
to national telecoms monopolies if they hampered the introduction of modern
technology, but favoured the maintenance of an efficient public service.
However, the commissioner said it would be imprudent to use special
Commission powers to challenge those national monopolies.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Job agencies attack curbs in EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

RESTRICTIONS on temporary work agencies are hindering job creation in the
European Community, according to the International Confederation of
Temporary Work Businesses.
The employers' group has filed a formal complaint to the European Commission
about restrictions in Italy, Spain, and Germany and it has written to Mr
Jacques Delors this week asking for a 'quick response.'
Mr Wim Ruggenberg, federation president, told Mr Delors that in view of
concern about EC unemployment he should immediately lift all restrictions,
saying 'our industry provides a mechanism for keeping in touch with the job
market and in work, even if temporary.' He quoted a French survey which said
25 per cent of temporary workers get permanent jobs as a result of work
found through the agencies.
In the Netherlands and the UK temporary work agencies, such as Manpower, are
encouraged. In Germany they are legal but severely restricted, but are
illegal in Greece, Italy and Spain.
The complaint has, so far, made little progress in the Commission despite
support from the single market and competition directorates. The social
affairs directorate is more hostile although its view may change if the
International Labour Organisation revises its long-standing reservations on
temporary work agencies.
The three countries being targeted have all promised some reform but it is
unlikely to be enough to satisfy the employers' federation. Greece has not
been targeted because the potential market is too small.

FT  19 FEB 93 / German engineering employers revoke eastern pay deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S engineering employers are abandoning an agreement to bring east
German wages up to the level of their west German counterparts by 1994.
The decision is likely to provoke a major confrontation between IG Metall,
Germany's giant engineering union, and Gesamtmetall, the employers'
federation.
It could lead to a wave of strikes among IG Metall's 300,000 workers in
eastern Germany. More than 10,000 workers in Chemnitz, Saxony demonstrated
on Wednesday against any attempts to revoke the contract.
Mr Klaus Zwickel, the deputy chairman of IG Metall, yesterday described the
employers' decision as a 'spectacular breach of the law'. It would not be
accepted without a struggle.
Mr Hans Peter Munter, head of Saxony's Metal and Electrical Industry
Association, said the contract was no longer valid because the economic
circumstances in both west and east Germany had deteriorated considerably
since it was signed in March 1991.
Mr Munter repeated yesterday that the employers were prepared to award the
engineering and electrical workers in the five east German states a 9 per
cent rise for 12 months from April 1.
IG Metall has insisted, on the basis of the 1991 contract, on a 26 per cent
pay increase for its members starting from April 1.
East German rates in the sector are currently 71 per cent of western rates.
A 26 per cent pay rise would take this to 82 per cent of western rates.
Productivity levels in the east are about 70 per cent below west German
levels, and unit labour costs are 140 per cent higher.
Union officials in Berlin said arbitration talks would begin today, despite
the breakdown of talks earlier this week in Saxony and Thuringia.
But Mr Michael Bohm, IG Metall's spokesman in Berlin, said Gesamtmetall
would try to use yesterday's announcement to break off talks in the capital.
'It's not only the breach of contract, and the 26 per cent pay rise we are
fighting for,' he explained. 'It is for the whole future of collective wage
bargaining, which has existed since the war. That is the real issue for us,'
he said.
Union officials are now considering what action to take. They could go court
and try to prove that Gesamtmetall had broken the contract, or ask workers
to go the courts if they do not receive the 26 per cent increase, or call a
strike.
Failure to reach a compromise could mean the breakdown of central wage
bargaining between employers and unions as employers seek local deals.

RUSSIA is trying to bring about 'a full paralysis' of the Ukrainian economy,
Ukrainian prime minister Leonid Kuchma said yesterday.
Mr Kuchma said such action could present the west with a 'distorted' view of
the republic's economic position,
The remarks by Mr Kuchma, who has consistently sought an economic and
political rapprochement with Russia, indicate a sharp deterioration in
relations between the two former Soviet republics.
'Unfortunately, there is already a conflict,' Mr Kuchma said. 'Worse still,
this is a conflict in which there can be no victors.'
The weapons in the current struggle are oil and gas, for which Russia is
demanding world prices or threatening to decrease supply, and the unresolved
issue of the foreign debts and assets of the former Soviet Union.
But recent comments by Russian officials suggest that disagreements over
these economic issues are underpinned by political and military disputes
between Russia, which is seeking to retain some of the former Soviet Union's
old sphere of influence, and Ukraine, which is adamantly charting a separate
course.
In an effort to save the situation, Mr Kuchma said that yesterday he
telephoned his Russian counterpart, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, to arrange a
face to face meeting next Friday.
'I cannot understand the Russian position,' Mr Kuchma said. 'It is not
motivated by economics. It can only be seen as some sort of pressure on
Ukraine. But Russia must realize that to return to the former Soviet Union
is neither technically nor politically possible.'
Earlier this week Mr Viktor Shokhin, Russian deputy prime minister, said
Ukraine would get subsidised energy only if it made concessions to Russia
over the Black Sea Fleet, allowed Russian military bases to be established
in Ukraine and permitted Russia to export oil and gas through Ukrainian
pipelines.
Mr Shokhin's statements came on top of Russia's unilateral increase in the
prices it charges Ukraine for natural gas to world levels ' a jump of 2500
per cent ' and the announcement by the Russian prime minister that Ukraine
would receive only 15m tonnes of oil this year, 5 million less than Russia
promised in January and one third of Ukraine's energy requirement.
'They understand perfectly that to move to world prices in one day means a
complete paralysis of the Ukrainian economy,' said Mr Kuchma. He said
Ukraine did not receive any oil from Russia in January.
Nuclear missiles in Ukraine are being drawn into the struggle. Ukrainian and
Russian sources say the missiles are not being properly maintained by the
Russian factories which produced them. Western diplomats in Kiev say that in
a worst case scenario the missiles would not be mistakenly launched but
could explode, spreading nuclear material throughout the region.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Tax rises likely as jobless total rises above 3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, PHILIP STEPHENS and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of tax increases in next month's Budget appeared to harden
yesterday after an hour-long cabinet discussion of the economic outlook was
accompanied by news that headline unemployment last month pushed above 3m
for the first time in six years.
With little hope in Whitehall of any falls in unemployment until the
mid-1990s, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, left ministerial colleagues in
no doubt that tax increases to cut the government's deficit were a real
possibility in the March 16 Budget.
The suggestion that the government should 'bite the bullet' on raising taxes
sooner rather than later also appeared to be winning support among Tory MPs.
The extension of value added tax to domestic fuel and heating as part of a
number of 'green' taxes is considered a front-runner.
Hopes of economic recovery received only a modest boost from news that
seasonally adjusted bank and building society lending increased by an
unexpectedly strong Pounds 4.1bn in January after falling by Pounds 74m in
December. The Bank of England and the British Bankers' Association suggested
that January's lending figure could have been inflated by companies
borrowing to pay corporation tax bills.
The headline figure of people unemployed and claiming benefit in January
rose to 3.06m, while on a seasonally adjusted basis the figure was lower at
2.99m.
The seasonally adjusted rise in unemployment between December and January
was a lower-than-expected 22,100, the smallest monthly increase since June.
But Downing Street officials acknowledged there was little prospect that the
figure would turn down for two or three years.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, indicated that a new package
of measures to take tens of thousands off the unemployment register would be
ready by Budget day.
The jobless figures brought fierce clashes in a rowdy House of Commons. With
Mr John Major appearing distinctly unsettled at the despatch box, Mr John
Smith, Labour leader, accused the prime minister of creating a 'social
tragedy' and 'economic madness'. He was joined by Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal
Democrat leader, who accused Mr Major of having 'nothing to say' about
unemployment.
A welcome development for the government was that average earnings across
the economy rose in the 12 months to December by 4.75 per cent, the smallest
annual rise for 25 years. The depressed level of wage rises may help the
Treasury attain its target of keeping underlying inflation at 4 per cent or
less.
Since the low point for seasonally-adjusted unemployment in April 1990, the
number of people without jobs and claiming benefit has risen by 1.4m from
1.6m.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Kingfisher Pounds 560m purchase of Darty boosts shares 30p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KINGFISHER, the UK retail group, yesterday agreed its Pounds 560m takeover
of Darty, France's biggest electricals retailer, to create one of the
largest non-food retailing groups in Europe.
The deal was welcomed in the City of London, Kingfisher's shares closing up
30p at 557p. Kingfisher announced it would partly fund the deal with a
Pounds 313m, one-for-seven rights issue.
'What Kingfisher has done is to buy a great business, very profitable, very
cash generative, with no earnings dilution, which potentially gives it
access to new European markets,' said Mr Paul Deacon, retailing analyst at
Goldman Sachs. 'It's difficult to fault.'
For Kingfisher, which includes the Comet, B&amp;Q, Woolworth and Superdrug
chains, the deal is the group's most significant move since its creation in
1982. It also realises its ambition of developing a significant presence in
continental Europe.
Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, Kingfisher's chairman, said it would create a business
'with the muscle to compete on a European basis as well as enhancing growth
opportunities in our domestic markets'.
Mr Philippe Frances, Darty's chairman, said the deal marked the start of a
'strategic European alliance' between the two groups which would enable his
company to fulfil its potential.
Darty has been a force in French retailing since 1957 when the three Darty
brothers, Bernard, Claude and Nathan, opened their first store. It now
dominates the white and brown goods sector with 130 stores which command 12
per cent of the French market.
The group is still one of France's most profitable retailers but has come
under pressure in recent years because of the burden of the FFr4bn (Pounds
502m) net debt left by its 1988 management buy-out from the Darty family and
the increasingly competitive state of the French retail sector. Sales
slipped from FFr8.75bn to FFr8.56bn in its last financial year to August 31.
The deal values Darty at FFr4.45bn. Kingfisher will pay for it with Pounds
207m cash, plus 68m Kingfisher shares, giving Darty shareholders a
significant stake of between 10 and 12 per cent in Kingfisher. It will also
take on debts of about Pounds 477m.
News of the deal was accompanied by a better than expected profits forecast
for Kingfisher of Pounds 233m, before exceptional items, for the year to
January, up from Pounds 221.8m the year before.
The increase reflected strong performances by the Comet and Woolworth
chains. However, a write-down of Pounds 26m to cover the cost of
Kingfisher's withdrawal from property development will reduce the pre-tax
profit after exceptional items to Pounds 210m, from Pounds 227.7m last year.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Timex sacks and replaces its Dundee workforce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGRY PICKETS were last night besieging the Dundee plant of Timex
Electronics, the US-owned multinational, in protest at the company's
decision to sack all its production workers and replace them with a new
labour force.
This is the largest case of a mass dismissal of workers by a company in
Britain since News International fired its print workers before moving
production facilities to Wapping in east London in January 1986.
Yesterday the first 12 recruits walked into the Dundee plant, which makes
printed circuit boards, through a picket line of former Timex employees.
With more than 10.2 per cent of Dundee's workers jobless, the company has
been inundated with job applications from the unemployed.
'We have had an enormous response to our call for new workers,' said Mr
Peter Hall, the Timex president, last night.
Two senior union officials face jail or fines in the High Court next week
for alleged breach of an injunction to keep pickets down to only six outside
Timex.
Mr Hall said the company had decided to replace its 320-strong manual
workforce after a 20-day dispute over provisions for a series of lay-offs
and two months of negotiation with the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union.
Senior executives flew from Connecticut last week to hammer out a peace plan
with the union. This involved asking the workers to accept a rotation of
lay-offs among the whole workforce for six months with access to independent
arbitration, a pay freeze for 1993, a 10 per cent cut in benefits and
introduction of a profit-sharing scheme.
Mr Hall said the company intended to increase production in the second half
of the year and recruit a further 300 workers.
He said the staff had refused to accept the peace plan at meetings last
Sunday and again on Wednesday.
Mr Gordon Samson, the AEEU's district secretary in Dundee, said staff had
agreed to return to work 'under protest' and the company had fired them.
Mr Hall agreed that 'technically' the union was correct, but he added the
company had no alternative but to dismiss all its production workers
(including 17 who worked through the strike) because they could each
individually, with the union's backing, take Timex to court.
The company could face heavy fines over breach of contract if it changed
pension and other benefit provisions without the agreement of the workforce.
The trouble began when Timex warned the AEEU that the Dundee plant faced
closure, or compulsory redundancies, if the workforce did not accept
lay-offs and a reduction in the value of their present lay-off agreement.
In response the workers said that they would share what work was available
so all of them would have periods in and out of work with the promise from
the company of increased production in the second half of this year and an
expansion in the labour force.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Clinton package wins favourable public reaction
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton and his cabinet yesterday embarked on the task of
turning his four-year, Dollars 500bn (Pounds 350bn) package of tax increases
and spending cuts into reality lifted by favourable public reaction, but
facing hostility from Republicans.
Overnight opinion polls, although narrowly based, suggested that
three-quarters of those who heard the speech approved of its proposals, 60
per cent of them enthusiastically.
At a meeting in St Louis, President Clinton challenged his Republican
opponents, who attacked the package for raising taxes too much and cutting
spending too little, to be specific about their proposals for spending cuts.
'No hot air; show me where,' he said.
But Republicans questioned whether the efforts to reduce the budget deficit,
which are concentrated in the later years of the four-year plan, would ever
see the light of day.
'You hang your hat on what's going to happen three years from now. I'm
sorry, but people don't believe that in America and on Wall Street,' said Mr
John Kasich, the senior Republican on the House of Representatives budget
committee.
They also challenged Mr Clinton's presentation of his plan as a Dollars
500bn deficit reduction package. Although the plan includes Dollars 247bn of
spending cuts and Dollars 246bn of tax increases in 1994-97, these are
offset by Dollars 109bn of spending increases and Dollars 60bn of tax
breaks. The resulting net reduction in the deficit will be only Dollars
325bn.
This could spell difficulty for efforts to push the economic plan through
Congress in an important budget bill, which congressional leaders hope to
complete before the August recess.
But Mr Dan Rostenkowski, who as chairman of the House of Representatives
Ways and Means Committee is one of those with the most control over the
package's legislative fate, said that voters might be well ahead of their
representatives in recognising the need for sacrifice to deal with the
federal budget deficit.
'I honestly believe that the people, generally, are more willing than the
Congress to move in this area,' he said.
Mr Clinton is hoping to capitalise on this sentiment with a series of public
meetings across the country.
While Republicans are lining up en bloc against the bill, some Democrats,
anxious not to be associated too closely with higher taxes before the 1994
elections, could also desert their president.
Senator David Boren, a conservative Democrat from Oklahoma, urged Mr Clinton
not to press the short-term stimulus component of his plan before he had won
agreement on his broader deficit reduction proposals.
If US voters react more favourably to the package, members of Congress might
be emboldened.
After extending an olive branch to the Republicans in his speech to Congress
on Wednesday night, Mr Clinton yesterday sharpened his criticism of their
economic policies in a book: 'A vision of change for America.'
'The election of 1992 was a mandate for change - and no wonder . . . such is
the sorry legacy of 12 years of short-sightedness, mismanagement and
protection of the privileged,' he wrote.

<TEXT>
PICKETS demonstrated last night outside the Dundee plant of Timex
Electronics, the US-owned multinational, to protest at the company's
decision to sack all its 320 production workers and replace them with a new
labour force. The sackings followed a dispute over lay-off provisions. It is
the largest case of a mass dismissal of workers by a company in Britain
since News International fired its print workers in 1986.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Public welcomes Clinton plan: Republicans say tax rises too
high and spending cuts not enough
</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton and his cabinet yesterday embarked on the task of
turning his four-year, Dollars 500bn (Pounds 352bn) package of tax increases
and spending cuts into reality lifted by favourable public reaction, but
facing hostility from Republicans.
Overnight opinion polls, although narrowly based, suggested that three
quarters of those who heard the speech approved of its proposals, 60 per
cent of them enthusiastically.
But Republicans attacked the package for raising taxes too much and cutting
spending too little. They also questioned whether the efforts to reduce the
budget deficit, which are concentrated in the later years of the four-year
plan, would ever see the light of day.
'You hang your hat on what's going to happen three years from now. I'm sorry
but people don't believe that in America and on Wall Street,' said Mr John
Kasich, the senior Republican on the House of Representatives budget
committee.
This could spell difficulty for President Clinton's efforts to push his
economic plan through Congress in a budget bill, which congressional leaders
hope to complete before the August recess.
Mr Dan Rostenkowski, however, who as chairman of the House of
Representatives Ways and Means Committee is one of those with the most
control over the package's legislative fate, said that voters might be well
ahead of their representatives in recognising the need for sacrifice to deal
with the federal budget deficit.
'I honestly believe that the people, generally, are more willing than the
Congress to move in this area,' he said.
Mr Clinton is hoping to capitalise on this sentiment with a series of public
meetings across the country, appealing directly to voters to back his
proposals.
While Republicans are lining up en bloc against the bill, some Democrats,
anxious not to be associated too closely with higher taxes before the 1994
elections, could also desert their president.
Senator David Boren, a conservative Democrat from Oklahoma, yesterday urged
Mr Clinton not to press the short-term stimulus component of his plan before
he has won agreement on his broader deficit reduction proposals. 'That's
getting the cart before the horse,' he said.
If US voters react more favourably to the package, members of congress might
be emboldened.
After extending an olive branch to the Republicans in his speech to Congress
on Wednesday night, Mr Clinton yesterday sharpened his criticism of their
economic policies in a book: 'A vision of change for America.'
In Congress, Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, took the battle to his
opponents in a sharp exchange with Mr Kasich.
'The problem is that we have had gridlock in the Congress because
Republicans have always taken the position that you can't increase taxes on
the wealthy and Democrats have always said you can't cut any programmes, and
that produces gridlock. And you are now the perfect example through your
arguments of the kind of gridlock that I think people are tired of,' Mr
Panetta said.
While the Clinton package is projected by the White House to reduce the
budget deficit from Dollars 332bn this year to Dollars 206bn in 1997,
administration officials yesterday warned that the deficit would start to
climb again from 1998 unless healthcare costs are brought under control.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Bond prices rise but shares ease after early gains
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Clinton's package was given a mixed reaction by the US markets.
Government bonds rose sharply but share prices fell after an initial jump.
In early afternoon trading the benchmark 30-year government bond, the key
indicator of bond market performance, was up almost  3/4 of a point at 101
1/16 . But the prospect of slower economic growth undermined shares. By
mid-session the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 14.59 at 3,297.60.
The foreign exchange markets responded positively at first. In New York,
however, trading was more subdued, and by early afternoon the US currency
had slipped back to stand at DM1.6285, up about half a pfennig.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Concealing the 'odd' liability: Andrew Jack on the moves to
tackle off-balance sheet finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1984 Mr David Tweedie, then technical partner with accountants Peat
Marwick Mitchell, identified 'an odd scheme' by which a client company was
attempting to prevent a substantial liability appearing on its balance
sheet.
Nearly a decade later, he has finally been able to respond to the problem of
off-balance-sheet finance in his role as chairman of the Accounting
Standards Board (ASB).
In the intervening years, a growing number of companies have taken advantage
of an expanding range of obscure, rule-bending devices which allow them to
conceal their full liabilities from readers of their accounts. 'It's
impossible to generalise,' says Mr Tweedie. 'Every scheme I have looked at
is different.'
The old Accounting Standards Committee, the ASB's predecessor, initially
refused to act. It was cajoled into action by pressure - partly from the
Bank of England - after the collapse of Burnett &amp; Hallamshire, which used
off-balance sheet financing on US property activities.
Even after the ASC released ED 49, one of its final exposure drafts on the
subject during the organisation's death throes in 1988, long delays followed
before the ASB was ready to go public.
Part of the delay reflects fierce resistance by companies to the proposals.
Banks in particular were concerned that they would breach the EC's capital
adequacy requirements if they were forced to include securitised assets such
as mortgages on their balance sheets.
The ASB backed down with an elegant compromise last year - banks should
disclose the gross assets and liabilities incurred by securitisations, and
then show a net figure after deducting the amount which is genuinely
non-recourse.
But that still requires companies to be able to calculate the full extent of
the risk retained by them. The banks argue that this will be impossible for
credit card receivables - an item which several are presently considering
securitising.
They say that their computer systems are not sufficiently sophisticated to
assess fully the outstanding risk on credit cards. If so, the ADB proposals
would require them to show these risks on the balance sheet.
Fred 4, the new draft, draws heavily on the ASB's statement of principles -
where companies enjoy the principal benefits or are exposed to the principal
risks of transaction, and it can be measured, it should be put on the
balance sheet.
Fred 4 will affect many off-balance sheet devices presently in use by a wide
range of companies. These include sale-and-repurchase agreements, factoring
and loan transfers.
One classic example is shown in the 1990 accounts of Queens Moat Hotels -
not on the balance sheet but buried in note 22 - in a series of sale and
leaseback transactions for five hotels and two office properties.
'As soon as this standard comes out, there will be people in the banks with
wet towels around their heads working all night to find ways round it,' says
Mr Tweedie.
His response has been to weave examples into the draft standard, which is
more likely to ensure the general principles in the text could be defended
against legal attack.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Response to Daf collapse attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S response to the collapse of Daf, the Dutch truckmaker, came
under fierce attack in the Commons yesterday, with Labour claiming it
highlighted its lack of an industrial strategy, David Owen writes.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said the government's
approach contrasted with that of its Belgian and Dutch counterparts, which
were intervening to save local jobs.
Predicting that thousands of jobs would be lost if the British-based Leyland
Daf went down, Mr Cook asked why, as of last week, there had been no
'ministerial contact from Britain' with the Dutch finance minister while a
rescue package was being worked on.
'If you will not even talk to the Dutch government, you are making it more
likely that the cuts will fall on British jobs,' Mr Cook said.

<TEXT>
HEWLETT-PACKARD, the US computer and electronics manufacturer, reported
higher than expected first-quarter earnings. The quarter, ended in January,
is the first since Mr Lewis Platt succeeded Mr John Young as president and
chief executive in October, when Mr Young retired.
Net earnings were Dollars 261m, or Dollars 1.03 per share, compared with a
net loss of Dollars 30m or 12 cents per share in the first fiscal quarter of
1992, when HP took an after tax charge of Dollars 332m to reflect a change
in accounting for retiree health care benefits.
Excluding the charge, HP had net earnings of Dollars 302m or Dollars 1.19
per share in the first quarter a year ago.
Wall Street analysts had been predicting net earnings of around 96 cents per
share. HP's stock jumped sharply yesterday, closing Dollars 4 5/8 up on the
day at Dollars 72 1/4 .
Revenue for the quarter totalled Dollars 4.6bn, compared with Dollars 3.9bn
in the same period last year. US revenues were Dollars 2.1bn, up 24 per
cent, while revenues from outside the US rose 14 per cent to Dollars 2.5bn.
The company noted that acquisitions accounted for about three percentage
points of the growth in revenues.
New orders booked during the quarter were a record Dollars 5.2bn, up 24 per
cent, signaling strong revenues in the future. US orders totalled Dollars
2.1bn, up 18 per cent over 1992, while orders from outside the US grew by 28
per cent to Dollars 3.1bn.
'We're extremely pleased with our growth in orders, which was well balanced
by business and geography,' said Mr Platt. 'Our revenue growth was strong
and earnings were good, even though they were lower than those of our
outstanding first quarter of 1992.
'The year is off to a good start,' he added. 'Our challenge is to turn
strong order growth into higher profitability. We're cautious, however,
because continuing order growth depends in part on worldwide economic
conditions, which still show signs of weakness in key geographies.
'We're encouraged by the success of our new products, and we're finding
opportunities even in this tough environment. Our focus will remain on the
strong product programmes and lean organisations that success requires.'
Operating expenses for the first quarter rose 11 per cent , with about 2
percentage points of this increase due to the effects of acquisitions.
Operating expenses fell as a percentage of net revenue from 34.7 per cent in
1992's first quarter to 32.5 per cent.
'We're very pleased with the progress we've made on reducing operating
expenses as a percentage of net revenues,' said Mr Platt. 'We must continue
our efforts to reduce operating expense ratios in all our businesses.'
Separately, HP announced that Mr John O'Rourke, formerly of Bellcore and
Bell Labs where he had more than 25 years' experience directing
telecommunications programs, has joined the company in the newly created
position of general manager, Telecommunications Operations, and chief
telecommunications architect.
In this post, Mr O'Rourke will lead development of an integrated strategy to
increase significantly HP's position in the telecommunications industry, the
company said.

DAI-ICHI Mutual Life Insurance Company has taken the unusual step of
requesting Standard &amp; Poor's to withdraw its credit rating, after the US
agency lowered the company's rating on claims paying ability from triple-A
to double-A+, S&amp;P said, writes Tracy Corrigan.
'In the light of the withdrawal, S&amp;P will no longer be able to maintain
surveillance of this insurer's financial strength at a time of growing
uncertainty surrounding Japanese financial institutions,' the agency said.
The downgrade was prompted by the earnings and capital deterioration caused
by the economic downturn in Japan. S&amp;P said that the sharp decline in the
Japanese stock market had greatly reduced unrealised gains in Dai-Ichi's
equities portfolio.

<TEXT>
THAINOX Steel, the Thai stainless steel joint venture in which Ugine of
France is the largest foreign shareholder, yesterday announced that a
consortium of six Japanese companies had been brought into the project.
ILVA of Italy was brought into the venture last year.
The latest move is the final stage in a restructuring of Thainox's equity,
which began when several international steel producers found themselves
planning rival factories with a combined capacity far too large for the Thai
market.
Under the final arrangement, Ugine will have 21 per cent of Thainox while
ILVA and the Japanese consortium will hold 14 per cent each. The four Thai
partners will share the remaining 51 per cent. Ugine and its partner, PM
Group of Thailand, will retain joint management and operational control.
Nippon Steel will co-ordinate the Japanese consortium, which says it will
have the right to supply 30 per cent of the raw material for the plant in
Rayong and to sell 30 per cent of Thainox's output to the Japanese
companies' traditional customers in Thailand.
The factory is due to start production in October this year of up to 60,000
tonnes a year of cold-rolled stainless steel sheets, an amount slightly
higher than the present size of the entire Thai market.
The sheets are used to make a range of products, including washing machines
and car exhaust systems.
Thainox says its plant will be the first producing stainless steel in the
six-country Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean), where demand is
growing at more than 10 per cent a year.
The other Japanese participants are Nisshin Steel, Kawasaki Steel, Sumitomo
Metal Industries, Nippon Metal Industry and Nippon Yakin Kogyo.

term

<TEXT>
CIGNA, one of the largest composite insurance companies in the US, has
announced a sharp drop in fourth-quarter earnings to Dollars 50m, down from
Dollars 108m a year earlier.
Full-year 1992 profits of Dollars 311m were also well down on the previous
year, when the company earned Dollars 449m, although the latest results were
depressed by a Dollars 26m charge to cover the adoption of new accounting
standards.
Earnings would have been worse but for realised investment gains, which
brought in Dollars 19m in the fourth quarter and Dollars 192m in the year.
In comparison, investment gains in 1991 netted only Dollars 52m.
The company, which described its results as 'unsatisfactory', said its
property and casualty operations incurred a loss of Dollars 374m last year,
despite investment gains of Dollars 111m.
The bulk of the losses were due to a big increase in catastrophe losses,
which jumped from Dollars 68m in 1991 to Dollars 251m, largely as a result
of Hurricane Andrew which devastated parts of southern Florida and Louisiana
in August.
Earnings from Cigna's employee life and health benefits business also fell
sharply in 1992, although income from its financial services division rose
slightly.

<TEXT>
BELLSOUTH, the largest of the Baby Bell regional telephone companies that
was spun off from AT&amp;T in 1984, has unveiled plans to spend up to Dollars
9bn during the next three years updating its telecommunications network.
The Atlanta-based company said Dollars 5.7bn would be spent to keep up with
the business' growth and to replace outdated equipment, and another Dollars
3bn would be invested in newer technology for the network infrastructure.
Some of the money will go towards the installation of more fibre optic cable
and the continued replacement of analog central offices with digital
equipment.
So far, BellSouth has installed 900,000 miles of fibre optic cable in its US
network and plans to install fibre-to-the-curb systems for 130,000
residential and business customers over the next three years. The
incorporation of self-healing capabilities into the network to enhance
reliability will also continue under the capital investment programme.
In a separate development, BellSouth has signed preliminary agreements with
Intel, RAM Mobile Data and Ericsson Telephone to develop new products and
services for the mobile computing market.
The four companies said they planned to expand the availability and increase
the usage of standard Intel processor-based mobile computers able to perform
two-way wireless communications via the nationwide dedicated public mobile
data networks run by RAM.
BellSouth and Intel also said they would be exploring new mobile computing
products and services that can be used on a variety of communications
networks.

FT  18 FEB 93 / UK Company News: RTZ shares fall on warning of Pounds 52m
provision
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, fell yesterday after it
revealed that its 1992 results would include exceptional charges totalling
Pounds 52m.
The share price dropped 20p in early trading but later recovered to close at
651p, down 5p.
RTZ said low metals prices were forcing it to curtail operations at its 54
per cent owned Greens Creek mine in Alaska, which produces zinc and lead and
is the biggest silver producer in the US.
About 230 employees are affected.
The group said it hoped to resume operations at Greens Creek when economic
conditions improved but meanwhile it would make a provision of Dollars 48m
(Pounds 32m) after tax against the book value of its investment in the mine.
Greens Creek cost Dollars 114m and started up as recently as 1989. Last year
it produced 6.979m troy ounces of silver, 36,800 tonnes of zinc and 15,100
tonnes of lead - less than 1 per cent of the lead and zinc mined last year
in the world outside the former eastern bloc countries.
RTZ also revealed that Indal, its wholly owned Canadian subsidiary which is
active in a broad range of North American construction-related markets, had
been badly hit by the recession and, after exceptional restructuring costs
of CDollars 38m (Pounds 20m), recorded an after-tax loss for 1992 of
CDollars 58m.
The group said it would be publishing 1992 results next month on the basis
of the new financial reporting standards and would treat both charges as
exceptional items.
RTZ reported net attributable profits of Pounds 308m for 1991 after a Pounds
74m exceptional charge for replacing its copper smelter at Bingham Canyon,
Utah.

The Earl of Limerick (above) has been given a licence to print money. The
former merchant banker has taken over the chairmanship of De La Rue, the
world's largest commercial printer of banknotes.
Pat Limerick, 62, replaces Peter Orchard, chairman for the past five years,
who died suddenly last month. He has been on the De La Rue board since 1983
and since a couple of his colleagues - Sir Douglas Wass and Martin Harris
are retiring this year - he was one of the most senior non-executive
directors and a natural successor to Peter Orchard.
De La Rue is also strengthening its board. John Robb, Wellcome's 56-year-old
chief executive, has been appointed a non-executive director and Robert
Gardner, 56, managing director of De La Rue's payment systems division, also
joins the board. He came from Gestetner in July 1990.
Despite his aristocratic background, the Old Etonian sixth Earl of Limerick
is well plugged into the City - which could be useful if corporate predators
were ever to show interest in De La Rue again.
A chartered accountant by training, he spent 20 years as a director of
Kleinwort Benson rising to be deputy chairman. A former chairman of the
British Overseas Trade Board and British Invisibles, he has a number of
other chairmanships including Pirelli UK and AMP Asset Management.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Steel crisis prompts talks

<TEXT>
THYSSEN and Krupp, Germany's two largest steel producers, and Saarstahl, the
sixth largest, are holding talks on future co-operation in their output of
certain products.
The aim of the talks, precipitated by the crisis in the steel industry, is
to decide whether significant cost reductions can be made by greater
specialisation between the three companies.
The first details emerged as 10,000 steel workers demonstrated on the
streets of Dortmund against the threat of mass job losses, and the closure
of an entire steel plant belong to Hoesch Stahl, in the process of merging
with Krupp Stahl.
At the same time Mr Ruprecht Vondran, president of the German Steel
Federation, warned that the industry in west Germany alone might have to
shed 25,000 to 30,000 jobs, under the latest capacity cuts proposed at the
European Commission in Brussels. East Germany would lose 10,000 jobs.
The negotiations between Thyssen, Krupp and Saarstahl follow two abortive
efforts at co-operation agreements between German steel producers in the
past 18 months.
This time they have been personally agreed by Mr Gerhard Cromme, chief
executive of Krupp holding company, and Mr Heinz Kriwet, head of Thyssen
group.
Thyssen Stahl said the talks would focus on 'whether cost improvements could
be achieved in the long products sector (girders, rods and the like) through
a division of labour in the process of an exchange of programmes.
Thyssen and Krupp were involved in a previous round of talks on possible
co-operation in special steels production - virtually all Krupp's long
products output consists of special steels. These talks ended abruptly last
year when Thyssen decided instead to amalgamate its two producing companies,
Thyssen Stahl and Thyssen Edelstahl.
A further round of talks was initiated by Krupp last year with
Klockner-Werke and Saarstahl, which also foundered. However the recent slump
in the European steel market has forced the big producers to reopen their
talks.
Klockner-Werke, currently in negotiations on debt relief with its major
creditors, has been excluded from the latest talks.
The threat of thousands of job losses throughout the German industry has
caused a surge of labour militancy, barely restrained by IG Metall, the
giant engineering and steel workers' union.
The union has called for a mass national demonstration on March 26, but
workers fear that will come too late to prevent agreement on further plant
closures.

<TEXT>
A UN inspection team yesterday made a surprise visit to an undeclared
military factory south of Baghdad and said it had gathered fresh information
on Iraq's ballistic missile programme, Reuter reports from Baghdad.
'We had a very busy day. We collected a very good deal of information,' Mr
Patrice Palanque, the team leader, said.
He did not say exactly where the factory was but he added: 'This is a new
site. To my knowledge it was not visited before (by previous UN inspection
teams).'
It was Mr Palanque's fifth day in the field checking if materials produced
by Iraq military factories breached the terms of the Gulf war ceasefire.
Mr Mark Silver, Mr Palanque's deputy, said that while they were inspecting
the factory on the ground, UN helicopters watched the site closely from
above.
Neither gave details of the new information but said it might fill gaps in
their knowledge of Iraqi missiles.
Under Gulf war ceasefire terms, Iraq is allowed to keep only missiles with a
range shorter than 150km. The rest will have to be scrapped along with the
means to produce them.
Mr Palanque and his 13-member team arrived in Baghdad on Friday to check
that Iraq is not storing or secretly producing missiles which are prohibited
under the ceasefire terms.
Iran said 1,000 Iraqi military men who fled to its territory during the 1991
Gulf war would return home today.
Iran's official IRNA news agency said the Middle East representative of the
International Committee of the Red Cross had been informed of the planned
repatriation.
IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said 400 Iraqi military men returned home from
Iran in November.
It did not say if either group included pilots of scores of Iraqi aircraft,
including advanced fighters and bombers, which flew to Iran for safety when
US-led allies launched air and missile attacks on Iraq to force it to pull
out of Kuwait.
Iran, which fought Iraq from 1980 to 1988, remained neutral in the Gulf war.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Vietnam: a rocky road for investors: A gaping lack of
infrastructure contributes to problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of Vietnam's attractions for foreign investors is the size of its
population: a plentiful supply of workers and a domestic market of 67m
consumers is an enticing prospect for manufacturers.
Perhaps it is fitting that the Taiwanese, the largest source of foreign
capital for Vietnam, should be among the first to suffer the consequences of
overcrowding.
Completion of a huge Taiwanese industrial estate in a loop of the Saigon
river in southern Vietnam is being delayed because the land is already
occupied by scores of villagers who do not want to move without generous
compensation.
'I am Vietnamese,' says Mr Don Van Hien, a 56-year-old sawmill worker, when
asked whether the industrial estate does not represent progress. 'I'm
looking forward to developing the country, but the government doesn't pay
enough for us to move to another place.'
The bare, flattened sand of the 40 hectares cleared so far - dotted with the
occasional Taoist shrine which the developers have not dared to molest -
comes right up to his doorstep. Behind him are the paddy fields and creeks
where he and the other villagers supplement their income by farming rice or
catching fish.
'I don't want to move,' says Mr Hien. 'The government wants to get more
money to enrich the nation, but how can the poor people survive?'
The ambitious plans of the Taiwanese - and their trials and tribulations in
seeking to implement those plans - demonstrate both the opportunities and
the pitfalls confronting investors in Vietnam.
The Tan Thuan export processing zone, at 300ha the largest such zone planned
for the country's industrial heartland around Ho Chi Minh City, is an
Dollars 89m joint venture between the Central Trading and Development
Corporation of Taiwan (which is owned by the ruling Kuomintang party) and Ho
Chi Minh City's Communist people's committee. As in most such ventures the
foreign partner provides the money and the skills and the Vietnamese provide
the land.
'We have a lot of problems right now,' says Mr Chow Hong-Lin, one of the
Taiwanese managers at Tan Thuan.
First, there was a contingent of air defence troops who had to be moved out
of their barracks in the future export processing zone; at one point they
locked the gates and refused to go, and they were difficult to dislodge
because they had guns. Then the villagers had to be compensated for moving.
Some of them took the money and stayed in their houses, others built new
shacks in other parts of the land earmarked for development. Now the company
has to trace the descendants of the Chinese ancestors worshipped at the
shrines to negotiate their removal.
Clearing the land is only the start. The ground is boggy and tonnes of sand
were trucked in to level it. The underground water is dirty and Tan Thuan
must pay Dollars 4m to have fresh water piped in from outside the zone.
Electricity is in short supply in southern Vietnam, so Tan Thuan, together
with Hong Kong's New World Group, is planning to build a Dollars 250m
thermal power station at a village 20km away. In the meantime the 15 brave
companies which have already paid their deposits to set up factories in the
zone are being encouraged to bring their own generators.
Transport in Vietnam is also notoriously difficult, so Tan Thuan proposes to
spend Dollars 55m on building a 17km road to link the industrial estate to a
main road; and it intends to build a new port on the Saigon river.
There are compensations of course. In exchange for building the road, Tan
Thuan is to receive 600ha of land along the route, which represents an
opportunity for lucrative property development in a prime area not far from
the city centre.
But for the time being the project is like an obstacle course for investors.
'When we built our zone at Kaohsiung in Taiwan, it didn't have anything, it
was only a sandy beach,' sighs Mr Chow. 'We didn't have any problems.'

FT  18 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Brazil clinches pipeline accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL and Bolivia yesterday finalised an accord - first mooted in 1938 -
for a Dollars 3bn project to build one of the world's largest gas pipelines
amid considerable uncertainty over the financing.
Brazil's President Itamar Franco flew to the Bolivian town of Cochabamba to
sign the protocol to begin work on the 3,400km pipeline to supply Bolivian
gas to the main industrial centres of Brazil.
The first large project of Mr Franco's government, it aims to reduce the
country's almost total dependence on oil from the Middle East. It was hailed
by Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's foreign minister, as a solid
achievement for the government.
But it is unclear how funds will be raised for such an ambitious project.
Bolivia is one of the continent's poorest countries and Brazil continues to
wallow in economic crisis; its access to multilateral financing has been
inhibited by the collapse of its last accord with the International Monetary
Fund.
Negotiations are under way with the World Bank and private sector but a
Foreign Ministry spokesman said yesterday: 'We have not yet decided such
technical points as finance.'
The pipeline will transport daily 8m cubic metres, rising to 16m cu metres,
of natural gas from Santa Cruz de la Sierra in southern Bolivia to the six
principal cities of southern Brazil.
While diversifying Brazil's energy grid it will also reduce pollution and
save money; the price agreed is equivalent to Dollars 6 per barrel.
The pipeline will provide an important source of new income for Bolivia,
which is trying to reduce its dependence on tin and coca leaf. Previously
all its gas was sold to Argentina.
The signing of the accord is an important victory for the Sao Paulo business
community which has long been lobbying for it against heavy opposition from
Petrobras, the state oil company which fears its monopoly will be
threatened.
On the eve of Mr Franco's departure for Bolivia, Petrobras officials were
still trying to turn him against the idea, arguing it would be better to buy
from Paraguay.

MEMBERS of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade yesterday urged the
Philippines government to go further in liberalising trade and investment
policies which continue to hamper growth.
A report by Gatt economists, discussed yesterday by the body's governing
council, says economic reforms over the past decade have opened up the
Philippines economy and gone some way towards correcting its anti-export,
import substitution bias. But import-competing sectors, especially in
manufacturing, continue to be protected by trade barriers.
Average tariffs have fallen from more than 40 per cent to 25.6 per cent,
with a further reduction to 20 per cent planned by 1995. Import restrictions
have been removed, export taxes phased out and monopolies in commodity trade
abolished. However, tariffs are higher for manufactured goods than for raw
materials, while some key products are excluded from import liberalisation.
The report is particularly critical of the government's Car Development
Programme which promotes the domestic industry. This is backed by restraints
on imports of vehicles and components.
Gatt notes that, while restrictions on foreign investment have been eased,
those that remain continue to deter would-be investors.

<TEXT>
THE Mexican government has reacted defensively to charges by Mr Richard
Gephardt, majority leader in the US House of Representatives, that it is
financing US companies to move to Mexico, writes Damian Fraser.
Mr Gephardt had complained in a letter to President Salinas that the Mexican
government development bank, Nafinsa, has taken a 25 per cent stake in a
company, Amerimex Maquiladora Fund, that is buying up US companies to move
them to Mexico. So far, Amerimex has bought one textile company, and moved
40 per cent of its production to Merida, Mexico.
Critics of the proposed Nafta argue that American jobs will be lost, as
companies move from the US to Mexico in search of cheap labour.

FT  18 FEB 93 / UN members 'put own interests first'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE leading members of the UN are putting their own interests before the
organisation's commitment to collective security in deciding how to act in
Bosnia-Hercegovina, a UK foreign affairs select committee was told
yesterday.
Professor Rosalyn Higgins, UK representative on the International Human
Rights Committee, said in written evidence it was not the intention of the
UN Charter that member states should help countries under attack only if
they felt they had a direct national interest to do so. Neither did such
assistance depend on guarantees that no harm would come to their soldiers
nor that the outcome of any action was clear at the outset.
'But all of these reasons have been offered over the last weeks as to why
there should be no enforcement action by the UN in response to illegal
action in Bosnia,' Prof Higgins told the select committee on the role of the
UN.
Unlawfulness and aggression were encouraged by 'the debates about national
interest, the hesitations about military overstretching, and disputes
between allies as to what should and should not be done' by the UN.
Key members of the Security Council were insisting they could not do
everything alone, while at the same time refusing to ensure a role for other
member states.
The US and the UK were understandably concerned about the limits to the
burden each took in enforcing peace around the globe. But the burden could
only be shared properly if the resources of all member states were available
to the Security Council on call.

FT  18 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Telecom sector active

<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HINTS that the appointment of a new head of Oftel, the government's
regulatory body, was imminent sparked fears of a tougher pricing regime and
depressed telecoms stocks. BT fully-paid fell 5 to 398p, while the
partly-paid retreated 4 1/2 to 293p. Vodafone fell, but rallied ahead of a
big institutional meeting today and closed a penny ahead at 385p.
The effects of currency movements continued to be felt in the market as
Cable and Wireless was the latest stock to be seen as a major beneficiary of
last week's dollar strength.
Broker Hoare Govett lifted its current-year forecast by Pounds 125m to
Pounds 1.05bn. Analyst Mr Jim Ross said: 'With the US economy picking up
ahead of Europe, further dollar strengthening over the medium term is
likely.' Hoare also increased its new customer connection rate estimates for
Mercury, the C and W subsidiary, from 22,000 a month to 29,000. The shares
rose 10 to 740p.
Utilities bought
The water and electricity sectors performed strongly as investors sought out
defensive stocks in the wake of the US economic worries. Among waters,
Anglian put on 6 at 509p, so did Thames, at 510p, and Southern added 4 at
498p.
Ms Angela Whelan at BZW said: 'The sector is attractive for short-term
dividend growth together with the growing realisation that the regulatory
environment is increasingly stable.' Ms Whelan believes the sector's
defensive qualities will override the attractions of the recovery plays,
mainly because any economic revival will be slow. She added that selected
stocks, such as Severn Trent, 3 ahead at 490p, also had recovery potential.
Among electricity issues, London rose 7 to 451p, National Power 9 1/2 to
312p, PowerGen 10 1/2 to 314 1/2 p and Yorkshire 8 to 497p.
SmithKline weak
Pharmaceuticals group SmithKline Beecham suffered a sharp fall in an already
depressed sector. General pressure was exacerbated by worries that tax
benefits for companies who manufacture in Puerto Rico will be removed as
part of US financial reforms. Puerto Rico is a significant production centre
for the company's US operations.
In addition, the possibility that President Clinton might crack down on the
health sector in his State of the Union address late last night added to the
worries. SmithKline shed 10 to 439p in the 'A's and 9 to 382p in the Units.
Meanwhile, Fisons lost 5 to 238p, Glaxo 5 to 662p ahead of figures today,
and Wellcome 2 to 898p.
Tobacco stocks BAT Industries and Rothmans International declined on fears
of a possible rise in US taxes on overseas companies. BAT fell 11 to 958p,
and Rothmans 6 1/2 to 611p. Conglomerate Hanson slipped 5 1/2 to 244 1/2 p
on heavy turnover of 10m shares for the same reason.
Lasmo favoured
Oil group Lasmo rose 6 to 172p after securities house Smith New Court
published a buy recommendation. The house said it expected Lasmo to maintain
its dividend, based on the current level of sterling oil prices.
However, other oil shares were unmoved by the announcement of Opec
production cuts, with many in the market sceptical that they would be
adhered to. Opec set an output ceiling of 23.582m barrels per day (bpd) from
March 1, against January output of around 25m bpd. BP lost a penny to 261p
and Shell Transport gained 1 1/2 at 577 1/2 .
RTZ down
The world's biggest mining group, RTZ, saw its shares fall sharply in early
dealings after the group announced provisions for cutbacks within a US
subsidiary.
The registered shares were down 20p just before the official start of
trading on the surprise news that RTZ's Kennecott subsidiary was stopping
operations at its 54 per cent owned Creek mine in Alaska. The move will
entail provisions of Dollars 48m (Pounds 33.8m).
Although the news was unexpected, one analyst summed up the general view
when he said: 'It is a one-off provision and does not affect the underlying
trading position.' The market is looking for profits of around Pounds 300m,
against Pounds 308m last year, when RTZ reveals figures on March 11. The
share price recovered throughout the day, partly helped by a buy note from
US house Lehman Brothers, to end a net 5 off at 651p.
Abbey National up
High street bank Abbey National climbed 14 to 365p with the help of an
improved recommendation from UK merchant bank Kleinwort Benson.
House analyst Mr Peter Dutton moved to a buy from a hold. He said the shares
had underperformed the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index by 6 per cent over the
past month and 'the yield has got to a level where we are happy to be buying
again'. There was also talk of a badly handled buy order by one house.
Elsewhere in the sector, Barclays mopvked down 4 to 431p and National
Westminster receded 5 to 435p.
Pittencrieff jumped a further 27 to 378p on consideration of the company's
plan to split its telecommunications division from its oil and gas
activities.
A squeeze in P &amp; O saw the shares improve 11 to 557p. UK airports operator
BAA firmed 3 to 770p after announcing that it had applied for planning
permission to build a fifth terminal at Heathrow airport.
British Airways recovered 3 to 278p after Tuesday's fall that followed the
release of third-quarter results.
Publisher Emap moved forward 4 to 434p following a Pounds 20.65m acquisition
of business magazines, directories and related exhibition interests from
Thomson Information Services. Analysts said the market liked the fit and the
fact that the money came from Emap's existing cash pile.
Carlton Communications recovered 13 to 768p from its oversold position as
concern about rival products, particularly pay-for-view, proved hard to pin
down.
Worries that a large customer may cancel or defer aircraft orders depressed
defence and aerospace components group Smiths Industries. The shares gave up
15 to 349p, with funding worries at the European Fighter Aircraft, to which
Smiths is also a supplier, also dampening enthusiasm for the stock.
Several brokers have now turned cautious, including NatWest Securities and
Strauss Turnbull, which said: 'The company is vulnerable to defence cuts,
health issues in both the UK and US, and the deep late cycle recession in
civil aerospace.'
The sentiment in Smiths hurt Rolls-Royce shares, which relinquished 5 to
127p, and FR Group, down 9 at 253p.
It was, however, profit-taking along with worries about US taxation that led
Siebe 6 lower to 463p. Bargain hunters in TI Group helped the shares bounce
10 to 293p.
Motor stocks were in demand and GKN added 4 at 469p, ahead of figures next
month, while Thomas Cowie apprecated 6 to 195p.
A large stock overhang in J. Sainsbury weakened the shares, which closed 11
adrift at 511p. Marketmakers said a leading securities house had been unable
to place a line of 1.25m shares, but had eventually parcelled them off at
around 507p. Turnover was a bulky 4m.
Relief greeted the bond issue by Argyll Group and the shares moved ahead 5
1/2 to 368p. Food specialists said a conversion bond had been feared. Shaved
profits forecasts in Albert Fisher weakened the shares, down 1 1/2 at 66p.
The latest government retail figures boosted sentiment in the stores sector.
Boots, helped additionally by news on its Manoplax heart drug, advanced 6 to
491p, Dixons 9 to 218p, GUS 15 to 1585p and WH Smith 6 to 425p.
NatWest Securities raked up concern over the Forte dividend and turned
seller of the stock. The shares closed a penny better at 193p.
Selected brewing stocks recovered from their weakness earlier in the week
that was prompted by disappointing figures from Courage. Bass added 9 at
576p, with James Capel also said to be keen, while Scottish &amp; Newcastle
improved 10 to 424p.
A badly handled order upset Whitbread and the 'A' shares closed a net 2 off
at 455p.

FT  18 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Retail sales help offset US worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER A few uncomfortable moments in early trading, when market support
levels were tested, the UK stock market stood up well yesterday to the US
reaction to President Clinton's revised tax plans. A largely unexpected
increase of 1.6 per cent in domestic retail sales in January helped the
investment mood, but the London market was mixed at the close with dealers
keeping a wary eye on Wall Street, which was moving uncertainly at the
opening of its new trading session.
On the home front, stock market attention is now focused on today's UK
unemployment figures. But at last night's close, London was also keenly
awaiting President Clinton's State of the Union Address.
At the end of the session, weakness in sterling was also restraining the UK
equity market, although most strategists do not expect any further move in
domestic interest rates until the Budget in March. However, the chances of a
full-point rate cut then came under question as the pound gave further
ground in the foreign exchange markets yesterday.
Shares fell sharply at the opening in reaction to the 82-point loss in the
Dow Industrial Average overnight. The FT-SE 100 Index dropped through 2,800
without waiting for the March index future to open, but the early reading of
2,794.2 on the index proved to be the day's low.
The market quickly rallied, supported by a good level of interest by the
institutions, which appeared to regard the Footsie 2,800 area as buying
territory. Early losses were replaced by gains and the Footsie touched
2,820.8 before rises were trimmed ahead of the opening of the new Wall
Street session. With nothing further to go for, the market closed off the
top for a final reading on the FT-SE 100 of 2,814.0, a net 1.8 up on the
day.
The institutions were active, if very selective, and continued to buy stocks
in the utilities sectors, which are traditionally seen as defensive in times
of economic uncertainty. Stock Exchange data disclosed that retail, or
customer, business in equities bounced to Pounds 1.23bn on Tuesday, a
recovery from the brief reduction in retail activity at the beginning of the
week.
Seaq volume of 618.6m shares compared with 634.3m in the previous session,
with non-Footsie business making up a healthy 61 per cent of yesterday's
figure. Increased activity in the second line issues was confirmed by a gain
of 7.9 to 3,017.4 yesterday in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index.
The oil sector made a cautious response to the agreement hammered out by the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, with initial enthusiasm
checked following less favourable comments from Kuwait.
Store shares responded firmly to the January retail figures, which showed
the best performance for four years and were received eagerly as the latest
pointer to the progress of the domestic economy.
But the industrial conglomerates remained depressed beneath the new
uncertainty over the US dollar, with pharmaceuticals still unsettled by
fears of tighter federal control on US medical spending. The drugs sector
was also overshadowed by prospects for today's trading statement from Glaxo,
which has underperformed the stock market over the past four months.

FT  18 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARGAIN hunting, together with the release of favourable UK retail sales
figures, boosted trading in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
The poor opening of trading in the March contract on the FT-SE at 2,794
followed the continued overnight falls on Wall Street, and initially led
dealers to believe a dull and quiet session lay ahead. By 9am the contract
had declined to 2,788, which proved to be the day's low.
However, a feeling that Tuesday's falls had been overdone soon took hold and
caused a turnround in the fortunes of March as independent traders, followed
by some of the bigger securities houses, went bargain hunting.
The renewed buying gathered momentum with the release of buoyant retail
sales figures and continued into the afternoon, with the quiet opening on
Wall Street a relief to many traders.
The day's high of 2,827 was reached at around 3pm but was quickly followed
by a bout of profit-taking. The March contract closed at 2,815, up 17 from
Tuesday's poor finish and at a small discount to the underlying cash market.
Turnover was 11,253 lots.
In traded options, volume totalled 32,790 contracts, of which 14,586 were in
the FT-SE 100 option and 1,416 in the Euro FT-SE option. BP was the busiest
stock option with 1,761 lots transacted, followed by BT with 1,563. Glaxo
and BTR were also active.

FT  18 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow trades narrowly after
Tuesday's drama
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER the dramas of Tuesday, US stock markets were calmer yesterday, with
share prices spending most of the day in a narrow range either side of
opening values. Secondary stocks, however, continued to be plagued by heavy
selling, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 2.70 better at 3,312.19. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.61 off at 433.30, while the American SE
composite finished 4.45 lower at 401.36 and the Nasdaq composite 5.96 weaker
at 659.43. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 302.2m shares.
The markets opened in a solemn mood, with dealers and investors digesting
the implications of Tuesday's 83-point fall in the Dow, which had been
triggered by President Bill Clinton's announcement that he will raise taxes
levied on both middle-class and higher paid Americans.
Although few observers believe that the sell-off presages a sizeable
correction in the market, some investment strategists yesterday recommended
that aggressive investors should shift some of their assets from stocks to
cash for the immediate term.
As expected, there was some sporadic buying early on as bargain hunters went
in search of stocks which might have been oversold during Tuesday's frenzy.
Otherwise, there was little demand in the market, with most investors
choosing to sit out the day until the president's State of the Union address
to Congress in the evening.
Among individual sectors, selected cyclicals staged a modest rally: Alcoa
firmed Dollars 1 to Dollars 72 3/4 , International Paper added Dollars  3/4
at Dollars 65 1/2 and Goodyear Tire rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 67 5/8 .
Many leading drug stocks, which were hardest hit on Tuesday, remained under
pressure. Bristol-Myers Squibb fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 57 3/8 , Merck
slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 37 3/8 in volume of 4.6m shares, Johnson &amp;
Johnson gave up Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 42 and Pfizer shed Dollars  7/8 to
Dollars 59 1/4 .
One of the day's biggest gains was posted by Hewlett-Packard, which jumped
Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 72 1/4 in volume of 2m shares after announcing
better than expected first-quarter profits of Dollars 1.03 a share. Analysts
said they were pleased with the company's control of expenses and its order
growth.
Hewlett's strong showing gave a modest lift to other computer stocks,
Digital Equipment improving Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 42 3/4 , IBM Dollars
1/2 to Dollars 50 1/2 and Motorola Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 54 3/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, healthcare and medical stocks continued to suffer,
with US Healthcare weakening Dollars 1 to Dollars 44 3/4 and Amgen Dollars 1
5/8 to Dollars 48 1/4 .
Canada
TORONTO closed mixed yesterday as North American markets anxiously awaited
US President Clinton's address that night on his economic plan. The TSE 300
index gained 7.2 at 3,417.7, but declining issues led rises by 328 to 284
after volume of 35.7m shares.
The real estate group gained 1.8 per cent, buoyed by acceptance of
Bramalea's restructuring plan by two of the company's creditor groups.
Bramalea put on 7 cents at 59 cents. The 'A' shares of Trizec, which owns 67
per cent of Bramalea, rose 19 cents to CDollars 2.40.

FT  18 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei recovers as
region responds to slide in Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LATE buying by public pension funds came to the aid of share prices, and the
Nikkei average recouped an earlier decline prompted by the overnight fall on
Wall Street, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei finished a net 93.31 higher at 17,009.63, after falling to the
day's low of 16,760.81 in the morning session as investors were discouraged
by Tuesday's tumble in the Dow. Index-linked buying and support from public
funds prompted the rally in equity prices just before the close.
Volume contracted to 200m shares from 229m. Declines still outscored gains
by 521 to 413 at the close, with 188 issues unchanged. The Topix index of
all first section stocks was finally up 0.94 at 1,293.27, and in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 2.35 at 1,038.54.
Investors were inhibited by another rise in the yen, which moved above the
Y1.20 level against the dollar for the first time since October. Mr Yasushi
Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, expressed concern over the sharp
fluctuations.
Mr Masao Suzaki, an economist at the Bank of Tokyo, said Japan would
probably have to endorse a higher yen in the face of a surging trade
surplus, which rose by 39.4 per cent last month amid increasing pressure by
the US on the Japanese government to lift domestic demand.
Some export-oriented, high-technology issues were sold on the stronger yen.
Hitachi receded Y7 to Y678, falling below its 1992 low of Y685. Electric
power companies, in contrast, gained on the same score. Tokyo Electric Power
moved forward Y10 to Y2,590, Tohoku Electric Power Y40 to Y2,370 and Shikoku
Electric Power Y20 to Y2,500.
Retail issues encountered bargain hunting by foreign investors. Mitsukoshi
advanced Y18 to Y740 and Tokyu Y13 to Y569.
Dealers dabbled in Aids-related stocks. Nagase, a chemical trading company,
was the most active issue of the day, climbing Y21 to Y874. Kanematsu, a
medium-sized trading company, rose Y26 to Y412.
Housing-related shares were also bought by dealers. Daikyo, the leading
condominium builder, moved ahead Y29 to Y884. Sekisui House, which had been
sold ahead of its equity-linked bond issue, recovered Y24 to Y979. Nichias,
a construction materials maker, put on Y18 at Y487.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 73.64 to 18,332.64 in volume of 71m shares.
Roundup
THE REGION offered a moderate and by no means unanimous response to events
in New York.
AUSTRALIA partially recovered to end with the All Ordinaries index only 10.8
down at 1,601.3 after an early 1,593.3. Turnover came to a heavy 146.52m
shares worth ADollars 370m.
The index was dragged down by the US-linked News Corp, down 50 cents at
ADollars 29.94 in turnover of ADollars 50.24m. Banks, particularly ANZ,
saved the market from worse damage. ANZ topped industrial turnover for the
second day amid continuing takeover speculation, and closed 9 cents stronger
at ADollars 3.40.
NEW ZEALAND was less fortunate, the NZSE-40 index falling 20.94 to 1,600.71.
Volume was heavy at NZDollars 65m, some NZDollars 41m of that due to
Telecom, down 8 cents at NZDollars 2.75 after a sharp rise on staffing cuts
on Tuesday. Fletcher Challenge slipped 6 cents to NZDollars 2.55 after
posting interim profits at the top end of expectations.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index declined 12.80 to 1,616.56 in
volume of 120m shares, against 118.3m on Wednesday.
KUALA LUMPUR added further profit-taking to the Wall Street influence and
the KLSE composite index finished 9.20 lower at 625.81.
BANGKOK was unable to recover from a wave of early panic selling over the
announcement that First City Investment was forced to defer repaying matured
deposits. The SET index closed at 973.24, down 13.41, with the banking,
finance and property sectors suffering the most.
TAIWAN, seemingly untouched by the Dow, climbed 3.3 per cent in hectic
trade. The weighted index ended 126.43 higher at 4,001.16 on a wave of late
buying, turnover expanding from TDollars 31.8bn to a very heavy TDollars
43.25bn.
Financials, which had been rallying on signs of improving profits and links
to the premier-designate, Lien Chan, remained particularly strong.
HONG KONG finished moderately higher after a day of wide swings on rumours
that Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's political future could resume. The
Hang Seng index closed 21.84 ahead at 6,087.46 after opening 36 points down.
Turnover shrank from HKDollars 4.29bn to HKDollars 3.27bn.
Sun Hung Kai Properties topped the actives list and advanced HKDollars 1 to
HKDollars 31.75.

FT  18 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Leaders and laggards from Latin America
 -January offered a mixed outturn from the world's emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new year opened with strong performances in a number of the world's
emerging markets.
In Latin America, Chile led the way, far outperforming the region in dollar
terms, according to data supplied by the IFC, part of the World Bank.
Thailand also had a promising start to 1993 and, until a setback this week,
had been building on those gains in February; Turkey and Greece also feature
among the leaders.
Chile received a boost in January following a long-awaited announcement of
capital market reforms designed to broaden the range of investment options
available to private pension funds (AFPs). This measure allows them to
extend their investment opportunites beyond the 40 most liquid stocks. Later
in the month activity was stimulated further when the central bank said that
pension funds could invest up to 1 per cent of their assets in approved
companies.
The effect of these measures was to boost the IPSA index by about 12 per
cent on the month - average daily turnover more than doubled to some Dollars
28m.
First Boston, in a Latin American strategy document, comments that the
outlook for Chilean equities remains positive, helped by the rosier economic
outlook. 'Chile is expected to register a real GDP growth rate of 9.7 per
cent in 1992, which would be the best performance in some 30 years,' the
report says. 'Despite strong growth the year-to-year inflation fell to 12.7
per cent in 1992, down from 1991's 18.3 per cent and 1990's 27.3 per cent.'
However, this must be set against high interest rates and the strength of
the peso, which has had a negative effect on exports - these account for
some 30 per cent of GDP.
Conversely, Latin America also saw the worst performer on the month as
Venezuela dropped by more than 13 per cent in dollar terms. According to
Latin American Securities in London, public demonstrations against alleged
elec-toral fraud in December's local elections and rumours of another coup
attempt led to the market's sharp decline.
Some confidence returned as January drew to a close with the stock exchange
proposing a number of measures to improve the market's transparency and
efficiency. With presidential elections scheduled for December, most
analysts expect the market's volatility to continue throughout 1993.
Thailand, benefiting from good economic data, briefly saw the SET index
testing the 1,000 level, while declining interest rates also encouraged a
switch into equities.
Mr David Bates of Asia Equity says the rally was focused on the bank and
finance sectors following better than expected results from the former.
However, there was not enough momentum for the SET index to consolidate
around the 1,000 mark. He expects a short term technical correction to bring
the market back to around 930 to 940.

FT  18 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris strengthens on hopes of
rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY continental markets reflected nervousness ahead of last night's State
of the Union address in the US, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS built up momentum towards the close with strong performances from the
financial sector on renewed hopes of an easing in European interest rates.
The CAC-40 index, which had been as low as 1,867 earlier, finished 26.80
higher at 1,904.97, a gain of 1.4 per cent on the day. Turnover was also
strong at FFr3.1bn after Tuesday's FFr2.4bn.
A slight easing in the Bundesbank's variable money market rate also helped
to encourage the belief that interest rates will come down in the short
term. UAP gained FFr15 to FFr544, Suez rose FFr7.00 to FFr287.20 and Societe
Generale put on FFr2 to FFr626.
Rhone-Poulenc, whose 1992 results were well received, saw its investment
certificates improve FFr8 to FFr550 while the shares eased FFr1 to FFr548
ahead of entering the CAC on Monday.
FRANKFURT recovered from Tuesday's post-bourse fall of about 20 points in
the DAX index, following that day's tumble in the Dow. The DAX closed only
10.96 lower at 1,653.26 as selling pressure failed to materialise.
Turnover fell from DM7.3bn to DM6.1bn. Dealers said that foreign investors,
who had taken their profits on Wall Street, were putting some of their money
into the D-Mark via German equities. Siemens, they said, was a case in point
as it closed only DM1.70 lower at DM650.
Elsewhere there were falls virtually across the board in financials,
carmakers and chemicals. In the latter sector, Degussa emerged with less
damage than most, slipping DM1.50 to DM358.50 after a 14 per cent gain in
December quarter profits was offset by a forecast of nil profits growth for
the full year.
ZURICH saw selling in chemicals on fears over the President Bill Clinton's
planned reduction in US health care costs. The SMI index fell 17.5 to
2,112.9 as Roche certificates slipped SFr70 to SFr4,100 and Ciba-Geigy fell
SFr11 to SFr665.
In industrials, Brown Boveri and the cement producer Holderbank, fell by
SFr50 to SFr3,880 and SFr7 to SFr584 respectively.
MILAN, beset by rumours regarding Fiat and Olivetti, came back from a weak
opening, the Comit index closing 1.74 lower at 498.53. Turnover was
estimated to be in line with Tuesday's L242bn.
Fiat has been influencing the market throughout the week as investors
continue to ignore the group's denial that it plans either to sell some of
its assets, is about to announce a joint venture or that Deutsche Bank is to
lift its shareholding. The shares fixed down L150 at L4,949 before rising to
L5,270 on the kerb.
Olivetti became the latest subject of speculation as some investors took the
view that Stet might be interested in the group but, as with Fiat, there was
no substance to the reports. Olivetti fixed L99 higher at L2,020.
STOCKHOLM saw a decline in Astra following the decline in US pharmaceutical
stocks overnight. The pharmaceutical stock had been strong ahead of next
week's 1992 results but the B lost SKr13 to SKr689 yesterday, as the
Affarsvarlden general index fell 10.6 to 974.0 in high turnover of some
SKr1.1bn after Tuesday's SKr724m. Volvo was another big loser with a SKr14
decline in the B shares to SKr380.
MADRID reacted to pressure on the peseta, which came under heavy pressure
against the D-Mark in foreign exchange markets. The general index closed
0.95 lower at 232.50.
AMSTERDAM marked time, Royal Dutch picking up 80 cents to Fl 153.10,
following the completion of Opec talks in Vienna, while the CBS tendency
index slipped 0.6 to 97.7.
ISTANBUL soared 8.6 per cent to an all-time-high of 5,756.49, compared with
the previous high of 5,749.69 on August 2, 1990, the day Iraq invaded
Kuwait. Turnover also hit an all-time high, of TL800bn.
Brokers said that reports of major deposit rate cuts planned by three
leading banks, sharp rate falls in the bond markets and cash flooding the
lira market due to bulky bond maturities all helped boost demand.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Money Markets: Sterling futures rally
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT sterling futures staged a rally in late trading after Scandinavia Bank
 -rumoured to deal on behalf of George Soros, the international investor -
bought actively.
In earlier trading the March and June contracts had drifted lower on the
back of the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report and better than
expected retail sales figures.
The Bank's report warned that a further reduction in interest rates could
jeopardise the government's aim of defeating inflation. The retail sales
figures, although widely leaked over the weekend, nevertheless heartened the
market. Sales rose by 1.6 per cent in January, month-on-month, against
expectations of a 0.5 per cent monthly increase.
In the last 15 minutes of trading, the June contract rallied to 94.50,
although this was still below the previous close of 94.57. The March
contract ended at around 93.98, a net 6 basis points below the previous
night's close.
Traders said that two weeks ago the market was pricing in a rate cut at
around the time of the Budget next month, but that it had now become
sceptical about early monetary easing. This conflicted with the prevailing
view on the foreign exchanges that the govern-ment would put its desire to
see economic recovery ahead of its low-inflation goal.
A money market dealer commented: 'Today, people are talking about the
government waiting until the summer for another rate cut, if we are to get
one at all.'
Interbank rates were once again fairly static, although easy liquidity meant
that rates at the shorter end eased. The Bank's forecast liquidity shortage
was Pounds 200m. This was relieved in the afternoon when the Bank purchased
Pounds 208m of band-1 bank bills at 5 7/8 per cent. The overnight rate
stayed at around 5 per cent for most of the day.
Trading in French Pibor futures was described by one dealer as weird. The
March contract fell about 10 basis points from the previous close to 88.39,
but the June contract added the same amount to finish at 90.85.
Dealers said there was still talk of a base rate rise in France, with
investors still worrying about the ability of a new centre-right government
to hold the franc in the European monetary system.
In Germany, sentiment about rates remained positive, boosted by hopes of
continued moderate wage agreements.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound closes at record low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING dropped to its lowest ever close against the D-Mark yesterday,
after better than expected retail sales figures failed to convince foreign
exchange markets that the government would not cut interest rates again in
the near future, writes Emma Tucker.
Mr Rob Loewy, a foreign exchange dealer at Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking,
said: 'The scenario is that in spite of the reasonably optimistic numbers we
saw today, stimulation of the economy will still be put ahead of the
exchange rate.'
Mr Paul Chertkow, chief currency economist at UBS Phill-ips &amp; Drew,
commented: 'The economic situation here still warrants lower interest rates.
The markets have reassessed the economy and believe that, although the
retail sales figures are better, the industrial sector is still very
depressed.'
A substantial amount of institutional selling of the pound for the French
franc was reported in late trading and the strength of the D-Mark added to
pressure on sterling. It closed in London at DM2.3500, down 1 1/4 pfennigs
on the day. Against the dollar the pound was mildly lower at Dollars 1.4440,
but later in New York it finished at Dollars 1.4455.
The US currency continued to drift downwards, with the market still
uncertain about President Clinton's State of the Union speech. Dealers were
concerned that zealous reduction of the budget deficit through higher taxes
would impede economic recovery. The dollar ended at DM1.6280, compared with
the previous night's close of DM1.6315. It slipped further in New York to
close at DM1.6235.
The morning saw strong buying of the D-Mark, mainly at the expense of the
Italian lira and the Danish krone. Enthusiasm for the German currency
stemmed from a perception in the market that German monetary policy remained
on course and that there would be no easing of rates at today's Bundesbank
council meeting.
The lira continued to be plagued by rumours of political corruption and
economic weakness. Analysts said it was likely to remain under considerable
pressure until it became clear whether or not the Italian prime minister
intended to reshuffle his cabinet. The lira finished in London at L951.1 per
D-Mark, against a previous close of L943.3.
The French franc was slightly weaker against the D-Mark, with the market
unable to make up its mind about the currency's direction. Some believe
further pressure on the franc, in the wake of a right-wing parliamentary
election victory, would lead to a fixed-rate link between the franc and the
D-Mark. Yesterday Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, and Mr Michel
Sapin, his French counterpart, ruled out such a mini-monetary union.
Others believe that monetary easing in Germany will come early enough to
rescue the French franc from devaluation. Mr Chertkow said he did not think
investors were building up short franc positions.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Survey of World Taxation (8): Overlapping umbrellas - Andrew
Bolger inspects the anatomy of an Anglo-Dutch deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TAX benefits of a large international deal are seldom quantified
directly, so the merger between Reed International of the UK and Reed
Elsevier of the Netherlands was an interesting exception.
The merged group, which with a market value of about Pounds 6bn is one of
the world's biggest publishers, said the merger would cut its effective tax
rate by up to one percentage point a year. Given that the combined companies
made estimated pre-tax profits of Pounds 424m last year, that is not an
insignificant saving.
Two of the people most involved in structuring tax aspects of the deal were
William Harrison-Cripps and Nicholas Hughes, both partners in Price
Waterhouse, although both emphasised that the commercial aims were set by
the clients.
Harrison-Cripps, head of European M&amp;A tax services, said: 'I think what we
ended up with - which is pretty well what we put to them on the back of a
fag-packet - is a long way different from what they had in mind at the very
early stages, but that is fairly normal.'
He added: 'What we were talking about was what would be the ideal commercial
structure, if we could achieve it fiscally. Tax must never drive it.'
The merger, which took effect on January 1, was on a 50-50 basis, without
any premium or cash payment to either set of shareholders, and both Reed and
Elsevier kept separate stock market listings. Reed was granted a 5.8 per
cent cross-holding in Elsevier, to reflect the UK group's larger
capitalisation.
Although Anglo-Dutch mergers are inevitably compared with early link-ups
such as Unilever and Royal Dutch/Shell, Harrison-Cripps said: 'I
specifically told them that they did not have to live only with a Shell-type
structure. If we had been putting together Shell today, we would have done
it differently.'
Harrison-Cripps strongly opposed the parallel company structure with two
parallel operational streams, and complex mirror boards. He said: 'Over time
 -and this is nothing to do with tax - you are looking at how quickly you
can bring together and harmonise the two structures. The perception of
working for the umbrella organisation is quite a powerful thing, and not to
be passed over lightly.'
Hughes said: 'You can look at the Reed/Elsevier structure and show it is not
totally dissimilar from the Royal Dutch/Shell and the Unilever structures,
but better because there is more flexibility on how you can set the
dividends and you've got a company in the middle that gives strong
operational control, and you can still get the money tax-efficiently to
shareholders.'
Close examination of the combined group's structure illustrates two of the
deal's most important features: operating subsidiaries will be grouped under
a UK holding company, Reed Elsevier, while finance subsidiaries come under
Elsevier Reed Finance, a Dutch company which enjoys the continental European
freedom to put money into a tax haven and earn tax-free interest on it.
Harrison-Cripps said: 'It is not some underhand trick to deprive the UK
Exchequer - actually, quite the contrary: we could have had the choice of
bringing nothing to the UK Exchequer, because the whole lot was destined to
go to an overseas country.
'Our task had to be to set something up and convince people that it was
right and still proper for us to have a UK holding company and still allow
the group as a whole to have these benefits which we would have had anyway
if we had set it up as a Dutch holding company. In other words, to put us as
a country on an equal footing.'
Other notable features are that the values of the two groups were equalised
without the use of cash, without any capital gains tax being due, and money
can be remitted to Dutch shareholders without incurring any Advanced
Corporation Tax. Hughes said: 'If we couldn't have solved these problems,
then the deal would not have happened.'
Price Waterhouse worked on the tax problems with Freshfields and Linklaters,
legal advisers to Reed and Elsevier respectively, and their merchant
bankers, SG Warburg and Swiss Bank.
Harrison-Cripps said: 'The most interesting thing for us was our early
involvement in the transaction. What all of us had been trying to defeat,
which had been fairly traditional in the accountancy profession, was that
you learned about something in the press - and then you might be lucky to
get a crumb or two from the table.'
Even having achieved that, Hughes said the question of who was in control
was always an issue when a team was involved. 'We can work effectively in a
corporate team with other players, such as Freshfields. The competitive
element is that the lawyers might say that they can do all of the work,
including the tax, but they don't have same international representation.'
The merger cost between Pounds 30m and Pounds 35m in advisers' and listings
fees, reflecting the fact that the enlarged group operates in 43 countries.
Harrison-Cripps is in no doubt that his team's tax work was worth 'an
infinite amount' to Reed and Elsevier, relative to Price Waterhouse's fee of
less than Pounds 2m. 'They will have had a payback within a month or so, in
terms of the tax saving and the fact that the merged group works.'

FT  18 FEB 93 / Survey of World Taxation (7): Knowledge is all - Computer
data bases open new horizons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHAN S. SCHWARZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ability of computers to store and permit the rapid retrieval of
extensive amounts of information makes them ideal for gathering tax
information.
Even companies and their advisers who are engaged in purely domestic
activities have a never-ending struggle to keep up with new developments.
In the UK, for example, tax experts have to cope with an annual Finance Act
of more than 100 pages, High Court decisions running to hundreds of pages,
and more than 100 press releases and assorted statements each year.
The amount of information to be dealt with multiplies by the number of
countries concerned. In addition, the interaction between tax systems
requires careful analysis.
The vast majority of computer systems used by tax advisers are essentially
databases. A number of companies such as Lexis operate substantial legal
databases on line. Although their focus is domestic, they do give tax
researchers access to material from a number of countries.
In addition, countries' specific tax databases are available to aid in
research. Most on-line databases need skilled researchers to extract the
information efficiently.
The charges for access to the databases ensure that their use is frequently
limited to cataloguing materials such as judicial decisions on a particular
point.
The cost of retrieving a full text is often prohibitive. As a result, tax
advisers still need to rely on hard copy.
In reaction to this, a number of publishers, particularly in North America,
such as CCH, Prentice Hall and others now offer tax databases on compact
disks with read-only memories (CD-ROM).
These are usually electronic versions of hard copy publications. On-line
databases are often, therefore, used as support to provide for the most
up-to-date information only. Such systems offer speed of access, ease of
updating and mobility when combined with portable computers.
In the international arena, choices are more limited. The only source
entirely devoted to international issues is the International Bureau of
Fiscal Documentation, the non-profit publishing affiliate of the
International Fiscal Association. It maintains CD-ROM databases on European
and Latin American taxation, as well as one providing the full text in
English of double tax treaties. These are supplemented by an on-line data
service.
Once the tax adviser has extracted the relevant information, its evaluation,
interrelation and application is largely left in the hands of the adviser.
The development of tax programs that actually use the data to assist in
planning decisions has been slow.
For several years, domestic tax programs have been available to assist
planners manipulate data with what are effectively spreadsheet applications.
Typically, tax computations are made and planning may be done through 'what
if' analysis.
Two forays into computerised international tax planning have been by major
accounting firms KPMG and Price Waterhouse in the field of expatriate
taxation. The KPMG Peat Marwick 'EXPATRIATE' program calculates tax and
social security for proposed employee assignments overseas. It covers 40
countries, 26 Swiss cantons, the Canadian provinces and territories, five
American states plus a generic American state for locations not on the
system.
The Price Waterhouse 'IAMF' program also calculates the cost of sending
employees to particular locations. Its system covers 51 countries, plus
American states and Canadian provinces, as well as some Swiss cantons. Both
systems are available under licence.
The only corporate international tax planning program that is available by
licence is 'COMTAX' produced by Comtax AB. Again, the combination of
database and spreadsheet evaluates the effect of transferring earnings from
one country to another within a multinational group on the total after tax
profits of the group.
These planning programs help to generate possibilities that tax advisers or
managers might not immediately think of, or eliminate possibilities that are
simply unworkable. They also help to calculate the impact of taxes on
existing corporate structures and suggest possibilities for reorganisation.
They may make it easier to decide which company in a multinational group
should be the vehicle for making an acquisition or for post-acquisition
restructuring.
None of these systems can make judgments as to whether particular tax rules
are applicable or not. They merely calculate the result.
Even though they are becoming indispensable in dealing with international
tax problems, the human touch is still required and traditional legal skills
are necessary.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Survey of World Taxation (6): In search of benefits -
Jonathan S. Schwarz on the tax status of expatriate executives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHAN S. SCHWARZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HIGHLY mobile executive is one of the key features of the increasing
internationalisation of business.
Citizens of EC states can work anywhere in the Community and this privilege
is likely to be extended shortly to citizens of Efta countries.
While immigration and work permit barriers may be falling, the tax
impediments and cost of transferring senior employees from home may be
significant. Executives expect at least to be no worse off financially if
they work in other countries than if they stay at home. In many cases, they
expect financial rewards for the disruption to their personal lives.
Virtually all industrialised countries tax residents on their worldwide
income. Ceasing to be resident in a country usually involves remaining
physically outside the country and severing all ties for a significant
period of time. It is therefore only feasible for medium and long term
postings.
In the case of executives required to spend parts of a year in a particular
country, most double tax treaties following the OECD Model will absolve the
executive from tax outside his home base if he or she spends less than 183
days a year in a country performing services and if the cost of employing
the executive is not borne by a local company or permanent establishment.
Separate rules are, however, provided for company directors which cause them
to be taxed on directors' fees paid by local companies even if they are not
resident where the company is situated. Special rules are also provided for
those in the shipping and airline industries.
Even such relatively straightforward situations give rise to problems as a
result of anomalies between countries. For example, the UK excludes the day
of arrival and departure in determining whether visitors are physically
present in the UK. The US, on the other hand, includes the days of arrival
and departure.
Other issues which affect executives are differences in tax year ends as
well as administrative costs in filing tax returns or claiming refunds where
tax is withheld at source. Those may be expensive and time-consuming.
Longer term moves by executives are accompanied by salary adjustments to
take into account not only tax differentials but also other cost of living
adjustments. The tax adjustments are most commonly effected by either tax
equalisation or tax protection arrangements.
Under tax equalisation, the employee pays no more income tax than if he or
she had stayed home. The company meets any additional tax cost if the
individual is posted to a higher tax country and the company may make
savings if the posting is to a lower tax country.
Tax protection involves the company agreeing to meet any additional costs of
income tax if higher than the home country level. Any savings because of
posting to a lower tax country are retained by the executive.
A number of countries seek to attract international and regional
headquarters operations with tax incentive packages designed to attract
foreign executives on a temporary basis. The UK and Ireland, for example,
tax resident but not domiciled individuals on local source income and gains.
Foreign income and gains are taxed only when remitted.
Belgium and the Netherlands also have attractive regimes for temporary
foreign residents which exempt them from tax on foreign investment income
and capital gains. In the Netherlands, such executives are also entitled to
a 35 per cent tax deduction from salary subject to Dutch tax.
Executive incentive packages also give rise to challenges in an
international context. Most packages are designed with the tax rules of the
executives' home base in mind, and are often difficult to duplicate with
precision. An area of increasing importance in this regard is in relation to
pension benefits and employee share plans.
The tax treatment of pension provisions varies from country to country. The
tax deductibility of pension contributions by the employee and the taxation
of investment income by the pension fund itself depend in part on whether
the fund and the executive are both resident in the same country.
Where mobile executives retire outside their country of employment,
additional issues arise as to the taxation of pension payments. These
problems are graphically illustrated in the Bachmann case that was recently
brought before the European Court of Justice.
Mr Bachmann, a German national, had commenced payments on insurance policies
agains sickness and disability as well as life insurance while resident in
Germany. Having moved to Belgium to work, the Belgian tax authorities
refused deductions of these premiums.
The Belgian income tax code permits deduction of insurance premiums agains
professional income in computing taxable income. However, they are only
deductible if paid to mutual companies recognised in Belgium and no foreign
companies have ever been recognised. In the case of retirement and death
related insurance, premiums had to be paid in Belgium.
The European Court recognised that the Belgian tax legislation contravened
the Treaty of Rome rules dealing with freedom of movement of workers and
freedom to provide services.
Contrary to the opinion of the Advocate General, however, the Court
concluded that the non-deductibility of the premium was necessary to
compensate the state for nontaxability of the pension.
In other cases, the foreign pension fund may not be recognised as a tax
exempt savings vehicle and the employee may be taxed on income cumulated in
the fund on amounts related to his or her contributions.
Social security contributions constitute a significant cost and the mobile
executive may suffer mismatches of contributions and benefits. The problems
are eased by international agreement.
For example, the UK/US social security agreement permits US employees to
remain liable to US social security contributions only for assignments of up
to five years and vice versa for UK executives in the US.
Within the EC, the rules are complex. In general, social security
contributions are applicable in the country where the person is employed,
even if he lives in a different member state. Temporary transfers for
periods up to one year normally enable employees to remain under the social
security rules of the home state. However, the EC regulation on social
security schemes recognises the application of bilateral agreements in
several cases between member states, as well as recognising circumstances
where individuals may be subject to social security payments in two members
states simultaneously.
The complexities and costs often lead companies to contrive base locations
for some or all of their expatriate executives.
Although the taxation of businesses has been identified as an area for
harmonisation within the EC, the taxation commissioner, Mrs Christiane
Scrivener, has made it clear that personal tax harmonisation is not on the
Commission's agenda. Detailed planning of multinational remuneration
packages will continue to be a requirement for many years to come.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Survey of World Taxation (5): The network expands -
Bilateral treaties girdle the globe

INTERNATIONAL double taxation has long been identified as an inhibition to
international trade and investment. It arises when two countries each assert
their taxing authority over the same source of income or capital gains.
Although international tax treaties have been around for over 100 years, it
is only since the Second World War that they have grown in numbers and
significance. There are now more than 1,200 treaties dealing with taxation.
Tax treaty networks have developed around patterns of trade and investment.
Not surprisingly, therefore, the most dense network of treaties is among
OECD members. Treaties between former colonial powers such as the UK and
France and their former colonies are also notable networks.
Within the European Community, the treaty network is almost complete. Only
Greece, Portugal and Spain do not have income tax treaties with all other
member states. The European Commission, however, has encouraged the
completion of the intra-EC network to assist in eliminating fiscal barriers
to cross-border trade and Investment.
The vast majority of treaties deal with income tax and capital gains and are
patterned on the models prepared by the OECD fiscal committee. There are a
number of more limited treaties dealing with shipping and air transport
income. These are usually found between countries where double taxation is
not an important issue generally because of the limited way in which each
country levies its taxes on local source income only.
Since, with two exceptions, all tax treaties are bilateral, there are
variations and anomalies between tax treaties of which multi-national
businesses and investors have sought to take advantage.
This treaty shopping has been exacerbated in relation to countries such as
the US which, in spite of its size and importance in the world economy, has
a relatively limited treaty network. It currently only has about 40 income
tax treaties compared with, for example, the UK's 80 or so treaties. The
OECD recently released a revised model treaty to replace its earlier
versions released in 1963 and 1977. The new OECD Model Convention - and tax
authorities generally - have sought to impose limitations on what is
regarded as permissible use of tax treaties, particularly by persons who the
authorities believe were not intended to benefit from them.
The US has led the way in seeking to impose so-called limitation of benefits
provisions in order to exclude residents of third countries from benefiting
from particular treaties.
This has given rise to enormous technical difficulties in drafting the rules
and particularly in taking into account the recommendations of the OECD that
limitations of benefits clauses should be restricted so as to exclude bona
fide economic activities that may unintentionally be covered by them.
Limitation of benefits clauses have also caused considerable difficulty for
countries such as the Netherlands who have sought to encourage
multi-nationals to use it as a base location for international operations
and financing in particular.
It has therefore facilitated the use of its tax treaty network by companies
based outside the Netherlands.
In the EC, this issue is further complicated by the interaction between
Community law prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of nationality under
the Treaty of Rome and such limitation of benefits clauses.
Many experts hold that member states are not entitled to enter into treaties
that discriminate against EC nationals, whether they are individuals or
companies. This area of EC law is in its earliest stages of development and
the outcome is uncertain.
A new income tax treaty just signed between the Netherlands and the US
contains an extensive limitation of benefits article along with a memorandum
of understanding requiring claimants under the treaty to demonstrate their
entitlement to its benefits.
Apart from Dutch individual residents and non-profit organisations, Dutch
resident companies may qualify if they fall within one of seven different
tests.
While the clause may deter the most aggressive treaty shopper, it will also
add significantly to the compliance costs of bona fide taxpayers seeking to
benefit from the treaty.
The OECD Model Treaties and those following it have approached the avoidance
of double taxation largely by seeking to eliminate tax in the country of
source of income. The country of residence of the taxpayer has retained the
right to levy taxes on foreign income earned by their residents. This
largely favours capital exporting countries and as a result many developing
countries have questioned the value of tax treaties.
Treaty networks between developing countries are the thinnest. In addition,
the UN Model Convention has attempted to shift the balance in favour of
countries where income is generated.
Some developing countries have recently succeeded in concluding treaties
which permIt them to tax the activities of foreign investors more
extensively. They leave the country of residence to rely on foreign tax
credits to eliminate double taxation.
These successes have typically been in the area of more expansive
definitions of permanent establishment and entitlement of developing
countries to impose withholding taxes on payments for technical assistance
and related services. Under the OECD Model such services would not be taxed
in the country of source of the income.
Although the avoidance of double taxation was the original purpose of tax
treaties, the prevention of tax evasion has become an increasingly important
issue. The internationalisation of economic relations has caused growing
interest in the reciprocal supply of information between countries on the
basis of which domestic tax laws are administered This is the case even if
the application of a treaty is not in question. Exchange of information
falls into three categories:
routine exchanges such as the details of interest dividend or royalty
payment;
spontaneous exchanges where tax authorities of one state believe that the
authorities in another state may be interested in a particular piece of
information;
exchanges on request.
Tax administrations keep their cards close to their chests in relation to
this issue and little is made public about the amounts and nature of such
collaboration.
In most countries, taxpayers do not know when information is being exchanged
and typically no opportunity is provided to correct information erroneously
given.
In some countries, such as Germany, taxpayers must be advised when
information is exchanged, however. Other programmes are well publicised such
as the US-Canadian joint audit programme where simultaneous investigations
are conducted by both the Internal Revenue Service and Revenue Canada.
Some treaties provide for mutual assistance in the field of tax collection.
These are unusual, however, and are limited in their scope.
Within the EC, a Directive on exchange of information sets out extensively
the rules for this process covering all fields of taxation.
The only other multilateral attempt at such collaboration is to be found in
the OECD/Counc1 of Europe Convention for Mutual Administrative Assistance.
This provides for extensive cooperation between tax authorities in not only
exchanging information but in pursuing tax claims on behalf of treaty
partners.
Although it has been ratified by the US, other major industrial countries
such as the UK and Germany have indicated they will not ratify the
Convention and it has thus far not entered into force.
As the international tax treaty network matures, it is likely that more and
more attention will be focused on refining the rules governing double
taxation of income and capital gains. One by-product of the process is
clearly that scope for abuse of tax treaties will become more limited.
Companies involved in international business will need to pay more attention
to ensuring that they can fall within tax treaty rules, even if they do not
engage in aggressive tax planning.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Survey of World Taxation (2): First months are critical -
Andrew Hill measures the progress of the EC's new VAT system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community has a new barrier-free internal market, a new system
for monitoring value added tax on cross-border transactions, and new minium
rates of excise and VAT. So far, the EC does not have a whole new set of
problems - but Brussels officials are ready for complaints and difficulties
should they arise.
The new VAT system, which came into force at midnight on New Year's Eve,
allowed member states to lift internal border controls on goods and sweep
away some 60m administrative documents filled in by companies every year
under the old system. But proof that the new system works will not come
until the spring, when data on cross-border transactions start to flow into
national tax authorities via the EC's specially established computer system.
The European Commission has accepted that there will be confusion in the
early months of the new barrier-free internal market. Indeed, senior
Brussels officials have urged national authorities to be lenient with
companies which accidentally break the rules in the first half of 1993.
But Mrs Christiane Scrivener, who retained her responsibility for fiscal
matters in the December reshuffle of European commissioners, has already
made it clear that there will be no quarter for governments which are
sluggish about adopting the relevant legislation.
Inevitably the new system has come in for criticism. Companies, some of
which admit they left preparations for the single market to the last moment,
have been irritated by what they consider an unnecessary new bureaucracy for
handling VAT transactions. Some member states have been slow to issue VAT
codes to businesses, and others have not moved quickly enough to bring rates
into line with legally-binding guidelines agreed last year.
In the specific area of excise duties, there are worries that a failure to
reduce the gap between high-excise countries like Denmark and low-taxers
like Spain will lead to 'bootlegging' of cheap cigarettes across the
Community.
Over the next two years - the limit of the current Commission's term in
office if the Maastricht treaty is approved - Mrs Scrivener will be
preoccupied by making these new systems work. Late last year she rushed
through directives aimed at simplifying the new approach so it would not
unduly penalise companies involved in 'triangular trade', and she is eager
to maintain pressure on member states to bring their excise duties more into
line.
But Mrs Scrivener must also bear in mind the EC's broad commitment to
introduce a 'definitive' VAT system by January 1, 1997.
At the moment, only individuals benefit from the most logical indirect tax
system - paying VAT on goods where they are bought, at the local rate. The
introduction of this 'origin' system and the abolition of travellers'
allowances for tax-paid items has encouraged a mini-boom in cross-border
shopping.
The revenue at stake in such small-scale cross-border business was very
small, although consumer groups hope a small increase in intra-EC
bargain-hunting will have a disproportionate effect on prices in domestic
markets. Such is the sensitivity of national treasuries, however, that even
for individuals there are exceptions to the 'origin' VAT rule for some
items, such as cars and mail-order goods.
More importantly, member states are not yet prepared to make the sacrifices
needed to introduce the same system for cross-border commercial
transactions. That is the aim for 1997, but it will involve a great deal of
preparatory work.
For example, some sort of central 'clearing house' would have to be set up
for all EC cross-border transactions, to ensure that national treasuries do
not lose out. Senior Commission tax officials reckon work will have to start
on such a system before the end of 1993.
For the time being, however, Mrs Scrivener's advisers are reluctant to add
to companies' worries about the existing situation by beginning to talk
about a 'definitive' system. They even reject the tag 'provisional' for the
system which came into force on January 1. 'We will start our reflections
(on a definitive system) next year, but we don't want to mix the two
things,' says one.
Advocates of a definitive system worry that even if companies decide they
want to move on to the simpler system, governments will try to hang on to
the transitional VAT regime, unless they are put under intense political
pressure by Brussels. 'Certain governments will say that it isn't in their
own interests (to move to a definitive system),' says one Commission
official.
In the meantime, Brussels officials are likely to work on the technical
aspects of a definitive system so that when the time comes to make a
political commitment, the groundwork will already have been laid.
Mrs Scrivener's other priorities are in the even more sensitive area of
direct taxation. Advisers suggest she will press for member states to
approve outstanding directives aimed at eliminating double taxation for
companies with subsidiaries in other member states, held up in the council
at the end of last year. 'It's indispensable that these texts are adopted,'
says one official.
The Commission may also take another look at the vexed question of
harmonising savings taxes, without putting EC savers at a disadvantage
compared with those depositing their savings from outside the Community. A
harmonisation proposal tabled in 1989 was resisted by member states.
Finally, the Commission is keeping a sharp eye on member states' double
taxation pacts with non-EC countries.
Mrs Scrivener warned last year, when outlining the Commission's position on
the Ruding report on corporate taxation, that Brussels was studying the
effect of recent tax treaties - in particular between certain member states
and the US. She warned that such treaties could discriminate against EC
companies setting up in other EC states.
Advisers confirm that they are now working out how to end such
discrimination - either by introducing new EC-wide legislation, or possibly
by taking a test case to the European Court of Justice.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Survey of World Taxation (4): Revenue showdown - Deficit
challenge to Clinton and Congress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US POLITICIANS and economists have for years been wringing their hands over
the ever-growing federal budget deficit. But with the outlook now worse than
ever, the time may be approaching when the administration and Congress unite
to tackle it.
During his election campaign, Mr Bill Clinton shied away from the
catastrophist approach of Mr Ross Perot, the self-financed candidate who
argued that the deficit was a 'mad aunt in the basement' which must be dealt
with before anything else.
Just before Mr Clinton took office last month, however, his predecessor, Mr
George Bush, presented a farewell pro forma budget projecting that the
deficit would, on current policies, grow from Dollars 290bn in 1992 to
Dollars 320bn in 1998 - substantially gloomier than the Office of Management
and Budget's earlier predictions, and its most honest forecast for years.
Mr Clinton seized this opportunity to explain that things were much worse
than he had been told, and that he would therefore be unable to fulfil his
campaign plan to halve the deficit in four years.
Preparation for the presentation of an economic plan, due yesterday, has,
therefore, included much fervent discussion of what combination of spending
cuts and tax increases will best provide the short term stimulus that Mr
Clinton seeks to ensure that the economic recovery does not, once again, bog
down, while at the same time offering a prospect of deficit reduction over
the longer term.
The economic plan laid out by Mr Clinton during his campaign included a
curious mix of the broad brush (unspecified administrative savings) and the
bizarrely detailed (an end to the Dollars 18.6m a year subsidy to honey
producers) but contains two main revenue raisers:
the top income tax rate would climb for the richest 2 per cent of taxpayers
from 31 per cent to 36 per cent. This, coupled with a surtax on
millionaires, would bring in an extra Dollars 17.8bn in 1993, rising to
Dollars 23.0bn in 1996.
the prevention of tax avoidance by foreign companies is estimated to yield
an extra Dollars 9.0bn this year, rising to Dollars 13.5bn in 1996.
Mr Clinton now intends to raise corporate income tax rates, probably to 36
per cent, in order to stop the wealthy from shifting their income into
corporate shelters to escape the higher personal income tax rates. He has
also promised limits on the deductibility of excessive salaries.
The money from foreign companies may, however, be hard to find. Although
foreign companies on average report lower profits as a percentage of assets,
capital or sales than their domestic counterparts, it is far from clear that
all of this gap is accounted for by any effort to avoid US taxes.
Clinton campaign officials remained reluctant to the last to disclose the
basis of their estimate. But it is widely assumed that they split the
difference between an estimate by the Internal Revenue Service that the tax
shortfall could amount to as much as Dollars 3bn, (if the gap between
foreign and domestic profitability were entirely accounted for by abuses),
and an estimate of Dollars 30bn a year, popular in Congress but based on the
somewhat academic assumption of Professor James Wheeler, of Michigan
University, that foreign companies must be earning as great a return on
assets as they would get on a Treasury bond, or they would not trouble to do
business.
Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation, probably the most authoritative
source for revenue estimates, calculates that if foreign companies were
taxed in proportion to their assets, rather than their reported profits,
they would pay only Dollars 166m more a year, or Dollars 680m more if taxed
in proportion to their receipts.
Politically, however, the target is so appealing that tax lawyers and
congressional staffers are convinced that some effort will be made to wring
more tax out of foreign companies. This could involve an attempt to rewrite
the Section 482 rules on transfer pricing put out by the Bush administration
in its final days, but many observers feel that Congress is so eager to get
its finger into the pie that new legislation is likely.
Foreign governments, as well as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development, fear that the Congress may try to ignore international tax
codes and bilateral tax treaties.
Fiscal realities, however, are driving the new administration in search of
other sources of revenue beyond the tax increases Mr Clinton outlined in his
campaign. This is taking him into hostile territory.
Many of Mr Clinton's advisers, backed by an unlikely coalition of
environmentalists and carmakers, have argued in favour of a substantial
increase in taxes on petrol, an option favoured by Mr Perot during his
campaign. The federal petrol tax stands at a relatively modest 14.1 cents
per gallon, although all states and some cities also tax petrol.
But although many economists believe an increase in the petrol tax would
have the desirable effect of reducing US fuel consumption, and hence
pollution, politicians view it as suicidal, because it is perceived as
unfairly burdening the middle class, as well as the car-dependent states.
A broader energy tax, possibly levied per British thermal unit, is now
favoured, although some senators from oil-producing states are clamouring
for an oil import fee.
It is a token of the greater seriousness with which the budget deficit is
now treated in Washington that discussion of tax increases has not stopped
there: even Social Security, the US state pension system, is under scrutiny.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the unpredictable New Yorker who took over
the chairmanship of the Senate finance committee when Mr Lloyd Bentsen
became Treasury Secretary, has made it clear that he will fight to the last
any attempt to freeze inflation adjustments in Social Security payments.
But Mr Dan Rostenkowski, who as chairman of the Ways and Means committee is
his counterpart in the House of Representatives, has warned that there can
be no sacred cows, and several leading senators have indicated that they
would be prepared at least to consider making a greater portion of these
Social Security payments liable to income tax.
Mr Nicholas Brady, President Bush's Treasury Secretary, argued in a
valedictory speech that the US tax system needed root and branch reform,
including radical measures such as lifting the income tax threshold
dramatically and replacing the lost revenue with a form of VAT.
But Mr Brady never undertook such an initiative while he was in office, and
even though Moynihan believes a VAT will come to the US one day, it seems
unlikely that the Clinton administration will be any bolder.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Survey of World Taxation (3): Lawyers muscle in - Tax
advisers are thriving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTANTS DO it, lawyers do it, even property surveyors now claim to do
it. A growing number and diversity of professionals are becoming involved in
the lucrative world of tax advice.
More than many other grey areas which cross the divide between the
professions, tax consulting has become a battleground. And in a recession,
the gloves are coming off.
In the UK, tax advice has historically been dominated by the accountants.
But the last few years have seen considerable growth in involvement from
lawyers - reflecting their influence in other regions such as North America.
Some accountants and lawyers are beginning to move beyond their own firms,
while others are setting up their own specialist niche practices with even
fewer confines.
'Traditionally accountants were involved in tax compliance and planning
while lawyers were involved on transactional work,' says Mr Simon Stubbings,
the head of tax at the London law firm Theodore Goddard.
During the 1980s, the growth in transaction work exposed lawyers to tax work
more frequently, he argues. That tempted lawyers and also allowed their
clients to see and appreciate the greater scope for their expertise to be
used.
But lawyers held back until recently for cultural and professional reasons.
They were generally less aggressive and more restricted in how they could
market than the accountants.
In international work, the accountants were able to make great play of their
international networks and affiliations. More generally, they had the
advantage of a recurring base of audit clients from which to identify and
obtain additional tax work.
That is changing. In the last four years, Theodore Goddard has hired two
accountants to help it compete. 'They help make our advice more
comprehensible to a finance director by putting numbers to the words,' says
Stubbings.
The change-over is not always easy. There is a considerable cultural clash
between the two types of firms, according to Mr Daniel Feingold, of
Strategic Tax Planning, which he created after stints with accountants and
law firms.
Theodore Goddard - in common with most other lawyers - still sees compliance
work as a matter for the accountants, and transactions as their own
exclusive territory. But the distinctions are becoming increasingly blurred.
'Tax planning has become the battleground,' says Stubbings.
The picture is rather different outside London. 'Provincial solicitors throw
up their hands in horror when they sense a whiff of tax being mentioned and
they call in an accountant,' says Jill Hallpike, secretary of the Law
Society's revenue law committee. 'But the City firms hold up their own
against the accountants.'
The tension between accountants and lawyers is being played out between the
different professional bodies. There is already rivalry between the
independent Institute of Taxation, and the Tax Faculty of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Now the Law Society is
considering introducing a specialist further tax qualification.
The lawyers are not the only professionals encroaching on the accountants'
turf in the UK. A large number of specialist agencies also chip away at
particular niches such as entertainment tax or, in the case of firms like
Crosher &amp; James, property work such as advice on capital allowances.
VAT Clearing House offers an even more highly-focused service: the recovery
of VAT on business expenses in the EC. That raises an important structural
point about the changing nature of the tax profession. Increased competition
is having an effect on both the size and the structure of fees.
The firm only charges if it achieves recoveries, and takes 12.5 per cent of
the tax received.
Geographically, there is also a considerable challenge from overseas. London
remains important as a centre for international tax work, but other areas
are taking on growing importance.
The Netherlands has always been an important rival. Mr Barry Larking, a
lawyer with Smith &amp; Partners, a tax firm based in Rotterdam, who has worked
for both law and accountancy practices, argues that many London firms adopt
an 'ostrich-like approach' to issues of law beyond their own national
boundaries.
'The big firms take a shotgun approach to international work, sending a book
of information from each of the relevant national offices,' he says. 'We are
not tied into a particular network, and can take a different perspective
from the outside.'
The accountants are still hitting back with greater emphasis on marketing,
and the creation of new activities such as out-sourcing, by which they
directly take over the running of tax compliance work in client companies.
But Mr Feingold is among many commentators suggesting that accountants will
become increasingly hard-pressed to compete unless they are in partnership
with lawyers, since so much international tax work is essentially legal
work.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Survey of World Taxation (1): The pressure is starting to
hurt - President Bill Clinton's intention to raise taxes and squeeze more
from foreign companies in the US is symptomatic of a new fiscal
aggressiveness in many other countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's calls for higher taxes this week are warning shots
which have been heard in terror by tax practitioners around the world.
He may have toned down his aggressive campaign rhetoric about capturing an
extra Dollars 45bn from foreign corporations operating in the US. But many
will see his pledges as symptomatic of a new, aggressive attitude in the
world's largest economy which will help set the agenda of many other
governments over the next few years.
The prominence given to Mr Clinton's remarks since his election also serves
as a reminder of the huge importance now being given to international tax
issues, as multinational companies and international transactions grow in
significance. 'Business has undoubtedly become more international,' says Mr
Roger White, head of tax at KPMG Peat Marwick in London.
That has brought a corresponding change in the attitude of fiscal
authorities. 'In their own plodding way the revenue services are catching
up,' says White. 'They are desperately trying to bring themselves into the
1970s as business moves into the next century.'
He argues that there has been a 'globalisation of tax policy setting', with
fiscal authorities from different countries meeting more regularly across
borders, exchanging information and sharing ideas through forums such as the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
This dialogue is reflected in the recent resurgence of international tax
treaties, which grew after the second world war but then declined in
importance during the 1960s and 1970s. There are now many hundreds in place
around the world, including a near-complete network between EC member
states.
Geographically, the US is an important focus of attention. When the Internal
Revenue Service takes action, other countries often have to follow to ensure
they maintain their share of tax levied. Aside from President Clinton's
general sabre-rattling, it has been aggressively pushing for new rules on
transfer pricing. 'We have the potential for the start of a tax war,' says
Mr Peter Dickinson, head of international tax with Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
This attitude is shown in the recent re-negotiations of its tax treaty with
the Netherlands.
The US forced discussions for a new treaty, and the result includes some
tough conditions on removal of remaining privileges - on pain of the treaty
being nullified. 'It was a reflection of what the US wanted,' says
Dickinson.
The new climate is posing particular problems for multinational companies
when trying to structure acquisitions and plan operations, he argues. 'It is
difficult to plan in the long-term, so you have to arrange things in a way
that can be changed without adverse consequences in two years' time.'
One trend in which the US remains the exception is the introduction of value
added tax. Around the world there has been a clear shift away from direct
taxation towards indirect tax. Mr Ian McDade of Price Waterhouse says this
reflects both the simplicity and lower costs of collection, and the fact
that, once introduced, indirect taxes are less politically damaging since
people are not so likely to see their impact.
He adds that this growing application reflects a shift away from considering
tax as an instrument of social policy or wider public policy objectives,
towards one more tightly focused around income generation. At a time when
many countries are in recession, it comes as no surprise that their fiscal
authorities are pushing hard to boost collection.
The use of indirect taxes is now also being echoed in the countries of
Eastern Europe, the former Commonwealth of Independent States and Asia.
McDade says this is explained by competition for inward investment:
companies will be discouraged by seeing high headline tax rates.
Most geographical attention for international taxation at the moment lies in
Western Europe. The EC has achieved a harmonised system for VAT, which began
operating at the start of this year. Market forces, officials argue, will
begin to force the varying member states' tax rates to converge.
The next challenge will be the debate on whether to shift from an
origin-based system - in which VAT is charged in the country where goods or
services are bought - to a destination-based one. That change is designed to
take place in 1997 but may be strongly contested.
On direct tax, EC trends are more ambiguous. Progress towards harmonisation
on corporation tax seems to have been stalled in spite of an ambitious
report by Dr Ono Ruding early last year. But a number of practitioners point
to draft EC legislation clearly pushing in that direction.
Methods of collection have changed considerably in the last few years. There
has been a movement towards self-assessment of tax, by which taxpayers
calculate how much they should pay and send this amount directly to the
authorities rather than wait for an assessment.
This has long been the method applied in the US. It is also in place in
countries such as Canada, Spain, Italy, Denmark, France and Germany. Ireland
and Australia recently moved in the same direction.
Now the UK is doing the same, with an Inland Revenue consultative document
issued last year on self-assessment for personal income taxpayers, and a new
system of 'pay and file' for corporations due to begin this autumn.
The approach reduces the prolonged annual debates over tax calculations, and
permits revenue authorities to make considerable staff savings. But it
introduces new pressures by placing greater burdens on taxpayers - one
reason, it is said, why alcohol sales peak in the US at the time of filing
the annual return.
It also brings the risk of far greater investigations or 'audit' work by tax
officials to ensure that the correct amount has been paid. The onus is being
shifted on to taxpayers to prove they have paid the right amount - backed up
by detailed documentary proof.
Investigations and compliance issues are taking on a wider significance.
Most international tax treaties include clauses calling for exchanges of
information between different national fiscal authorities. These have led to
a growth in multinational examinations of a company's tax affairs.
In the EC, formal computer systems to share information between member
states and to detect fraud are now in place. This raises questions about the
security of confidential and commercially-sensitive information.
It also worries many practitioners, since data may be exchanged and used as
the basis for inquiries without any opportunity for the company involved to
be able to verify the information under scrutiny.
Technology is becoming more important in other ways too. For companies and
their advisers, new software is making it possible to compute and experiment
with the presentation of financial information more easily. For revenue
authorities, electronic filing of tax returns will increase markedly during
the 1990s.
As international tax issues continue to flourish, one more question remains:
the role of the tax professional. In the UK, advice has traditionally been
led by accountants.
Elsewhere, lawyers or others with specialist qualifications have dominated.
Small companies offering niche services are also developing.
Accountants have good abilities to crunch numbers; lawyers play a vital role
in interpreting legal texts and precedents. In the future, there will
probably be greater demand for a combination of these skills, at a
competitive price.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Talk of Cuban buying helps to
keep sugar price surge going
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD SUGAR prices continued to surge yesterday as a spate of bullish news
this week pushed the market out of the narrow trading range of recent
months.
New York's May raw sugar contract, which rose by 0.5 cents on Tuesday, was a
further 0.18 ahead in early trading yesterday at 9.69 cents a lb before
easing towards the close. At the beginning of the month it was trading at
8.5 cents.
Cuba has been reported buying 100,000 tonnes of sugar from Thailand to meet
its commitments in China and elsewhere in Asia. Cuba's harvest is being
delayed once again by problems with the country's infrastructure. Mr Juan
Herrera, the Cuban sugar minister, said earlier this month that a lack of
basic inputs had 'caused delays in the start-up of a significant number of
mills'.
Thailand, which in November forecast a record 1992-93 harvest of 49.15m
tonnes, now expects only 43m tonnes of cane, compared with 47.43m tonnes
last year.
Kenya surprised the market with the announcement that it would hold a tender
next Monday for 160,000 tonnes of white sugar. Morocco is tendering for
14,000 tonnes of raws, and there is talk of Cuban sales to Mexico and of a
100,000-tonne sale to Indonesia.
'There is a buoyant physical sector, and that has brought the funds back
into New York,' said one US analyst yesterday. 'Fund buying spurred the
market through stubborn resistance at 8.65 to 8.70, and then took it through
9 cents.'
'Basically the market is looking a lot better,' said a London trader. 'Good
news has arrived when the market was at its weakest.' He pointed out that
estimates for the world sugar surplus in 1992-93 were coming down. ED &amp;. F.
Man, the London trade house, has reduced its forecast surplus from 3.4m
tonnes to 1.5m tonnes.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium in cars 'to double'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM USAGE by the car industry can be expected to more than double,
from 2.4m tonnes in 1990 to 5.7m tonnes by 2006, according to the
Commodities Research Unit consultancy organisation.
Shipments of new or primary aluminium will rise at an even faster rate, from
770,000 tonnes to 2.8m tonnes, because of the development of 'all-aluminium'
or 'aluminium-intensive' vehicles, it suggests in a new study.
Some of the necessary aluminium smelting capacity is already in place but
this market alone will call for five or six new smelters by 2006, the CRU
points out.
The trend will also increase demand for secondary (scrap) aluminium, put
upward pressure on the price and increase the importance of the London Metal
Exchange's new aluminium alloy contract, which can be used by manufacturers
for hedging against price fluctuations.
The CRU made a detailed, component by component analysis, and says that the
increased use of aluminium will be mainly at the expense of steel and cast
iron because the switch 'will be driven by the need to reduce the weight of
cars and improve their fuel economy'.
By 2006 the aluminium content of an average European car will have risen
from 55 kg in 1990 to 98 kg. Usage in Japan and the US will almost double,
says the CRU.
Aluminium's relatively high price compared with that for steel will mean
that it will be used most intensively in luxury cars, where buyers can
afford to pay for it, and, later in this decade, in electric cars where
weight savings will be essential.
The study forecasts a growing use of aluminium 'space frames,'
(skeleton-like car bodies) and aluminium hang-on and structural panels. But
it sounds a note of caution about investment in aluminium rolling mills
specifically for the car market. The CRU expects that improvements in
plastics recyclability and recycling systems within the 15-year period, will
enable plastic body panels to become highly competitive in non-load bearing
applications and 'the window of growth for aluminium body panels will
probably then be closed'.
The study assumes a 1.8 per cent annual growth rate in car production and no
further oil price shocks. 'Any sharp rise in the oil price, or much more
stringent legislation on fuel economy in the US and elsewhere, would
considerably increase future demand for aluminium from the car industry,' it
concludes.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Surinam bauxite strike ends

BAUXITE MINERS in Surinam have returned to work after a two-week strike.
About 2,000 miners were demanding 100 per cent wage increases to keep pace
with inflation, but settled for a rise of 40 per cent.
There is still a threat of industrial action as the workers are seeking
payment for the days they were on strike.
The industry, based on a 1.6m tonnes-a-year refinery and a 30,000 t/y
smelter, accounts for about 70 per cent of the South American republic's
foreign earnings. It is owned by the Aluminum Company of America and
Billiton, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Exxon expects Indonesian gas
deal to be signed soon
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN AGREEMENT to develop the giant Natuna gas field in the South China Sea
between Exxon Corporation of the US and the Indonesian government could be
signed by the end of March, according to an Exxon official in Jakarta.
In a recent report the World Bank estimated that the field contained 40
trillion (million million) cubic feet of proven and probable natural gas
reserves mixed with about 70 trillion cu f of carbon dioxide. Industry
officials say the field will cost Dollars 16bn-Dollars 19bn to develop due
to the technical difficulties of separating the natural gas from the carbon
dioxide.
Gas from the field would be processed into liquefied natural gas. Indonesia
is at present the world's largest producer of LNG, exporting over 22m tonnes
last year to Japan, Taiwan and South Korea.
The Indonesian government and Exxon have agreed financial terms for Natuna's
development, the Exxon official said. But he declined to give further
details. Industry officials say fiscal terms would include cost recovery and
taxation terms.
Further discussions are likely to cover technical and environmental matters,
including methods for disposing of the carbon dioxide. One proposal is to
reinject the carbon dioxide into limestone reefs, but this may necessitate
an expansion of the project's acreage.
Exxon has a 50 per cent stake in the field with Pertamina, Indonesia's
state-owned oil and gas company, holding the remainder. Industry officials
say Pertamina may be unable to fund its share of development costs and be
forced to reduce its stake or offer incentives for Exxon to increase its own
financing burden.
The World Bank report attaches 'critical importance' to the development of
the Natuna field for the future of Indonesia's LNG industry. About 12m
tonnes of LNG a year is being produced from Pertamina's Arun plant in North
Sumatra but half its contracts expire in 1999 and reserves are running low.
The Natuna field could supply about 14m tonnes of LNG a year, more than
compensating for the reduction from the Arun plant.
Any agreement signed next month, however, would not guarantee the project's
go-ahead, officials stress. Before the field could be developed, between 20
and 30 agreements need to be reached with suppliers, banks, shippers and LNG
purchasers.
Industry officials say the field would take about eight years to develop
before first production and would entail more than 700,000 tonnes of
offshore platforms and facilities and nearly 1,000 km (620 miles) of
pipelines.
