FT  15 FEB 93 / Letter: Reform that centralises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IVOR BUFTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Joe Rogaly ('Vaudeville days are here', February 5) makes the amazing
assertion that 'the government's education reforms are excellent', while
suggesting that its 'continued assault on local democracy is scandalous'.
Don't you realise that while parts of the education reforms may be
excellent, many others are essentially a centralising attack on local
democracy, removing more and more power to Whitehall.

<TEXT>
Sir, It might be vulgar, as Mr Ivens suggests (Letter, February 8), to play
the game of 'our QC is more leading than yours', but everyone's European
Court of Justice has unambiguously stated in two leading cases  - Bartol and
Watson Rusk -  that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)
regulations 1981 and the EC Acquired Rights Directive do apply to compulsory
competitive tendering. And if the amendment in the Employment Bill is
irrelevant, why did the British Association of Landscape Industries say:
'The implications of having to take staff on at the same pay and conditions
are horrendous. It changes the whole concept of CCT.'?

FT  15 FEB 93 / Arts: A code of elegance in Florida / A new village founded
on principles of quality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It all happens in a quiet street in Little Havana to the west of downtown
Miami where a firm of architects and town planners is gradually changing the
way Americans look at their sprawling suburbs and decaying urban areas. This
April, Andres Duany and his wife and partner Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, who
run this Miami practice, will receive the much-prized Thomas Jefferson Medal
for Architecture for their remarkable contribution to radical planning.
The two architects are great proselytisers for ideas that reverse the spread
of urban chaos and create densely planned communities of high architectural
and environmental quality. It must be at least six years since I wrote about
the new town of Seaside, which Duany and Plater-Zyberk, inspired by the
vision of Leon Krier and the developer Robert Davis, designed on the Gulf of
Mexico. The influence of that small holiday community of some 2000 residents
has now gone far beyond the remote regions of the Florida panhandle.
Their second, more modest, (416 acres), planned community is the village of
Windsor at Vero Beach in south Florida. This will be an exclusive haven
where there will be an emphasis on golf, tennis, polo and the pursuit of
happiness in beautiful surroundings. The joint developers are Geoffrey and
Jorie Kent and Galen and Hilary Weston.
Both Seaside and Windsor are very American in the form they take as private
community developments. Their privacy, exclusivity and literal remoteness
from the troubled inner cities of the world gives then an air of unreal
perfection. But this is, in some ways, a mistaken view. In America, the
private sector takes the lead and creates models of redevelopment that will
have a wider application. The planners of these two communities are applying
the same principles to deprived areas of cities and communities throughout
the US.
What are the principles that have made Windsor and Seaside so influential?
It is the simple, intelligible planning guidelines and the architectural
codes that are applied to the new buildings. The planning rules that govern
the developments are extremely sensible -  similar to those of older
European towns and pre-sprawl America.
The town plan is dense and houses -  or their high garden walls -  are built
to the edge of the site boundary. This removes at a stroke the useless acres
of suburban front lawn, encourages an economical use of space and allows for
the creative design of courtyard or 'side yard' gardens. This close planning
will give the completed development a sense of defined, narrow streets and
elegant squares.
The other principle is one that prescribes a maximum walking distance of
five minutes between the town centre and the houses. Existing planning
regulations have to be waived to allow for narrow alleys between houses and
small mews houses or blocks of garages at the end of rear gardens. This
follows the old carriage house idea of towns like New Orleans and
Charleston: you can also hide the cars away and house granny. Cars are
accommodated but not encouraged. At Windsor it is possible to leave your car
and use the small electric golf carts that are available on a 'park and
ride' basis.
These simple rules immediately allow for a town that feels like a town with
the right level of intimacy and neighbourliness. The planning rules are
accompanied by a code for the architecture which ensures the sympathetic use
of appropriate materials and helps develop the town's sense of propriety and
character. At Windsor the code's insistence on deep set windows, consistent
roof pitches, wood balconies, high garden walls and cool colours has
resulted in a town with the feel of Florida and the Caribbean. Scale and
proportion, and a closely defined relationship of windows to walls are
written into the code; and there is a town architect and a five man review
committee to ensure civilised compliance.
It might be thought that the imposition of codes restricted architectural
design. This is definitely not the case at Windsor, where I saw some of the
best new houses I have seen for a long time. Certainly there is a sense of
tradition about some of them, but they are interpretations of tradition in a
way that allows for new thinking. The house by the Washington-based
architect Hugh Newell Jacobsen is a spectacularly beautiful, modern version
of the Palladian villa. The house has a glorious double height salon and a
large swimming pool between the main house and a handsome garden pavilion.
You can slip into the pool from the windows of the salon and swim across the
pool, which is lined by symmetrical rows of lemon trees, to the pavilion. It
is within the codes and yet original, refreshing and splendid.
Other architects working at Windsor, within both the architectural codes and
the community code, are Scott Merrill, Craig Roberts and Clemens Bruns
Schaub. Scott Merril has designed a terrace of rowhouses which seems to be
inspired by English Arts and Crafts architecture of the turn of the century.
The houses' tall chimneys and lofty rooms are complemented by elegant
gardens, designed by Deborah Nevins.
All architects felt that it was worth some sacrifices to stringent design
codes because the end result produces a coherent context. Certainly Windsor,
in its early stages, shows every sign of being one of the most beautiful and
carefully designed new villages in America. It should be a serious exemplar
to follow.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Arts: Tristan und Isolde - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tristan und Isolde, perhaps the most influential and significant opera ever
written, has been missing from the British opera stages. English National
Opera did it last, seven seasons ago. Severe Tristan-hunger was starting to
build up.
Welsh National Opera have now set about assuaging it. Their new production,
given in the original language, opened on Saturday at the New Theatre,
Cardiff; it will be shown in six other southern cities (London included)
over the next couple of months -  and thence, because it is shared with
Scottish Opera, in Scotland also.
The initiative is important, and bravely undertaken. The producer-designer
Yannis Kokkos, Greek-born, France-based, is making his British debut.
Charles Mackerras, probably the most wide-ranging and experienced
opera-conductor alive, leads here his first British Tristan. (He is also
part-sponsor of the surtitles that are making their WNO debut.) All the cast
 - British apart from the American Kurwenal -  come new to their roles.
On Saturday, while it was everywhere evident that the production had been
mounted with care and seriousness, the mixture failed to settle or blend. It
is no doubt grossly unjust to complain of this, as it would be to judge the
performance by inappropriate standards: an authentic Tristan style is not
built in a day. Yet the WNO habit of soaring above in-built artistic
constraints -  as the company did in 1979, in its never-to-be-forgotten
Tristan conducted by Reginald Goodall -  was perhaps responsible for raising
those unjust expectations in the first place.
I recall with admiration Mackerras's ENO Ring and Meistersinger: cleanly
executed, bright of sound, crisply forward-moving. In the WNO programme-book
he speaks feelingly of those 'slower and slower' conductors of our century
who took over the Wagnerian tradition from their 'faster' predecessors.
His own approach to the score lacks nothing in energy: in this Tristan one
really hears and feels each rhythmic thrust, each application and alteration
of colour (much reedy, penetrative wind tone and trenchant brass), the
urgency in utterance of every phrase. Nothing in the least sleepy or hazy
mars the sound-picture. The unusual clarity of the bass line is a token:
this performance unfolds upon a forcefully delineated foundation.
Unfortunately, in a opera so deeply rooted in poetic, emotional and
psychological contrasts of light and dark, day and night, the unvaried
directness of the music-making soon comes to seem as much a burden as a
boon. The instrumental textures have a coarse, glaring impact upon the
voices; one was reminded (as one never was by Goodall) that the New Theatre
is a small house for Tristan in full flood. Driven forward so unremittingly,
the music failed to disclose its longer line, its unique system of
tension-and-release. On this occasion, the fabled Tristan ecstasies were no
more than dimly glimpsed.
Kokkos's production is physically clean-cut. The stage pictures for the
first two acts are semi-abstract (and obviously Appia-influenced), peopled
with figures in elegantly cut and coloured Burne-Jones costumes, and lacking
all necessary pieces of furniture; the third moves into the realm of
surrealism, with a curious marbled walkway jutting out of the frame. Actions
are decorous, bland, occasionally a touch fancy (a falcon among the dramatis
personae of Act 2). Nothing seriously impedes the comfort of the singers;
equally, there is (to my mind) not a single moment in the staging that stirs
the imagination or the intellect.
The most positive aspect of this Tristan is its choice of principals: almost
all of them have started well and promise to develop greatly. The qualities
that caused Anne Evans's WNO Brunnhilde to be so widely acclaimed -
unforced lyricism, womanly tenderness -  suit Isolde even more. Even at this
early stage, when the furious outbursts of Act 1 were still cautiously
offered, with high notes touched (though always purely and accurately)
rather than trumpeted, there was a radiance about her performance that
graced phrase after phrase and lifted the heart.
Jeffrey Lawton, the company's Siegfried, Otello and Aeneas, tackles with
extraordinary boldness perhaps the most challenging dramatic-tenor role in
the repertory. The big, burly voice is used with heartwarming sensitivity to
the colour, weight and emotional import of the music; he rises nobly to the
third-act ravings. Peter Rose's first Marke, beautifully grave and
reflective, is a big step forward for this young singer; Richard Paul Fink's
Kurwenal, though too consistently loud, likewise. Brangane is that fine
artist Della Jones -  vigorous in attack, excessively reliant on register
gear-change, and altogether unwisely embarked on this (for her) alien vocal
venture.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Arts: Weston and Petrucciani - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Randy Weston was once the beatnik's dream musician. A cohort of Art Blakey's
during the ferment of the 1950s New York hard bop scene, he moved to
Tangiers in the early 1960s where he opened a nightclub. Here, presumably in
a fug of kif, dark tobacco and stream of consciousness, Burroughs and Bowles
would settle in to listen to the lanky American pianist in the company of
bluesmen, Congolese singers, jamming with Moroccan percussionists.
Now that world music is finding a more popular place in jazz, a UK tour from
one of the most colourful crossover pioneers is something of a treat.
Supplemented by three Gnaoua musicians of Morocco, who appear in a national
dress of dreadlocks, mitre-style headgear and multi-coloured aprons,
Weston's similarly exotic quintet of reeds, trombone, bass and African
percussion, is a feast for the eyes and ears.
Though the line-up changes throughout the set, the pattern of swaying rhythm
set up by the sonorous string bass of Stafford James and Neil Clarke's
African congas is constant. On to this lapping wave of sound Talib Kibwe
engraves a melody with searing soprano and a rhythmically intense alto,
Benny Powell pushing in, ostinato, with a rumbling trombone. Weston,
directing proceedings from the stool, looks on beneficently, altering the
dynamics of the ensemble with percussive phrases and cross rhythm runs.
The Gnaouas, seated and somewhat bemused by the Queen Elizabeth Hall's
enthusiasm for their chanted prayers to ancestral saints, belt out a song
form that builds in impetus to the sound of castanets and African bass (or
hajouj). Joined by Weston's singular technique, which takes the piano far
away from its European roots, it makes a heady concoction, concluding in the
Gnaoua's traditional folk tunes Sidi Moussa and Lalla Mira, the Moroccans
charmed to their feet by Kibwe's seductive soprano.
In stark contrast to the animated exoticism of one of music's tallest
pianists, the previous night at the QEH saw Michel Petrucciani, less than a
third Weston's size, improvising on an entirely American theme. Promenade
with Duke (Blue Note CDP 7805902) is the new solo outing with the Frenchman
putting his stamp on Strayhorn/Ellington standards such as 'Take the A
Train', 'Lush Life' and 'In A Sentimental Mood'.
Precariously balanced on the very edge of his stool, two tiny crutches cast
on the floor behind, Petrucciani ought to appear vulnerable alone on the
stand. He doesn't, but if the sight of him still makes for compulsive
viewing so too does his sound, which teems off the right hand side of the
keyboard in cheeky quotes and clever cadenzas which never quite run out of
notes. His thick distinctive lines are embroidered with a deft right hand on
to a close weave of chords laid down by the left. Intricate squiggles are
drawn across a strongly independent rhythm and blue notes smeared in.
'Caravan' veered dangerously from the exotic to jolly showtime before neatly
moving into 'Satin Doll' and finally closing with an impromptu stop-time,
finger clicking audience participation piece.
The Randy Weston African Rhythms tour continues to Leeds (Feb 18),
Manchester (Feb 19), Birmingham (Feb 20) and Bradford (Feb 21). Spon- sored

FT  15 FEB 93 / Arts: Greasepaint - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Frances de la Tour can so realise the nervous system beneath one character's
external behaviour that she can turn the stage into a believable world; and
that is why she is one of our finest actresses. But here, where she plays
the one and only character of Hiashi Inoue's Greasepaint, the differences
between nervous system, external behaviour, and surrounding stage world are
so unclear that she is grounded.
The production, directed by Koichi Kimura, is co-produced by the Lyric,
Hammersmith, and Tokyo's Chijinkai theatre company. De la Tour has to hold
us for 90 minutes with her account of the disintegrating psyche of a
Japanese Kabuki actress-manager, haunted by the child she once gave away and
the vicissitudes of performing. The kind of Kabuki she practices is on the
skids. Gradually it becomes apparent that to hold her troupe, her art, and
her life together is more than she can master.
She addresses other characters -  whom we do not see. Part of the play's
tension is the question, unspoken but gathering in force as you watch: are
these other characters real or in her imagination? Much of the time she is
applying or removing make-up, wig and costume, and she addresses the mirror
as she talks. But there is no mirror. Her mirror talk is addressed straight
out into the auditorium.
Apart from the Kabuki trimmings, this kind of soliloquy has no great
novelty. It's a Romantic mad scene, it's 'Ridi, Pagliaccio', and it's
Petrushka in his cell. You can easily imagine how a hammier actress would
devour such a role -  switching attention from one character to another with
a sharp flick of the head, revelling in all the virtuosity of mirror antics
with no mirror, changing vocal tone dramatically from mood to mood, and then
suddenly amazing us with (oh irony]) the utter sincerity with which she
'becomes' the role she is rehearsing.
De La Tour is too sincere an actress for all that, and shows no relish for
such obvious theatrical effect. She plays this actress-manager without any
charming japonaiserie but, instead, in a south London accent. She shows us
that the Japan she inhabits is not some pretty Mikado land, but is
thoroughly modern and urbanised. And this is a modern woman. Her mind
returns to the son she gave away; she makes excuses for that; but she is
'reluctantly', miraculously reunited with him in a big theatrical
recognition scene; she then loses him again; and finally she tries to turn
everything back into theatre.
It is de la Tour's modernity, and the play's ambiguity, that makes this
Greasepaint interesting. She shows you the tawdriness of this character's
life, and her need for escapism. She also shows you this character's
weaknesses and self-contradictions. Her need for fantasy (and theatre)
becomes both real and pathetic. But the dichotomy between play and actress
is too large. For the performance de la Tour gives it, the play develops its
character's psyche far too slowly. If it received a more narcissistic
performance, it would 'work' better -  but it would also seem more trite.
Lyric, Hammersmith, until March 6

FT  15 FEB 93 / Ground rules for the firing squad: FT writers explain how
recent large-scale redundancies have highlighted variations in the ways
European countries protect workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES, DAVID BROWN, DAVID BUCHAN, TOM BURNS, TIM COONE, DAVID
GOODHART, KERIN HOPE, HAIG SIMONIAN, ROBERT TAYLOR and PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French government's reaction to the decision by Hoover to shift some of
its production from France to Scotland was to proclaim a further tightening
of the rules governing redundancies and plant closures.
This was an understandable response from a government facing a national
election, but it is not necessarily in the long-term interests of French
workers and appears to be running against the European tide.
David Rees, investment location expert at Ernst &amp; Young, says that
multinational companies, especially American ones, are starting to add ease
of 'exit', or at least rationalisation, to the list of priorities when
making investment location decisions.
Within the European Community that should favour the UK, Ireland and
Denmark, the three most laissez-faire countries when it comes to closures
and sackings. It will count against the southern European economies -
Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece -  which are restrictive and costly,
probably one reason why the EC's poorer outer rim has not attracted more
investment.
There are many other factors in an investment location decision besides ease
of exit, and Rees says it is still only an influence 'at the margin'.
Nevertheless, with the barrier-free single market encouraging companies to
concentrate production on one site, as opposed to scattering it around the
EC's national markets, such advantages could become increasingly important.
There is, currently, little new multinational investment into the EC, so the
extent to which the UK's devalued currency, relatively low wage costs, and
'hire and fire' industrial culture will suck in a disproportionate amount of
investment should not be overstated.
Nevertheless, the debate about whether the UK is winning a legitimate
competitive advantage or is undercutting workers' rights across the EC
through 'social dumping' looks likely to intensify.
Opponents of the UK can take heart from the fact that its advantages are
likely to be limited to certain sectors.
Most analysts believe the UK will have a competitive advantage in
semi-skilled manufacturing, if it is not undercut by eastern Europe, but the
continuing weakness of its education system will cause it to lose out in
higher skill or R&amp;D-based investment.
In the longer run the current restructuring of the welfare state is likely
to shift more cost on to employers and thus undermine the UK's advantage of
low non-wage labour costs.
In the short-term, the UK is likely to lose more jobs than it gains from
multinational re-structuring within Europe precisely because of the ease
with which workers can be dismissed.
Hoover decided to move to Scotland despite the fact that shedding jobs in
France is considerably more costly and complex, a measure of the cost
advantage from much lower UK non-wage labour costs.
The French government seems convinced that, at least at this stage in the
economic cycle, 'locking in' jobs through raising the cost of closure is the
most suitable response to multinational restructuring. The new French
redundancy law returns the situation to something close to the time prior to
1986 when official approval was still required for large-scale redundancies.
The new law requires official approval of the 'social plan' for the workers
who are losing their jobs. France thus rejoins that large group of EC
countries -  including Spain, Portugal, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands and
Germany -  which give government or workers an effective veto over
redundancies. A veto which can only be circumvented with time and money.
There are, however, indications that several countries, most notably Italy
and Spain, are starting to recognise that the sky-high cost of dismissal is
both a disincentive to international capital and to domestic restructuring.
This trend is still weak but will gather momentum when EC growth picks up.
The trend might be strengthened by the introduction of common EC rules on
large redundancies which could provide political cover for countries like
Spain.
A spate of Hoover-type, beggar-my-neighbour, rows over jobs and investment
is just what EC officials have for years been fearing. The Social Charter
and its latest manifestation, the Social Chapter, were, in part, meant to
soften the process of industrial restructuring within the EC. But as they,
quite properly, do not address the question of relative labour costs, they
have had no impact on companies like Hoover.
The one EC-wide redundancy rule already in operation requires worker
representatives to be given 90 days' notice and proper consultation over
larger redundancies. After Hoover there is also a move to breathe life back
into the idea of European works councils -  forums for companies operating
in more than one EC country where employee representatives must be informed
of major corporate plans.
European union leaders say that such councils would have prevented Hoover
playing off the workers in two different countries against each other.
It is debateable whether a works council would have made much difference in
the Hoover case. But it is certain that if compulsory works councils are
introduced under the Social Chapter -  from which the UK has opted-out -
many US multinationals will be horrified and will be even more likely to
concentrate their EC investment in the UK.
BELGIUM
ALTHOUGH more difficult than the UK, Ireland and Denmark, the procedures in
Belgium covering large redundancies or closures are surprisingly light.
Employers must discuss dismissals with works councils and the Labour Office
has the power to suspend dismissals, although rarely does so. Notice periods
are at least three months and can rise to six months. Statutory severance
pay is relatively high - usually about two-thirds of salary for four months.
DENMARK
DANISH legislation on dismissals and redundancy pay is liberal, largely
because of the need for small firms to be flexible.
Hourly paid workers can be dismissed from one day -  indeed, one hour - to
the next, and the worker can pick up unemployment benefit immediately as
well.
Where collective dismissals are concerned, the firm must inform the
employees and negotiate with them to minimise dismissals and alleviate the
consequences. The firm must inform the Labour Market Board (Job Centres) a
minimum of 30 days before the dismissals take effect.
If these procedures are not followed, the firm must pay a fine and one
month's wages to the employees. If procedures are followed, the law does not
oblige employers to pay redundancy pay; in practice employers rarely do so.
Salaried employees come under separate legislation. They must be given up to
six months' notice, depending on length of service, and receive a minimum of
one month's redundancy pay after 12 years' service, rising to three months'
pay after 18 years. Terms are also regulated through collective wage and
work condition agreements.
FRANCE
THE Loi Aubry, voted by the Parliament in December and in effect since
January 31 1993, aims to get employers to make their best efforts to find
alternative work for those they are laying off.
The new law applies to all companies which have 50 or more employees and
which are planning to make 10 or more of them redundant.
It sets out what a social plan should contain in terms of trying to redeploy
workers, to training schemes, to new jobs. There is no obligation to find
alternative jobs, because 'in certain depressed industrial areas that is
simply not possible', admits an Aubry aide.
As at present, the management has to put its social plan before the Comite
Central d'Entreprise. The new law gives the public authorities the right -
within eight days of the social plan going to the works council -  to tell
the management that its plan is not good enough. In that case, the company
has to redo its plan and, until it does so, any redundancies are legally
invalid.
The legal minimum pay-off is one-tenth of a month's salary for every year
worked. For those who worked at a company for more than 10 years, there is
an additional payment of one-fifteenth of a month's salary for every year
worked beyond 10 years.
GERMANY
GERMANY is one of the countries where employees in larger workplaces have
quasi-veto power over closures and redundancies. The works council, as well
as the local Labour Office, must be informed of large redundancies. The
council has the right to be consulted over whether the redundancy is
necessary and who should go.
If the council and the employer cannot reach agreement the case goes before
the local labour court which is quite likely to back the council. There is
no statutory redundancy pay in Germany but redundancy costs -  agreed as
part of the social plan -  are usually quite high.
GREECE
GREECE does not permit large-scale redundancies. In any case, most Greek
companies are small in comparison with other EC countries; more than
three-quarters of them employ fewer than 50 workers.
Under a 1983 law, no more than 3 per cent of a company's workforce, or 30
employees (whichever is fewer), can be laid off in any month. It is possible
for employers to get special permission from the Labour Ministry to raise
the ceiling on dismissals, but in practice this rarely happens.
Workers made redundant are entitled to one month's salary for every year
worked.
IRELAND
IRELAND is another relatively liberal country when it comes to dismissals.
The 1977 Protection of Employment Act stipulates that employers must give a
minimum 30 days' notice to their workforce of planned redundancies, and must
notify the Minister for Labour if more than 10 per cent of the workforce is
to be laid off.
This allows for an obligatory consultation period with the relevant trade
unions, which must be given the specific information and reasons for the
redundancies, and which may then offer their own proposals.
If the redundancies go ahead, employees with more then two years' employment
with the company, and working a minimum eight hours per week, are entitled
to minimum severance payments of one week's pay plus a half week's pay for
every year of employment.
For employees over 41 years of age this is increased to one week's pay for
every year worked above that age. This is capped at a maximum income level
of IPounds 250 (Pounds 255) per week. Employers can reclaim 60 per cent of
these from a social welfare fund which is financed out of employers'
national insurance contributions.
ITALY
LABYRINTHINE job security and redundancy rights have been clarified by a
1991 law replacing the wide-ranging, but informal, accord between unions and
employers on job security at big private-sector companies.
Although matters are now being simplified further, there are still sharp
differences on rights for public-sector workers -  who in effect had jobs
for life -  and employees in companies with less than 15 staff, formerly not
covered by any job protection rules.
Employees being laid off have a minimum of 15 days' notice, often longer
depending on the individual contract. Once given notice, there follows an
obligatory 75-day consultation period, during which unions and management
discuss ways to avoid, or at least alleviate, redundancies. Failing a
solution within the first 30 days, the talks are widened to include the
Employment Ministry representatives.
Sacked employees go into a special regional 'mobility' list, guaranteeing a
sliding scale of benefits, starting at 80 per cent of salary in the first
year. The proportion of salary received, and the period covered -  which
stretches up to four years for redundancies in the economically-depressed
south -  depends on age and location. Workers on the list also get priority
in finding new jobs, thanks to social security breaks for companies hiring
them.
Meanwhile, the employer has to make a one-off redundancy payment equivalent
to 80 per cent of six months' salary.
Early retirement schemes have been introduced in certain cases, although the
numbers covered are limited. Similar incentives have been used for big,
overstaffed state employers such as the railways.
NETHERLANDS
THE Dutch labour market is rigid and costly, but peaceful as well. Layoffs,
whether collective or individual, are subject to local government approval,
a time-consuming and not always successful procedure.
Notice periods of between one and six months at full pay are required
(depending on length of service). Additionally, redundancy pay, which is
negotiated between the unions and employers, can vary between three months
and three years, at up to 100 per cent pay. More common is a graduated
scale, with the pay percentage declining over time. The average monthly
industrial wage in the Netherlands is roughly Fl 3,000 (Pounds 1,120).
PORTUGAL
PORTUGAL'S strongly pro-worker labour laws, passed in the wake of the 1974
left-wing revolution, make it almost impossible to dismiss workers except
for gross misconduct.
Nevertheless, far-sighted companies are successfully trimming their
workforces, using voluntary redundancies and early retirement. William
Cunningham, a Lisbon partner with consultants Arthur Andersen, tells of a
company that reduced the number of its workers from 12,000 to 387 in seven
years and still outputs the same manufacturing volume using more modern
technology.
Companies usually pay one to 1.5 month's pay for each year worked for
voluntary redundancies. They estimate that they can recover this in about 18
months through saved wages and social security payments of 24.5 per cent a
worker.
Portugal's labour laws were liberalised slightly in 1989, making it
theoretically possible to dismiss workers for 'economic, market,
technological or structural reasons'. But the criteria laid down and the
delays involved are so long that the law is rarely invoked. Officially,
employers carrying out involuntary redundancies must pay workers one month's
pay for each year worked.
SPAIN
SPAIN'S restrictive labour legislation has become a major item on the
political agenda. Carlos Solchaga, the economy minister, wants a thorough
reform of hiring and firing rules. He says major foreign investors no longer
ask him about the potential for domestic growth but about the cost of
dismissing employees.
The cost of dismissals in Spain is on paper among the highest in Europe. A
company that seeks to make workers on a fixed contract redundant because it
is losing money or because their jobs have been phased out by new technology
has to pay such employees 45 days for each year worked with a maximum payout
of 18 months' salary.
In practice the cost is a lot higher. The redundancies have to be authorised
by the Labour Ministry and if they are opposed by the unions, as is normally
the case, authorisation is delayed for months as the Labour Ministry's
inspectors evaluate the company's case and that of the unions.
The unions have every incentive to oppose redundancies. Under the existing
labour legislation the company has to continue paying the employees it
wishes to make redundant until such a time as the Labour Ministry delivers
its final ruling.
Should the redundancies be authorised, the company has to pay the full
severance pay as laid down by the law without any deductions based on the
salaries it continued to pay while the case was being heard.
A consequence of this system is that in order to obtain quick authorisation
from the Labour Ministry, companies are forced to negotiate with the unions
redundancy terms of as much as 60 days per year worked. Additionally, the
company often has to pay up to two days' salary per employee made redundant
directly to the unions.
Spain's employers association, the CEOE, has made the elimination of the
prior authorisation for redundancies by the Labour Ministry a priority
issue. Solchaga, who understands perfectly well how the system works in
practice, is sympathetic to their case.
The unions are, however, adamantly opposed to any changes and the
government, which faces general elections later this year and is wary of
waning support from its rank and file socialist voters, has effectively
shelved any meaningful reform of the labour legislation until after the
polls.
SWEDEN
Since 89 per cent of Swedes are in trade unions, collective agreements cover
almost all redundancy programmes. Bargaining between the 'social partners'
has been backed up since the mid-1970s by legislation.
Under the 1977 Co-determination At Work Act, an employer is obliged before
deciding on 'an important alteration to his activity, on his own initiative,
to negotiate' with the trade union to which he is bound by collective
agreement.
If they cannot agree, the issue is referred up to national level for
resolution between employers and unions. Only after that can the employer go
ahead with the decision. If a company ignores this procedure it can be
fined.
The 1977 Act covers specifically any change in work or employment
conditions. However, the law provides a way out for employers 'if special
(unspecified) reasons so necessitate'.
The aim -  as with all Swedish labour law -  is to achieve consensus on
change. Unions and workers have no veto power to prevent plant closures but
through the 1977 laws they are involved before decisions are made by the
company. Under the 1988 Security of Employment Act workers have strong legal
rights when faced by redundancy or closure of their plant. An employer must
give six months' notice to anyone over 45 years of age employed for more
than six months. The period of notice is less for younger workers. Swedish
workers get no other compensation for losing their job.
UK
The UK, along with Ireland and Denmark, is an easy-fire country by EC
standards, indeed probably the easiest of all. Full-time workers have no
protection from unfair dismissal until they have been employed for more than
two years, and part-time workers have no protection for five years.
For large-scale redundancies companies are merely obliged to give 90 days'
notice and consult with a recognised union if there is one. Statutory
redundancy payments are also low. Most workers qualify for one week's pay
per year of service, slightly less for younger workers and slightly more for
older workers.

Peter Coster, 59, has resigned as a director of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester
Building Society following its decision to merge its specialised centralised
lending operation into the rest of its business.
Coster, who had been an assistant general manager of Scottish Life, joined
C&amp;G in 1989 following its takeover of the Guardian Building Society. He was
chief executive of C&amp;G Guardian which offered specialist mortgage products
through life offices and as recently as May it had moved into a new
headquarters in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, which had been designed to cater
for considerable expansion.
However, the downturn in the UK housing market has led to a scaling back of
C&amp;G's ambitions in this area and it has closed C&amp;G Guardian's Potter's Bar
headquarters and put it up for sale. Around 80 staff have lost their jobs.

FT  15 FEB 93 / People: Parkland picks outsider
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For the second time in a month an old-established Yorkshire textile firm has
gone outside the family to find a chief executive. Bryan Lodder, who has
spent 25 years in the textile industry in the UK and US, has been appointed
chief executive of Bradford-based Parkland Textile (Holdings).
Lodder, 48, joined Parkland last May as a non-executive director and first
got to know it during his time as chief executive of the European end of
Guilford Mills, a big US textile company. Parkland and Guilford have a three
year-old joint venture which supplies fabrics for the car industry.
In October 1989 Lodder was promoted to be president and chief operating
officer of the the US parent which has 15 textile plants in the US and
overseas and is headquartered in Greensboro, North Carolina. He stepped down
in April 1991.
The appointment of Parkland's new chief executive comes only a few weeks
after Dewhirst Group appointed its first chief executive from outside the
family -  David Witt. Both family-run firms are suppliers to Marks &amp; Spencer
and have been hard hit by the recession in the textile industry. Parkland
has lost money for the past two years and is shedding its loss-making
garment manufacturing operations.
Parkland says that Lodder's appointment allows its executive directors to
'assume direct responsibility' for the group's core businesses.
Lodder replaces John Hanson, 48, part of the controlling family and
Parkland's chief executive since 1987. He moves to be managing director of
Parkland Manufacturing and has been given the task of looking after the
reorganisation and growth of the group's worsted fabric business -
Parkland's major subsidiary. He will retain responsibility for the group's
overall marketing strategy.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gill Tishler has joined the Young Women's Christian Association of Great
Britain as its new chief executive on the departure of Elizabeth Sharples,
who is retiring after 14 years in the position.
The boss of the YWCA has always been a woman 'because the worldwide
organisation believes very strongly in leadership by women', according to
Tishler who, at 34, is younger than any of her predecessors.
Tishler joined the Ministry of Agriculture from Oxford in 1979; she spent
part of her time in Brussels, and worked in the private office of two junior
ministers before making 'a very deliberate move into the voluntary sector'
in 1987.
She started with the Royal National Institute for the Blind doing
parliamentary work and campaigning before becoming head of public affairs.
Now she thinks her marketing and public relations skills will be very
relevant in her new job, which will also allow her to make 'practical use'
of her faith, she says.
The charity which, as well as being a registered housing association is
engaged in youth and community work 'empowering young women aged between 13
and 26', is involved with between 60,000-75,000 people countrywide and has a
budget of Pounds 8m.

<TEXT>
THIS will be a tense week for the UK government with Thursday's unemployment
figures set to take the jobless total over three million.
The consensus forecast is for a seasonally adjusted rise of 40,000, but an

surpassed in the mid-1980s.
Last month, unemployment rose by a much higher than expected 61,000 and the
trend growth rate accelerated to around 40,000 a month. However, the figures
do fluctuate and monthly increases as low as eight million were recorded
twice last year.
Other important UK figures this week include manufacturing output, retail
sales and the public sector borrowing requirement. The Bank of England's
quarterly bulletin will contain the first of the Bank's independent
quarterly analyses of inflation.

RESULTS DUE
BRITISH AIRWAYS, still struggling to restore its dignity in the wake of the
Virgin Atlantic 'dirty tricks' affair, will report its third quarter results
tomorrow. An Pounds 30m exceptional charge for reorganisation at Gatwick
after the Dan-Air acquisition will knock the quarter's profits back to about
Pounds 10m (Pounds 100m). Profits for the nine-month period to the end of
December are likely to be about Pounds 237m (Pounds 285m).
Glaxo, the UK's largest pharmaceuticals company and rather mauled by the
market of late, is expected to report on Thursday that profits in the six
months to December 31 will rise from Pounds 709m to about Pounds 775m.
Zantac, the anti-ulcer drug which accounts for 40 per cent of group's sales,
has seen its sales growth slow as rivals prepare to enter the market.
Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, will report tomorrow its first quarter
results, covering the period to end December. A small improvement is
expected on the Pounds 226m pre-tax recorded a year ago - possibly up to
Pounds 240m, excluding profits on disposals.
Much of the increase, though, will come from the translation of dollar
profits at a more favourable rate. Analysts expect further elucidation of
Lord Hanson's comments at the recent annual meeting that UK margins were
likely to be tighter this year.
Dalgety, the food group, is reporting interim results today for the six
months to end December. These are expected to show a small increase from
pre-tax profits of Pounds 53.8m last time to Pounds 56m. UK trading is dull,
though there will be the benefit of Sooner Snacks acquired in February. A
good performance is expected from the US operation.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 38m roadworks for Costain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COSTAIN BUILDING &amp; CIVIL ENGINEERING, has been awarded two road construction
contracts, with a total value of Pounds 38.9m. The first contract is the
Pounds 23.4m M4 link to the second Severn crossing for the Welsh Office.
The 33-month contract includes the construction of six and a half kilometres
of three-lane dual carriageway and the widening of two kilometres of
existing two-lane dual carriageway. Six bridges will be constructed and
three bridges modified and all road lighting, signage and communication
systems will be provided.
The link, designed by the Second Severn Crossing Group, a joint consultancy
of WS Atkins and G Maunsell and Partners, under the direction of the Welsh
Office Highways Directorate, is programmed for completion by Spring 1996
when the whole second Severn crossing scheme will open to traffic.
The award of this contract coincides with the virtual completion by Costain
of the Pounds 31m M4 Earlswood to Lonlas "missing link'. The second contract
is a Pounds 15.5m project for Surrey County Council, which involves the
diversion of the A3 at Hogs Back Road north of the village of Runfold and
the construction of the southern end of the new Blackwater Valley route.
The development includes the construction of about six kilometres of
two-lane dual carriageway, an interchange, 10 bridges and retaining walls.
The engineer is Surrey County Council's director of highways and
transportation.

leave to 14 weeks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW RULES on maternity leave
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 which will, for the first time, give all pregnant employees a right to at
least 14 weeks off work - threaten to cause confusion, extra costs to
companies, and could even undermine women's job prospects, employers'
organisations say.
The changes in maternity rights are contained in the Trade Union Reform and
Employment Rights Bill, which is due to reach report stage in parliament
this week. The legislation springs from a European Community directive that
lays down minimum leave entitlement and levels of maternity pay across
member states.
Mr Robbie Gilbert, director of employment affairs at the Confederation of
British Industry, said companies would face the prospect of a female
employee 'appearing on day one, and on day two saying 'I now wish to claim
maternity leave'.' At present, a woman has to have worked for the same
employer for two years full-time, or five years part-time, before she is
entitled to time off.
As well as opposing the content of the original EC directive, the CBI also
objected to the way the new rules were being built into UK legislation. Mr
Gilbert said: 'It's becoming increasingly clear that it would have been
better to have taken more time and dealt with it more thoroughly.'
The bill now going through parliament implements only part of the directive
 - entitlement to maternity leave -  but leaves the question of levels of
payment until further social security legislation later this year. The CBI
says the issues of leave and pay 'march together' and should therefore have
been decided at the same time.
Opposition to the way the bill has been framed has also come from groups
seeking to improve maternity provision for women. The Maternity Alliance,
which includes among its membership the Equal Opportunities Commission,
children's charities and unions, argues that the government's 'attempt to
fuse the minimum provisions in the EC directive with the current maternity
schemes has been ill-thought-out and will produce an excessively complicated
system'.
The CBI and the Maternity Alliance say they would have preferred a thorough
overhaul and simplification of the rules on maternity leave and pay. It is
generally agreed that the present system, which has different rules
depending on whether an employee is full or part-time, is often confusing,
particularly for smaller businesses. A recent report from the National Audit
Office, the government spending watchdog, concluded that a 'small but not
inconsiderable minority of women appeared not have received statutory
maternity pay to which they were entitled'.
Ms Jill Andrew, a director of the London Chamber of Commerce and a partner
with Masons, the City solicitors, said the new maternity rules would have a
'counter-productive effect on women's employment'. In times of recession
small businesses in particular were finding there was 'no capacity to carry
pregnant women', she said.
Mr Paul Sheffrin, director of personnel policy development with accountants
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said the firm was keen on women who intended to make
long-term careers with the company, but anyone wanting maternity leave very
shortly after joining would 'create real difficulties, add to our costs, and
frustrate the whole way we organise our work'.
J Sainsbury, the food retailers, which has 100,000 employees in the UK, two
thirds of them women, said the new rules would 'obviously add to our costs'.
It said that there were some concerns about the burden on companies of
administrating the new rules. But, overall, improved maternity provision
helped to 'level the playing field' for female employees, said Mr John
Adshead, personnel director.
The Equal Opportunities Commission said it was concerned some employers
appeared to be taking a 'backward attitude' by arguing that women's
employment prospects could be damaged by increasing their maternity rights.
'The same arguments were used when sex discrimination and equal pay
legislation was introduced and there has been a great increase in women's
employment since then,' said the commission.
The Department of Employment said the UK had succeeded in negotiating a
final EC directive that gave important new rights to women 'without imposing
unacceptable burdens on employers'. The employment bill was likely to be the
only opportunity for legislating before the directive had to be implemented
in October 1994, the department added.
Separately, the CBI yesterday denied press reports that employers were
preparing to abandon support for equal opportunities policies because of
rising unemployment. It was an 'outrageous misrepresentation' to suggest the
CBI was no longer interested in the issue, it said.

<TEXT>
THE SUN newspaper has apologised to the Queen for 'unintentionally' causing
personal offence by publishing the text of her Christmas message early. The
speech has a strict embargo.
The apology, in the form of a letter on the front page of today's paper,
follows a writ served on the paper last week on behalf of the Queen alleging
infringement of copyright.
The paper also offers to donate Pounds 200,000 to the Save the Children Fund
of which Princess Anne is patron.
Mr Chris Davis, assistant editor, said the decision to publish the letter
was made by Mr Rupert Murdoch, who owns the newspaper. Mr Davis said both
sets of lawyers were unaware of the offer and he did not know if it would
halt the legal action.
Buckingham Palace said last night: 'Any proposals that they are making will
be looked at carefully but in the meantime the matter remains with the
solicitors.'

FT  15 FEB 93 / Leyland Daf van plant buy-out 'promising'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POSSIBILITY of a management buy-out of Leyland Daf's van production
business in Birmingham from the receivers of the collapsed Anglo-Dutch
commercial vehicles group was yesterday 'looking more promising', according
to one of the executives involved.
Mr Norman Childs, communications manager for Leyland Daf Vans, said the
management team, headed by Mr Allan Amey, who has been managing director of
the van manufacturing operations for three years, had already signalled its
intentions to the receivers and hoped to make a formal approach later this
week.
It was also likely that Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy firm,
would be appointed to advise the management team.
Mr Childs said that, since the administrative receivers from accountancy
firm Arthur Andersen were called in on February 4, the van plant
management's main concern was to keep some production going. The receivers
and the management had been in contact with those component suppliers which
had stopped delivering to the van plant.
It was hoped that these efforts would bear fruit this week and production,
which had been intermittent, would re-start smoothly.
That would have to wait until Wednesday however because the first two days
this week would be spent on retraining the remaining employees as 520
workers, one third of the workforce at the plant, were made redundant on
Friday.
Mr Childs said the management team was now able to concentrate more
attention on the potential buy-out. Some of the van sales and marketing
people based at Thame in Oxfordshire were also involved. He said Mr Amey 'is
very confident he can put together a management buy-out'.
It was proving difficult to disentangle the van plant's financial
performance from the rest of Leyland Daf, however.
When it operated as a separate company, Freightrover, it was profitable from
1983 to 1988. 'We understand it went on making a profit under a new
structure introduced in 1989, but it is difficult to pin it down,' said Mr
Childs.
The van business has always been one of the receivers' most pressing
problems because it is excluded from moves backed by the Dutch government to
create a company out of the core Leyland Daf truckmaking business.
Also, as far as the Birmingham plant was concerned, an ambitious joint
venture with Renault seems to be dead.
From the outset, the receivers suggested that the van plant's best chance of
survival was for it to produce very basic, low-cost, utility vans,
essentially for the UK market only and for a core of loyal, large fleet
customers such as the Post Office. This plan would need a management buy-out
and might need to be kick-started by some form of government selective
regional assistance.
Mr Childs pointed out the Birmingham plant also generated income from its
very large press shop which did a great deal of work for the Rover Group,
including pressing panels for Land Rover and Range Rover vehicles.
Mr Tony Woodley, national motor group secretary of the TGWU general union,
welcomed the prospect of a buy-out. He said: 'I hope that even at this late
stage the Department of Trade and City institutions will co-operate with any
management buy-out.
'In the interim, I appeal to all the van plant suppliers to continue
supplying the factory in order to give it a fighting chance of survival.'
The result of a ballot of workers at Birmingham on taking strike action will
be announced today.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Empty offices become shelter for homeless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED-LYONS, the drinks and food group, has turned almost half of its
former London headquarters over to temporary shelter for the homeless.
Allied-Lyons has given up three of the eight floors at its former offices in
Islington, north London. The move is part of a campaign to help the homeless
by taking advantage of some the capital's empty office space.
Up to 120 people sleep each night in the building, which has become London's
largest cold-weather shelter.
The project has been organised by English Churches Housing Group and the
Construction Industry Relief and Assistance for Single Homeless (Crash).
Crash said that it was the first time that owners of an empty office block
had offered to make space available in the capital under the government's
cold-weather shelter scheme launched in 1991.
Under the scheme the government provides grants to voluntary agencies in
London to finance temporary shelters during the coldest winter months,
normally from late November to the end of March.
Crash, established to take advantage of surplus construction industry
capacity and skills to aid the homeless, has been supporting the scheme
since November 1991 by providing conversion work either free-of-charge or at
concessionary rates.
This winter building groups such as John Laing and Trafalgar House have
provided services, goods or money to provide more than 300 temporary
cold-weather beds. The Barbour Index, which supplies construction research,
has also helped fund the projects.
English Churches and Crash appealed to owners of other empty office
buildings to follow Allied-Lyons' lead. Ms Caroline White, chief executive
of English Churches Housing Group, said: 'When the managing agency has
experience of working with the homeless, as we do, there is no risk to the
property.'
The group said that the offices had been converted into double bedrooms in
just five weeks with the help of Crash and Wates Construction.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Cook in attack on trade policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR HAS lashed out at the government's export insurance regime, charging
it with 'profiteering' from exporters and threatening Britain's prospects
for recovery.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, released figures which
he said showed that the government hoped to make a 'tidy' profit of Pounds
129m from exporters in the next three years.
Accusing the government of 'sheer stupidity', he urged ministers to act to
ensure British exporters were not faced with higher insurance premiums than
their foreign competitors.
'Michael Heseltine (the trade and industry secretary) is keen to talk about
creating a level playing field,' he said. 'From where our exporters are
standing, it looks more like the north face of the Eiger.'
The figures released by Mr Cook were presented as a budget analysis for the
UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department.
They showed net public expenditure by the ECGD was expected to be negative
in each of the next three financial years, weighing in at minus Pounds 35m
in 1993-94, minus Pounds 64m in 1994-95 and minus Pounds 30m in 1996-97. Mr
Cook said this would be the first time this had happened since records
began.
Labour's attack came about 10 days after a group of leading British
exporters warned MPs that the high cost and limited availability of export
credit cover was putting thousands of British jobs at risk and causing
hundreds of millions of pounds in exports to be lost.
Mr Brian Willett, ECGD chief executive, said last month that the
organisation was likely 'in three to four years' to become a net contributor
to the exchequer for the first time in about a decade.
The exporters' group called for ECGD country coverage comparable with that
of competitors, for premium rates to be harmonised with those of competitor
countries and for the government to provide aid-supported finance where
competitor countries provided it.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Rifkind sees peace role in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MALCOLM Rifkind, defence secretary, indicated yesterday that British
troops would be likely to take part if a new UN peacekeeping force were sent
to Bosnia, but that their participation might be temporary.
British forces have been deployed in the former Yugoslav republic since
September, when they were sent to escort humanitarian supply convoys
organised by the UN.
A larger UN force is expected to be required to police the latest UN-EC
peace plan, involving the division of Bosnia into 10 provinces, which
recently received tacit approval in Washington.
Mr Rifkind said: 'If the US and other countries are prepared to play their
part, then the UK would want to take the same responsible position as the
international community as a whole.' He said on ITV's Walden programme that
if peacekeeping plans appeared to involve a much greater burden the UK would
be 'very careful before we go in'.
A new force would be sent only if there were a real ceasefire, he said.
'There is no question of British forces being sent into a combat role in
Bosnia or elsewhere in former Yugoslavia.'
He said Britain would have to examine the implications of any long-term
commitment. The UN should adopt a rotation system enabling the initial
participants in a peacekeeping operation to withdraw and be replaced by
troops from another country.
He said many UN members could share the task of policing a ceasefire in
Bosnia. This kind of action would be more akin to traditional peacekeeping
operations than present deployments in the country. He said Britain would
not keep troops there if they became involved in combat.
'I would not have the slightest hesitation in wishing to see our forces
withdrawn at the earliest possible opportunity,' he said.
Mr Rifkind dismissed demands made by the all-party Commons defence committee
last week for the government to cancel all its planned reductions in the
infantry to enable it to meet its commitments.
He said this would be 'frankly unnecessary' and would cost an extra Pounds
200m a year, which would have to be taken from other government programmes.
The committee persisted with its call after Mr Rifkind cancelled two
regimental amalgamations and increased the planned strength of the army in
the mid-1990s by 3,000 to 119,000.
Mr Rifkind said yesterday: 'I could double the size of the army tomorrow and
you could still say in theory that it might not be enough.'

FT  15 FEB 93 / Budget reduction of interest rates urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT should cut interest rates further in next month's Budget to
boost confidence, but interest rates might have to rise as early as the end
of this year if wage claims start to move higher.
The message from economists at London Business School is that the
sluggishness of the recovery owes much to caution among consumers still
burdened with high debt and frightened by unemployment.
Mr David Currie and Mr Geoffrey Dicks say in an assessment of UK economic
prospects that the government needs to raise taxes if it is to avoid a debt
spiral on the budget deficit.
They forecast growth of 1.4 per cent this year. Inflation will stay in the
Treasury target range of 1 per cent to 4 per cent this year but rise to 5
per cent next year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SUN newspaper has apologised to the Queen for 'unintentionally' causing
personal offence by publishing the text of her Christmas message early. The
speech has a strict embargo.
The apology, in the form of a letter on the front page of today's paper,
follows a writ served on the paper last week on behalf of the Queen alleging
infringement of copyright. The paper also offers to donate Pounds 200,000 to
the Save the Children Fund of which Princess Anne is patron.
Mr Chris Davis, assistant editor, said the decision to publish the letter
was made by Mr Rupert Murdoch, who owns the newspaper.
'It has been discussed at the very highest level,' Mr Davis said, but both
sets of lawyers were unaware of the offer and he did not know if it would
halt the legal action.
Buckingham Palace said last night: 'Any proposals that they are making will
be looked at carefully but in the meantime the matter remains with the
solicitors.'

FT  15 FEB 93 / Opencast mines in the firing line / An option for ministers
seeking a solution to the coal crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMAGINE THE reaction of shareholders and bankers if a private-sector company
cut the most profitable part of its business to concentrate on a production
area which had less chance of success.
But that is what the government wants British Coal to do, even as it
prepares it for privatisation. In its efforts to dig itself out of the
problems sparked by the closure programme of deep-mined pits, the government
plans to tell the corporation to reduce its highly profitable opencast
operations to make room for less financially rewarding, but more politically
sensitive, deep mines.
The proposal, contained in the draft of the white paper on the future of
coal reported in the Financial Times last Thursday, has caused deep concern
at British Coal and at dozens of private-sector companies which are involved
in opencast mining.
One British Coal executive asked: 'How are we expected to bring our prices
down to world levels if the government takes away the best parts of our
business?'
In strictly financial terms the case against cutting opencast output is
impeccable. Last year the opencast operation contributed Pounds 171m to
British Coal's total operating profits of Pounds 361m, even though it mined
only 16m tonnes of coal, less than a fifth of the corporation's output.
The easier access of opencast coal makes it much cheaper to extract -
production costs last year were about Pounds 31 a tonne, Pounds 10 cheaper
than for deep-mine coal. This means that if the government ordered British
Coal to replace 4m tonnes of opencast product with deep-mine coal, then
overall profitability would fall by about Pounds 40m a year.
Even that might be an under-estimate since environmental considerations
would lead to British Coal losing opencast greenfield sites before
industrially derelict areas that are more expensive to operate because they
have to be rehabilitated.
British Coal could undoubtedly withstand a reduction of Pounds 40m-plus in
its annual profits. Last year overall profits were Pounds 170m and
significant growth is expected, even in this troubled year. But the
reduction in profits would add to the government's problems of a growing
public-sector borrowing requirement.
It would also make the corporation less attractive to prospective purchasers
in the privatisation which is planned for the middle of the decade. Lower
profitability would, however, be a marginal problem compared to the effect
which restrictions on opencast production would have on British Coal's
ability to match the cost of coal imports.
If the government were to restrict opencast mining by stricter planning
controls, as seems likely, then private-sector mining companies such as RJB
Mining and NSM would suffer. Private-sector mining companies might have
difficulty increasing their opencast output from a combined 3m tonnes to 7m
tonnes a year in five years as British Coal had previously expected. That in
turn would affect their ability to buy parts of British Coal when it is
privatised.
Civil engineering contractors, which provide the equipment and most of the
labour for opencast mining, would also be hit.
Mr John Chance, chairman of Wimpey Mining which, with subsidiaries of Taylor
Woodrow and Amec, is among the main contractors, said: 'We would be looking
for compensation. Contractors have Pounds 1bn worth of plant employed in
opencast and the majority is specialised and cannot be used in other
industries. It would go to waste.'
Mr Chance added: 'Each 1m tonnes of opencast provides employment for about
1,000 people, many of them in areas which were formerly mining communities.'
However, there are powerful factors pressing on the government to cut
opencast mining.
A reduction could be portrayed as a concession to environmentalists who have
long complained about the problems associated with opencast mining. The
government could achieve its aims to cut production by revising the
presumption in the planning guidance to local authorities that opencast
mining is in the national interest.
But while environmental considerations could provide the public reason for
cutting opencast mining, the more pressing need is political. Having
rejected the more radical suggestions the government is struggling to find
all the extra coal tonnage it needs to satisfy backbenchers.
The attraction of cutting opencast mining is that, because of planning
permission considerations, it would start to have an effect only in the
latter years of the five-year subsidy which the government is planning to
implement.
Most of the other measures in the white paper would increase demand in the
early years but would have less effect later. This means that, in spite of
the intensive lobbying it faces from British Coal engineering contractors,
the government might find reducing the output from opencast mining
impossible to resist.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Warning on pit workers' pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Coal has told trustees of its two pension schemes that the
government is likely to offer coal workers the same deal on pensions as that
offered to British Rail.
The government has said that after the rail privatisation it will stop its
Pounds 70m annual contribution to the rail pension scheme, and contributions
on behalf of current workers will be paid by their new private-sector
employers.
BR's pension trustees have been offered two options for current and deferred
pensioners.
The first would require BR to turn over a significant portion of its scheme
assets to the Treasury in exchange for a promise by the government to
increase pensions in line with inflation, but there would be no further
improvements in benefits.
The other option would allow BR to keep all the assets but, if these proved
inadequate to meet pension obligations, benefits would be cut.
BR's scheme has total assets of Pounds 7.22bn, with more than 130,000
contributors and about 176,000 current and deferred pensioners.
British Coal has two schemes, one for white-collar staff and the other for
mineworkers. Between them they have about Pounds 13bn in assets, with only
72,000 contributing members but 345,000 pensioners and 277,000 deferred
pensioners.
Miss Rhoslyn Roberts, secretary of the British Coal Staff Superannuation
Scheme, said yesterday on BBC Television's Money Programme that she did not
view government regulations as a sufficient safeguard for the pensioners in
her scheme.
She said: 'I think that the trustees of the staff scheme would certainly
want primary legislation to guarantee the security of pensions for the
future, if such a a proposal were to be adopted.'
Trustees have discussed in private meetings earlier this year whether they
could rely on funding promises made by one government being honoured by
successive governments without legislation.
Moreover, trustees are concerned that their present trust deed requires them
to ensure that any change leaves pensioners no worse than they had been
previously.
Both BR and British Coal pensions have been raised in line with inflation
annually, and in addition large surpluses have been used in recent years to
improve pensions -  particularly for the elderly and least-well-off.
The government's insistence that no further improvements may be made
therefore effectively worsens conditions for the pensioners.
Coal fund trustees, after a series of meetings, are said to agree that it
may be worthwhile to give up scheme assets to the Treasury if sufficient
safeguards can be offered to protect current and future benefits. However,
the trustees feel the plans so far offered to British Rail fall short of the
safeguards needed.
Trustees of BR's pension scheme, including those appointed by BR management,
are preparing a paper for government ministers outlining their concerns
about the proposals.
A BR trustee said: 'We want to talk quietly to the government about the
options. But at the end of the day, if we have Hobson's choice, then we must
take the best option.'
Among other things, the trustees will point out to the government that all
the current actuarial surplus has already been allocated to contribution
holidays and benefit enhancements.

TOURISTS regard the UK and London as being cleaner than two years ago,
although a large number still see room for improvement in public toilets,
public transport and the capital's streets, according to the British Tourist
Authority's overseas visitor survey published today, Michael Skapinker
writes.
London streets were described as clean by 56 per cent, a sharp improvement
on the 1990 figure of 44 per cent. Public toilets in the UK were described
as clean by 55 per cent, compared with 52 per cent in 1990. The cleanliness
of public transport won approval from 54 per cent, compared with 50 per cent
in 1990.
The survey found that Britain was successful in attracting repeat visitors,
with 71 per cent of those interviewed saying they had been before. Repeat
visitors in 1992 had made an average of three previous holiday trips.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Alleged fraud at BA probed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A POLICE report into allegations of fraud in the property maintenance
department of British Airways is being studied by the Crown Prosecution
Service, BA and the police said yesterday. At least 11 people have been
questioned and released on bail.
Details of the investigation have emerged within weeks of the exposure of a
'dirty tricks' campaign by BA against rival airline Virgin Atlantic.
The allegations involve claims that payments were made for maintenance work
which was not carried out or that duplicate payments were made for the same
work.
Yesterday BA denied a newspaper report that it had sold surplus engines
which were unserviceable because they no longer had their logbooks from its
fleet of Trident aircraft.
'BA does not sell serviceable engines without their logbooks except to
museums and to local authorities running, for example, apprenticeship
training schemes,' it said.
Meanwhile BA confirmed that it had had 'good and constructive' talks last
week with Virgin Atlantic aimed at striking a peace deal over the 'dirty
tricks' but refused to give details. It also refused to comment on reports
that Lord King, appointed BA president after stepping down as chairman last
month, would receive between Pounds 200,000 and Pounds 600,000 a year.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Ministers warned on transfer rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S law officers have warned that it could be liable to pay
damages to former civil servants whose employment conditions deteriorated
when the public services they had been providing were contracted out to the
private sector.
In an eight-page confidential document seen by the Financial Times Sir
Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, the
lord advocate, Scotland's senior law officer, warn that ministers should
take 'seriously' the government's potential liability for such damages.
The EC's 1977 Acquired Rights Directive, which the 1981 Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations were designed to
implement in the UK, protects the jobs and conditions of workers in mergers.
Recent decisions of the European Court of Justice have confirmed that the
directive can apply to the contracting out of public services.
The regulations mean that employees who are dismissed because of a transfer
may be classified as unfairly dismissed and therefore entitled to
compensation. The dismissal would automatically be unfair unless it was
genuinely on the grounds of redundancy or for some other legally valid
reason.
The document says a reduction in pay or any other worsening in conditions
could allow employees to resign and claim constructive unfair dismissal.
The main category of individuals likely to pursue such
claims are those who have been unable to take advantage of the EC protection
because the UK regulations exclude non-commercial ventures. It is understood
that officials expect few actions to arise from past contracts that have
been put out to tender as the number excluded from the EC legislation under
the non-commercial venture clause is small.
The government has accepted that the UK regulations do not meet EC
obligations and is in the process of amending them to include non-commercial
ventures. The document indicates that the government could be liable for
claims arising from any flawed transfers that may have taken place in the
past.
The government would be liable for two reasons, the document says. First,
directives impose obligations that directly bind 'the Crown and emanations
of the state irrespective of the (UK) regulations'.
The law officers add that the normal time limits for such actions would not
apply 'since domestic time limits cannot operate in favour of the state
until it has brought its law into harmony with community obligations'.
Second, individuals can sue the government because there is a right to
compensation for EC citizens injured by a member state's failure to give
effect to community law obligations.
The Cabinet Office said it could not comment on 'what may or may not be
advice from legal officers'.
The NUCPS Civil Service union said it would now activate the cases it has
been preparing over the past few months.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Studies for an exercise in containment / The limited scope
for reducing the pressure on education spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EDUCATIONAL issue facing the Portillo public spending review is not how
to cut the bill, but how to stop it shooting through the roof.
Education will this year cost the Exchequer more than Pounds 30bn (the pie
chart gives figures for England only, and local authorities will spend more
than government estimates). Yet all the pressures are for spending to rise
exponentially:
16-year-olds are staying on at school or college in unprecedented numbers,
with politicians campaigning in unison for still more to do so.
In 1987 less than half of all 16-year-olds remained in full-time education.
This year three quarters are doing so and more than four in five are
expected to stay on within three years. Although the trend is partly
influenced by the recession, most observers believe a cultural shift is
afoot and that staying on will soon be the norm among all social groups, not
only the professional classes.
The rate of increase is as rapid at university level. In 1991 the Department
for Education projected that by 2000 one in three 18-year-olds would be
going on to higher education. It now expects that target to be reached in
the next three years and has just imposed quotas on vice-chancellors to
prevent the target being reached sooner.
The government's campaign to persuade schools to abandon local-authority
control and seek grant-maintained status is costing it dear. Only 337 of
England's 21,000 schools have yet opted out but getting that figure to 1,500
by the middle of next year is a top political priority for Mr John Patten,
education secretary. To encourage them to opt out, grant-maintained schools
get special bonuses in revenue and capital funding.
The government is concerned about the funding implications when more schools
have opted out, but to prevent momentum flagging Mr Patten has promised that
the new central funding formula for grant-maintained schools, to be
introduced over the next two years, will leave virtually all better off than
they now are under local-authority control.
The only compensatory savings on offer are from Mr Patten's promised assault
on surplus places in schools. But in recent months he has almost halved the
number he thinks he can eliminate, and with rising rolls and the inevitable
concessions to parents of small schools in marginal constituencies, even
that target may prove illusory. Anyway, set against the spending pressures
the sum involved -  about Pounds 150m -  is chicken-feed.
So what is to be done? At the school level, radical options for
user-charges, or means-tested vouchers of the kind once favoured by the Adam
Smith Institute -  but by few others even on the right wing - have been
ruled out. Mr Major is simply not prepared to send out bills for school fees
and the practical difficulties in the way of means-tested vouchers are of
poll-tax dimensions.
At university level the field is more open. Having burnt its fingers on the
issue in the mid-1980s, in 1991 the government abandoned ideas for making
students pay means-tested fees. Instead, the state continues to pay fees
direct to universities for all first-degree students, irrespective of
parents' income. Mr Portillo could review that.
The Labour party is considering plans for charging fees to the better off.
The education department already has a student-loan scheme for living
expenses in place and machinery for assessing parental income, which is used
to determine maintenance grants, which are being gradually replaced by
loans.
With the total bill for university fees at little more than Pounds 1.5bn, no
bonanza is to be had from that source, however.
On the face of it there is scope for retrenching on teachers' pay. After
hefty increases in the past two years pay is no longer derisory. From this
September a teacher midway up the salary scale will get Pounds 18,000 a
year, with heads of large secondary schools eligible for up to Pounds
50,000. Recession and improved pay have given the classroom a new appeal.
Teacher-training colleges are swamped with applications and the proportion
of vacancies fell three quarters in two years.
Regional pay could be on the agenda. Vacancy rates in Wales, the Midlands
and the south-west are barely half those in London. In the Yorkshire area,
the north and north-west they are a third or lower. But since pay cuts would
create uproar, only a sharp rise in inflation would enable sizeable
differentials to be introduced soon.
No wonder Mr Patten agreed to the Portillo review so willingly. With most of
his budget politically out-of-bounds, its most likely result will be to give
the Treasury imprimatur to his steep upward spending curves. Unless, that
is, the government wants to risk a poll tax on children.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Shephard hints that rules on dole may be eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government signalled yesterday that it was ready to ease rules
preventing the unemployed receiving dole payments if they are in full-time
training or education or working in the unpaid voluntary sector.
Under present rules payments are cut for those spending more than 21 hours a
week on courses or working in such sectors as voluntary community work. But
in a BBC radio interview yesterday Mrs Gillian Shephard hinted that these
regulations might be altered. The employment secretary said that the special
cabinet committee on unemployment had completed its work and proposals would
be tabled in the Commons within the coming few weeks. She added that the
Whitehall-wide inquiry had involved joint reviews by the education and
social security departments 'to see if there are more sensible ways of
helping unemployed people to use their time constructively'.
The government was now examining 'ranges of ways' to help the jobless make
productive use of their time away from full-time employment, Mrs Shephard
said.
Meanwhile, Labour was stepping up its campaign for a Budget for jobs by
charging the government with failing to take adequate steps to protect those
still in work. In the same BBC programme Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment
secretary, said that as many as 300,000 jobs were under threat. These
included 100,000 in coalmining and related industries, a similar figure
through local-authority budget cuts and the rest through post office and
rail privatisation, defence cuts and in the London Underground and the
National Health Service.
An all-day meeting of the shadow cabinet today will look at plans drawn up
by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, for job rallies to be staged in
Tory-held marginal seats, including Basildon, Swindon and Tynemouth over the
coming weeks.
A survey of unemployed people found that 74 per cent rejected any plan that
would force them to work for their unemployment benefit. But the Mori poll
for the BBC TV On the Record programme of people out of work for more than a
year showed that 53 per cent would support a voluntary work scheme for a
small, extra payment.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Universal training credit is considered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTRODUCTION of a universal credit or entitlement to either vocational
training or academic study for post-16-year-olds is being investigated by
the government, Lisa Wood writes.
Credits would introduce the marketplace into schools and further education.
Critics of the present system argue that the vocational training system pays
by outcome, such as the attainment of qualifications, in contrast to funding
for both schools and further education colleges.
A universal credit would extend arrangements now being offered to a number
of young people on Youth Training, the government's main training scheme for
young people.
Individuals are given a credit with which they can choose to purchase
training with an employer. By 1996 all young people going on to YT will have
such an entitlement. The government believes that the credit empowers the
individual and encourages him or her to take greater responsibility for
their training.
The Confederation of British Industry, which will be taking part in the
government's consultation exercise on the universal credit, is a strong
advocate of such a move.
The review will also consider whether the state is getting value for money
with increased staying-on rates at school and how best young people can be
guided to taking the route most appropriate to them -  be it academic or
vocational.
Staying on rates at school have increased significently in recent years but
non-completion rates of both training programmes and academic courses are
high.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Trustees saw risk in Belling deal: Pension fund invested
Pounds 5.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORMER pension trustees of Belling, the cooker maker now in liquidation,
acknowledged long before they purchased a subsidiary of Belling in 1991 that
its value would be severely diminished if the company were wound up.
The chairman and the finance director of Belling, Mr Richard Eric Belling
and Mr Michael Henley Stewart, were responsible for the administration of
the Belling pension fund.
About Pounds 6m of the Pounds 8m sought by the current pension fund trustees
from Belling's liquidators and others relate to this transaction.
The activities of the trustees come to light as the government's own panel,
under the stewardship of Professor Roy Goode, considers whether the present
trust law framework is adequate to protect pensioners.
The Goode committee is also asking whether there should be further
restrictions on the composition of boards of trustees and on transactions
between pension funds and plan sponsors.
The subsidiary, Compound Sections Ltd, was sold to the pension scheme for
Pounds 5.5m in December 1991. It is now valued at Pounds 2.5m. The Pounds 8m
sought by the trustees includes about Pounds 3m as a performance-related
penalty payment for failing to achieve expected earnings.
In April 1991 Mr Stewart and Mr Belling contemplated the likely winding-up
of Belling by Midland Bank, its largest lender. Mr Stewart believed CSL
would be able to continue to trade as an independent company but that its
value would be severely diminished by the loss of work from Belling itself.
Belling had been trying to find a buyer or investor for all or part of the
company for some months before the sale of the subsidiary to the pension
fund.
Earlier in April 1991 3i, the venture-capital investment company, turned
down a request by Belling for a cash injection via a buy-out of the company.
'We felt that next year's budget is credible, but contains areas of risk',
3i said in explaining its decision.
Also that month Belling was discussing the possible sale of all or part of
the company with investment bankers S G Warburg.
The present pension trustees are also seeking Pounds 2.1m from the former
trustees personally in connection with pension fund monies used for an
advance interest payment on a Dollars 50m loan to Belling itself which never
materialised.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Seoul orders tax audit at steel group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE South Korean government has ordered a tax audit of Pohong Iron and Steel
(Posco), the world's third largest steelmaker, in what is regarded as a
possible political reprisal against its former chairman.
Mr Park Tae-joon, who created the state-run steel company 25 years ago,
refused to support Mr Kim Young-sam, Korea's new president, after he was
nominated candidate of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) last year.
Mr Park, who then headed the majority faction within the DLP, resigned from
the party and as Posco chairman in protest against Mr Kim's nomination. Mr
Park is now honorary chairman of Posco.
The government appears to be settling political scores with industrialists
who opposed Mr Kim by investigating their business activities.
Mr Chung Ju-yung, founder of the Hyundai industrial group, was forced to
retire from politics last week after he was indicted for allegedly receiving
illegal campaign funds from the conglomerate.
The United People's Party, the opposition group formed by Mr Chung a year
ago, could be dissolved this week. Mr Chung is encouraging its MPs to join
the ruling party in an apparent attempt at reconciliation with the
government.
The Office of National Tax Administration has not conducted a tax audit of
Posco in 13 years, although the company's accounts are regularly inspected
by the government's audit agency.
The tax office denied that it was investigating Posco for the illegal use of
corporate funds for political purposes. It described the audit as 'routine'
and said it was focusing on the 1990 financial year.
The Posco share price fell on Saturday when the tax audit was disclosed.
Posco became a popular stock among foreign investors last autumn after the
government allowed them to acquire 8 per cent of its shares.
The foreign shareholding limit was quickly filled, reflecting Posco's
earnings performance with a 27 per cent growth in 1992 profits to Won185bn
(Pounds 160m).

FT  15 FEB 93 / Pressure for Japan growth package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic Party will put pressure on the finance
ministry to bring forward plans for a pump-priming package so that Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa, the prime minister, can outline the plan when he visits Washington
in the spring.
It is likely that Mr Miyazawa will want to indicate the timing and scale of
a stimulus package during talks with President Bill Clinton, possibly next
month, in order to counter US calls for Japan to take its surging trade
surplus in hand.
The finance ministry insists that plans for another such package must wait
until the 1993 budget is passed and after the effects of last year's
Y10,700bn (Pounds 62.5bn) special package begin to spread through the
economy.
Talks in Washington at the weekend left the Japanese government in no doubt
that the Clinton administration will take an assertive approach to trade
issues, which could signal the start of a renewed round of trade friction.
Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, urged Japan to open its rice
market to underline its commitment to free trade.
Mr Masami Tanabu, the Japanese agriculture minister, dismissed the demand,
stating that Japan would stick to its policy of banning imports.
Late last year Mr Miyazawa hinted the rice import ban might be lifted to
help conclude the Uruguay round of Gatt world trade liberalisation talks.
However, the LDP is wary of antagonising rice farmers, who are among its
strongest supporters, in the run-up to an election expected in the late
autumn.
Some Japanese officials believe that the US administration may press Japan
to open the rice market before a Gatt deal as a symbol of Japan's commitment
to reduce its trade surplus.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Battle to curb powers of Malay sultans leaves deep scars:
The royals have yielded to a government campaign and agreed to
constitutional changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE royal bashing season in Malaysia is over. Last week the country's nine
sultans, each of whom takes a turn as Malaysia's king, finally agreed to
constitutional changes limiting their powers.
A three-month battle between government and royalty which threatened unrest
in one of Asia's fast growing countries has ended. The guns of the heavily
government-influenced media, trained on the royals since late last year,
have fallen silent.
But the tussle between the government led by Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime
minister, and the royals has left deep scars. Malaysia's monarchy now faces
an uncertain future. Politics in Malaysia is unlikely to be the same again.
The royal rumpus started last November after one of the sultans had
allegedly beaten up a sports official. The behaviour of the sultans and
their increasing involvement in politics and Malaysia's business sector had
been a growing cause of concern to the government.
Dr Mahathir, 12 years prime minister, decided he had enough public support
to go for the royal jugular.
He launched an unprecedented campaign against the sultans. Before this, any
mention of royal misdeeds had been forbidden. Now the public was fed an
increasingly rich diet of alleged royal misdemeanours, ranging from
corruption to murder.
Revelations were made about the spendthrift ways of the royalty - their polo
ponies, their Italian sports cars, their private armies, their palaces and
their yachts.
Dr Mahathir's initial campaign against the sultans backfired. According to
Malaysia's constitution, the sultans have to agree to any changes which
affect their position.
Incensed by Dr Mahathir's public assault, they refused to accept
constitutional amendments which would, among other things, take away their
immunity from prosecution.
Dr Mahathir responded by withdrawing various royal privileges. Most
seriously for the sultans, a number of financial stipends were removed.
The sultans would no longer be entitled to preferential share allocations.
Thousands of hectares of valuable forest concessions were taken away. There
was talk of investigating certain royal business deal ings.
Now the sultans, some apparently fearing bank-ruptcy, have agreed to what
amounts to a humiliating truce. The royals accept Dr Mahathir's amendments,
though some limited concessions appear to have been made by the government.
Royal status has been severely dented by the three-month campaign against
them. The palace gates have been thrown open: public prying into royal
affairs is unlikely now to cease overnight.
Dr Mahathir has already said that certain royal privileges will not be
restored. That could mean that some sultans might still face severe
financial hardship, if not ruin.
On one hand Dr Mahathir, already invested with considerable executive
powers, emerges from the royal fray in an even stronger position, with his
reputation for tough dealing enhanced.
However, Dr Mahathir has encouraged public prying into the financial affairs
of the monarchy. There are those who say that equally close examination
should now be made of the business dealings of what critics call Malaysia
new rajas -  some senior government officials themselves.
The royals might not be the only people to have been damaged by the events
of the last three months.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Australian opposition given a boost: Hewson unscathed in
pre-election debate with hesitant Keating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ELECTORAL prospects of Australia's conservative coalition strengthened
yesterday when Mr John Hewson, the opposition leader, emerged unscathed from
a televised debate with Mr Paul Keating, the Labor prime minister.
Mr Hewson's robust performance, at the end of the first week's campaigning
for the March 13 federal election, will give renewed confidence to the
conservative Liberal/National Party coalition, which is up to 12 points
ahead in opinion polls.
Mr Keating appeared hesitant when challenged on the credibility of his
economic forecasts and floundered when asked to produce a timetable for
Labor's promised constitutional changes.
Labor's election strategists had hoped for a repeat of the 1990 election
campaign, when Mr Bob Hawke, the former prime minister, decisively won a
debate with Mr Andrew Peacock, the then opposition leader.
But Mr Keating's aggressive debating style appeared to be blunted by the
format, which required the two leaders to give short answers to questions
from a panel of journalists.
As expected, the prime minister claimed that the economy was poised for a
strong recovery and forecast that unemployment was 'on its way down' from
the current level of 10.9 per cent.
Mr Keating attacked the coalition's 'divisive' plans to abolish the
centralised industrial relations system, reform the national health care
system and introduce a 15 per cent goods and service tax.
Mr Hewson focused on the government's patchy economic record and the
unreliability of official forecasts, which have repeatedly over-estimated
growth prospects.
The debate confirmed that the government has the most ground to make up for
polling day, especially in the light of figures released last week showing
that 1m Australians are out of work for the first time since the second
world war.
A second televised debate is scheduled to take place in three weeks.
But the outcome of the election may turn on the next batch of unemployment
figures, which are due to be released just two days before the vote.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Ukraine's youthful enthusiasm for private industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEPRESSING AS this may seem, the experience of the last decade means that
western governments are now adept at dealing with the political fall-out
from persistently high rates of unemployment. Not so in the former Soviet
Union. Political leaders in Russia and the 14 other republics which have
succeeded the union have had no choice but to learn to live with rising
prices, falling output and declining real wages. But none has been prepared
to tolerate the rise unemployment that this collapse implies.
The fear, openly expressed by reformers in Kiev and less publicly by their
counterparts in Moscow, is that allowing enterprises to close would lead to
mass unemployment and provoke a wave of opposition against reform.
But the alternative, in the absence of substantial western aid, is to try to
keep unemployment rates low by continuing the current practice of printing
money to pay wages at the expense of accelerating inflation.
Would the employment consequences of cutting subsidies be disastrous?
Poland, after three years of pain, has managed to stabilise its inflation
rate by allowing the private sector to absorb many of the workers who lost
their jobs in state industries. Unemployment rose to 14 per cent last year,
not so high by west European standards, while over half of Poland's employed
work in the private sector.
Yet Poland's private sector, even before reforms began in early 1990,
already accounted for over a third of total employment. In the former Soviet
Union, by contrast, private employment was negligible, at least in the legal
economy. The ability of fledgling private companies to absorb redundant
workers might be expected to be comparatively modest.
Typically, there are almost no reliable statistical data about current
employment in the former Soviet republics; but a recent survey of redundant
workers in Ukraine's capital goes some way towards filling this vacuum. By
tracking the fortunes of 350 workers who were made redundant last year, Mr
Simon Johnson of the Fuqua School of Business, Duke University and Mr Oleg
Ustenko of Kiev State Economics University suggest some grounds for
optimism.
The survey covers workers previously employed by 13 state enterprises in
Kiev. In December 1991, the enterprises employed 65,000 workers, a little
under 10 per cent of total employment in the city. But employment in these
enterprises has fallen by 13 per cent over the past year, with about two
thirds of the job losses resulting from involuntary redundancies or
retirement. Job cuts were relatively more severe in the seven enterprises
which produce only civilian goods. Among the four military enterprises,
which make up three quarters of total employment in the sample, two
enterprises escaped redundancies almost entirely.
Young people appear to have borne the brunt of these redundancies. From each
of the 13 enterprises, Johnson and Ustenko have interviewed 40 workers who
were fired last year. While the redundancies were equally split between
women and men, 49 per cent of the redundant workers were aged under 30 and
only 3 per cent were aged over 50.
Surprisingly, however, the survey finds that two thirds of the redundant
workers have been able to find new employment, with younger male workers
faring better in the job hunt. Of the women and older workers who have found
jobs, most work in the state sector. Younger workers, by contrast, are much
more likely to find employment in the non-state or 'private' sector as the
chart shows, usually unlicensed small-scale trading or in off-shoots from
the state enterprises. Men have also fared better than women: only 12 per
cent of the male sample said they were unemployed compared to 39 per cent of
women.
Ukraine has a long way to go before it reaches Polish levels of private
activity. But it has made a start.

<TEXT>
SOUTH Africa's president, Mr F W de Klerk, warned yesterday that the South
African republic risked breaking up unless Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi,
leader of the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party, could be brought into
negotiations on a post-apartheid constitution.
'Otherwise we might be looking for trouble in South Africa. We don't want to
go the Yugoslavian way,' he said in a BBC interview.
The threat of secession from the republic by Chief Buthelezi, political and
tribal leader of the Zulus, became acute after news that the chief's rivals,
the African National Congress, had done a bilateral deal with government to
install a power-sharing cabinet to rule South Africa until the end of the
century.
Chief Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party would probably gain enough votes to
participate in this cabinet along with the ANC and ruling National Party.
But Chief Buthelezi reacted to news of the deal by warning of possible
bloodshed if such a solution were imposed on his people.
The Inkatha leader said in a statement the government and the ANC would have
to resort to force to compel the KwaZulu homeland, which he heads, to accept
the plans announced on Friday.
He, too, raised the spectre of Yugoslavia, saying 'minds should be
concentrated on recent world events in which similar arrogant impositions
have resulted in untold misery and bloodshed'.
Late last year, Chief Buthelezi published a draft constitution for the Natal
region which amounted to a unilateral declaration of independence from the
republic.
This constitution and other issues are to be discussed when Inkatha and
government negotiators meet for three days later this week to prepare for a
planned multi-party conference due by the end of this month.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Wave of violence in Algeria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RADICAL Islamic groups in Algeria have stepped up confrontation with the
security forces with a series of weekend attacks.
General Khaled Nezzar, defence minister and key figure in the five-man
presidency, narrowly escaped assassination on Saturday when a car bomb
exploded as he drove past.
Fundamentalists yesterday attacked a minibus carrying children of members of
the security forces to school in Algiers, wounding the driver.
At least 600 members of the security forces have been killed in the past 12
months, including four policemen in Algiers on Saturday.
The attempted killing of the defence minister came less than two days after
execution of four fundamentalists for an attack on army barracks.
Gen Nezzar has tried to hold a middle course between senior members of the
armed and security forces who want a firm line against Moslem groups and
those officers more inclined to conciliation. Mr Michel Sapin, French
finance minister, has offered Algeria FFr6bn (Pounds 752m) worth of tied
credits for 1993.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Nigeria meets UK over debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
NIGERIA will seek UK support for its plan to revive a lapsed reform
programme and reschedule its Dollars 27.6bn external debt today when Mr
Ernest Shonekan, chairman of the country's transitional council, meets Mr
John Major, the British prime minister.
The Downing Street talks are seen as critical to Nigeria's efforts to win
international backing for last month's budget, designed to pave the way to a
new agreement with the International Monetary Fund and to rescheduling
negotiations by mid-year.
The military government of President Ibrahim Babangida is due to complete
the transition to civilian rule in August.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, last month stressed during a
visit to Lagos that there was 'not a chance' of persuading Nigeria's
creditors that the Trinidad terms for debt relief could be applied before an
IMF deal. The terms, announced by Mr Major in October 1991, allow for the
write-off of half of an eligible country's official debt and long-term
rescheduling of the balance.

FT  15 FEB 93 / US steps up pressure for Mideast talks: Palestinians warn
that stranded deportees still pose a problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS to set a date for the resumption of Middle East peace talks will
intensify this week with a visit to the region by Mr Warren Christopher, the
US secretary of state.
The US and Israel believe that the Arab delegations can be brought back to
the table, even though nearly 400 deported Palestinians remain stranded in
south Lebanon in defiance of a United Nations resolution.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, said yesterday he believed 'that
parties interested in peace will come to the negotiations and I believe that
the Palestinians will do the same'. Israel has ruled out further concessions
on the deportees, beyond offering to take back 100 immediately and reducing
by half the two-year banishment order for the others.
On Friday, the UN Security Council welcomed the offer to readmit 100
Palestinians and repeated its demand for the rest to be allowed back as soon
as possible. The statement appears to have headed off any Arab attempt to
persuade the Security Council to impose sanctions against Israel.
Mr Nabil Sha'ath, who has co-ordinated the Palestinian negotiating position
during the Washington talks, said yesterday the US was making a mistake if
it thought it had resolved the problem of the deportees in advance of Mr
Christopher's trip. 'That would be a very big mistake and really does not
augur well for his visit,' he said.
Syria, Jordan and Lebanon all wish to resume peace negotiations soon. But
they would hesitate to attend if the Palestinans stayed away. Mrs Hanan
Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation, said she was not
insisting that all deportees be taken back imediately but there had to be an
acceptable timetable.
The deportees are accused by Israel of being members of Hamas or Islamic
Jihad, the two radical Palestinian organisations in the occupied West bank
and Gaza that oppose the peace talks and are challenging the political
leadership of the PLO, headed by Mr Yassir Arafat.
Accepting an arrangement set by Israel and the US to resume peace talks
while the 400 deportees remain in Lebanon could further reduce PLO influence
in the territories, especially as anger is running high over the sharp
increase in children and young people shot dead by Israeli troops during the
past two months.
Some western diplomats fear that even if Mr Christopher succeeds in bringing
all delegations back to the peace talks, recent events will have soured the
negotiating atmosphere and will make compromises more difficult. Mr Rabin
has also been under fire from the right wing in Israel for bowing to US
pressure on re-admitting 100 of the Palestinian deportees and may want to
reinforce his credentials as a tough negotiator.

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGNERS living in Germany should be given easier access to citizenship as
well as the possibility of dual citizenship, a senior member of the
governing Christian Democratic Union said at the weekend.
The move is likely to increase pressure among the CDU, and the Christian
Social Union, its sister party in Bavaria, to support eventually the
principle of an immigration law.
Mr Heiner Geissler, the former chairman of the CDU/CSU parliamentary
faction, said that citizenship acquired through 'birth and blood was
disgraceful'. Citizenship is automatically granted to an individual if
either parent is German.
The strongest support for easier access to citizenship, which would
inevitably lead to a debate about introducing an immigration law, has come
from the liberal Free Democratic party, the junior coalition partner, and
the opposition Social Democratic party. However, the CSU continues to oppose
any relaxation of current citizenship laws, which allow foreigners the
chance for full German citizenship after 15 years.
Mr Geissler's calls follow a wave of attacks on foreigners by extreme
right-wing groups. Yesterday, a fire bomb was thrown into a Turkish-owned
shop, injuring 10 people.
European interior ministers will meet in Budapest today to discuss policy on
refugees, immigration and asylum.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Stormclouds gather over Croatia's Sector West
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE heavily bombarded town of Pakrac in Sector West, one of four United
Nations protected areas in Croatia, Serb and Croat farmers last week met to
decide how to divide up local vineyards before the planting season.
A handful of Serb and Croat families are even returning to the no-man's land
running through the town. The UN will provide them with temporary shelters
while they rebuild their houses. The dire economic situation in the zone,
which is bisected by the strategic Zagreb-Belgrade motorway, has led to
moves towards trade between local Croats and the 40,000 Serbs in the
south-east pocket of Sector West.
Such co-operation would seem to be a positive omen. But the status of Sector
West and the other UN protected zones is still uncertain.
Last week Zagreb indicated that it would approve a six-week extension of the
mandate of the 14,000 UN peacekeepers in Croatia which expires next week.
This was despite allegations that the international peace plan for the
republic has failed.
The extension will allow time for international negotiators to broker a
fresh ceasefire between the Croatian and Serbian forces at talks which begin
at the UN in New York tomorrow. But before agreeing to a further year of
peace-keeping, the Croats are demanding the involvement of Nato troops and a
timetable for the restoration of Croat government control over the third of
its territory seized by Serb forces in 1991. The biggest bone of contention
between Croatia and the UN is the return of 245,000 refugees to Serb-held
zones.
Skirmishes between Serb and Croat forces rumble on in Sector South,
following last month's Croat offensive across UN lines to secure the
Maslenica bridge and Peruca dam.
But what UN officials most fear is the spread of fighting to Sector West. It
is the most tempting target for Croats anxious to gain control over the
whole of the republic -  breakaway enclaves included. In a recent nationwide
address President Franjo Tudjman placed the motorway at the top of a list of
Serb-held targets which his forces intend to recover. The villages in the
sector bear testimony to the seven-month Serb-Croat war of 1991.
UN commanders say they expect an attack on Sector West, which is divided
into a larger Croat-held and a smaller Serb-held area. They point to the
build-up of Croatian troops around the zone. But in contrast to the other
zones, there are substantial UN forces in Sector West, including the better
part of six heavily armed battalions.
In Daruvar, the UN military headquarters for Sector West, Lt-Col Guillermo
Lopez, the Argentine commander, said: 'We are waiting for an attack. Our
order is to defend the UNPA. If it means shooting, that's okay.'
Sector West is the UN's showpiece in Croatia, a model of co-operation
between the UN and Serb authorities, especially compared with other zones.
Croatia and Yugoslavia signed the peace plan for the republic in January
1992. The deal envisaged the disbanding of Serb militias and return of
refugees but left the final status of Serb-held territory undetermined. The
plan was undermined from the first, when the Serbs refused to disband their
armed militia and carried on expelling Croats and other non-Serbs from the
UN sectors.
The Croats see the agreement as tantamount to cementing Serb territorial
gains in the Serbo-Croat war, perhaps forgetting that the plan ended the war
and the destruction of the eastern Croatian city of Osijek. Instead Croatia
has waged what one UN official described as an 'unprecedentedly vicious
campaign from the moment we arrived'. Leaders from Krajina, which covers
one-third of Croatia, now claim their failure to comply with the peace plan
has been justified by the Croatian offensive.
The Croat offensive has certainly reversed the scant progress made thus far
by the UN forces. Serb fighters acting on orders from Knin, the centre of
Krajina, took back their heavy artillery, earlier placed under UN guard, in
all of the zones except for Sector West. Lt-Col. Lopez said: 'They took the
tanks and drove about 200 metres but turned around after our commander
promised to defend the zone.'

FT  15 FEB 93 / Bosnian Serbs set for clash with UN on relief convoy

THE UN yesterday was set on a collision course with Bosnian Serb leaders
after they turned back a relief convoy headed for a besieged Moslem enclave
cut off from the outside world since April.
In what was seen as a crucial test of a UN pledge to break through a Serb
siege of Moslem enclaves, the ten-lorry convoy set off from Belgrade at dawn
carrying 90 tonnes of food and medical supplies to Cerska, eastern Bosnia.
But Bosnian Serb commanders said the convoy could not pass because of
fighting in the area.
According to The Belgrade office of the UN High Commissioner of Refugees
(UNHCR), the Bosnian Serbs also claimed they had not received prior notice.
The UNHCR said the convoy will try again today.
The convoy was stopped even though Mr Jose Maria Mendiluce, the special
UNHCR envoy, at the weekend told Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic the
convoy would go ahead despite Serb opposition.
Mr Karadzic demanded that a truce must be agreed before the convoy was
allowed to pass.
Serb commanders have shocked UN relief workers with their refusal to allow
the passage of food and medical supplies for reasons ranging from personal
security to accusations that the convoys are carrying smuggled weapons.
Belgrade Radio yesterday reported fighting between troops in Serb-held
Bratunac, on the River Drina which marks the Bosnian frontier with Serbia,
and Srebrenica, a nearby Moslem stronghold. The mainly Moslem Bosnian forces
in Srebrenica have tried to break the Serb stranglehold of eastern Bosnia.
Mr Ljubisa Vladusic, the minister for refugee affairs in the self-styled
Serb Republic of Bosnia, who attended the meeting, said: 'We said we had
nothing against aid supplies for the Moslems along the Drina river but an
end to the fighting was a precondition -  not just on the day and place of a
convoy but a truce which would ensure the safety of the corridor.'
UNHCR officials have vowed to get tough with Serbs, Croats and Moslems for
undermining the deliver of emergency relief -  but have singled out Serb
leaders for blocking relief to about 100,000 Moslems in eastern Bosnia.
Mr Mendiluce yesterday in Sarajevo condemned the Bosnian government for its
decision to boycott aid for the 380,000 people trapped in the capital out of
solidarity with the besieged Moslem enclaves.

<TEXT>
UKRAINIAN government officials failed at the weekend to reach agreement with
miners from the Donbass region who have called a general strike for February
25 over demands for higher wages and further subsidies to the coal industry.
Resisting the miners' demands is crucial if the Ukrainian government is to
fulfil its pledge to bring the budget deficit down from last year's 44 per
cent of GNP. However, failing to appease the Russian-dominated region could
strengthen separatist tendencies and that may be a political price Kiev is
unwilling to pay.
Mr Iuri Ioffe, deputy prime minister with responsibility for the energy
sector, said on Friday that the government would not bow to pressure from
the miners. 'The strike leaders tell the workers that they should put down
their tools because the government will always find money for the Donbass,'
said Mr Ioffe, a former director of a coal mine. 'But I tell you now, this
government has no money left.'
Mr Ioffe said that the disturbances were being provoked by the managers of
the mines, whose salaries were slashed in December by as much as 90 per cent
after a government commission discovered that mine directors were paying
themselves up to 100 times the average Ukrainian wage.
The confrontation comes at a time when Ukraine is facing a severe energy
crisis triggered by Russia's decision to supply oil at only one-third of
traditional levels.
To help make up the short-fall, Ukraine is pursuing vigorous negotiations
with Iran. On a visit to Kiev last week the Iranian energy minister said his
country will supply Ukraine with 4m tonnes of oil this year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER communist party boss and an emigre ambassador were the choices
facing Lithuanian voters in yesterday's presidential elections. The
contenders epitomise the confusion over how the small Baltic state can
embark on the transition from communism to capitalism.
Mr Algirdas Brazauskas, respected for splitting the Lithuanian communist
party from Moscow three years ago, is tipped to win. He is riding high on a
wave of popular discontent with every aspect of Lithuanian life from the
lack of hot water to chaotic agricultural reforms.
But Lithuania's ambassador to the US, Mr Stasys Lozoraitis, an emigre who
has spent his adult life in the west, is expected to pick up a substantial
number of votes with his warning that Mr Brazauskas is too rooted in the
past to take the country into the future.
Some supporters, citing the dubious nature of opinion polls, even hope for
an upset win this morning. 'Lozoraitis can see things better than us from
the outside,' said Mr Berute Vienazinviene, who is in her early 60s, as are
both the candidates. 'I respect Brazauskas but you can't teach an old dog
new tricks.' That opinion is shared by the Catholic Church, young people,
and many educated and better-off Lithuanians who want to rejoin the
capitalist west from which Lithuania was plucked by Soviet annexation in
1941.
But peasants, disgruntled by hasty land reform in this agricultural nation,
and others nostalgic for the safe Soviet past have been reassured by the
promises of Mr Brazauskas who says that the 'burden of reform must be borne
by the state not by ordinary people'.
His renamed Democratic Labour party trounced Mr Zytautas Landsbergis, the
nationalist leader, and his radical Sajudis movement in parliamentary
elections last November.
Even though this is unlikely, Mr Brazauskas also expects this week's
negotiations with Russia will produce better terms for the supply of energy
as the change to world prices has cut off hot water to Lithuanian homes.
The tall former athlete has, in effect, halted privatisation pending a
review. He has also pledged to soften financial policies agreed with the
International Monetary Fund, which is soon expected to release the second
tranche of a standby facility.
The affable Mr Lozor-aitis meanwhile, looking every bit 'the American' he is
perceived to be with his horn-rimmed spectacles and natty suits, has made no
promises except to say: 'We must do something' to relieve the plight of the
peasants and 'make something' of the obsolete industries inherited from
Soviet rule.
The truth is that neither candidate has a clear idea of what to do once in
power, underlining the dilemma facing reformers in the former Soviet Union.
While both have vowed to correct the mistakes made by Mr Landsbergis in his
first year of independence, neither has a magic solution for coping with the
country's limited resources, and for attracting badly needed foreign
investment.

There was some speculation in Caracas that the pact may be an effort to

American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).
The G3 presidents and the chief executives of six central American states
also called for a free trade area, by July 1 1993, between G3 members and

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSERVATIVE challenger in the Cyprus presidential election, Mr Glafcos
Clerides, yesterday won a narrow upset victory over President George
Vassiliou, Agencies report from Nicosia.
Mr Clerides, a 73-year-old veteran of Cyprus politics, campaigned for
changes in United Nations proposals aimed at ending the division of the
island between Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
The official result last night gave Mr Clerides 50.3 per cent to Mr
Vassiliou's 49.7 per cent in the second round of voting -  a majority of
fewer than 2,000 votes. The challenger had trailed in the first round of
voting a week ago, but supporters of an eliminated candidate switched to him
in a run-off vote.
With the margin of victory so thin, the Vassiliou camp at first refused to
concede defeat and demanded a recount in the Nicosia district, but this was
rejected by the chief election officer.
Mr Vassiliou, a 61-year-old millionaire backed by the communists, won an
unexpected victory five years ago.
Clerides supporters last night burst into wild celebrations, driving through
the streets of Nicosia in cars draped with Cypriot and Greek flags, and
honking car horns.
The so-called UN 'set of ideas' for the future of the divided island was a
dominant campaign issue.
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops seized the northern
third in the wake of a short-lived coup in Nicosia backed by the military
junta then ruling Greece.
Mr Clerides has not rejected outright the UN proposals to reunite the island
as a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation of Greek and Turkish Cypriots. But he
has said key clauses need to be rewritten.
Mr Clerides has said he will postpone UN-sponsored talks with Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash and launch intensive efforts to take Cyprus
into the European Community.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Gabriele Cagliari, the president of ENI, the Italian state oil concern,
was told over the weekend by Rome magistrates that he was under
investigation for alleged embezzlement over a controversial reorganisation
of the chemicals industry in 1990.
Mr Cagliari is the most senior figure in a state-run industry to fall foul
of a wave of investigations into illegal party funding, corruption and abuse
of public office. The weekend saw a string of prominent politicians and
businessmen come under investigation.
For at least three weeks Rome magistrates have been looking into ENI's
decision to buy out the Ferruzzi group's 40 per cent stake in their joint
chemicals conglomerate, Enimont. The stake, held through Ferruzzi's
chemicals arm Montedison, was sold in 1990 for L2,805bn (Pounds 1.27bn) on
the basis of both international and Italian valuations.
But the price was high given the state of chemicals business and in
particular the losses in the fertiliser sector. ENI's accounts still reflect
the consequences of this purchase. Mr Cagliari, questioned by magistrates on
Saturday, has denied any wrong-doing in the operation. Earlier last week Mr
Raul Gardini, the financier who headed Montedison at the the time, was also
questioned about the Enimont deal.
In another development, Mr Cirono Pomicino, budget minister in the previous
Andreotti government and one of the most influential members of the
Christian Democrat party, was warned he was under investigation for alleged
corruption. The investigation centres on a port modernisation contract.
Mr Pomicino, the Christian Democrat leader in Naples, vigorously denied the
allegations and yesterday personally took the matter up with the
magistrates. Nevertheless it is the first time in the recent spate of
corruption investigations that the Christian Democrat stronghold of Naples
has been touched.
Among the businessmen arrested for alleged corruption over the weekend were
Mr Bruno Tronchetti Provera, member of a leading Milanese business family,
and brother of the chief executive of Pirelli; and Mr Paolo Ciaccia, head of
ENI's engineering group Saipem.
Their arrest formed part of a new branch of inquiry by Milanese magistrates
into alleged kick-backs paid to politicians in the energy sector.

FT  15 FEB 93 / EC maps a path for steel's contraction
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST October, the European Community's largest steelmakers called for
financial, commercial and political help from the EC authorities. Hit by
overcapacity, recession and cheap non-EC imports, the industry warned of
'catastrophe', if the Community did not support it under the Treaty of Paris
 - protector of the European steel and coal industries since 1951, and
foundation of the modern Community.
Five months later, the situation in the EC steel industry has changed. The
main steel producers have finally begun to cut production and raise prices.
But Community action is still seen as essential. A special report submitted
to the Commission a week ago by Mr Fernand Braun, the EC's 'steel envoy',
records 70 steelmakers' warning that the situation is still worsening and
could have repercussions for other sectors.
This week, the European Commission is poised to deliver a detailed response
to last October's plea. This outline plan will be discussed by a special
council of EC industry ministers on February 25. 'We hope we can convince
the council to produce a resolution with the main elements in it,' said one
senior Commission official.
The cautious Euro-speak is deliberate. This is one of the most sensitive
issues that the Commission has had to handle since the beginning of the
recession. Under such circumstances, it is difficult enough to forge
agreement on 'resolutions' and 'outline plans', let alone reach unanimity on
formal proposals and legally binding decisions. Details of the Commission's
initiative began to emerge last week:
Aid. As suggested in its initial response to the industry's requests, the
Commission is trying to whip together Ecu240m (Pounds 195m) to help cover
redundancy and closure costs, on top of Ecu210m already committed. Before
they can release those funds, however, Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC industry
commissioner, and Mr Karel Van Miert, responsible for competition, will have
to convince member states to provide the same amount. At the same time, the
Commission is likely to support attempts by groups of steelmakers to pool
financial resources to assist specific sectors.
Officials admit that the funds likely to be on offer to the industry are
small, compared with the amounts needed to fund overall restructuring of the
industry. The Braun report suggests a total cost over the next three years
of perhaps Ecu6bn, of which Ecu2.5bn would cover the cost of cutting at
least 50,000 jobs.
Market supervision. Under the terms of the Treaty of Paris, the Commission
seems prepared to issue quarterly 'recommendations' for forward production
and delivery volumes in specific sectors across the whole Community.
External measures. This is the only part of the plan which has yet to be
clarified, but the Commission has pledged to improve protection against
cheap non-EC imports, notably from eastern Europe. Sir Leon Brittan, EC
external trade commissioner, will have to suggest how this could be done.
Restructuring. The industry has already started to reduce capacity, but the
Commission will approve other measures only if steelmakers come up with firm
closure plans by the end of September, which could be carried out by the end
of 1994. According to the Braun report, steelmakers may be able, but not
necessarily willing to cut up to 25.8m tonnes in crude steel capacity, and
17.9m tonnes in rolled products.
The aim of the Commission is to persuade steelmakers and member states to
endorse this balanced, overall plan at the same time. If a number of large
steelmakers, or an individual member state steps out of line - either by
refusing to make capacity cuts, or by granting large illegal subsidies to
its own industry -  then the fear is that others may follow suit.
Spain, for example, is still wrestling with a controversial plan to
subsidise additional steel-making capacity in the volatile Basque region of
the country, in return for capacity cuts elsewhere. The Commission, which
has suggested more capacity should be cut, or the aid reduced, hopes Madrid
will accept that other countries are being forced to make similar
sacrifices.
The Commission is also worried that it may again be cast in the role of
organising the EC steel market. That is broadly what happened in the 1980s,
when, under the plan named after the then industry commissioner, Mr Etienne
Davignon, the Commission was allowed to dictate individual company's
production quotas, impose protectionist trade measures, and endorse
subsidies and industry cartels.
This time, according to the Commission, individual companies will only
receive overall guidelines on production volumes, and, in any case, will
have to commit themselves to closure programmes before any of the rescue
package is implemented.
If necessary, officials say, Mr Braun will act as 'father confessor' to the
producers, but otherwise Brussels believes steelmakers should be able to
moderate their output along their guidelines without collaborating. Informal
cartels will be punished, they add. The industry, on the other hand, says
this is one area where there may have to be further negotiation with the
Commission.
If the Commission and industry ministers cannot agree on the way forward in
the next fortnight, then the steel industry may try to put further pressure
on the authorities by calling for the so-called 'manifest crisis' clause of
the Treaty of Paris to be activated.
The Davignon Plan was founded on this article of the treaty, but Mr Van
Miert and Mr Bangemann are opposed to its use. Eurofer, the steelmakers'
federation, is also resisting calls from some members to press for more
intervention by the authorities. But industry sources are beginning to echo
the comments of one British Steel executive when the same dilemma was being
discussed in 1980: 'I don't know whether there is a 'manifest crisis' or
not, but I can tell you: there is manifestly a crisis.'

The airline said there would be no announcement this week, but that the
cancellation of Airbus leases was an option, as was the possible grounding
of some DC-10 aircraft. The airline has a total of 672 different aircraft in
its fleet.
'We are looking at a number of options and have lots of alternatives for
reducing costs. One of them is to return some of our Airbuses, but no
decision has been taken,' an American Airlines spokesman explained
yesterday.

<TEXT>
FOR Mr Achille Maramotti, founder and chairman of Italy's Max Mara fashion
group, Europe's single market became a reality long before January 1.
'Fashion has become more European. Before, national differences were much
more evident,' he says. Mr Maramotti, son of a seamstress, founded the
company in Reggio Emilia in 1951. He has built it up to one of Italy's
largest clothing groups, with sales of L902bn (Pounds 410m) last year.
'The camel hair coat,' reflects Mr Maramotti, 'was once typically British.
Now it is established as a fashion item all over Europe.'
All Max Mara's goods travel by road, so swift, reliable delivery is the big
advantage of an open market. It now produces 16 different fashion marques,
operating from 400 outlets. Some of these shops it owns, especially
'flagship' stores in main European capitals. 'As far as we're concerned,' he
says, 'abolition of European border controls is a blessing.'
Max Mara started exporting in 1970 and already produces clothes in the same
sizes for countries across the EC. 'It's only for the US and Japan that we
have to have different sizing,' says Mr Maramotti, 65, who has handed
day-to-day management to his three children but still keeps a close eye on
the business.
The group, whose production is concentrated in Italy, sells in more than 40
countries, with 38 per cent of turnover abroad. France and the UK are its
main export markets, with Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands also ranking
high among export customers.
Surveying trends across the continent, he says Italy has guided developments
in women's suits -  moving to 'a slim, confident, comfortable style designed
for the professional woman'. French tastes, however, have conquered Europe
in more formal women's wear.
Even a company such as Max Mara that actively promotes European
harmonisation has to adjust for national differences. Buyers of a size 40
jacket in Germany or the Netherlands will get a slightly larger article than
in Italy, France or Spain. 'Our customers tend to be built a little bigger
and a little taller in northern Europe,' says Mr Maramotti, 'so our clothes
have to be a little different."
Max Mara's profits -  which reached L118bn after tax in 1991 -  have
invariably been ploughed back into the business. Mr Maramotti points out
that Max Mara tends to be a depositor with the banks rather than a borrower.
He says he started the company when he spotted growth prospects in Italy in
the 1950s. 'I saw there could be opportunities in ready-to-wear clothing,
having realised the days of individual tailoring were over.' Now, the market
has become continent-wide. Mr Maramotti's children 'have a more European
culture, having studied or worked in places like London, Dusseldorf and
Munich.'
Max Mara's prices, too, reflect the reality of one European market. 'In the
past, our clothes were usually more expensive abroad. Now we tend to charge
roughly the same throughout Europe.'

will protect him and allow me to go home soon so I can hold him in my arms,'
he said.
Mr Quas, a student from Nablus in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, is among
396 Palestinians who were arrested last December by the Israeli Shin Bet
internal security service, bundled into buses and shoved over the border at
gunpoint into Lebanon. He first heard about the birth of his son from
Palestinian radio broadcasting from neighbouring Syria.
Today the 396 men, including 22 university lecturers, 14 engineers and 11
doctors, start their 60th day stranded in a makeshift tented camp in a bleak
no-man's land in southern Lebanon.
Their treatment by the Israeli government will dog this week's visit to the
Middle East by Mr Warren Christopher, the first foreign tour by the new US
Secretary of State. Resumption of the suspended peace talks may hinge on
whether Mr Christopher can hammer out a compromise on the crisis acceptable
to Israel, Arab leaders, the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the
expelled Palestinians themselves.
Cut off from outside assistance in their muddy hillside camp of canvas and
plastic sheeting, the deportees are kept alive with food smuggled through
Lebanese army checkpoints by sympathetic journalists and local villagers.
Despite the rain and melting snow, and the scorpions which live under the
boulders around the camp, the morale of the expelled Palestinians is high.
Wrapped up in kafiyehs (headscarves) and woollen balaclavas they say they
are determined to stay put on their rain-lashed hillside until Israel
concedes the right of all of them to return home immediately, as laid out in
UN resolution 799 adopted unanimously the day after they were banished.
Above their squalid tented village flies a blue flag with a slogan from the
Koran in Arabic: 'Victory of God is coming soon.'
Israel claims that the exiled men, originally numbering 415, are members of
the shadowy, militant Islamic resistance movement Hamas, whose military
wing, Qassam, has been responsible for a spate of recent attacks against
Israeli soldiers. Hamas opposes the Middle East peace process, refuses to
recognise Israel's existence and is banned by the government.
None of the expelled Palestinians openly admit membership of Hamas - a
'crime' punishable under Israeli law by imprisonment. But they are all
sympathetic, in varying degrees, to the organisation.
Mr Abdul Aziz al-Rantisi, the leader of the expelled Palestinians, was a
founding member of Hamas. He is direct in his criticism of Israeli policies
in the occupied territories. 'The Israelis are killing us with machine guns.
We are defending ourselves with stones. That is our God-given right.'
Not all of the 396 Palestinians are so political. At least 80 have never
been arrested, interrogated or even warned by Israeli security. Mr Faris
Abu-Mouamer, the 35-year-old dean of the faculty of commerce at the Islamic
University in Gaza, returned to Gaza in 1989 after completing his five-year
doctoral thesis in business administration at the University of Wales,
Cardiff.
He says he never had time to get involved in politics, concentrating instead
on his academic career and private business.
'I never supported any political party,' he said in Welsh accented English.
'I thought that any group fighting to liberate our occupied land was right
and I didn't care how.'
A month before he was expelled his brother was shot dead by Israeli soldiers
as he was returning from the funeral of a distant family member who Mr
Abu-Mouamer said had been active in the resistance. He consulted lawyers and
planned to protest his brother's death in the courts. 'That was the only
thing I ever did against the government,' he said. 'I never wanted to be a
martyr, now I am forced to be one.'
There are some mutterings of a compromise in the ranks of the deportees. But
their spokesmen say nothing short of full implementation of UN resolution
799 will be acceptable. They, and the PLO, have rejected a US-brokered
Israeli offer to take back 96 of the remaining exiles and to reduce to up to
one year the term of exile for the rest.
'Our only crime is that we said to the Israelis 25 years of occupation is
enough,' said Mr Aziz Dweik, a professor of geography at Nablus University
who was detained twice for political activities. 'Please let us and our
children live free lives.'

FT  15 FEB 93 / Government insists on EC treaty with opt-out: Clarke warns
on Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government will this week send a clear signal to its anti-Maastricht
rebels that it will not allow a defeat over Labour's controversial social
chapter amendment to undermine its determination to ratify the treaty.
In an uncompromising message to the Conservative Euro-sceptics, Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the home secretary, insisted yesterday that the Cabinet would pursue
'whatever course is necessary' to achieve ratification without the UK having
to drop its opt-out from the chapter.
Speaking in a BBC television interview, Mr Clarke was clearly intent on
correcting the impression given by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary,
last week that the government would abandon the treaty if Labour's Amendment
27 was passed.
'We are aiming at getting the treaty without the social chapter and we
propose to proceed in parliament on that basis,' he said.
While reiterating its confidence that the amendment would be defeated,
Downing Street tacitly backed up Mr Clarke by underlining that there were
widely varying interpretations of the amendment's legal impact on
ratification.
Foreign Office lawyers have been in close contact with Brussels as to how
its passage would be interpreted.
However, a senior minister close to the discussions was adamant last night
that the government had no plans to ride roughshod over the Commons by
ignoring the amendment if it is passed.
'There is no question of us thwarting the will of parliament,' he said.
Technically, the British government could override parliamentary opinion and
ratify Maastricht because legally treaties only require the approval of the
Crown, not that of parliament. However, such a course of action would
provoke outrage among MPs and could undermine the government's authority.
Downing Street was yesterday determined to quash newspaper reports that Mr
John Major, the prime minister, would press ahead with ratification whatever
parliament concluded. Instead, a senior official steered inquiries to Mr
Hurd's exact phrasing in his BBC interview last week.
At the time, the foreign secretary said: 'There is no question of our
ratifying a treaty other than the one we negotiated.' While this was widely
interpreted as a threat to drop the ratification process in the event of a
defeat, it is now understood that no such strategy exists.
The government is now devising a series of fall-back positions should its
21-vote overall majority in the Commons be overturned by an alliance of
Labour, Liberal Democrats and Tory rebels.
Speculation is mounting that this could involve holding a separate debate on
the social chapter -  which is fiercely opposed by all Conservative MPs -
on a motion reaffirming the government's opt-out.
If, as expected, such a motion is passed, the government will claim that it
has won the authority of the Commons to override the Labour social chapter
amendment at the report stage or in the Lords without thwarting the will of
parliament.
Mr George Robertson, Labour's European spokesman, agreed last night that
this was the kind of strategy which may now be under way, although he added
that such a device would amount to 'sharp practice'.

FT  15 FEB 93 / France beats Britain and US to win Dollars 3.5bn UAE tank
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE HAS beaten the US and Britain in a bid to supply almost 400 battle
tanks to the United Arab Emirates in a deal worth about Dollars 3.5bn.(
Pounds 2.3bn)
The new French Leclerc tank, made by the state-controlled GIAT Industries,
was chosen in preference to the M1A2 Abrams, which General Dynamics of the
US has sold to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
Vickers of the UK also took part in the competition with its Challenger 2
tank, but was considered to be an outsider. The French emerged last year as
clear favourite in what was seen as a two-way contest with the US.
The UAE decision to give the order to the French was described as 'very,
very bad news indeed' by Mr David Clark, the Labour party's defence
spokesman. Mr Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, also
said the decision was a big blow to Vickers and British manufacturing.
However, the company said yesterday: 'It is not a blow at all -  you don't
win every order you bid for.'
It added: 'We are always looking for new business. We have been in business
a long time and not being selected by one particular country is not going to
have a significant effect on us at all.'
Last month Vickers won its first export order for the Challenger 2 in a
contract expected to involve about 40 tanks for Oman, worth around Pounds
150m.
However, the UK producer still needs further orders to stave off the threat
of closure of one of its two tank assembly lines in Leeds and Newcastle upon
Tyne.
Vickers is fighting to secure an order from Saudi Arabia, which is
considering a further purchase of 235 tanks in addition to the 465 M1A2s it
is due to receive from General Dynamics.
The UAE deal is the first export order for the Leclerc, an automatic-loading
tank which in contrast to its western competitors requires a crew of three
instead of four.
The version sold to the UAE will be equipped with a German engine and
transmission system, which have been specially cleared for export by the
Bonn government.
The arrangement marks a shift in German policy. Bonn has up to now banned
German tank sales to the Middle East and in the 1980s decided to halt
efforts to sell a hybrid German-British tank in the region.
It emerged last year that Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, ruler of Abu
Dhabi and president of the UAE, had agreed to pay the estimated Dollars 50m
cost of integrating the German engine after the French diesel was judged
unsatisfactory. The engine, made by the Daimler-Benz offshoot MTU, is
similar to the one in Germany's Leopard 2.
Mr Pierre Joxe, French defence minister, said in Abu Dhabi yesterday that
the deal was 'a tribute to French technology and to the position of France
in the region'.
The contract, announced shortly after the opening of a defence exhibition,
involves 390 Leclerc tanks and 46 armoured repair and recovery vehicles, for
delivery between 1994 and 1999.
It is tied to an offset deal under which 60 per cent of the contract value
is to be reinvested in the UAE. Such deals have become standard practice
with defence contracts in the Gulf region.
The deal confirms France's role as principal arms supplier to the UAE, in
spite of a strong bid by the US to oust it from this position in the wake of
the 1991 Gulf war.
The bulk of the UAE's current tank fleet consists of French-supplied
AMX-30s, and its air force is mainly made up of French aircraft including
Mirage 2000 fighters.

<TEXT>
COCA-Cola Amatil, the Australian soft drink and snack food company, has
raised its annual dividend to 17.5 cents a share from 15.5 cents after a
solid profit and sales performance in 1992.
Net profit rose 13.8 per cent to ADollars 77.4m (USDollars 52.2m) on a 17.7
per cent sales rise to ADollars 2.1bn. But some gloss was taken off the
result by an ADollars 11.6m adverse tax settlement which reduced earnings
after abnormal items by 4.4 per cent to ADollars 65.8m.
The result was achieved in spite of a 6.7 per cent decline to ADollars 33.7m
from ADollars 36.1m in pre-tax profits from the snack food division, which
was sold just after balance sheet date to United Biscuit of the UK.
THe snack division increased sales and market shares, but was hit by reduced
margins and higher input costs. Beverage operations, the largest in
Australia, lifted pre-tax earnings 8.6 per cent to ADollars 182.1m.

FT  13 FEB 93 / International Company News: Pinault in talks over disposal
of retail arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PINAULT, the heavily-indebted French retail group run by Mr Francois
Pinault, is in negotiations to sell Discol, one of its wholesale businesses,
to Promodes, the French hypermarket chain.
The disposal of Discol forms part of the divestment programme at Pinault,
which has been selling assets in an attempt to reduce the FFr19bn (Dollars
3.5bn) net debt it incurred in its controversial bid for the Au Printemps
department store chain.
Discol is a substantial wholesaling business with 13 depots across France
and annual sales of FFr2.7bn. However, it is a loss-making company with
heavy debt of about FFr100m.
The acquisition of Discol would turn Promodes into the largest wholesaler in
France ahead of Metro, the German group. Promodes has substantial
wholesaling interests through its Prodirest subsidiary which has 21 depots
and annual sales of FFr1.5bn.
Pinault hopes to raise FFr100m from the sale, according to an unconfirmed
report in yesterday's edition of L'Agefi, the French financial newspaper,
and wipe out Discol's FFr100m borrowings.
The group yesterday disclosed a marginal fall in sales to FFr70.69bn last
year from FFr70.83bn in 1991.
Casino, another leading French hypermarket group, yesterday disclosed a 46.3
per cent increase in sales to FFr61.6bn in 1992 fuelled by last summer's
acquisition of the Rallye hypermarket chain.
Au Bon Marche, the department store group, produced sales of FFr25.16bn last
year, although this can not be compared to 1991's FFr4.65bn sales because
the company has been expanded by adding part of Mr Bernard Arnault's luxury
goods interests.
Credit Lyonnais, the French state-controlled bank, has signed an agreement
with Vseobecna Uverova Banka, Slovakia's biggest bank, to set up a joint
venture based in Bratislava, Reuter reports from Paris.
Credit Lyonnais will have a 90 per cent stake in the new bank, to be called
Credit Lyonnais Bank Slovakia, which will have initial capital of Dollars
10m.

FT  13 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Asprey and Mallett talks end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASPREY, the USM-quoted jeweller, has ended its takeover discussions with
Mallett, the Mayfair-based antiques dealer.
Mallett confirmed in December that it had received a takeover approach.
Although it did not identify its suitor, the announcement came shortly after
Asprey's chief executive, Mr Naim Attallah, confirmed that his company had
acquired a 6.8 per cent equity stake in Mallett 'for investment purposes.'
Yesterday Mallett announced that the talks had been terminated. It is
understood that the two sides could not agree on a price.
In its statement yesterday, Mallett, noted that at the time of the approach
its interim results had shown a pre-tax loss of Pounds 485,000 (Pounds
680,000 profit) in the six months to June 30 and Mallett directors had
passed the interim dividend.
At that stage the group had said that trading was extremely difficult in all
areas of the group, partly because of the strength of sterling.
The full year results will be announced later this month, but the company
said yesterday that the fine art market improved significantly in the final
quarter of 1992 after the value of sterling slumped.
As a result, Mallett made a profit in its second half and will announce
pre-tax profits of not less than Pounds 500,000 for the full year.
In addition, Mallett said its borrowings, which reached Pounds 2.3m at one
stage last year, had been eliminated and that it ended the year with net
cash which should enable it to pay a 2p final dividend.
The company statement added that although it was too soon to forecast the
outcome for 1993, trading results so far showed a continued improvement
compared with last year. Mallett's share price closed 2p lower at 68p.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Feasibility of coal plans doubted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S prob-lems in ending the public furore over pit closures
deepened yesterday as British Coal said it doubted the feasibility of any
plan which did not tackle planned growth in nuclear and gas-fired power.
The company's said even the recommendations of a Commons select committee,
generally considered to be more favourable to coal than measures the
government is contemplating, could result in a nil increase in the market
for coal after five years.
A draft of the government's white paper on energy proposes slowing the
planned run-down of coal stocks, cutting output from opencast mines and
using subsidies to halt growth in imports.
British Coal would not comment in detail on the proposals, but remarks by Mr
Neil Clarke, its chairman, suggest a strong belief that they do not go far
enough.
He said the company's problems could not be solved simply by using subsidies
to deter coal imports while the growth in gas and nuclear power continued.
The draft white paper makes little if any provision for capping nuclear and
gas power.
Mr Clarke said: 'The market for electricity is not elastic.'
If a greater role was to be found for coal then it was a question of what
fuel would give way, he added.
'We risk storing up problems if we rely too much on maintaining coal stocks
to sustain production rather than on switching away from other fuels,' he
argued. 'Careful consideration should also be given to the business
consequences of any artificial cap on the competitive coal from opencast
mines.'
Mr Clarke added that ordering power stations using orimulsion - an imported
fuel - to fit flue gas desulphurisation equipment was unlikely to stop use
of the fuel.
The select committee report has been interpreted as seeking to create a
market for at least an extra 16m tonnes of coal a year. But, in its response
to the committee's findings, British Coal said its proposals would increase
the market by 8m tonnes at most, and possibly not at all.
British Coal said the report:
Overstated the likely level of coal imports in 1997-98 by 16m tonnes. This
was important because any subsidy would be directed at replacing imports.
Understated gas burn by the equivalent of 3m tonnes.
Assumed total fuel used to generate electricity would be equal to 5m more
tonnes of coal than was likely.
The company wants the government to explore using new gas stations at less
than base-load capacity in the electricity system, delay the commissioning
of the Sizewell B nuclear station and not extend the lives of magnox nuclear
stations.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Arts: Best troupers in the world - As they return home
Alastair Macaulay pays homage to the Bolshoy dancers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bolshoy Ballet brings its 37-day season at the Albert Hall to a close on
Sunday. Dire rumours about the bleak financial conditions that the company
had to endure were rife; and some of them were surely true. And yet the
company showed few signs of wear and tear. How they gave] For seven
performances a week, the Moscow dancers kept returning to the Albert Hall
stage, generous and expansive and open. They are the best troupers in the
world.
How they keep up their verve and good spirits is a mystery. Yuri
Grigorovich's productions are blatantly weak: they do not tell their stories
clearly; they insert meaningless 'pure-dance' waffle where some basic
gesture would have been far more expressive; and they thwack out a
dreadfully limited dance vocabulary for oomph impact. (The fact that they
have been reduced to highlights 'suite' format here this season has done
them little harm, because they are really just a string of highlights
anyway.)
Then there is the puzzling way in which the Bolshoy replaces one ballerina
with another without making an announcement. One Saturday afternoon Inna
Petrova and Yuri Vasyuchenko danced Giselle. The programme said that the
audience was seeing Nadezhda Gracheva and Andrei Uvarov. If I were Petrova,
I would stamp my little foot and have a tantrum. Maybe she did, offstage.
Onstage, however, she danced calmly and devoutly. This kind of thing, as any
Bolshoy fan can tell you, is nothing new.
The powerful irony behind the season was that Irek Mukhamedov, the great
star of the Bolshoy's 1986 and '89 seasons here, has been dancing with the
Royal at Covent Garden. It was strange to see Spartacus at the Albert Hall
and to find that Mukhamedov's massive intensity is still writ large all over
the ballet's title role - writ into the music. Strange, too, to remember
that he seemed to be the Bolshoy's figurehead, first-cast hero of such big
Grigorovich productions as The Golden Age, Spartacus and Ivan the Terrible -
whereas now he is often second- or third-cast with the Royal.
Yet just look at the roles he has been dancing at Covent Garden while the
Bolshoy was at the Albert Hall: the Prince in The Sleeping Beauty (a role
the Bolshoy did not give him when it brought Beauty here in '89), the title
role of Apollo (a ballet made by the century's two greatest Russian emigres,
Stravinsky and Balanchine, both extending classicism as no Soviet art ever
conceived), and the leading male role of Kenneth MacMillan's The Judas Tree
(a piece of socialist realism beyond all Soviet practice).
When Mukhamedov was with the Bolshoy, he still had an astounding jump. He
hovered, in The Golden Age, like some dense thundercloud over the heads of
the company. He has never jumped like that with the Royal; and, from his
first Royal performance on, he has sometimes shown a heaviness of landing
such as he never did before. But while the Grigorovich repertory capitalised
on his sheer athleticism, it gave small range to his artistry. Dancing here
in ballets by Ashton, MacMillan, Nijinska and Balanchine, Mukhamedov has
displayed more musical acuity, range, and dramatic subtlety than the Bolshoy
ever let him reveal.
Of the Bolshoy - as of so many ballet companies these days - it can be said
that the first time you saw them was the best. Spartacus and The Golden Age
are altogether less galvanic without Mukhamedov. But then, tremendous as he
was (is), film shows that Vassiliev (in the 1960s and '70s) was even more
overwhelming. I could never forget my first sight of the Bolshoy on TV in
1969 (the Spartacus suite and Carmen). And it seems that nobody who saw
Ulanova here in 1956 has been quite the same since.
And yet, and yet. The Bolshoy remains uniquely endearing. Young Nadezhda
Gracheva still has the phenomenal leg-extensions that made her electrifying
with the Bolshoy School here in 1987, and with the Bolshoy Opera in 1990,
and she has gained a new upper-body finesse. Galina Stepanenko is still
steely, but she has more musical wit than before. Inna Petrova - who danced
soloist role here in 1989 - is now taking ballerina, roles with assurance
and shy, sweet grace. Andrei Uvarov's jump was one of the talking-points of
the season; and his phrasing is nobility itself.
As for Spartacus, it is true that it no longer has Mukhamedov, or Vassiliev,
or Lavrovsky. It is true that it is actually trash (no better as art than
Ben Hur, or Flash Gordon). But it is still Spartacus  - meaty, crude,
thrilling, camp and fun. The daftest moment always comes at curtain-calls,
when the Roman troops salute in answer to Crassus and then the slaves all
salute in answer to Spartacus. This season, the BBC Concert Orchestra - the
loyal band for this Albert Hall season - all waited for Spartacus's cue, and
then joined in the slaves' salute too. Silly, lovable, marvellous.

Hawthorn Leslie, the USM-quoted maker of electronic goods and toys, said
yesterday that it was in talks which might lead to a bid being made for the
company.
Any offer would be at a discount to the current share price, it said. The
company's shares closed down  3/4 p at 2 3/4 p.
No offer would be made unless Hawthorn concluded a final settlement with the
funders of CP Finance and Leasing, the group's leasing subsidiary. Hawthorn
said that such an agreement, subject to contract, had been reached.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Unions angry at public-sector pay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLIC-SECTOR pay rises limited to about 1.5 per cent were confirmed
yesterday, demonstrating the cabinet's determination to crack down on public
spending.
The prime minister's statement in the Commons came as the Treasury said
inflation had dropped to 1.7 per cent, the lowest for 25 years.
Doctors and dentists, nursing staff, midwives and health visitors,
professions allied to medicine and the armed forces will receive 1.5 per
cent from April 1.
Most teachers will receive between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent over the full
year from this April.
The awards, in line with limits announced in November, were quickly
portrayed as not a rise but a pay cut.
There was anger among teachers - some of whom receive only 0.55 per cent
initially - as well as nurses and other hospital workers, but the military
felt there was little point in grumbling.
Health union negotiators rejected the award for nurses, midwives and health
visitors as 'totally unacceptable'.
Ms Judith Carter, the unions' lead negotiator and national officer for
Cohse, the public service union, said the award would simply lead to a
deterioration in morale, cause difficulties implementing the Patient's
Charter and lead to more staff leaving the health service.
The awards mean a nursing assistant would have an average increase of Pounds
2.47 a week, increasing the salary to Pounds 8,699. A newly qualified nurse
would have an increase of Pounds 3.12 a week, giving an annual salary of
Pounds 13,449. Ward sisters would get an additional Pounds 4.31 a week, for
a new annual salary of Pounds 15,184.
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the NUT, the biggest teaching union,
said the award was a 'disgraceful insult'. He added: 'Pay has not been at
the top of the teachers' agenda but this derisory increase will push it high
up their list of grievances.'
All qualified teachers will receive a 0.55 per cent increase on April 1, and
a one-off payment of Pounds 90 on May 1. On September 1, they will be
transferred to a new pay scale, giving a further increase to most.
Teachers are presently paid on a 10-point scale from Pounds 11,184 to Pounds
18,837, with five different incentive allowances - ranging from Pounds 1,296
to Pounds 7,692 - for those assuming extra responsibilities or demonstrating
'outstanding ability'.
The allowances will be abolished from this September, and all teachers will
be placed on an 18-point scale, ranging from Pounds 11,295 to Pounds 30,573.
Head teachers and deputy heads will receive a 1 per cent increase on April
1.
Overall, the package will cost an extra 1.5 per cent. Local education
authorities, most of which are now spending at their capping ceiling,
yesterday expressed concern at their ability to foot the bill without
redundancies.
Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow employment secretary, said: 'It is unfair to
expect vital people like nurses and teachers to accept a pay settlement less
than the rate of inflation, a lot less then settlements outside, and less
than what the government are likely to give the judges.'
The top salaries review body did not report this year. In common with
ministers and MPs, those in this group would receive no pay increase for
this year, Mr Major said. The deferred second stage of the 1992 award of 2.9
per cent from April 1 would be honoured.

FT  13 FEB 93 / EC puts together deal on rules for banana imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community last night finally agreed its controversial new rules
for the import of bananas. The rules are considered illegal by Germany,
opposed by the Benelux countries inside Europe, and seen as a job-destroying
impediment to trade by Latin American banana growers.
The agreement required the current Danish presidency of the EC to bury its
own objections so as to get a settlement.
Only Germany and Denmark opposed the deal last December, when political
agreement was supposedly reached. Since then, the Benelux countries
discovered new objections.
The deal last night reflected fears that EC decision-making might be brought
into discredit by the Dutch and Belgians reneging on the original plan.
Cabinet decisions were needed in the main countries involved. Holland and
Belgium maintained their opposition, amid charges that their word would be
in question in future Euro-decisions.
The deal sets a quota of 2m tonnes on cheap Latin American bananas coming
into the EC, with an Ecu850 (Pounds 696) per tonne tariff - about 170 per
cent - above that volume.
Independent Latin American producers, as well as the main US multinationals
supplying the EC market, organised the most intensive lobbying campaign the
EC has ever seen to try to change the terms of this deal.
They failed. But the slightly modified deal makes some attempt to preserve
the rights of existing importers and makes it easier to raise the import
quota in line with demand.
Latin American producers still intend to challenge the rules through Gatt,
and Germany still threatens to take the decision to the European Court of
Justice to keep unimpeded access for banana imports of its choice.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Population crisis in Daisyworld
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAD another lesson this week with Jasper Strong, my 6ft 5in,
sportscar-driving, blond-locked tennis coach. For two hours we worked on my
back-court shots, the drives, the lobs and half-volleys. 'Remember,' said
Jasper, 'the lob is a lifting shot. Try to concentrate. Your mind should be
blank.'
I once asked Jasper why he persists with me. All his other clients are rich
and wistful women who live in Daisyworld: the area off London's Kensington
Church Street. 'Well,' said Jasper. 'You are the only media whinger that I
know. You have an interesting mind. Pitiful, but interesting.' He is 23,
with a degree in sports studies.
As soon as the lesson was over, Jasper interrogated me about my remarks last
week on unchecked population growth - specifically, my belief that the
planet is hurtling towards a catastrophe caused by manic pollution and
over-consumption.
'Priscilla Humpington-Kooning says you're wrong,' said Jasper. 'She says you
are a pessimist and a cynic.' Mrs Humpington-Kooning is one of his
Kensington clients: beautiful and silly-rich.
'Priscilla says that from now on there will be progress in education,
health, family planning and improvement of women's status to counteract
population growth, and that technological prowess will help us master
planetry degradation. She looked up some figures for me. Priscilla says that
if the overall fertility rate stabilises at below two children per woman,
world population will fall quite rapidly, perhaps to 5bn-6bn again by 2150.
At a rate of 1.7, world population in 2150 would be the same as in 1978,
about 4.3bn. Priscilla says optimism on this score is not far-fetched.
Europe's current average fertility rate is 1.7. Eleven developed countries
are already below it.'
'Sure, Jasper,' I said. 'That is the view from Daisyworld. But I am a
Cassandra, a neo-Malthusian. It is equally possible that world population
will shoot to 20bn-30bn. Last week I mentioned Paul Harrison and his book,
The Third Revolution. Everyone should read it. Referring to a population of
20bn-30bn, Harrison says: 'Assuming such numbers were sustainable, life
could come to resemble the prophetic film Soylent Green, where meat and soap
are exquisite rarities; nature is glimpsed only in videos played to
euthanasia volunteers . . . and human corpses are recycled as high-protein
biscuits.'
'Take water, Jasper. I know that when you visit Priscilla, she runs Perrier
through the Jacuzzi for you as a prelude to rumpy-pumpy. There is not an
obvious scarcity of water in Daisyworld. But its supply is finite. The
global annual run-off from rainfall is 41,000 square kilometres. Of that,
perhaps 9,000 sq km are available for human use. Of that, we already use
more than a third. There will be wars over water. Even then, we are not
facing a resource crisis but a pollution crisis. At the end of his lifetime
the average European leaves a monument of waste almost 1,000 times his
bodyweight. North Americans leave a waste mausoleum 3,900 times their
bodyweight.'
'So what are your solutions to population growth?'
I said: 'All the usual: education, contraception, immense advances in
women's status. But for Cassandras like me, more will be needed. We disagree
with the idea that compulsion over family size has no role to play - that it
violates human rights and is only possible in non-democratic societies.
India and China are the only two countries to have tried it on a large scale
so far. In India, family planning was said to have been set back a decade by
Indira Gandhi's coercive vasectomy programme.
'However, I believe that such schemes will become the norm. I see nothing
wrong with tax bonuses for childlessness or even the odd spot of castration
for recidivist or overly gung-ho males.'
Jasper had turned chalk-white. 'I thought you were supposed to be a
liberal,' he whined.
'I am a liberal, Jasper - but a liberal from the middle of the 21st century.
You should see what right-wingers will be like in 2050.'
Jasper was stricken. But then he brightened. 'I'll see you next week,' he
said. 'What you need most is some extremely serious gym work. I will draw up
a programme. Meantime, get your hair cut.'

FT  13 FEB 93 / A wicked tax on our birthright: The Queen has caved in on
tax; at least, Charles' inheritance is safe - for now
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS a matter of the deepest regret that Her Majesty the Queen has been so
unnerved by spurious newspaper opinion polls about the popularity of the
monarchy as to agree to pay taxes.
It is true that there is no great tradition of the monarch being tax-exempt.
This was originally granted to George VI only because his coffers had been
depleted by the need to buy out his abdicating brother's British properties,
such as Sandringham.
The coffers, through astute investment, have been replenished. Still, it is
sad to see the monarch so swayed by the results of telephone polls in The
Sun: 'You tell us. Should the Queen pay taxes?'. (I know someone who rang up
six times, using different voices, to say 'yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes').
It is not as if there was any pressure from the two main political parties.
Her Majesty has at least not gone the whole egalitarian hog. Her son will
not be liable to pay inheritance tax. When asked by a Labour member, 'Why
should all private assets passing from one sovereign to the next be exempt?'
John Major spoke of 'the danger of assets of the monarchy being
salami-sliced away by capital taxation through generations.' Well said. But
why does not Major apply this sound moral principle to the rest of us?
Shortly after becoming prime minister, he declared his interest in reforming
the wicked system of inheritance taxation and spoke of the need to create a
society in which 'wealth cascades down thorough the generations.' So far he
has done nothing to further this noble declaration.
Estates - other than Her Majesty's - are still liable to taxation at 40 per
cent. That is the third, terminal, bite of the Inland Revenue. First our
earnings are taxed, at up to 40 per cent. When we retire, the income from
our savings - if we have not been robbed of them by inflation and illness -
is taxed. And then, through inheritance tax, children are penalised for
their parents' providence.
Perhaps it is too kind to this administration to say that it has done
nothing to buttress the great Tory principle of inheritance. In fact it has
acted strenuously to destroy inherited wealth.
On Wednesday, the day before Major made his staunch defence of the royal
family's rights of inheritance, the Commons gave a third reading to the
government's highly redistributive Housing and Urban Development bill. Among
other things this bill gives leaseholders in subdivided properties and
blocks of flats the right to buy out their landlords compulsorily.
Michael Howard, the environment secretary, sees this as a great and
electorally beneficial extension of the right to buy. It is also the
destruction of the inherited estates of the likes of the Duke of Westminster
and Lord Cadogan, and the state interfering in legal contracts freely
entered into, on the side of one of the parties.
It is a measure of which the utilitarian philosophers would have approved.
The aggregate amount of happiness which will be felt by the many
expropriating leaseholders will exceed the misery experienced by a few
voteless grandees. But that does not make it right.
Property rights are at the heart of the capitalist system: ignore them, and
you damage the integrity of that system, and leave it morally defenceless
against those who really wish it harm.
If you cannot find it in your hearts to feel pity for the Duke of
Westminster, remember that some of our greatest freeholders are pension
funds and charities. One is the Henry Smith charity, set up in 1627 'for the
purchasing of lands of inheritance for ever for relief of the poor.' The
original trustees acquired the village of Brompton, which we now know as
Kensington. The income from the that last year enabled the charity to pay
out over Pounds 11m to worthy causes.
Why should the affluent leaseholders of Lennox Gardens and Onslow Square be
allowed to buy out the charity, if its trustees are against it? I cannot
believe that any of those tenants acquired their leases without being aware
that, on expiry, the property would revert to the Henry Smith charity. Her
Majesty should beware. Who knows when this government might decide to treat
her inheritance with as much contempt as it has those of other landowners?

war - Neil Greatrex is the new head of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers.
Nine years ago he helped lead his men out of the NUM. He explains why he is
still a leftwinger

IT IS A story of conflicting loyalties and apparent betrayal, a story in
which the enemy of the enemy proved to be no friend.
Neil Greatrex is a Nottinghamshire coal-miner who helped lead his men out of
the National Union of Mineworkers yet keeps an NUM loyalty certificate
hanging proudly in the hall of his house.
'People who've been round say: What the bloody 'ell you got that up for? But
I was a member of the NUM for 20 years, and proud of it.'
Elected president of the rebel Union of Democratic Mineworkers three months
ago, Greatrex is lobbying ministers and managers as the future of British
coal is re-assessed in a White Paper expected in the next couple of weeks.
He may be an NUM rebel, but Greatrex is no friend of the government which
profited from the union split to defeat the 1984-5 miners' strike: he
condemns it not because it betrayed the union rebels but because it is
Conservative.
'When people say to me the government owe you, they don't owe me a thing,'
he said. 'Because I've never done anything to support 'em.
'That's where people get it wrong. We're often accused - and you (the Press)
do it more so than anybody - of being a breakaway union that supported the
government in '84. Now I'm telling you, nobody in Notts supported the Tory
government. What they did was to fight for the right to democracy within the
NUM.'
The UDM president is an abrasive, humorous man very much in the mould of his
area and profession. He was always an activist. What is more, unlike most
Nottinghamshire miners, he was a left-winger.
His political baptism came at the age of 16 when he raised his hand at a
branch meeting in support of his elder brother. His intervention swung the
decision against the right-wing leadership; so they disallowed his vote.
'I thought, if that's the attitude of the union officials we're supposed to
elect and supposed to be democratic . . . So I started a bit of a campaign -
probably arrogance more than anything - against them.' Five years later he
got his way: he was one of a group of young left-wingers who toppled the old
guard.
A few weeks into the 1984 strike, history repeated itself. Arthur Scargill,
president of the NUM, had come to meet the Nottinghamshire branch officials
who were refusing to call their men out without a ballot.
'I gave him merry 'ell,' Greatrex recalled. 'I practically begged him to
call a ballot even then. And he turned to Heathfield (Peter Heathfield, NUM
general secretary) and said: 'You answer 'im. I don't want to talk to 'im'.
And Heathfield says: 'You're not having a ballot because we don't trust
you.' That's the worst thing he could have said.'
Greatrex had been a militant in the 1972 and 1974 coal strikes and had
campaigned for both Scargill and Heathfield. 'I'm not ashamed to say it,
even now, because I felt at that time they would be better for the
membership. Unfortunately everyone's got a cross to bear, and that's
probably mine.'
He read his Marx and Engels, and the works of an obscure Chinese
revolutionary recommended to him by Joe Whelan, the Communist former
secretary of the Nottinghamshire area. He wielded a shovel on the coalface
as a ripper before graduating to union safety officer. 'I was ripping all
day, I was footballing all weekend and boxing three nights a week.'
Was he any good as a boxer? 'I did it for fun more than anything. But my
nose is still straight so I couldn't have been too bad at it,' he laughed.
The day he got married to his wife Sheila, there was a reception at Bentinck
colliery welfare club. It happened that a union meeting had been called
downstairs for 6pm to vote on whether one coalface (where Greatrex was
working) should stay on four shifts while the rest went down to three.
'So me and 20 others had to go down to union meeting. The in-laws haven't
got over it from that day to this,' he laughed. 'And we still lost the
vote.'
Like many miners, Greatrex contemplated another career. His mother wanted
something better for her sons. But his father refused to sign the paper
necessary for him to join the Army as an engineering cadet ('If it's good
enough for me it's good enough for you,' was his response) and a joinery
apprenticeship turned out to mean sweeping up in the shop for only Pounds
2.50 a week. So, like his grandfather, father and three brothers, down the
pit he went.
At least it was a secure job.
Greatrex said: 'You didn't really worry about the security. You never gave
that a second thought. Everybody knew that mining had been about for years
and they expected it to carry on for years.'
Greatrex ascribed the union split to two things: Scargill's refusal to take
the constitutional route and the behaviour of the flying pickets who came
across the border from Yorkshire and one day turned over the three-wheeler
car of a crippled Bentinck miner, with the man inside it.
He blames Scargill not only for a gross tactical error which he believes led
to an acceleration of pit closures - 120 were shut, 13 of them in
Nottinghamshire - after the strike was lost.
'I'll never forgive Scargill. All he's done is ruin thousands of people.
He's ruined thousands of family relationships.'
He said his own relationship with his elder daughter, Colette, was ruined
for years. She was 10 at the start of the strike and, at the age when she
was expecting a bit more freedom, could not understand that threats against
the family made it dangerous for her go outside alone. 'It's took nearly
eight years to get that relationship right again,' Greatrex said.
His father, a Scargill supporter, stopped talking to his son in 1984 and
went to his grave five years later without breaking his silence.
The UDM president did not get on too well with his own predecessor, either.
He describes Roy Lynk, the man he defeated last December, as a one-man band
who kept his cards to his chest and was deceived into thinking he had
friends in high places who would protect the jobs of the miners who had
broken with the NUM.
One-man bands were bad for winning popular support. The public outcry that
helped overturn Michael Heseltine's decision to close 31 pits as a prelude
to privatisation had been 'nothing short of a miracle', he said. 'And I
think, to be fair, Scargill has played his role in this. He's been told to
tone it down because of public support, so he's played his role by keeping
his gob shut.
'I think people right throughout the land are pig sick of unemployment and
they've said 'Enough's enough'. That's what worries me about the campaign
we're doing now. I know it focuses on mining, but I've tried to get the
message across that you can't just isolate miners in this argument. It's
everybody, every form of worker that's losing their jobs.'
At the age of 41, Greatrex has found himself unexpectedly propelled into a
national political crisis. I asked him for his impressions of Whitehall and
Westminster.
You have talked to Heseltine, I said.
'Well, we shouted the first time, but we've spoken since.'
What do make of him?
'Heseltine's bothered about Heseltine and nobody else.'
What about John Major?
'I had a different impression of him entirely. I've always seen him on
television as somebody guarded; he looks like you could pick him up and
shake 'im to shake some life into 'im. In real life it's not like that at
all. I honestly believed there was some compassion in the chap and that he
genuinely wanted to help to resolve the situation.'
He described Sir Marcus Fox, the Yorkshire MP who is chairman of the
Conservative backbenchers, as 'a genuine chap' who wanted to help - 'not
because we're the UDM but because we're mineworkers.'
By temperament and political background Neil Greatrex is uncomfortable about
hob-nobbing in private with Conservative politicians or British Coal
managers. Although he clearly regards Scargill's puritan refusal to engage
at all as irresponsible, he is aware of the dangers of the backstairs chat.
'I've prided meself that I never wanted to change from when I was branch
president at Bentinck and I've worked hard at not changing.
'I've seen it happen that many times when you've got a branch lad elected to
a full-time official and he seems to change overnight. He becomes aloof from
the membership, becomes aloof from all the friends he's had. I've never
wanted to do that. I take people as I find them and they take me as they
find me.'
Shouldn't a union leader be leading his members as well as serving them?
'Its a compromise of both. One reason I stood against Roy Lynk is because
Roy refused to take people to meetings. No-one knew what were being
discussed and I object strongly to that. A leader should keep his national
executive committee informed when he's discussing thousands of other
people's lives - for his own sake, too.
'Obviously there's times when you've got to lead from front anyway and I've
always been prepared to do that.'
Have you got a different view of the system than you had?
'I have, and it annoys me. It annoys me in the sense that there's more
compromises or agreements made sitting round a table over lunch than what
there is sat in a formal meeting with proper negotiations. I don't like
that. Going into bloody alleys and doorways with British Coal . . . that's
what happens. But if you want to get the agreements for your members you
have to go along with that. I find it difficult but I'll get used to it.'
Won't you get corrupted by it?
'No.'
After a pause, he added: 'You all know it happens that British Coal and
people offer you various things: 'Would you like to come to 't races?' or
things like that. Without fear of contradiction I don't think you'll find
that Neil Greatrex goes to many of them, if any.'
No box at Ascot, not even the silver ring at Doncaster?
'Well, that wouldn't bother me 'cos I hate bloody horse-racing anyway.' He
laughed. 'It would have to be something like Razor Ruddock fighting Lennox
Lewis.'

FT  13 FEB 93 / Arts: 'Tombeaux': a busy ballet from Bintley - Clement Crisp
reviews the latest work created for the Royal Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMBEAUX is David Bintley's new creation for the Royal Ballet, given its
first performance on Thursday night. It is set to Walton's Variations on a
theme by Hindemith, and has design by Jasper Conran. It is a plotless piece,
its style academic, and it looks on first viewing as if Bintley has said to
his public: 'You like steps? Then here are steps, lots and lots of steps'.
There is a buzz of activity, a chatter and clatter of movement, that is
rather like being trapped by a compulsive talker - one of those monsters who
never seem to draw breath and never, ever, tire.
As a dance-maker Bintley has unusual facility. Invention is never lacking,
nor ideas, nor, indeed, a quick response to music and dramatic situation.
Tombeaux is fluent in its choreography, but my initial response is to wonder
what it seeks to show, other than Viviana Durante, Bruce Sansom, a quartet
of men and ten women, being very busy. The title implies a memorial homage -
as Walton to Hindemith - but beyond a slight and passing similarity to
Ashton's Scenes de ballet (whose message of succinct classicism Bintley has
not received), I can see no relevance.
The piece is over-decorated: a dull front cloth and three gauzes (trees, a
lion's-mouth fountain, a wash of green) do little to establish mood.
Something more sombre is suggested by the girls' handsome tutus - Durante
chic in black; the attendant women with blue edges to their black skirts -
and the men are unflatteringly garbed in funereal long-johns, their arms
bare.
The score, a theme with nine variations and a closing fugue, has guided
Bintley - his musical responses ever alert - but the result is oddly
inconclusive. The dance has a nervous pulse. Pas de deux for Durante and
Sansom look as if the choreography is seeking increasingly uneasy and tense
ways for a man to manipulate a woman.
The writing for the attendant groups is by turns dutifully academic or
hyper-active. There are eye-catching groupings as Bintley disposes his
forces with real felicity, and his rather conscious inventiveness ('Here's
something new]') provides sharp imagery. I admired a thematic phrase in
which Durante, supported by Sansom, took a walking step which closed into a
fifth position: the effect was inevitable, vivid. The end of Tombeaux is
ravishing as, on an otherwise empty stage, Sansom runs from Durante in a
widening circle and leaves her in touching isolation.
The abiding impression of Tombeaux, though, is of splintered patterns and
choreographic stresses. It is driven dancing, uneasy in manner - the
short-breathed musical form may have encouraged this response - and
curiously arid. It invites, and receives, quick, bright, small-scale dancing
from its cast.
Tombeaux is at the centre of new Opera House triple bill which begins with
Firebird. Our Fokine inheritance - and, for that matter, the Massine
repertory - has continuing relevance and importance for dancers and
audiences, and the Royal Ballet possesses authentic stagings of masterpieces
which it has a duty to show. But if Firebird is to be understood today, it
must be better done than on Thursday night. With the exception of Fiona
Chadwick, flashing brilliantly through Kastchey's garden as the Firebird,
casting was underpowered, and this magical vision of Holy Russia was
obscured by meaningless and routine performance. Serious coaching is needed.
The evening ended with William Forsythe's In the middle. Sullen,
repetitious, noisy, it offers the angry physical attitudes you might expect
to find in the playground of a tough, run-down comprehensive school. I find
it sad to see Darcey Bussell being beaten up in these surroundings: she is
too valuable to waste on such brutalisms.
This triple bill is repeated at Covent Garden on Feb 17, March 10,16

FT  13 FEB 93 / Arts: Haydn's Creation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KLAUS Tennstedt was originally booked to conduct the London Philharmonic's
two performances of Haydn's Creation this week at the Royal Festival Hall.
Tennstedt, though, was advised to rest after some strenuous touring; forced
to look elsewhere for a conductor the LPO struck lucky: the concerts were
taken over by Roger Norrington.
The results were certainly very different from any notion of what a
Tennstedt Creation might have been. For though Norrington was working with a
modern symphony orchestra without a period instrument in sight, he was still
able to bring bear a whole range of stylistic insights derived from his
experience of conducting it with his own London Classical Players.
Every texture was opened out, and the bright dabs of instrumental colour
that fleck Haydn's score made to acquire an extra luminosity. Light and
shade was everything. Recitatives were accompanied by a fortepiano, the
strings found their natural inclination to vibrato had been strictly
controlled - many passages, the opening prelude the first, arresting
example, were delivered with wonderfully chaste, limpid string chording -
while the woodwind solos were etched in sharp relief.
The distinguishing characteristic of every Norrington performance is its
rhythmic acuity and it was no surprise to find every phrase here sharply
profiled, each accompanimental figure deftly worked.
So every aspect of this Creation was rendered elegantly buoyant, a tapestry
of deftly worked instrumental strands and vigorously alert singing. The
soloists were a distinguished set - Felicity Lott, Anthony Rolfe-Johnson,
David Wilson-Johnson - all imposing characters in their own right.
With a less characterful trio Norrington might have been tempting to impose
his own precepts, encouraging a little more flexibility, perhaps more
ornamentation; instead he gave them expressive licence and they sang most
elegantly.
The London Philharmonic Choir coped well too with his demands for sinewy
precision; indeed, as an example of what can be achieved within the
constraints of big-band symphonic Haydn the whole evening was an instructive
and inspiring model.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Arts: Schreker's grand magic opera - Andrew Clark on two
rare revivals in Bielefeld and Zurich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOSE WHO know Franz Schreker's music only from Die Gezeichneten, Der ferne
Klang or Der Schatzgraber would be intrigued by Der Schmied von Gent,
currently enjoying a persuasive revival at Bielefeld. The three operas which
shot Schreker to fame immediately before and after the First World War (and
now forming the basis of the Schreker renaissance) are a hothouse of sound
and feeling, expertly orchestrated but shrouded in empty symbolism.
Der Schmied von Gent is altogether more straightforward and entertaining.
Premiered in Berlin in 1932 less than two years before Schreker's premature
death, it suggests the direction his music might have taken if he had not
fallen foul of the Nazis.
Gone is the trademark richness of style which by the mid-1920s was already
out of fashion. In its place comes a dry, contrapuntal language not unlike
Hindemith and Weill. What is most striking is its simplicity  - the way
Schreker uses a few ideas with imagination - and his ability to pull off
such a radical transformation. Only in scenes of great sentiment do we hear
his more familiar self.
A 'grand magic opera' in three acts, Der Schmied von Gent is based on an old
Flemish fairy tale about a blacksmith who sells his soul to the devil in
return for seven years of prosperity. When his time is up, he outwits the
devil and scrapes into heaven.
Smee the smith and his wife are an operatic Mr and Mrs Bloggs - dreaming of
the better life, God-fearing when it suits, decidedly unheroic. A single act
of kind-heartedness to a destitute refugee couple and their baby (Joseph,
Mary and the Christ child) saves Smee's soul - a prescient touch to a German
opera of the 1930s, even more so in the light of Germany's current
preoccupation with xenophobia. Schreker respects the primitive naivety of
the tale, but sprinkles it with comic and ironic touches. As a result, Der
Schmied von Gent communicates well: it is an opera of the common man.
That, at least, was the impression left by this production. John Dew's
staging, with cartoon-like fluorescent decor by Thomas Gruber and plain
modern costumes by Wolfgang Kalk, focused on clear visual symbols.
Set-pieces such as the Wife's prayer and the skeletons' Dance of Death had
an appealing directness. The finale at the pearly gates was a parody of
Everyman's view of paradise: three camp angels prancing about in feathered
wings, St Peter resembling a bouncer and Joseph presiding like a benevolent
televangelist.
In the bass-baritone title role, Erling Onsager gave a solid performance,
and there were some characterful cameos in the smaller parts. But Krystyna
Michalowska made a prosaic, off-pitch Wife and Rainer Koch's conducting left
too many gaps between pit and stage.
Running parallel to this popular Bielefeld production was Die Gezeichneten
(The Branded) at the Zurich Opera House. Here the old doubts about Schreker
resurfaced. For all its cinematic colour, the score is constantly promising
melodies which never materialise. The plot revolves around neurotic,
over-sexed aristocrats (too many male voices), none of whom does anything to
earn our sympathy. Was this really the same steamy pot-boiler which the
Frankfurt and Dusseldorf stagings of the 1980s so convincingly brought to
life?
Jonathan Miller's Zurich production updated the work to the early 20th
century and drained it of dramatic contrast. Peter Davison's single set
consisted of colourless facades, the Act three Elysium looking more like a
shell-shocked military hospital than a den of vice. Dressed in Jon Morrell's
stiff costumes, the cast resembled frigid members of the haute-bourgeoisie,
an impression reinforced by the torpid stage direction. The Zurich public
must have wondered where Dr Miller earned his reputation.
There was some compensation in Eliahu Inbal's powerful, purposeful
conducting and a well-matched cast. Roland Hermann made a tall, blue-blooded
Tamare, Alfred Muff a stalwart Duke Adorno. Gabriele Lechner turned the
artist Carlotta into a majestic dilettante: she knows how to act with her
eyes and voice, and made the most of her soaring lines in the big Act one
duet. The weak point was Alviano, the physically repellant Genoese nobleman
around whom the plot revolves: Jyrki Niskanen, a plausible-sounding tenor,
spent most of the evening searching for his cues.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Arts: Under-sung piano virtuoso
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PIANIST Martin Jones surfaces too rarely in London, but on Wednesday he
addressed himself to the Wigmore Hall's new Bosendorfer with bracing effect.
Like Hamish Milne and John Bingham, he is an under-sung British virtuoso
with ideas and an enterprising repertoire. His Wigmore programme surveyed
solid Jones territory: first early Brahms, big-boned and rangy, and then a
string of virtuoso piano-transcriptions, stuffed with notes and with
outrageous challenges to the performer.
He began by expounding the Brahms Variations on an Original Theme, op. 21
no. 1, coolly and selflessly - shapely, consequent, unforced. Then the C
major Sonata, the First, took him into high gear (young Brahms was himself a
doughty virtuoso): intrepid speeds, and even in rapid-fire chords the
satisfying, well-balanced crunch of a masterly attack. From the start it was
strong and buoyant; also slightly tight-lipped, for Jones's rhythms are
often taut to the point of brittleness. Brahms's varied piano-textures were
gorgeously realised; the Andante was sober and sincere, the Scherzo less
than 'con fuoco', without much dance-pulse.
In the second half, every one of the transcriptions - a dubious genre, of
course, but wickedly enticing - boasted passages of brilliant authority.
Percy Grainger's 'ramble' around the last Rosenkavalier duet does indeed
ramble, and closer sympathy with how live sopranos sing their limpid lines
might have lit up the lyrical base of the exercise better; but the
surroundings were prettily crystalline. Similarly in Godowsky's irresistible
'concert paraphrase' on Die Fledermaus: part of the fun must lie in the
combination of wild, extraneous arabesques with the rollicking songs we all
know and love - but the songs really need to rollick, and to breathe.
Here they were paler than that, like the voice line in Godowsky's version of
Richard Strauss's 'Standchen', the only strand that faltered in an otherwise
delectable performance. Jones made a slow-motion idyll of the famous Albeniz
Tango in Godowsky's elaboration, a sort of decadent dream about the simple,
unforgettable original. I draw the line at Godowsky's treatment of the same
composer's 'Triana': like all the other pieces in his Iberia Suite, the
spareness and precision of the original piano-writing - however explosive,
from time to time - are essential to its musical virtue, and surplus
upholstery means a net loss.
In Dohnanyi's arrangement of the 'Schatz' waltz of Johann Strauss II (new to
me), Jones brought the pianistic roulades as much to tingling life as he did
in the Fledermaus paraphrase. He is not, however, a great waltzer. In both
pieces we missed any confident, shameless Schwung. A canny pianist like him
should notice that Dohnanyi and Godowsky cram in more titivations than can
possibly be accommodated within a strict beat (which will therefore limp at
saturation-points, while you try to get all the notes in), whereas a
properly skewed, swinging pulse will make room for the overload without
seeming to miss a step. Jones should practise unbending.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Arts: Dublin's 'Juno' in Belfast - Malcolm Rutherford
discusses the pertinence of O'Casey's play today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Gate Theatre Dublin has been appearing this week at the Grand Opera
House in Belfast with a wonderful production of Sean O'Casey's Juno and the
Paycock. The production by Joe Dowling is not new; it was first performed in
Dublin a good five years ago and has since been acclaimed around the world.
But as Michael Barnes, the artistic director at the Opera House, explains,
this is the first time that it has been possible to get it to Belfast.
So what do the people of the north make of a piece which has plenty of
relevance to present troubles? They have flocked to it in droves. The Opera
House, a fine theatre which seats about 1,000, has been booked out all week.
And, of course, they recognise it as the masterpiece it is.
Juno is not a nationalist work. If anything, its attitude to politics is a
plague on all the factions. When O'Casey was making his mark in Dublin in
the early 1920s, the internal troubles were intense. Political infighting
and fanaticism are strewn throughout the play, yet the underlying theme of
Juno is poverty and the attempt to live above the breadline: sectarianism
simply makes life even more difficult.
There is also something about the play which goes deeper. Why is it that
people are poor? Certainly the Boyle family would be better off if the
Captain consumed less drink and spent less time with his friend Joxer Daly?
Why are the women on the whole so much more responsible than the men? Why do
they set double standards when the women occasionally fall from grace? See
the way the best as well as the worst of them turn on the young Mary when
she becomes pregnant. Why are the Irish so curiously fey, for ever lilting
into song and fantasy however deep their troubles? Is it escapism or is it a
way of life?
Then there is the very sharp attack the futility of religion, as in the
famous lines: 'Mother o'God, Mother o'God have pity on us all] Blessed
Virgin, where were you when me darlin' son was riddled with bullets,' the
last words being repeated like a prayer. Why does the religion like the
political fanaticism remain so strong? And why are there some Irish, like
the IRA, who appear to have no sense of humour? The gunmen in Juno behave
like stage dummies.
Again it is striking that even when Captain Boyle is out of work the Boyle
family is not absolutely poor. It survives, has aspirations, tries to dress
well. Mary has been through school and is reading Ibsen. The women take the
Captain's behaviour more or less for granted.
In short, this is a very complex society. Every character is different, and
the women are as different from each other as they are from the men. Few of
the questions raised have changed much since the play was written. They seem
as relevant in the north as in the Republic, and watching the play in
Belfast the audience had no sense of estrangement. In fact, they seemed
thoroughly at home.
Two footnotes. Joxer, the layabout sponger, is usually played with a degree
of sympathy. Here, Mark Lambert plays him as an out-and-out waster. The mood
of the piece is realistic, not sentimental. I also think Juno would be an
even better play if the final drunken exchanges between the Captain and
Joxer were dropped, stopping with Anita Reeve's magnificent Juno crying for
an end to 'this murdherin' hate'.
The production moves to Cork, then from March 15 tours to Chichester, Bath,
Cardiff, Reading, Blackpool, Norwich, Birmingham, Richmond and Newcastle.

<TEXT>
IT IS too easy, in reactionary and fogeyish times, for the critic to give
the impression that he is against all art that is difficult, openly
experimental, avant-garde, simply because it is, well, difficult,
experimental . . .But two concurrent exhibitions in the same building afford
some countervailing encouragement and relief.
Hamish Fulton, with uncharacteristic long-windedness, calls his latest
exhibition at Annely Juda 'only art resulting from the experience of
individual walks', but we should not be put off. Here again are the
photographic works that marry image to text. And here are the drawings: the
mountain silhouettes, again with allusive and evocative texts; and the texts
that are the entire work, the letter-forms painted directly on the wall.
It all sounds conventional enough, and within its particular modernist
orthodoxy. Fulton is not the only artist to present work of this kind, and
in such a way; like his sometime fellow-student and travelling companion,
Richard Long, he derives his work from the walks he takes - which might be
the far wilderness or the domestic countryside, the far side of the world or
no farther than the Home Counties.
The conceptual proposition is that the walk itself, set to a rigorous,
self-imposed programme - 'no talking for seven days', for example, or
'fourteen days walking, fourteen nights camping', or 'a continuous 106 mile
walk without sleep' - constitutes a work of art in itself, an act defined
and realised, a palpable line, albeit instantly ephemeral, traced across the
surface of the earth. The work in the gallery is something quite else,
resolved in its own terms, the spring of imaginative recollection or
sympathetic association.
Such things are easy enough to mock, but the very mocking too easily misses
the point. What makes Fulton so special and distinguished in his field, as
it were, is his disciplined acceptance of the rules and limitations of what
he does. He makes no alterations where he goes, builds no cairns, marks out
no lines,nor brings back sticks and stones to set out in circles in the
gallery. He is no sculptor, though he responds acutely to the sculptural
qualities he confronts in the natural world. There is no fuss, no
dissimulation, no self-parade.
If he called himself a poet rather than an artist, even though one of a
peculiarly visual nature, he would perhaps encounter less vehement prejudice
of the kind that would ask: 'what kind of art do you call that?' The poet,
after all, is one who takes his path through life, with his notebook in his
pocket and images in his head, his poem the distillation of his experience,
his images but metaphors, the purest of conceits.
Downstairs, Leon Kossoff fills Anthony d'Offay's principal gallery with a
group of recent drawings, of the nude and the portrait head, and of urban
landscape and architecture, most notably of Christchurch at Spitalfields.
Kossoff is, with Frank Auerbach, outstanding among those figurative painters
of his generation who have continued in the tradition of direct, intense and
expansive expressionism, after the example of David Bomberg, who taught them
in the years just after the Second World War.
The mark, the intuitive gesture is all, to be trusted absolutely, a romantic
commitment to canvas of immediate vision, an act of faith. But nothing in
art, true art at least, is ever quite so simple and arbitrary. Beyond the
surface image and the apparent flurry of marks lie repetition and
reconsideration, thought, decision and start again. Was there ever an
accident in art that was not contrived? To look into these rich, active and
complex drawings is to begin to recognise a profound deliberation and
authority. The charcoal runs across the surface just so, the pressure
delicate and exact the image achieved, resolved, beautiful.
Hamish Fulton: Annely Juda Fine Art, 23 Dering Street W1, until March 6.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Arts: Imperial threads - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STARTING this week, the World Service is to run, over the next two months, a
Spotlight on South Asia, about the Indian sub-continent and its neighbours.
In four programmes on successive Mondays, John Renner will examine affairs
in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. This week's, Division and Identity,
begins with a recording of Nehru's promise that the Indians will 'redeem our
pledge' - a promise at once torpedoed by the Hindu-Moslem division that gave
birth to Pakistan, and subsequently Bangladesh.
Situations in these three nations are sharply scrutinised, with telling
interventions from local voices. Next week Renner will consider social
matters, and the week after, the 'huddled masses' in the regions of great
poverty, with a view of the causes and the conceivable cures.
There will be features and plays from the same countries too, including  -
on St. Valentine's Day] - a Sanskrit tragi-comedy, Hayavadana, where rivals
for the same woman each cut their own heads off. The goddess Kali puts them
back, but unhappily she gets the heads on the wrong shoulders . . .
The Imperial thread was tugged again on Friday in Radio 3's A Future for
Their Past. Christopher Hope, a native South African, presented other South
African writers, black and white, on the future of South African writing
after the end of apartheid. What shall we have to write about seemed to be
the principal question, and the main answer was the past. Lately, stories of
repression and resistance, said JM Coetzee, had seemed more important than
inventive fiction. Free from censorship, the South Africans had to learn
about themselves - especially the blacks, whose history was mainly recalled
from their conflicts with the invaders. Next week Radio 3 will give five
South African Snapshots, to include work by some of the contributors to this
programme.
Radio 3's Sunday play this week was a subtle piece by David Pownall, Dreams
and Censorship, that contrived to include in its dramatis personae St. John
the Divine, King James I and William Shakespeare. The King (Hugh Ross) is
anxious that the new English Bible shall not include the Book of Revelation
lest it encourage revolt. Shakespeare (Edward Petherbridge), whom the King
calls Willy, is directing a company in the events that took place on Patmos,
where St. John (Robert Stephens) has retired, and where the Romans are to
crucify two vestal virgins, one of them played by randy young Prince Charles
(Gary King).
The arguments that connect these events are as entertaining as they are
interesting, even if sometimes as historically dodgy as (say) Henry V; they
lead properly to the inclusion of Revelation in the King James Bible that we
know. The playing throughout is first-class under Eoin O'Callaghan's
direction.
Good Wives (Radio 4 FM, Thursday) is the sequel to Alcott's Little Women,
which has been dramatised in six parts by Marcie Kahan. We begin with Meg's
wedding to John Brooke, and go on to Amy's disappointing day out with the
young ladies of her drawing class, that only one of the invited dozen
attends. If you enjoyed Little Women you will enjoy this, for the girls seem
hardly to have grown up at all. Marilyn Imrie directs, and Marmee is no less
than Gayle Hunnicutt.
The Saturday play on Radio 4 was David Halliwell's Crossed Lines, that began
with a chap being offered Pounds 88,000 by a strange woman on the telephone,
and went on as improbably for 90 minutes. The lucky guy was Ian Hogg and the
director Philip Martin.
Richard Imison, one of the best influences on radio drama, died from cancer
last week. He had been the BBC's script editor for almost 30 years, later
its deputy director of drama.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Arts: Where Angels fear to tread - Antony Thorncroft looks
at the state of West End theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON MARCH 25, at the HQ of the Society of West End Theatre in Covent Garden,
a training seminar will be held. The aim is to initiate aspiring impresarios
into the arcane mystery of the theatrical producer. It may seem odd that men
and women should need instruction on how to lose others people's money, but
the West End is desperate for more producers, and if the seminar can unearth
another Cameron Mackintosh, or even a Duncan Weldon, it will have paid for
itself a million times over.
On the surface the West End is weathering the recession rather well.
Audiences last year just about equalled the 10.9m achieved in 1991, the
second highest total on record. But many of these theatre goers will have
been occupying a discounted seat and the last six months have seen audiences
slip.
Spurred on by falling receipts the entire West End brotherhood - theatre
owners, producers, even actors - is drawing together in an unprecedented
show of co-operation, with the objective of conjuring up the perfect
scenario: well financed producers with a good supply of new plays queueing
up to rent theatres.
Change is inevitable because traditional Angels are becoming extinct. The
flow of individuals prepared to fritter away Pounds 1,000 or more on a stake
in a show which nine times out of ten will fail financially, has all but
dried up. The problems of Lloyds of London, coupled with a rise in
production costs which makes a straight play a Pounds 250,000 bet and a
musical anything up to a Pounds 3m gamble, have scattered even the most
stage struck theatrical backers.
New sources of finance are being explored, notably American, Japanese and
even City syndicates, but the West End now relies for its precarious living
on plays and musicals which started out in the subsidised theatre, or on
limited runs of revivals built around star names by Duncan Weldon or Peter
Hall. New producers, tapping new sources of funding and, ideally, new
writers, would be most welcome.
In the meantime the theatre owners, reluctant to see their properties lying
dark, are doing their bit to develop product. Stoll-Moss, which owns 11
theatres, has just recruited Nica Burns, best known as a comedy impresario,
to seek out new plays for its smaller, 400-seater plus, theatres, which are
the accountants' nightmare. Stoll-Moss might even commission new works: it
already takes a small stake in many of the productions renting its theatres.
This involvement by theatre owners parallels a trend by the more successful
producers to acquire theatres. Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful company
has just spent around Pounds 3m acquiring a half share of the Adelphi
Theatre, which will present his new musical Sunset Boulevard. He already
owns the Palace and the New London. Cameron Mackintosh has joined forces
with Lord Delfont and now owns the Prince Edward, the Prince of Wales, and
the Strand. Michael Codron owns the Vaudeville and manages the Adelphi, and
Eddie Kulukundus is a co-owner of the Duke of York's and the Ambassadors. We
are returning to the post-War era when moguls like Prince Littler and
Bernard Delfont put on shows in their own theatres.
The arrival of the new theatre owners, especially when they are
multi-millionaires like Mackintosh and Lloyd Webber, has brought a much
needed infusion of cash into the West End. Inspired by the thought that he
will not be paying rent at the Adelphi, Lloyd Webber has embarked on a
Pounds 3m refurbishment of the theatre, while Mackintosh has insisted on a
Pounds 3m revamp of the Prince Edward, returning it to its 1930s glory and
hoping to attract the major musicals which are the gold spinners of the West
End: the Broadway hit Crazy for You starts previews there next week. And
Stoll-Moss will be investing Pounds 3m on improvements across its theatre
chain this year.
George Biggs, director of Maybox, which owns seven West End theatres, has no
plans to become a producer, but is happy to join in the current blurring of
responsibilities. Maybox underwrote the losses at its revamped Donmar
Theatre until producer Sam Mendes could find alternative backing for the
small venue, which can never survive on ticket sales alone. Like Stoll-Moss,
Maybox will increasingly carry plays for a few weeks if they fail to reach
the agreed box office revenue. This is good business sense. If there is no
new play waiting in the wings, the current production, even if playing well
below capacity, brings in some income through bar and snack sales. Left dark
it could cost Pounds 12,000 a week to maintain.
With virtually all the theatre buildings in the West End now architecturally
'listed' they are safe from commercial predators, and only one is on the
market, the Royalty, owned by Stoll-Moss. It is on the wrong side of the
tracks, but the success of Cats at the equally remote New London supports
the view that there is no such thing as a bad theatre, only a bad show.
There have been three offers for the Royalty; none from existing theatre
owners.
Anyone becoming a West End theatre owner will join a closely knit community
co-operating to survive. It beggars belief that central London can support
fifty theatres, but despite the prophets of doom, who include Duncan Weldon,
the vast revenues from the successes - around Pounds 350,000 a week from
Miss Saigon - will continue to weave their spell. The number of theatres is
actually destined to grow this year. The Criterion has just re opened and
the Savoy soon starts up again.
There is also a growing interest in the Lyceum, which was one of the finest
theatres in the West End. It has been a wreck for years and its current
owner, the financially embarrassed Brent Walker, has let it decline into
total disrepair. The cost of refurbishing it, estimated at around Pounds
15m, deters potential buyers, but, in another example of how far the
barriers between producer and theatre owner, between the subsidised and the
commercial theatre, between the Arts Council and the West End, have broken
down, there is now serious discussion of an ambitious, indeed dramatic,
solution.
Like much else in the arts it involves Millennium money, gathered in through
the Lottery. The government would use it to pay for the renovation of the
Lyceum. This could then become London's dance theatre (and perhaps the home
of the English National Ballet). Alternatively, Stoll-Moss would rent out
the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, to fit this role: it would be ideal for the
Royal Ballet which will be homeless in 1997 when Covent Garden closes for
restoration. As compensation Stoll-Moss would take on the Lyceum as a home
for musicals. The will is there for mutual co-operation; all that is missing
is the money.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Arts: Rothschild wins Lottery - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS HAS been a bad week for Jocelyn Stevens, the rumbustious boss at
English Heritage, who has had years of experience at rough riding over
opponents. In an unexpected show of muscle his London Advisory Committee,
headed by Sir Hugh Cubbitt, squashed Stevens plan to hand over control of
Grade Two listed buildings in the capital to the reluctant boroughs, most of
whom have neither the money nor the knowledge to replace the respected
English Heritage team of experts.
Now I can reveal that he has failed to get his hands on that slice of the
Lottery money which is to be allocated to shoring up the heritage. Instead
the National Heritage Fund, headed by Lord Rothschild, will play the good
fairy. The sum involved is reputed to be Pounds 70m a year. (This means the
Government anticipates that the revenue from the Lottery, after prizes, tax,
and expenses, will be Pounds 350m a year, to be split five ways between
heritage, arts, sport, the Millennium Fund, and charities).
Perhaps the choice of the NHF was signalled last November when the Heritage
Secretary, Peter Brook, announced that its grant, currently Pounds 12m a
year, was to be reduced over the next two financial years. He knew it will
have its hands full allocating the much larger sum.
The National Heritage Fund must somehow distinguish between its two pots of
gold. Probably the Lottery money will be earmarked for a dozen or so major
good causes in the heritage involving capital projects. It might be good
politics for the NHF to hand some over to English Heritage which needs a
multi million pound donation to realise its ambitious plans to improve its
most public responsibility, Stonehenge.
The Royal Albert Hall is on the move: literally. For the first time in its
120 year history it is empire building. The object of its expansion is the
South Steps, the rather grand staircase that leads from Prince Consort Road
towards the back of the Hall.
In themselves the steps are purely a thoroughfare but underneath are wide
open spaces currently used to garage cars. If the Albert Hall can acquire
the site it can use the space to transform its back stage facilities,
allowing better access for stage crews, more storage space, plus dressing
rooms and bars.
Fortunately the Hall can offer a fair price. Since the arrival of chief
executive Patrick Deuchar it has gone on a marketing offensive. It no longer
waits for the phone calls from deluded divas, desperate to fritter away a
lifetime's savings on hiring the Hall, but sells its attractions world wide
to star names.
Hence the importance of the Bolshoy season which ends tomorrow. It has
played to 80 per cent capacity and proved to the world that the Albert Hall
can successfully handle long seasons by the biggest companies. Among the
stars set to perform in the Hall for the first time is that indubitably big
name, Victoria Wood.
But there is one odd consequence of this new success. The Albert Hall is a
charity. Its 300 debenture holders cannot receive a dividend. Instead any
surplus goes back into making the Hall more comfortable. In 1987 just Pounds
392,000 was spent on improvements: this year Deuchar hopes to invest Pounds
1.78m. At this rate will we will all be sitting on Louis XV chairs and
eating lobster from silver salvers by the time the Bolshoy comes back for
another dollop of hard currency.
The Treasury seems to think that it can solve the nation's financial
problems by selling off its art. It has made a grab for the government
collection - and been firmly rebuffed by the Department of Heritage - and is
now sniffing around the British Rail Pension Fund's collection of art.
Its enthusiasm for the government's pictures is bizarre. These are the works
of art that decorate government ministries and offices and our embassies
abroad. Many of the 16,000 works are rubbish. The valuable works are creamed
off by cabinet ministers, from the PM down, and by the top embassies. They
would hardly be happy to lose this perk of office.
The most interesting part of the collection is the contemporary British art
acquired by curator Wendy Barron with a tiny budget of around Pounds 100,000
a year. Much of it is of high quality, but only of interest to British
collectors and would fetch little on the market. Disposing of the government
collection would be a philistine act, causing a tremendous commotion, and
very counter productive.
In contrast the British Rail art is among the best in the world. It was
acquired by its Pension Fund in the early 1970s when the return from
traditional forms of investment looked bleak. The Pounds 40m allocated has
proved that rarest of rare things, a good investment in art. Two-thirds of
the 2,200 objects acquired have already been sold, including the
Impressionists, silver, Japanese prints and Old Master drawings, and they
produced a reasonable return of 6 per cent a year after inflation.
The Fund still holds its best Old Masters, antiquities, and medieval works
of art, including Van Dyck's wonderful portrait of the daughters of Charles
I, as well as works by Goya and Tiepolo. But there are still many legal
obstacles to be overcome before the Treasury gets its hands on these
marvels.
It looks as if the British Commonwealth Library has been saved for the
nation. An appeal, organised by Sir Patrick Sheehy of BATS, has raised
Pounds 2.4m of the Pounds 3m needed, thanks to generous donations from Peter
Moores, Garfield Weston, and others. Cambridge University Library has
offered a home for the books, and the National Heritage Fund, which was
originally asked to stump up the whole Pounds 3m, may now well make a
donation to help complete the appeal.
This is sad news for Sotheby's which already has in its vaults the Cyprus
collection from the Library, the best in the world, and valued at Pounds
500,000. One tiny heave and the books will be on their way to Cambridge.

career of David O. Selznick

SHOWMAN: THE LIFE OF DAVID O. SELZNICK by David Thomson Andre Deutsch Pounds
20, 792 pages
PITY THE poor producer. Actors, directors and even writers may get lasting
credit for a memorable film, but the person entitled to pick up the Best
Picture Oscar is usually a nameless, faceless creature. Only a few producers
have been able to reach the level of a Gable or a Wilder in the filmgoer's
imagination. And, as David Thomson makes clear in this comprehensive
biography, none was able to stamp his imprimatur on films more deeply than
David O. Selznick.
If anyone was ever destined to be in the film business, it was David O. Born
in 1902 to the pioneering film magnate Lewis Selznick, he was his father's
right-hand man by the age of 14, writing memos, pampering starlets and even
trying his hand at production. When he was 20 'Pop' went bankrupt, forcing
David to find his way in the big bad world. He ventured as far as MGM, where
he was taken on by his father's old rival Louis B. Mayer, who suspended his
hatred of Selznick pere after recognising the spark of genius in his son.
Indeed, David was soon to marry Mayer's daughter Irene in a dynastic
marriage worthy of a Shakespearian history.
But Selznick was restless in the studio system. Though he excelled at MGM
right from the start, he moved several times in the next few years, working
at just about every major in Hollywood by the time he was 32, lending his
hand in the process to such classics as King Kong and David Copperfield. In
1935, Selznick decided to leave the studio system altogether, becoming
(along with Goldwyn) the model for independent producers. His first few
efforts were worthy, especially A Star is Born, which David more or less
wrote. The Selznick style was evolving - lush, sensitive films, bolstered by
cogent emotional narrative and a genius for casting.
It was a style that was to reach its apotheosis, of course, with Gone With
The Wind. Not surprisingly, Thomson's biography reaches its high point here
as well, depicting the conjugation of visionary grace and rampant ego
Selznick employed to complete the picture. Although the story has been told
before, it seems to make perfect sense when seen in the context of
Selznick's career. The sentimentality, the escapist grandeur, the utter
filmness of the project can all be seen as the culmination of a life that
began wrapped in celluloid rather than linen.
To his credit, Thomson does try to squirt some cold water on a few of the
GWTW myths, particularly in hinting that the famous meeting of Selznick and
Vivian Leigh during the burning of Atlanta sequence might not have been as
utterly serendipitous as it was made out to be. Also, the legendary delay
over getting the project going had as much to do with Selznick's natural
prevarication as it did marketing genius. Yet the reader still comes way
with the sense that, for this one film anyway, Selznick achieved the
pinnacle of the producer's craft.
After that, of course, everything was bound to be anti-climactic. To be
sure, there were big films to come, such as Rebecca and Duel in the Sun, but
they all paled in comparison with GWTW. Selznick the showman felt this more
acutely than anyone - 'I know my trouble,' he remarked in 1945. 'I know when
I die, the obituaries will begin 'David O. Selznick, producer of Gone With
The Wind, died today' and I'm trying like hell to rewrite them.'
Just as inevitably, Selznick's fame (and his dependency on Benzedrine)
created something of a monster. The infectious energy became more malignant.
His womanising - he tried to lay everything in his Culver City office except
the carpet - finally caused his marriage to break up. Irene had been a
devoted wife but she was also a Mayer. She took Selznick to the cleaners,
leaving him in debt for the rest of his life. Despite David's subsequent
marriage to Jennifer Jones, Irene would haunt him, Rebecca-like, for the
rest of his life. Though there were a few more films left in him, by the
mid-1950s David had, like his father-in-law, become so marginalised that a
TV documentary about MGM barely mentioned either.
Thomson's biography is remarkably complete, which is hardly surprising when
you consider that he is the first biographer to have complete access to
Selznick's voluminous correspondence. (A compulsive writer who would compose
dozens of memos in the course of a working day, Selznick once cabled Irene
simply to tell her he had just had a haircut.) Indeed, the book is flawed by
its extreme length. Seven hundred pages is simply too much, especially for a
character whose star burned bright for a relatively brief period. The
wearying accounts of Byzantine financial deals and overly detailed survey of
his later years eventually wear the reader down. Selznick may have been able
to make GWTW twice as long as its rivals, but Thomson does not have the
finesse to pull off a similar feat.
Still, for those willing to stay the course, Thomson well captures the
manic, almost demented personality needed to produce a big film, showing how
David's drug-taking and compulsive gambling were almost necessary
by-products of his endeavours. The book also provides a comprehensive
picture of the bleak realities of the studio system; Selznick had to become
something of a pimp to survive, renting out contract players to the majors
to pay his bills and ensure distribution rights.
And there is also a restrained smattering of the obligatory wry humor - did
you know that Gone With The Wind had as working titles both Tomorrow Is
Another Day and, astonishingly, Tote The Weary Load? Most memorable is the
time Selznick instructed an author he wanted a rewrite. When the writer
asked his producer what specifically needed changing, Selznick replied that
he would have to get back to him - he had not yet read the script. Now
there's a born producer for you.

WHAT a long way we have come. Sex was once a private affair whose existence
could not be acknowledged without a blush or a wink. Today it ranks with
fashion, gardening or home improvements as a leisure occupation that
supports a multi-billion-dollar industry.
Paul Ferris's book Sex and the British (Michael Joseph Pounds 18.99, 337
pages) is about how the British have over 100 years learned to accept sex as
something you get taught on television. He has heroically consulted a great
many sources, collected a great many anecdotes and stitched them together in
a stylish way.
Yet his history proves as indigestible as a double helping of steamed jam
roll. Better not to treat it as a narrative, but as an anthology to taste
from the index backwards. A bedside book, in other words.
Helen Fisher, an anthropolo gist, has written the ancient history of sex in
Anatomy of Love (Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 16.99, 430 pages). She takes us
back to the caves and suggests that adultery is the consequence of a
genetically-transmitted chemical change in the brain which occurs after four
years of passion (not seven). It may be comforting - or not - to learn that
modern sexual licence is just homo sapiens reverting to type.
Men's adultery is old hat, so publishers are interested in women's. In The
Erotic Silence of Married Women (Bloomsbury Pounds 16.99, 304 pages), Dalma
Heyn, an American feminist, talks to a number of women who tell her that sex
outside marriage is more fun than sex within and that shopping can be just
as exciting. Her title is a tease, her book a bore.
Lotte and Joseph Hamburger have a more promising subject in Sarah Austin, a
respectable Victorian woman who falls in epistolary love with a Prussian
bounder, Prince Hermann von Puckler-Muskau, whose saucy memoirs she has
translated and censored. It is sad to see such innocent affection exploited
in Contemplating Adultery (Macmillan Pounds 14.99, 314): one's first
reaction is to wish that poor Mrs. Austin's unrevealing letters had never
come to light.
Few writers are good at sex, they say. They are right.

MRS SHAKESPEARE by Robert Nye Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 14.99, 216 pages
A DOUBLE LIFE by Frederic Raphael Orion Pounds 14.99, 374 pages
EINSTEIN'S DREAMS by Alan Lightman Bloomsbury Pounds 11.99, 179 pages
SHAKESPEARE wrote in a sonnet full of ironic rudery: 'My mistress' eyes are
nothing like the sun.' With hair like black wire and dun-coloured skin, she
even seemed, poor woman, to have halitosis. Husbandly rather than lover-like
frankness? Robert Nye thinks so.
Anne Hathaway, eight years the elder and no match for her husband's London
life, is the Dark Lady of the sonnets, according to Mrs Shakespeare. The
Stratford boy married in a hurry at 19, had three children before he was of
age and two years later bolted to make his fortune. He made it and in the
end came home, but in the meantime left Anne with a one-parent family and
the in-laws.
When she comes to write about him, he has been dead seven years and she
still has no notion of his greatness or even his fame; as for his
immortality, the thought of it never crosses her mind. Yes, he did better
than might have been expected, but in a raffish world and a dubious cause:
the theatre and poetry. Poetry is not for her, any more than the theatre is:
'Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?' her husband asks. 'No thanks]'
says she.
And yet, though she has never read him ('I read my Bible'), she loves the
memory of him - his slyboots ways and bad teeth; their long separations and
their week of offbeat sex on her single visit to London; his thinning hair,
his passion for sugar. Sir Smile, the dirty devil, the crafty crow, my bad
husband, as full of secrets as a cow's tail is full of burrs, the magpie
man, the darling: all these he may be and her tenderness is oblique.
But as the everyday jottings of a woman who has lived, unaware of it, close
to genius, Mrs Shakespeare beguiles and persuades. It is winning, too, and
amazingly easy to read, since almost every sentence is given a new line of
its own, and so it comes out like small barks of monologue, all sharp
commonsense and funny, unexpected and touching no-nonsense.
A Double Life, a straightforward, well-tailored novel, with chapters
alternating between past and present, is a hard grind by comparison. Doze a
moment and you may miss a vital clue, for this is a psychological detection.
Who is the narrator and what the dickens is he up to? Dickensian only in its
proliferation of plots and characters, the novel lacks humour and humanity,
although Mrs Shakespeare might have seen it as weirdly clever and
desperately observant.
Over-observant, indeed. Nothing happens or is noted without dangling
suppositions and improbable subtleties about which, the characters all being
coldly watched by an unsympathetic narrator, it is hard to care. Guy de
Roumegouse is a French diplomat with good credentials from his Resistance
days and a notable lack of chums in the present. Nobody seems to like him
and it is soon clear why: he is unlikeable.
For no very clear reason he always does what he doesn't want to do and says
what he doesn't mean, marrying two women he neither loves nor wants, the
first a bitch called Berthe, the second a dim one-time nurse called Maureen.
Prostitutes, one of whom, perhaps ironically named Pia, is murdered with his
wife's coat in her room, feature importantly on the edge of his life.
Frederic Raphael's writing is so tight-packed it demands a response of
warmth and interest which this novel makes it hard to give. Paradox is his
main stylistic weapon or weakness, a see-saw of syntax and opinion balanced
between this and that, the double life of the title in action. It is
strictly realistic, nonetheless; and realism that does not convince defeats
its own end: you can see, even appreciate, every detail, yet fail to find
the spirit, the inner life.
A relief, after so thick a pudding, to come across something as endearingly
short, airy and irrational as Einstein's Dreams, which is described in a
rather far-fetched way as fiction. A series of short essays on the theme of
time, it is teasing, stimulating and remote from direct experience, yet set
firmly in particular times and places (1905, the year in which Einstein was
working out his relativity theory; and Switzerland).
Sometimes it goes too far over the temporal top and reminds one too clearly
that it is fantasy, but mainly it keeps within the limits of what seems like
straight-faced discussion and makes one grateful for the grace of its
writing; indeed, it seems the sort of book to hoard and treasure for bleak
times and empty spaces. Salman Rushdie was reminded by it of Calvino's
Invisible Cities. A good comparison: both have the same sweet unreason.

<TEXT>
BERLIN] BERLIN] ITS CULTURE, ITS TIMES by Michael Farr Kyle Cathie Pounds
18.99, 216 pages
REVOLUTION could never grip Berlin, Lenin predicted, because Germans would
only storm a railway station after first queueing for platform tickets.
Nevertheless, as this engaging book shows, Berlin has had one of the most
tumultuous lives of any European city in modern times. Today, it remains a
barometer for European politics and culture.
Unlike Rome or London, it was a never a natural capital. A medieval city
fought over by robber barons from the Brandenburg marshes, it was thought a
provincial upstart by lovers of Munich, Dresden and Frankfurt even in the
19th century. Michael Farr's achievement here is to explore how its
civilising went hand in hand with the military growth which proved its
downfall. So the work of the great architects Knobelsdorff and Schinkel, who
determined the tone of the city from the 18th century with buildings like
the opera house on Unter den Linden, the Altes museum and Potsdam's Sans
Souci Palace, is seen against the backcloth of the warlike escapades of the
Hohenzollern emperors.
Farr is inspired on the contradictory character of this clan and its city.
In the 17th century, every fifth inhabitant was a soldier, yet Berlin's
tradition as most tolerant and cosmopolitan of German cities was already
established, and in 1700, after an influx of Protestant refugees, one fifth
of the people were French. Tiny, fat Elector Frederick William was a liberal
but a bully who kicked women in the street and chased men with a cane. He
collected giant soldiers for whom he swapped the city's artistic treasures
with other monarchs. His favourites were a 7ft Irishman and a Norwegian
smith; all were too precious to risk in war.
His son, Frederick the Great, used his soldiers but always took a flute on
his campaigns and composed sonatas between battles. For all his Prussian
nationalism, he spoke only French and under him Berlin acquired the elegance
which Frederick envied in Versailles. The love affair with France continued;
during the Franco-Prussian war William I suspended his French chef, but
reinstated him after sampling the menus of his German successor.
The war ended in 1871 with Berlin capital of a united Germany. By 1900 it
had become a mecca for artists and intellectuals as never before. Farr is a
gifted raconteur but not a cultural commentator, and his anecdotal style
fails here. But the hey-day of German expressionism and of the 1920s
explosion of cabaret and naughtiness - Berlin had in perverted sex what
Paris had in straight sex, according to one high liver - makes a naturally
compelling story.
There is the same imbalance between the sharp historical analysis of the
Nazi and post-war years, and the sketchy cultural criticism. Redeemed
however by delightful period photographs, cartoons and engravings, no Berlin
lover would want to miss this book.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Books: Write first, live later - Stephen Crane's work
pre-empted his life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE DOUBLE LIFE OF STEPHEN CRANE: A BIOGRAPHY by Christopher Benfey Andre
Deutsch Pounds 17.99, 294 pages
WHILE A great many novels and plays derive from episodes in their authors'
past lives, the reverse is not uncommon. There are some authors' lives whose
future course seems to have been plotted in advance in their imaginative
work. Who, for instance, knowing the end of Oscar Wilde, can listen without
inwardly shuddering to the fate of Jack's imaginary brother Ernest in The
Importance?
JACK: He died abroad; in Paris in fact. I had a telegram last night from the
manager of the Grand Hotel . . .
MISS PRISM: As a man sows, so he shall reap.
Wilde was riding high when he wrote that. Not a cloud on his horizon. Yet
within five or six years he had been disgraced, imprisoned and had died in a
hotel in Paris, his friends informed by telegram.
As Christopher Benfey points out in The Double Life of Stephen Crane, no
author's imaginative work has ever provided a more accurate forecast of the
events of his future life than Crane's. This American writer was a
contemporary of Wilde's, and also had a meteoric career. He died aged only
28 in 1900, the year of Wilde's death. The young Wallace Stevens was sent to
cover Crane's funeral service at the Central Metropolitan Temple, New York.
'Most of the people' he wrote 'were of the lower classes and had dropped in
apparently to pass the time . . . The whole thing was frightful'.
Yet Crane's place in American literature was already secure ; nowadays no
course on the American novel is complete without him. But he still tends to
be regarded, especially by us in Britain, as merely the author of that Civil
War classic, The Red Badge of Courage, a one-book man. By any standards The
Red Badge is a fine book, a memorable study of initiation into manhood, into
life - but there is a great deal more, equally good (see the 1984 Library of
America omnibus volume of Crane's work). He produced several fine stories
and novellas not directly involving war - outstanding among them are The
Monster, The Open Boat, The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky, The Blue Hotel - all
of which turn nonetheless on violent action.
A black servant is horribly disfigured in a fire saving his master's child
and is thereafter socially ostracised. Four men including a war
correspondent fight to survive in a lifeboat off the Florida coast. A
sheriff returns home with his new young wife and has at once to participate
in a shoot-out. A poker-game ends in a brawl and one of the players, a
Swede, is killed. Crane is the earliest of the fly-on-the wall school of
fiction-writers, making the reader feel that he is totally enclosed in the
world of these events. We seem to experience them physically in our guts,
just as we experience the emotions of the fledgling recruit John Fleming
under fire, culminating in his flight from danger in The Red Badge.
Crane was far too young to have fought in the Civil War and had had no
direct experience of battle when he wrote that book, yet when it was
published to great praise in 1895 such was its air of authenticity there
were those who claimed to have served in the same regiment with him. It was
afterwards that Crane had real experience of war, and came under fire, as a
Hearst journalist covering the fighting between Greece and Turkey and the
gun-running during the Cuban insurrection. It was when Crane was trying to
reach Cuba that he experienced the shipwreck described in The Open Boat.
While he was convalescing from the ordeal he began his liaison with Cora
Taylor, the madam of the brothel in Florida - the aptly named Hotel de Dream
 -where he was staying.
Benfey has little difficulty in finding intimations of shipwreck as well as
battle in Crane's earlier work. And he points to the fact that Crane's first
book, the novella Maggie, had a prostitute for a heroine - though Benfey has
to admit that the pathetic waif Maggie is poles apart from the ebullient,
dominant, Mae West-like Cora who, after Crane had recovered, came to England
with him. As man and wife they took over a rambling, decaying Tudor manor,
Brede Place in Sussex, where they entertained the local literati including
Conrad, Wells and Henry James. There is a famous photograph of a garden
party they gave where James is seen with Cora.
This English fling of Crane's as a munificent lord of the manor (while
heavily in debt) is pretty well documented; but as Benfey shows there are
huge gaps in the earlier years that no amount of research has been able to
fill. The first biography of Crane, by one Thomas Beer, has been exposed
recently as highly fraudulent. Beer quotes letters allegedly by Crane now
revealed as clever fakes. Unfortunately the later book by the poet John
Berryman, containing some interesting observations about Crane's
extraordinary style, was heavily based on it. The standard later life of
Crane by RW Stallman does remain more or less intact. Benfey re-interprets
the ascertainable facts.
Crane's father was a Methodist Minister in New Jersey who resigned from a
fashionable living to become an itinerant preacher. The cause of his fall
from grace remains obscure, as does that of the mental illness suffered by
Crane's mother. His father's death when he was nine and his mother's
subsequent madness devastated the future novelist's childhood.
Benfey, a poet who teaches American literature at Mount Holyoake College,
freely admits to many crucial biographical gaps. He makes up for them by
scrutinising the work with exceptional care. He focuses on one or two
hitherto neglected aspects, pointing to some very short stories about babies
by Crane which de-sentimentalised the notion of infancy and anticipated the
findings of psychology, and he gives some welcome attention to Crane's
almost totally forgotten poems, Black Riders, relating their curious mode of
presentation, entirely in upper case, to newspaper headlines and, more
distantly, to the arts and crafts movement.
This is fascinating stuff - even if it does not render Crane's cryptic poems
any easier to read or understand. Indeed Benfey calls upon a diverse number
of disciplines and different authorities to illuminate Crane's texts, from
Gericault, the painter of shipwreck, to Winnicott, the child psychologist.
Let us hope his lively book will win for Crane some of that wider readership
he so richly deserves.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Outdoors: How I mastered a monster - Fishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE epic account of the epic battle is a staple of fishing literature. These
descriptions are commonly variations on a standard theme: 'The rod bucked
like a wild horse in my hands . . . the reel screamed/shrieked/howled . . .
the fish leaped skyward, lit by the sun, like a bar of silver . . . the huge
tail lashed the water into foam . . . a final desperate bid for freedom . .
. '
This kind of thing becomes wearisome. The trouble is that, while the outcome
and the incidentals vary, one struggle with a big fish is pretty much like
another. The fish pulls. The angler pulls. The fish dashes around. The
angler dashes after it. One side or the other wins. If the angler loses, he
swears.
I would not deny that the fighting of the fish is an integral, thrilling
part of the sport. It stirs deep responses within us, and is the necessary
prelude to the glow of triumph or the bleakness of despair.
But the purest, most intense excitement precedes the fight, before the
angler does anything much beyond watching and waiting. It is the moment of
the take. And I would further suggest that, in its highest form, it must
engage the visual rather than just the tactile sense.
This is not to disparage the heart-stopping moment at which the salmon or
trout grabs the fly. But more often than not, this is merely felt, not seen.
It may be that, at that moment, you are concentrating hard on your fishing.
But you may, equally well, be ruminating on the excesses of the gutter press
or the wisdom of privatising the railways.
Contrast this with the responsibilities of the dry fly man addressing a
trout which is on the feed. He must cast, spot his fly, chart its progress
towards his quarry, and then, as the surface is broken and it vanishes, be
ready. If his mind wanders, he is lost. It is a sure bet that the moment he
starts pondering the issue of the female priesthood the fish will rise and
he will miss it.
But I sometimes feel that fishing with the humble float offers an even purer
pleasure. Pleasing in appearance, even more pleasing in disappearance is how
one writer expressed the joy of float fishing with exquisite pungency. Its
glory lies in the variations in the manner of that disappearance.
The float may tremble awhile, then move off with steady purpose before
slanting into the depths. It may do no more than dip. It may stir almost
imperceptibly, then glide away. It may bob for minutes, before being pulled
under. Or it may be jerked from sight without warning. The fisherman waits
and watches, shaking under the strain of powerful emotions.
These reflections came to me recently, as my favourite crimson-topped pike
float circled the backwater. It was a glorious day to be out, with a clean
breeze dispelling the internal fog bequeathed by seasonal piggishness.
The river, as if content to have turned most of the surrounding countryside
into a lake for the previous two months, had retreated within its banks for
the time being. But it was still running high and the backwater was the only
spot tranquil enough for my float.
Using an elderly carp rod and an antique centrepin reel, I lobbed float and
sprat towards the willow tree on the far side. They had travelled no more
than a couple of yards when the float stopped, vibrated for a second as if
conducting an electric current, and shot under. I could see the crimson tip
beneath the water, whizzing towards the willow, and I struck.
The rod bucked, the reel whined. No, after what I have said already, I had
better leave that bit out. Suffice it to say that after a stern contest, I
netted a magnificent small-headed, fat-bodied female pike; gawped at it;
thrust it into a keepnet; and ran off to the house to find witnesses.
Plastered in mud, dripping with pike slime and reeking of sprats, I hurtled
upstairs in search of the infinitely indulgent couple who let me have the
run of the place. 'I have caught a monster,' I bawled. 'You have got to come
and look at it.' They humoured me and came, and - I hope and believe - were
properly impressed by the creature's size and beauty.
I slipped it back alive into the weirpool and, with a flick of its tail, it
went off to resume terrorising the lesser species. One does not fish on
after such a triumph, so I went home, singing. The pike weighed 23 lb and
was, by half a pound, the biggest fish I have ever caught.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Gardening: That old witch hazel magic - Hampshire's Hillier
Arboretum casts a fresh spell over Robin Lane Fox
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN local authorities have a gardening budget, they usually make fools of
themselves: they put hanging baskets down old streets, chopped bark on
roundabouts, and trees at a density of five to the square metre. I am happy
to put the opposite case.
In 1977, Hampshire county council accepted responsibility for 160 acres of
trees, shrubs and mowing bequeathed to it by one of the kings among
nurserymen, HG Hillier. Nobody knew what would happen. Late in winter, you
might have expected hectares of heather and universal pansies. You would be
wrong.
I have just spent an afternoon walking around a pre-run of heaven, sustained
by council funds and a discreet balance of management. In two hours, I have
seen more flowers than I will have grown myself by mid-April.
If your spirits are low, head for Ampfield, near Romsey. In the Hillier
arboretum, camellias are open already beyond the lake; among the winter
honeysuckles, Lonicera setifera will test the experts; and you ought to be
in time for two extraordinary spectacles: a daphne from the Himalayas and
dozens of witch hazels shining like stars through the mist.
Since 1977, the council has not compromised or made the arboretum worse. It
has survived the storms and gained in height, maturity and coherence.
Harold Hillier had planned a certain amount and planted even more: like
Topsy, his arboretum just grew, and he probably did not think about the
width of a gang mower or every ultimate vista through the thujas. His
gardens had some firm, straight walks, a lovely lake, and raised beds of
gravel near the main house.
Design was only one consideration, though. The other was variety: as a
result, the garden now includes more than 100 of the champion trees in
Hampshire and over 100 listed rarities including one, a rather dismal
conifer, which is believed to be extinct in the wild.
The council's budget is well over six figures and supports 12 gardeners, a
distinguished curator, and the necessary work of clearing, inspiring and
opening up. The council can be proud of it and deserves a round of national
applause.
Hampshire head-scarves have a way of kidnapping the early places on the
arboretum's popular weekend workshops; but anyone can visit and you can
become a Friend for Pounds 10 a year. Meanwhile, visitors continue to pile
in, increasing as healthily as the birch trees.
Under the general slogan of education, the county must also reckon on quiet,
personal visits when somebody looks, thinks and decides to go away and
imitate. I sound confident about this aspect because it has happened to me
twice at this place.
Once was on a spring day three years ago when the magnolias opened all at
once and hundreds of Weekend FT readers set off to see them. The second was
the week before last when, admittedly, the arboretum committee gave me lunch
 -although I do not think the lunch was to blame.
Our tour was not a laid-back affair. It was the sort of afternoon when
angular figures in anoraks might ask if you thought a particular birch tree
was costata or ermanii and, if you were not sure, they would ask someone
else instead. There were no bimbettes, no rides on runabouts: just a covey
of gardeners and botanists, one woman in a mackintosh hat, and an inability
to stay in a bunch because our guides Roy, Chris and Tony kept finding
something more interesting about 50 yards away.
The point of the meeting was to view the collection of witch hazels and,
just to be sure, I had checked them before lunch. They are quite marvellous
and their flowers, like frost-proof strips of papery textile, ought to be
hanging on even now. The pale yellow forms have stood up best to the wet
winter and, anyway, I prefer them to the coppery reds and oranges with
bouncy, female names.
Most of this family spread widely - too widely for front gardens, when they
have to be pruned. In an arboretum, a Hamamelis can develop its full
stature. It can also show its full range, because new forms have been bred
from Belgium to America and you need to see a collection in order to
anticipate the best.
If you live on a soil without too much lime, try Hamamelis pallida, which is
an exquisite shade of lemon yellow; Sunburst, which has a tinge of green to
the lemon; or a dark yellow one called Vesna, which is remarkably scented
but has yet to make a mark in the trade. In Japan, these shrubs grow wild in
woodland clearings; and although they will survive and flower on lime, they
are much happier without it and also turn a better colour in autumn. If
money and supply were no object, I would choose Sunburst, while noticing
that Advent flowers very early and the self-explanatory Goldcrest much
later, extending the season through 2 1/2 months.
Witch hazels have nothing to do with witchcraft. Their name means flexible
or pliant and the only magic in them is their scent, which is strong on a
clear winter's day. Under council management they are a marvellous sight,
and perhaps it is enough to be able to visit them, even if you cannot grow
them. But there is something even better.
We had already admired a fine white Abeliophyllum from Korea and the
insiders were being matey with one of the under-gardeners. Turning left, I
entered another world. By a grass path stood an evergreen daphne, over 4ft
high and wide, smothered in scented flowers of a pale pink.
Sometimes, these close encounters make you want to turn a somersault. In
late winter, not far from the beastly old A31, here was a form of the
Nepalese daphne bholua, bursting in all directions with flowers of colour
and quality which I had never seen before.
There are other, rather sparse forms of this famous shrub from the Indian
continent, but this particular variety is highly personal to the arboretum.
Its parents were conveyed to Hillier by runners from the hills during a
visit to Nepal. Back in Hampshire, they set seed; and Alan Postill, a
sharp-eyed propagator on the nursery, noticed how some of the seedlings
looked better than others. He selected the best and called it Jacqueline
Postill, since when it has won many prizes including a First Class
Certificate.
Can you and I grow it? Opinions divide on its tastes and hardiness. Roy
Lancaster tells me that it needs a south or west wall, that it can be pruned
quite hard, but that it prefers little or no lime. The head gardener at the
arboretum thinks Roy might be wrong because he himself grows it on an open
slope of chalk above the centre of Winchester. Nonetheless, Roy thinks that
readers with lime in their garden should not expect miracles.
At present, I am inclined to follow the arboretum's head gardener, having
just seen a flourishing specimen on the alkaline rock garden at St John's
College in Oxford; whatever you might expect from that rock garden, it is
certainly not the sight of miracles. But daphne Jacqueline Postill is a
scarce plant at present, its price ranging between Pounds 16 and Pounds 25.
In mid-winter it is worth anything, not least a visit to Romsey.
Without the Hillier family, without Hampshire county council and without the
skill of the arboretum's staff, we would not have this extraordinary,
winter-flowering shrub for which our great-grandchildren will bless us.
Forget those grumbles about marigolds, begonias in baskets and
love-lies-bleeding on the roundabouts: in Hampshire, a council still knows
how to support the best in gardening.

examines a bill, passed by MPs this week, that could change the face of
central London

THE CENTRAL London property market faces its biggest potential change for
two centuries when the Housing and Urban Development Bill receives royal
assent in the summer. This new law will allow many leaseholders of flats to
buy their freeholds, and extends greatly the existing opportunities for a
leaseholder of a whole house to do the same.
Although the great London estates oppose the bill, it has rattled through
the House of Commons and had its third reading this week. Opposition in the
House of Lords could be strong but the Queen will have no problem assenting
as Crown property is exempt (although the exemption probably will be
waived), as are the National Trust and housing trusts.
The bill maintains the level of complexity traditional in leaseholds, with
plenty of 'grey areas' to provide work for valuation surveyors. If you, or
the group of lessees in your building, are contemplating enfranchisement
(lawspeak for becoming freeholders), you will be wise to hire one who knows
the local conditions.
Enfranchisement began with the Leasehold Reform Act 1967, which the Labour
government introduced to help Welsh miners facing eviction. 'It was a
radical change in tenant-landlord legislation,' says lawyer David Neuberger
QC. 'For the first time, A could acquire property compulsorily from B when
it was not for the public good.' Most central London houses were too
valuable to qualify, but the Housing Act 1974 raised the limits for them
following the general re-rating in 1973.
The present rules are that the property must be a house and your principal
residence for at least three years. The original lease must be 'long' (more
than 21 years), the ground rent low, and the rateable value below Pounds
1,500 - or just above that if you can show that the marginal added value
came from improvements you had made as tenant (leaseholder). These
conditions are stringent.
An alternative is for leaseholders to apply for a 50-year extension beyond
the original date of expiry. There is no capital cost for this but, when the
50 years begin, the ground rent is set at a 'modern' (meaning high) rate
with a review in 25 years, and the leaseholder loses the right to buy the
freehold. The new bill keeps this 50-year option for houses that still
qualify under the 1967/1974 rules.
For enfranchising, the bill scraps the Pounds 1,500 rateable value limit.
The new test is that when the lease began, the original ground rent must
have been two-thirds or less of the then rateable value or; for a lease
granted after April 1, 1990, the ground rent must not have been been over
Pounds 1,000. This relaxation will slowly lead to the enfranchisement of
many houses above the old rateable value limit on leases of 50 or 60 years,
granted long before the recent inflation of property prices prompted
landlords to push up ground rents. Some landlords have raised ground rents
to as much as 1.5 or 2.25 per cent of the market value, but it is now only
the initial ground rent which counts in the criteria for enfranchisement.
The bill also extends enfranchisement to flats, with further provisos. The
building must have two or more of them with at least two-thirds on long
leases. In turn, two-thirds of those must agree to enfranchisement and make
a collective application through a nominee purchaser, which might well be a
company in which they all hold shares.
If the landlord lives in the building, there is no case for enfranchisement
 -unless it is a purpose-built block (not a conversion) with more than four
flats. And if more than 10 per cent of the building is non-residential (a
shop or garage, perhaps), again there is no case.
But flat leaseholders do not have to meet the three-year main residence rule
for houses. They need only a qualifying interest in the flat, and can have
their main residence elsewhere. A business could own it.
Flats that do not qualify may be able to buy a 90-year extension of the
lease with a peppercorn ground rent at market value.
The procedure for enfranchising is this:
1. Get a valuation from a surveyor and agreement among the leaseholders.
2. Serve a Tenants' Discovery Notice (optional) on the landlord requesting
details of the freeholder and all people with a proprietary interest in the
building.
3. Serve a Tenants' Purchase Notice on the freeholder and any intermediate
landlords, as the leaseholders have to buy out all superior interests. (This
means they will, collectively and expensively, become the new freeholders
for any leaseholders in the building who do not wish to share in the
buy-out).
This notice gives the proposed price, commits the leaseholder(s) to paying
the costs of the other parties from this point, and names a date at least
two months ahead by which the freeholder must reply.
Stage 4 is the freeholder's counter-notice, which might agree with, or
dispute, some or all of the terms. If most leases are within five years of
expiring, and he can show he intends to re-develop the site (difficult for
listed buildings in conservation areas), he can invalidate the claim. If
there are non-qualifying flats or parts of the building, such as garages or
tenanted shops, he must say if he wishes to exercise a new right to a
leaseback of those parts for 999 years. If he does not, then the
leaseholders will have to pay the cost of buying out these freeholds also
and will receive the rents (This might be more than the leasholders can
afford).
Negotiation follows. If the parties disagree, the case goes to the county
court or, if about price, to the Leasehold Valuation Tribunal, with appeal
on points of law to the Lands Tribunal.
This is a simplification of a difficult law packed with exceptions to delay
or complicate proceedings, and cut-off dates which must be observed. The
freeholders will use them to the full, as they do not wish to lose their
properties.
For leaseholders, it will be a struggle, with sleepless nights and anguish.
Is this worth it? And will they in the end have the money to buy the
freehold?
The cost to the leaseholders will be the sum of the open-market value of the
freeholder's interest in the property, plus at least 50 per cent of the
'marriage value' (the increase in total value which results from
amalgamating freehold and leashold interests) plus any amounts for
'injurious affection' to recompense the freeholder for a forced sale and
costs. You can be sure that surveyors for either side will begin with
differing estimates.
Some leaseholders will fail to complete the process 'But it is no longer a
landlord's market,' says Charles Boston, of surveyor Francis Russell. He
advises potential purchasers: 'Speak to your landlord now; he might sell you
a long lease at attractive terms.' But Boston adds: 'Make sure you have good
advice in case what looks like an attractive proposition isn't'

FT  13 FEB 93 / Property: For and against - Gerald Cadogan examines a bill,
passed by MPs this week, that could change the face of central London

IS THE Housing and Urban Development bill fair? Yes, and needed badly, say
the Leasehold Enfranchisement Association (LEA) and Dudley Fishburn, the MP
for Kensington who has headed the battle for reform. They say leaseholders
pay for their houses many times over - in premiums, ground rents, management
charges, repairs and maintenance - and, at the end, are left with an
out-of-date lease while the landowner gets the rise in value.
London's large estate-owners, who do not wish their holdings broken up,
disagree. They say they have looked after the estates for centuries and
claim it is unfair for the law to intervene in a contract into which willing
partners have entered freely.
The estates are unique, long-term family investments. In 1677, Sir Thomas
Grosvenor married 12-year-old Mary Davies, heiress to the manor of Ebury
which stretched from the river Thames to Oxford Street. Some 300 acres of
it, in Mayfair and Belgravia, are still owned by the Duke of Westminster's
Grosvenor Estate Holdings. (The Pimlico section was sold in 1950, one reason
being the embarrassment of the then duke when cited as landlord in many
brothel-keeping cases). Its asset value of Pounds 3.7bn made it equivalent
last year to the eighth-largest quoted UK company, says the LEA's report on
The Great London Estates.
The Cadogan estate stems from the marriage in 1717 of Charles Cadogan to the
daughter of Sir Hans Sloane, founder of the British Museum, who had bought
the manor of Chelsea in 1712. Other estates include Portman, Bedford, Howard
de Walden, the Church Commissioners, Phillimore, Eyre, Ilchester, the Crown
and Henry Smith's Charity, the trustees of which bought 84 acres in
Kensington, west London, soon after he died in 1628 'for the use of the poor
captives being slaves under the Turkish pirates' and for his poor relations.
Boom time came in the late 18th and 19th centuries as London spread into the
surrounding villages and farmland. The landowners gave speculative builders
like James Burton and Thomas Cubitt leases to put up houses, but did not
relinquish the land. So the system began. The builders paid for the houses.
Their clients bought and maintained them and paid ground rent to the estate,
which took them back after 99 years when the leases ran out.
The bias towards the families that owned the ground was tolerable while
property values stayed stable, as they did until the early 1960s. But the
price explosion changed the game. Reversions had great value. Leases of
50-60 years let the landowner (as in Monopoly) pass 'Go' and collect twice
as often, and ground rents turned 'modern' and expensive. The old were
affected worst; they have dreaded outliving their leases and being thrown on
to the street.
Joan South, campaign co-ordinator of the LEA, claims the estates have
inflexible attitudes which are conditioned by the great security they have
had and by the conservative training of their surveyors. She adds that, with
less complacency and more consideration by the estates matters would never
have polarised.
Diminishing leases are not such a problem. Research by the Consumers'
Association and the Joseph Rowntree Trust found that 97 per cent of flat
leases had an unexpired term over 60 years (the crucial factor for lending
by building societies) and two-thirds had more than 90 years. On the Cadogan
estate, long leases for flats were rare until the 1965 Rent Act controlling
rents severely hurt the market.
Lord Chelsea - son of Lord Cadogan - and Stuart Corbyn, chief executive of
the Cadogan estate, note that, under present rules, people tend to
enfranchise when they are thinking of selling on. Lord Chelsea says:
'Enfranchisement gives a number of lessees now a chance to benefit but does
nothing to solve the housing problem.' While the rules on price imply
willing buyers and sellers, he says: 'We are not willing sellers.' He says
London will suffer. 'The planning laws do not go so far as we do. There will
be more plastic windows and a satellite dish on every building. This is the
end of the family estate.'
The bill will be a piecemeal end to an impasse of attitudes, but the
legislation was in the Tory election manifesto - a new form of privatisation
to share out the spoils from the property boom. One thing is certain:
applying it will be a bonanza for lawyers and surveyors.
Next week: The look of London; the bill and the market; flatholders unite.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Travel: Intimacy and grandeur - London feels like
civilisation itself, a maze of divergent and overlapping threads / The FT
guide to Civilised Breaks
</HEADLINE>

THERE ARE many Londons. When I was a boy in the country, I craved London's
theatre, shops and famous sights. When I lived in New York, I missed
strolling in London's parks and residential streets. When members of my
farming family come to town for the day, I take them to an exhibition or
gallery, a little shopping, lunch, and then a matinee.
You choose your own London. Some visitors know that London is still the
theatre world's capital, and they pack in as many shows as they can. Other
visitors come to London solely for its classical music. And though London
may not be the painting capital of the world, it keeps a gallery-goer busy.
If you choose a cross-section of Londons, you take in not just the Londons
you were looking for, but also the larger London that threads them together.
London feels much more amorphous than Paris or New York. It can take much
longer to get around; it has been assembled, merged, reconstructed over the
centuries; it is diffuse. And that is its pleasure. London does not feel
like the product of one particular phase of civilisation - it feels like
civilisation itself, a maze of divergent and overlapping threads, with noise
and calm in alternation.
Here is my recipe for a weekend: Start late Friday afternoon, end late
Sunday afternoon. First, a few rules:
1) Fit in a minimum of two plays (or operas, ballets, musicals) - one light,
one serious, or one modern and one classic. Right now the West End has a
number of first-rate offerings: Peter Hall's staging of Wilde's An Ideal
Husband (Globe); Pinter's haunting No Man's Land (Comedy); Robert Lindsay in
Cyrano de Bergerac (Haymarket); Giles Havergal's brilliant staging of Graham
Greene's Travels With My Aunt (Wyndham's) and The Rise and Fall of Little
Voice (Aldwych).
If I do not recommend the National's Carousel or the RSC's Hamlet, it is
only because they are sold out. But any weekender in London should already
have checked what's on, not only at the National and RSC but also at Covent
Garden and at the English National Opera. Several of ENO's productions are
among London's finest. But be warned: the Coliseum's acoustics are only
reliable in the balcony or the stalls; not all voices carry well into the
two middle circles.
2) Fit in at least two galleries during the weekend. There is no point in
spending more than two hours at a time in one; your head gets congested. But
London's galleries are seldom crowded, and their range is great.
3) Walk (weather and health permitting) as much as possible. London is not
one of those cities, such as Paris, that can be taken in almost entirely on
foot, but it rewards as much pedestrianism as possible. And walk through at
least one London park.
4) Do not spend too much time on big meals. You can eat well in London but
it is easier to find poor restaurants in London than in most big cities.
Food is not the reason to be here - unlike, say, Brussels, where meals
should be prolonged.
Friday evening: Drink and/or light pre-performance snack at Cafe Pelican (St
Martin's Lane), deliberately French, beautifully coloured and very
convenient for most theatres. After the performance, a meal in the West End.
The traditional theatre-goers' haunt is the noisy Joe Allen's, where actors
and dancers also dine, but you need to book in advance, and things are not
much fun unless your table is well placed. (Lunch is quieter and easier).
More reliable are Chez Gerard (branches in Dover St, Charlotte St, Chancery
Lane), Bertorelli's (Floral St, Covent Garden), Cafe Fish (Panton St,
Haymarket) or Plummers (King Street, Covent Garden). You can have three
courses plus wine at most of these for well under Pounds 25, and a lighter
meal much more cheaply.
Saturday: If you can afford it, and can obtain a window view, try breakfast
at the Savoy, or anywhere with a view over the Thames. Gallery-goers should
then walk one block east to Somerset House - worth a look in itself - to see
the Courtauld Institute. True, the paintings are not well-lit, but the
collection, impressionist and post-impressionist, is first-rate.
Now for an obvious but uncrowded tourist path along the riverbank, for the
views. Cross Waterloo Bridge, walk along the South Bank to Westminster
Bridge and cross back to inspect the Houses of Parliament. Those with a
taste for monuments should make a slight detour to visit Westminster Abbey,
and/or Rodin's Burghers of Calais statue nearby.
Next, take a taxi or bus to the Tate Gallery (open 10am-5.50pm; Sunday
2pm-5.50pm), and head straight for the Turners in the Clore Gallery. There
are too many of these for the space, and at first they can look like too
much of the same thing. But try a few and you will find that you see light,
and London, differently. Both the cafe (good) and restaurant (excellent) are
recommended for lunch.
After lunch, zoom as fast or slowly as you feel inclined through the Tate's
modern art. You are bound to hate some of it, but its presence here reminds
you that London is not just a city that happened in other centuries. And the
Tate's pre-20th galleries give you, among other things, a sense of the
historic continuity of England: Hogarth, Gainsborough, Blake, Constable. As
you leave, there is the surprise of finding that the Thames looks different
from when you entered.
If you need to shop, head straight to Knightsbridge, Chelsea or Kensington.
(Only masochists hit Oxford Street on a Saturday.) If energy and weather
permit, you could carry on walking, through the squares and streets of
Pimlico to Chelsea, possibly via Belgravia. Apart from the incidental fun of
the different shops and pubs you pass, there is the larger pleasure of
sensing London's rapid switches of scale, between village intimacy and
grandeur, between ambassadorial formality and Bohemian ease.
Then jump into a taxi, or on to a 19 or 22 bus, and return to the West End
in time for the most controversial part of the day - tea. Whose tea is best?
My friend Clare prefers the Ritz or the Dorchester; I plump for Brown's. We
cannot agree. But upstairs at Fortnum's is cheaper (men do not have to wear
ties), and simpler altogether is the cafe at the Royal Academy. After tea
there is time to rest, and prepare for the theatre.
For dinner after the show, see Friday - or splash out on somewhere more
remarkable from The Good Food Guide. Since you have worked up an appetite by
now, try Bibendum (Fulham Rd). The Michelin windows, the spaciousness of the
restaurant floor and the calm good service are all particular pleasures.
Then there is the food, rich and exquisite. A full meal with wine may well
cost about Pounds 60 per head.
Sunday: If the day is fair, you can venture on to the river. The river bus
stops at regular intervals, and you can take it up to Hampton Court or down
to Greenwich. Or, if you take Sunday as the Lord's day, try morning service
at St Bride's, Fleet Street, with its memorable intimacy and choir.
If the day is greyer, you can spend it walking. London is not quite the
ghost-town it used to be on Sundays and crowd-lovers should hurry to the
Trocadero in Piccadilly, or to the Covent Garden or Camden Town markets.
But Sunday is still much London's quietest day, and the morning is a good
time to take in the bare bones of the city. From Parliament Square walk
north-north-east to St James's Park. (A slightly longer, terribly obvious
but fairly irresistible tourist route is via Whitehall). When in view of
Buckingham Place, head north-east, over the Mall, and thread through the
streets of St James's, a district which gives you a taste of London's
overlapping centuries. Now head east up Pall Mall and thus to Trafalgar
Square.
Whether the National Gallery's Sainsbury Wing is a stylish or anodyne piece
of architecture is a question you can ponder over lunch later. But seldom
will you find a space in which paintings are presented, spaced and lit to
better advantage than in the Renaissance wing upstairs. One small room has
one painting per wall; three of them are by Pero della Francesca.
Traditional English cuisine is rare anywhere, but for Sunday lunch and a
change of scene, try Kensington. Maggie Jones's (6 Old Court Place, off
Kensington Church Street) does a trad three-course Sunday lunch. Afterwards,
and after taking in a bit of Church Street, walk around and across Hyde
Park. Possible highlights here include Kensington Gardens, the swings near
Marlborough Gate, the Serpentine and Speakers' Corner.
Then walk in a north-easterly direction to Manchester Square and the Wallace
Collection. (Open 2pm-5pm; other days from 10am). If you have a taste for
18th or 19th century paintings (and much more), you know about this anyway.
If you have not, the gallery itself, with its furniture and staircases and
rooms, gives you a scent of bygone aristocratic eras. Life simply is not the
same after you have seen a Sevres frying-pan.
If there is serious rain you can spend more time in the galleries. In the
afternoon, you can further investigate the best-tea debate (see Saturday).
Or, for another change of scene and a taste of sheer whimsy, there is, from
3.30pm-6pm (Sunday or Saturday), the dansant at the Waldorf. Some of the
older couples come in ill-advised 1920s outfits, and - yes - some of them
should never tango. Sooner or later, however, if only for a shuffling
foxtrot, you will find yourself on the dance-floor too. After that, you are
no longer a spectator of London, but a participant.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Travel: Roll up (and wrap-up) for Nudo Matsuri - Christopher
McCooey sees a turbulent shinto festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER McCOOEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS mid-February and the temperature is barely above freezing. The crowds
lining the approach to the Shinto shrine at Konomiya, in Aichi prefecture in
central Japan, are muffled against the cold wind.
Wearing down-filled ski-jackets, everyone presses together for warmth, like
penguins resisting the cold. From an indistinct murmuring a pattern of sound
emerges, a chant growing in urgency as the first group of 100 naked men come
into view just before noon.
In all, more than 8,000 men and boys will make their way to the shrine
during the afternoon to await the climax of the festival which comes just
before dusk when the shinotoko (god-man) appears. The shinotoko is
completely naked while the others wear fundoshi - cotton loin cloths passed
between the legs and wound round their stomachs, a flap of which serves as a
convenient pouch for cigarettes.
On their feet they wear tabi - white socks split between the big toe and the
other toes and fastened on the inner side of the ankle by small metal
clasps. Tied around their heads are colourful bands which identify each to
his particular group or village.
For many, to participate is an act of bravura; for others, especially those
around the mid-life-crisis age, it is a necessary act of ritual
purification. For this festival to have continued since an edict by the
Empress Shotoku in 767 AD is testimony to the Japanese sense of continuity
and a need to retain a link with the indigenous religion of Shinto.
Despite Japan's apparent wholesale acceptance of western ways, most of its
local festivals remain uniquely Japanese, and the participants - salarymen,
housewives and children - relish the opportunity to dress up in traditional
clothes (or dress down to fundoshi as the case may be), to drink sake freely
and to revel in the long cultural pageant that is Japanese history.
The date of the festival is determined by reference to the old lunar
calendar which Japan adopted from China in 604 AD. This calendar was used,
with small modification, until 1872. Because the months were strictly lunar
in the Chinese calendar, the beginning of the year varied between January 20
and February 19, according to when the sun entered the sign of the fish.
The Shinto priests at Konomiya always fix the festival for the 13th day of
the first lunar month of the year, so the date varies between February 1 and
March 3, usually the coldest period in the Japanese winter. The Japanese
word for 'four' is shi, which also means 'death,' and they believe that the
most dangerous age is 41, called honyaku, and that you must be on your guard
against misfortune at this time.
The festival attracts many in the age range 39-41. They participate as a
kind of insurance policy based more on superstition than strong religious
conviction. Those who take part are not guaranteed freedom from misfortune -
each year the police arrest some who have drunk too much, and the ambulance
is always called to take away those suffering from exposure or with broken
bones.
In the 1970s a 20-year-old girl spectator was trampled and suffocated to
death by the frenzied throng. Since that incident police crowd control has
been much stricter. Even the shinotoko is not immune. A doctor friend of
mine told me, with some amusement, that the god-man of 1980 was treated a
few months later by a colleague - for tuberculosis.
The priests begin preparing for the festival on the second day of the year
(according to the old calendar). The shrine is cleaned and tidied and the
shinotoko is chosen from a number of volunteers. Formerly, an itinerant
visitor to the town was chosen as he would leave the district in due course
and take the community's ill-luck with him.
Today, selection is by omi-kuji (numbered sticks) and volunteers are usually
in the age group 24-26. Volunteers of other ages may apply, but because of
the physical hardship - the exposure to cold and the buffeting by
participants - strong and healthy men are preferred.
On the 11th day of the new year, the head priest makes naoi mochi. Steamed
rice is pounded and a cake (mochi) is made from the glutinous dough. This
cake plays an important part in the festival proceedings but it differs from
the traditional rice cakes made at New Year in that ash from burnt peach and
willow branches is mixed in with it, and the cake is destined to be buried,
not eaten.
Naoi is the official name of the festival and is a proper name, but in
recent years the Japanese have taken to using the English word 'nude,' so
the event is popularly known as the Nudo Matsuri (Naked Festival).
After preparing the naoi mochi, a special building is constructed on the
night of the 12th for the main god of the shrine to reside in as the climax
of the festival approaches. The shinotoko-designate stays in the shrine
overnight and receives instruction from the priest. All of his hair (head
and body) is shaved and he composes himself for the rigours of the morrow.
From early on the morning of the festival people start arriving from the
surrounding districts. More than 600 stalls have appeared in the streets
leading to the shrine and the chill air is redolent with soy and sake, the
sizzle of barbecued squid and the slurp of noodles.
Around 250,000 visitors are expected during the day and the shrine itself
has an extra 200 workers selling charms and talismen. If nothing else, the
festival is big business.
The roofs of buildings near the shrine have been converted to makeshift
stands and seat places are sold for Pounds 10-Pounds 15. Many are taken by
amateur photographers who want a good view and some kind of protection for
their expensive equipment.
In the afternoon, groups of naked men and boys (some as young as five, and
carried on shoulders for safety) present themselves in front of the main
shrine building. They pass to the priests a talisman that they have brought
from their own district for blessing. Usually this is a freshly-cut bamboo
pole tied with bright pieces of cloth. In return for the talisman the Shinto
priests give benediction by waving green fronds of bamboo above the heads of
the crowd. By late afternoon all groups have gathered in front of the shrine
and tension rises as the emergence of the shinotoko draws near.
When he does appear, surrounded by his protectors, all hell breaks loose as
everyone struggles to touch him. The excitement borders on frenzy as the
protectors do their best to steer him in reasonable safety through the mob.
All this time about a dozen men with wooden pails repeatedly throw ice-cold
water over the writhing limbs and torsos from which come cries and
incredible amounts of steam. The tide of bodies sweeps the shinotoko
backwards and forwards. After about 30 minutes his bodyguards endeavour to
return him through the gates of the shrine; in less than an hour he is back
in the safety of the inner sanctuary. For the participants, many numb and
blue with cold, their tabi filthy and torn, their fundoshi soaked, the
festival is over. Hugging themselves for warmth, they quickly make their way
home.
For the shinotoko, however, the most important part of the festival is
approaching, and he must remain in the shrine for another night. He
represents the tip of the pyramid of the transference of ill-luck. The
participating men brought their family's and community's potential for
misfortune with them to the shrine. In touching the shinotoko this was
transfered to him and he takes it all upon himself back into the shrine.
Once inside, all this misfortune is transferred from the shinotoko to the
naoi mochi and, at 3am, the final drama is enacted.
The head priest hands the naoi mochi to the shinotoko who runs three times
round the main building. Then he is driven out of the shrine with branches
of peach and willow which are thrown after him.
The shinotoko flees and runs past another shrine in the neighbourhood where
he throws away the rice cake. The head priest of this shrine collects it and
secretly buries it so that all the misfortune and ill-luck is finally
removed and the festival of purification is completed for another year.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Motoring: The Audi 80 Estate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUDI 80 Estate, newly-arrived in Britain, is at the other end of the
scale from the big people-carriers. Audi has a hang-up about estate cars. So
does BMW, which refuses to use the term for its five-door 3-Series and
5-Series Touring models, although that is what they are. The 80 Estate, Audi
says, is designed to fit between a saloon and a 'traditionally functional' -
for which read practical and boring - estate car.
The 80 Estate is most enjoyable to drive with excellent handling, light
controls and a feel of quality. A compact 4/5-seater, it comes with front or
four-wheel drive. Engines range from a super-economical 1.9-litre,
direct-injection turbo-diesel to a multi-valve, five-cylinder, turbo-charged
2.2-litre.
My test 80TDI (Pounds 16,955) combined refinement with all the performance
you could reasonably require and offered potential 50 mpg (5.65 l/100km)
fuel economy.
As for the Pounds 30,495, four-wheel driven S2 Estate above, think of it as
the original Quattro turbo coupe reborn with smoother styling and bulk
carrying capacity.

FT  13 FEB 93 / As They Say in Europe: Language of diplomacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS USUAL last Saturday, French radio stations carried extensive accounts of
the day's rugby internationals. There was also the regular phone-in and,
once again, I was impressed with the expertise and sense of le fair-play
exhibited by commentators, fans and rugbymen. Then, on France-Inter, there
was another phone-in. It was about the Ecu, monetary union, and speculation
against the franc,
In all such programmes, there are three groups of callers: buffoons,
paranoiacs, and those occasional rational, fair-minded people who agree with
me. This occasion was dominated by those who believed the US and its satrap,
Japan, were plotting against the European Community.
The Americans were leading a speculative attack on the franc to destroy the
EC. They were jealous of the dollar's global role and would stop at nothing
to prevent the Ecu's eventual take-over. They were helped by the English,
because the City of London had built its prosperity on speculation and could
not afford to let a whole lot of speculative opportunities - ie, numerous
European currencies - disappear. So, they were picking on them one by one to
break up the European monetary system and destroy all prospects of monetary
union.
Listeners were invited to phone in and record their vote, for or against
monetary union. About 1,500 did so and they split 81-19 per cent in favour.
What was extraordinary about that hour as I sat, captivated, by French radio
stations was that a rugby match should be treated with total objectivity,
credit being given where credit was due, while intricate questions of
international monetary policy should generate deep passion, xenophobia and,
of course, paranoia.
The immediate inspiration for this outbreak was the view enunciated by a
right-wing politician and former prime minister, Raymond Barre, who had
described the assaults on the franc as speculation contre l'Europe. A
foreign exchange dealer on the studio panel pointed out that there had been
only 'speculation for Europe' before the Danes voted No last June.
There is one sure way of knowing when a French politician is talking through
his hat - translate what he says into English. 'Speculation against Britain'
is the kind of phrase that nobody in the UK could get away with - British
politicians have to use other techniques to obfuscate and conceal lack of
thought.
Anybody who doubts this principle should stand outside the Lycee francais in
South Kensington and check which language the bilingual pupils use when they
emerge. If they wish to communicate vital information rapidly, they speak
English. ('Cor] Did you see Jean-Claude Pineau de Charente smash Claude-Remy
Martin de St Emilion's teef in] You should of. It were ace').
If they wish to indulge in sophistry and deceive, French will be the natural
choice. ('Tu sais, mon vieux, sans Eric Cantona l'equipe de Manchester
United aurait etait massacree meme par Stockport County'). This explains why
British politicians sound better in, say, Le Monde than in The Sun.
But I digress. It is apparent that the outburst of French Euro-fanaticism is
associated with greater hostility towards the neighbour across the Channel:
differences grow more acute. Is it not, for instance, strange that as the
franc strengthens and grows more reliable as a store of value, the more the
French wish to do away with it, while British loyalty to the rotten pound
grows as the currency declines?
Presumably, this is because of the new orthodoxy which holds that the main
foundation for a strong economy is a weak currency. The attempt to put this
policy into effect is seen as sabotage in France and has aggravated what one
might call the Hoover syndrome.
I had intended not to get involved in this matter, but 'social dumping'
might well turn out to be one of those phrases that will echo down the
weeks, like 'the end of history.' The move of Hoover's plant from Dijon to
Glasgow has become a symbol of almost everything. Le Figaro saw it as a
reflection of the 'third-worldisation' of parts of Britain and evidence of
the miserable plight of Scottish wage-earners. When the Lion chocolate bar
factory moved in precisely the reverse direction, that was merely a normal
commercial decision.
It was still strange that the prime minister, John Major, decided to see the
Hoover move as a vindication of his rejection of the social chapter of the
Maastricht treaty. This has played into the hands of his French critics, who
have to find what has been impossible up to now: a translation for 'level
playing field.' Hang around the lycee in South Ken and something will turn
up.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Motoring: Where are the big family estate cars?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT KIND of car do you buy if you have a large family? The fashionable
solution is a multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) like the Nissan Serena I wrote
about last week.
There is no doubt that MPVs have a lot going for them as people-carriers.
One version of the Serena - and the larger Toyota Previa - takes up to
eight. A Renault Espace or a Mitsubishi Space Wagon seats up to seven. But
there is a snag. Where does the luggage go when an MPV is carrying its full
quota of people?
The answer: mostly on the floor or a roof rack. Not even the Previa has more
than a modest amount of proper luggage room when all eight of its seats are
filled. And the spare pair that make an Espace or Space Wagon  - or 4 x 4s
like the Land Rover Discovery - into a 6/7-seater take up what is normally
the load space.
With one exception, the handful of conventionally-shaped 6/7-seat estate
cars are no better. Rover Montego, Mercedes-Benz 200-300 and Volvo 940
estates become seven-seaters only when their rear-facing occasional seats
for children are pulled up from the load compartment floor.
Friends of mine who had five young daughters and a holiday home in France
side-stepped the problem neatly. They bought a pair of Renault 4s and split
the girls between them. There was plenty of room for luggage in two boots.
An alternative could have been one of the genuine family estate cars that
were a French speciality. For years, Peugeot and Citroen made stretched,
seven-seat versions of their biggest estate cars, the 405 and 505, DS and
CX. Because they were longer in body and wheelbase, they had room for three
rows of face-forward seats plus a fair amount of luggage.
Sadly for parents of large families, they are not made any more. Last to go
was the Peugeot 505 familiale, a gentle giant of a car. Even with seven on
board, it had a load floor 29in deep and 51in wide (72cm x127cm) behind the
third row of seats. This bench was habitable by adults and plenty big enough
for two children to be comfortable on a journey. With middle and rear rows
of seats folded flat, the familiale had a load floor 83in (207cm) long. They
come larger only in vans.
So, where are the family estates today? Gone but not forgotten, so far as
Peugeot and Citroen are concerned. The 505 lived on for a time after the 605
appeared, but is no longer made. Peugeot says there will never be a
605-based estate car. Citroen denies any intention of adding a stretched
familiale estate, with three rows of forward-facing seats, to its XM range.
The only one of the breed still surviving - although, I fear, not for much
longer - is the Renault Savanna. It is not as big as the 505 and CX but at
least it allows parents to carry four offspring, fastened safely in child
seats and facing forward, plus some luggage.
The Savanna (Nevada on mainland Europe) with up to seven seats is listed at
between Pounds 11,810 and Pounds 12,770. You can pay more than that for a
low-mileage, H- or J-registered Peugeot 505 2.5 GRD familiale in mint
condition if you are lucky enough to find one. Its Citroen counterpart, the
CX22 RS, will be much cheaper (around Pounds 4,000) but older;
G-registration models were the last to be sold in Britain.

FT  13 FEB 93 / A very slow bamboo boat from China . . .: Columbus? A mere
new boy in America, or so Tim Coone hears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WERE the first civilised discoverers of America Chinese mariners, ordered by
their emperor to cross the Pacific on bamboo rafts more than 2,000 years
ago?
This question, which has puzzled archaeologists and anthropologists for
decades, is to be put to a daring test by Tim Severin, the explorer and
travel writer. In May, he plans to sail eastwards on a flimsy raft similar
to that used by those Chinese sailors to show that they could have completed
the 6,000 mile voyage to America.
The idea that the ancient Chinese exported some of their developed culture
to the Americas is strongly supported by Professor Joseph Needham, the
eminent orientalist and historian.
Modern archaeological techniques, such as radiocarbon dating, have
established that the first real 'discoverers' of the continent, were Stone
Age hunter-gatherers from Asia who crossed the Bering Strait around 12,000
to 15,000 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age, when sea-levels were
much lower than today.
These then dispersed throughout North and South America. As the world's
climate warmed and sea levels rose, contact was broken. There the agreement
on the cultural evolution of the AmerIndians ends.
Academic debate now centres around two antagonistic groups. The first,
dubbed the 'transoceanic culture diffusionists', claims that the many
similarities that have been observed between Asiatic and AmerIndian cultures
are the result of subsequent maritime contact between the two continents.
The second group, which believes in 'independent development' claims that
the similarities are coincidental, and the culture, science and technology
of the Americas developed independently . These achievements include the
highly accurate Mayan calendar and their pictographic scripts, impressive
stone temples demonstrating sophisticated geometric and engineering skills,
the cultivation of maize and cotton, and ornate metalworking of gold and
silver.
Severin's 'China Voyage' as it is to be called, will challenge the
'independent developmentalists' viewpoint. His voyage across the Pacific
ocean from Hong Kong to Mexico, will be aboard a specially built 60-foot
bamboo raft which is a replica of the sailing craft used by Chinese
fishermen and mariners 2000 years ago.
Taking the east-going Kuroshio current across the north Pacific, which was
used by the Spanish galleons in the 16th century, his aim is to follow the
probable route of an expedition of 3,000 Asian mariners of the Ch'in dynasty
in 218 BC, who are recorded as having been despatched by their emperor to
find a land across the ocean. There they believed a drug which would give
long life could be found. Severin believes they may have succeeded although
they never returned.
Severin, aged 52, is no novice to such expeditions. His Brendan Voyage in a
leather-hulled boat across the Atlantic in 1976, tracing the probable course
of an eighth century Irish monk, was followed by further voyages in replica
ancient boats; first in the Black Sea to trace the journey of Jason and the
Argonauts, in the Mediterranean following Ulysses' 'Odyssey', in the China
Sea after Sinbad the sailor, as well as two horseback treks - one following
a Crusade route and another through Mongolia on the trail of Genghis Khan.
The raft for the China Voyage has been designed by Colin Mudie, who worked
on three other replica craft for Severin's previous expeditions. It is being
built at Sam S'on on the Gulf of Tonkin in Vietnam, the only place in the
world says Severin, where such vessels are still in use.
A precursor of the later Chinese junks, the raft consists of three layers of
bamboo lashed together with rattan string and bamboo skin. Two small cabins,
which will be 'home' to the five-man crew for the six-month voyage, are made
of plaited bamboo strips sealed with a mixture of sawdust and tree lacquer.
It is powered by three Chinese battened lugsails set on bamboo masts and
steered by an arrangement of rudders and centreboards. When fully-laden, the
deck will be only a foot above sea-level.
The crafts's seaworthiness is based on a 'wash-through' principle, allowing
it to absorb the power of heavy seas by letting waves percolate through the
fabric of the hull. Severin says that prolonged exposure to the elements
will be a major problem for the five-man crew. Other perils they may have to
face are fog and typhoons. He said 'previous attempts to reconstruct voyages
in bamboo rafts have never gone so far without sinking, breaking up or being
eaten up by shipworm'.
However, Severin is no stranger to hardship. He braved storms, killer whales
and pack ice in the north Atlantic in a small leather-hulled curragh during
the Brendan voyage. He was surrounded by sharks and becalmed in the Doldrums
on his Sinbad voyage.
The China Voyage will have the benefit of modern navigational aids,
liferafts, radio, and warm clothing unlike the ancient Chinese mariners.
'Anything that will enhance safety will be aboard, but will only be used as
backups. We shall be eating similar foods to those used then and be using
replicas of early Chinese compasses and star-angle measuring devices to
navigate'.
So what drives this slightly-built Englishman who settled happily in a small
village in the west of Ireland 20 years ago, to continue undertaking such
risky expeditions?
He says: 'I enjoy doing them. It is as simple as that. It is an intellectual
challenge rather than a physical one. I hope this voyage, like the other
ones, will demonstrate that the technology existed then to enable travel
from one side of the ocean to the other'.
As with the Thor Heyerdahl's Kon Tiki expeditions, and his own previous
adventures, Severin recognises that a successful conclusion of the China
voyage will not necessarily prove that maritime contact across the oceans
was achieved in pre-Christian times.
'What it will do is symbolise that various voyages could have taken place.
We are focussing on one that was recorded as having set off in the Annals of
China, although nothing was ever heard of them again.'
'What those mariners would have carried with them, are not so much
archaeological artefacts that would have survived through time but their
intellectual baggage - their knowledge of calendars and astronomy, their
writing and art, and their building skills. These could have been passed on
and survived if they reached their destination,' he said. Severin hopes to
make his own landfall in the New World in October.

FT  13 FEB 93 / One wall that still stands: Jimmy Burns visits a symbol of
hope in troubled Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALBERT HUNTER, supervisor of the Spring community farm in west Belfast,
stands in the driving Northern Ireland rain, feeding a rejected newly-born
lamb from a bottle. 'This site is no good, the mud builds up, and then the
animals just sink,' he says. Around him the small farm of peacocks, peahens,
pigs, bullocks and sheep seems at odds with the desolate urban landscape.
Drainage may be the most immediate problem but it is not the most serious
for Hunter, a former shipyard worker, and his staff of six young unemployed
men working on the farm as part of ACE (Action for Community Employment) the
government-assisted scheme for the long-term unemployed.
The farm stands on a piece of bombed-out waste land between two deeply
divided Belfast communities: to the west, the Roman Catholic Ballymurphy
estate, to the east, the protestant Springmarket estate. It was set up in
the mid-1970s with government money in an attempt to reconcile the
communities. The site picked for early residents Louis the pig and Barney
the bullock was one of several groups of houses burnt down during sectarian
rioting.
Hunter himself has suffered as much as anybody from the social consequences
of Ulster's 'Troubles'. A 37-year-old Protestant, he remembers a peaceful
childhood on the Ballymurphy estate, but as an adult he was forced to move
house to the Protestant enclave of Springmarket. He came to work on the farm
after being made redundant.
'People have asked for this fence to be built to keep each other out,' he
says, surveying the Ballymurphy estate beyond it. The fence and nearby walls
 -bricks and concrete topped by a steel palisade - are among several so
called 'peace lines' which zig-zag through the working-class areas of
Belfast.
While other walls in Europe have been taken down, the one by the farm has
been built up over the last year. It was reinforced after a Protestant
loyalist terrorist walked round the farm's perimeter fencing, into the
Catholic area, and shot a 14-year-old schoolboy.
At the begining of the decade, it was widely assumed that such barriers
would come down in Northern Ireland as they seemed to be doing in Germany
and Eastern Europe. However, more recently a more tragic process of osmosis
has taken place: Yugoslavia and Northern Ireland have grown to reflect each
other.
In its bloody dissolution, Yugoslavia has revealed the underlying divisions
that have sprung from religion, territorial dispossession, and the burden of
history. These are familiar themes on Ulster's political landscape. While
some community-based groups and church figures do reach out across the
political divide in a spirit of reconciliation, the continuing violence of
the paramilitary gangs - and the unreconstructed rhetoric of some
politicians - springs from old fears, old antagonisms.
Against such a background it is not surprising that the farm has not
developed into the universal playground it was meant to be. But it has been
become a symbol of frustrated hope in the midst of Northern Ireland's
seemingly insoluble divisions, as poignant as the television images of
correspondents in Yugoslavia trying to make sense of the latest exchange of
sniper fire.
'No one has been shot on this farm and we are visited by Catholic and
Protestant school children,' says Hunter. 'But the Catholics come in their
buses, and the Protestants in theirs. They stay here for ten minutes, then
they go back into their estates.'
Staff at the farm are provided by the local office running the community
employment programme, which provides grant-assisted part-time jobs at
minimum rates for mainly young people who would otherwise be on unemployment
benefit. The area has an unemployment rate of above 50 per cent.
The local manager is Jackie Hewitt, a Protestant ex-trade unionist who has
spent most of his working life commited to community work. He plans to move
the farm to a better-drained area by the summer. But, like Hunter, he does
not under-estimate the problems of building a more effective bridge across
the sectarian divide. 'We are trying to reach out to the fringes of our
community, but we don't fool ourselves that Protestants and Catholics are
going to suddenly live together . . . Reconciliation in Northern Ireland is
not easy.'

FT  13 FEB 93 / Food &amp; Drink (The Flavours of Switzerland): Schnapps, to
take-away
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO MEN in caps, wellington boots and working clothes stand half-way up a
Swiss hillside admiring a Heath Robinson contraption of large proportions.
An assortment of bins and barrels and pipes throbs gently in the autumn
sunshine beside the vineyards at Chardonne in the Vaud canton, halfway
between Lausanne and Montreux.
It certainly does not look like a place where a precious commodity is
manufactured. But it is. Monsieur Raymond Perroud, 25 years a distiller, is
turning out fruit schnapps.
To a tourist in Switzerland he presents an astonishing sight with his
rickety-looking still perched on the edge of the road, but to the locals he
is as familiar as gnomes in Zurich. He charges SFr4.60 a litre for
distilling cherries into a clear liquid 60 degrees proof that makes your
eyes water and your knees wobble.
Perroud spends about six months on the road and between times is based at
home where anyone can bring their fruit to him for distillation.
Perroud is proud of his still - 'it cost me SFr150,000' - but like
everything in Switzerland it is regulated down to the last cherry pip.
Bureaucrats regularly check on him to ensure that correct standards are
maintained. Unlicensed stills are illegal in Switzerland, so 'home-made'
schnapps is made by local licensed distillers such as Perroud. Locals take
their fruit to such peripatetic distillers and later collect their bounty in
the form of fully distilled schnapps.
What a pity we cannot obtain a similar service in the UK, especially given
the annual glut of soft fruit, pears and apples. Roadside schnapps
distilling - now that is a service industry.
But, for the visitor, 'home-made' schnapps is difficult to obtain. You will
have to plead with Swiss friends for a bottle of the fiery, fruity liquid.
Alternatively, the Swiss Wine Growers Association, 4 av. Avant-Poste, Case
Postale 1346, CH-10001, Lausanne, can provide you with a list of spirit
exporters who can supply good branded schnapps such as Morvand.
Delicatessens, such as Manuel in the Place St Francois, Lausanne, also stock
a variety of fruit schnapps as do other good food shops in Switzerland.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Food &amp; Drink (The Flavours of Switzerland): The great autumn
mushroom hunt - Nicholas Woodsworth enjoys eating game and finding one of
the prizes of the forest, the steinpilz, in the Bernese Oberland, where old
customs die hard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BAD WEATHER, as every alpine mountaineer knows, can come out of the blue
with astonishing speed. I am not a mountaineer, and when on a crisp autumn
morning I looked out of the window and saw the Eiger, Monch and Jungfrau
rearing brilliant white against a clear sky I set off without so much as an
umbrella or a moment's thought.
Set in some of the most dramatic mountain scenery in Europe, the Bernese
Oberland is a renowned tourist destination - restaurants and hotels here
have been providing polished Swiss hospitality to foreign visitors for more
than 150 years.
But Oberlanders are not just members of a cosmopolitan service industry  -
like mountain people everywhere, they remain strongly attached to old
customs and to the land. Leave the sophisticated resort towns behind, get
just a few yards off the beaten track, and you can find yourself led into a
world of mountain traditions as old as man's instinct for hunting and
gathering.
I was, and I blame it on mushrooms. I had set off for the narrow, steeply
sloping valley of the Lauterbrunnen, a spectacular place of cliffs and dark
pine forests, high, thin waterfalls and jagged peaks, for a closer look at
the looming 11,000 foot Jungfrau.
But when I discovered a few buttons of exotic-looking wild mushrooms sitting
in the fine spray at the foot of a waterfall, and then, a minute or two
later, more mushrooms poking their delicate caps and gills out of the damp
soil at the forest's edge, I forgot about the Jungfrau. I am not a mushroom
expert, but always find the hunt for these strange fungi enticing. For the
next few hours I wandered along paths with my eyes set not on the great
wonders above, but searching for smaller wonders below.
There were many sorts; brown, grey, white and yellow ones, some smooth and
round, other crinkly and angular. Some I thought I knew, others I had never
seen before. All went into my day pack. I was not planning to saute and wolf
down the lot, but like berry picking or clam digging, mushroom hunting fast
becomes compulsive.
By the time I heard the angry growling of mountain thunder above and looked
up to see the peaks obscured in black cloud it was too late; not even the
fastest dash down the valley could save me. In a few minutes I was soaked
through, and the delicate mushrooms, liberally doused and jogged up and down
on my back, had become a soggy mess.
In the end, though, I was not disappointed. When I returned to the village
of Wilderswil and told Fritz Zurschmeide, my host at the Hotel Baren, of my
misadventure, he laughed and said I should not worry. I was not the only one
whose head was turned by nature's offerings - every autumn half of
Switzerland disappears into the hills to return with all manner of wild
plant and beast. Nor do these hunter-gatherers hoard their gains to
themselves: like restaurants throughout the country, the Baren each year
offers the best of this wild fare, to locals and visitors, on their
Jagdwild, or hunting menu.
It was not long before I was dried, changed and installed in the Baren's
simple white-pine-panelled dining room. At hand to ward off the effects of
my afternoon soaking was a glass of Appenzeller schnapps, aromatic with the
alpine herbs and roots that give it its dark brown colour. It is much
favoured by both mountain hunters and those who sit down to enjoy the
results of the hunter's efforts.
Also at hand was a steaming bowl of fine game consomme made of a stock of
chamois, the horned alpine antelope, and delicately flavoured with one of
the most prized of forest mushrooms, the steinpilz. I was just as lucky,
Fritz told me as I savoured it, that I had lost my cargo of mushrooms; they
had not been checked by the local pilzkontrolle, or mushroom examiner.
The Swiss, I found out, are just as meticulous and careful about mushrooms
as about everything else in life. In each village in Switzerland, said
Fritz, there is a qualified specialist whose duty it is to certify the
safety of the mushrooms picked in the surrounding area.
With an activity as popular and competitive as mushroom gathering - there
are individual quotas and spot checks by foresters to give everyone a chance
 -enthusiastic pickers can sometimes make mistakes.
Was I likely to turn green and keel over in agony after my consomme? Hardly
 -to qualify for their post, village mushroom examiners must themselves be
examined, and be able to identify 70 different fungi varieties in less than
20 minutes. One mistake and chances for the job vanish like toadstools in
the morning sun.
It is not only the pilzkontrolle that is busy in the Alps in the autumn. All
Wilderswil, it seems, abandons regular work. Most villagers are part-time
farmers, and fill in the rest of the year as ski instructors and lift
attendants, alpine guides or employees on the miniature mountain railway
that runs nearby. But for a few days in September and October older, deeper
instincts take over - villagers drop whatever pacific task they are at and
take to their guns.
How, I asked Franz as, one after another, a series of exotic game dishes
appeared and disappeared from the table, can such a rich fare be offered
year after year? There was game terrine served with pear sauce and tart,
fresh cranberries taken from mountain bogs 4,000 feet up. There was
home-made ravioli filled with minced stag meat followed by jugged chamois
marinated in red wine.
Only then did the piece de resistance, a tender escalope of venison, arrive.
It was accompanied by two sweet side-dishes that perfectly contrasted the
meat's slight gaminess - fragrant, freshly picked roast chestnuts and a ripe
apple stuffed with forest mushrooms and baked. If large numbers of Swiss
went in for this sort of thing every October, I wanted to know, how could
there be anything left moving up in the hills?
The answer is simple. Some of the game meat is imported from nearby Austria,
where it is plentiful. But more important, Fritz explained, the Swiss manage
their own game stocks as carefully and as wisely as their numbered bank
accounts.
In many other countries it is easy enough to get hold of a license and blast
away at anything on four legs, or even two, as sometimes happens. In
Switzerland it takes a year of hard study, followed by tough written and
practical exams, to get a license. In the Wilderswil area an annual permit
costs around Pounds 650 and much more for anyone out of town. Individual
hunting quotas are decided by committee with the maintainance of ideal herd
numbers as a priority. This year, for example, Wilderswil has decided to
limit chamois kills to three per hunter - not just any chamois, but one male
and two female.
There are also practical measures that even up the odds between the hunter
and the hunted. Anyone wanting a chance at shooting an animal, said Fritz,
is obliged to take his turn at feeding the herds through the lean winter
months. In high altitude hunting the enthusiast is allowed to drive only to
a certain height; thereafter he must search for and track the animals on
foot - no mean task in the craggy and dangerous Alps. And in some parts of
Switzerland a hunter must be over the age of 60 before he is allowed
telescopic sights on his rifle.
I finished my meal with a Swiss-Italian specialty, Coupe Nesselrode -
icecream and meringue topped with pureed chestnuts passed through a press so
they come out looking like spaghetti.
The fresh air, the long day's mountain walk, the schnapps and the stupendous
dinner had conspired against me; I am not yet over 60, but by this point I
could have been given a rifle with sights, led up to a tethered chamois, and
still have missed it. I was done in.
The only slope I was prepared to negotiate was the stairs up to bed.
Besides, I had an early-morning project for the next day. If bad weather
stayed away from the Jungfrau, if I could find the same trail once again, I
would take my pack and go off on my own hunt. I planned to give the
pilzkontrolle more work than he had had in a long time.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Food &amp; Drink (The Flavours of Switzerland): Nice, but is the
price right? - Jill James unscrews a few bottles of Swiss wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE Cafe Torrent, vigneron Rene Cottier is discussing the grape harvest:
'It's of medium quantity and we cut a lot of fruit off the vines this year.
We are aiming for quality, not quantity.'
More coffees are ordered. In his blue check shirt, corduroy trousers and
mud-caked boots, Cottier looks as if he is playing the part of a French
vigneron delivering the standard patter.
But Cottier is a Swiss and the economics of a Swiss vineyard, even in a
recession, are the envy of the wine world.
For a start the Swiss do not export their wine, they drink most of it
themselves - a noble effort since most is from the undistinguished Chasselas
grape. Transport costs are minimal too. Many consumers travel to the
vineyard to buy by the case. And Swiss drinkers are prepared to pay Pounds 9
to Pounds 12 a bottle for something fairly ordinary.
But, as Rene Cottier supervised the end of the harvest last autumn in the
steeply banked vineyards at Yvorne, near Vevey, in the Vaud canton, he must
have been a little worried, for the success of Swiss wine owes a great deal
to the fact that growers have lived in a protected market. And that is
changing.
Already the Swiss government has lifted quotas on red wine imports and
imposed yield restrictions on growers. Meanwhile, domestic consumption is
falling.
Cottier is realistic enough to know that he will almost certainly get a
lower price this year. But he is justly proud of his product - particularly
his Clos du Rocher, grand Cru Suisse, bottled at nearby Obrist - and he
remains optimistic about what he produces.
Paul Baumann, the chef d'exploitation, or oenologist, at Obrist was
expecting last autumn's Clos Du Rocher to leave the cellar at SFr19.40
(Pounds 8.70) a bottle (including tax).
This seems a high price for those of us who live in the UK and are
accustomed to taking our pick of decent wine from the other side of the
world for less than Pounds 5. But the Swiss expect to sell it at that price
 -and in screw-top bottles. 'We are convinced it keeps better,' said
Baumann. Wine aesthetes will be glad to know that the red has a cork and not
a screw-top.
Although the Chasselas has spread over most of the Vaud - some 80 per cent -
it is only fair to mention that other plantings have met with some success,
notably the Pinot Noir and the Gamay. Certain soils are also suited to the
Pinot Gris, the Pinot Blanc and the Muller-Thurgau.
But the question growers and merchants may soon have to face is: why should
you buy it at all?
There is no burning reason why you should, but sipped quietly in the many
excellent bars and cafes while you are on holiday it is as good an entree
into the region's discreet charm as anything.
Rarity - or novelty value - is another reason for giving it a try. In the
Vaud, particularly, varied flavours are an exceptional feature of wine
growing. The gout de terroir goes from restrained to heavily pronounced
because of the nature of the soil.
For those who would like the fruit to predominate in their glass of
Chasselas good examples are: Luins, Vinzel, Coteaux de Vincy, Villette,
Epesses, St Saphorin and Bonvillars. Those with more earthy palates may
favour Fechy, Lutry, Calamin, Chardonne, Vevey, Yvorne, Ollon, Bex, Cotes de
l'Orbe and Vully.
Finally, for those who would like something more harmonious and
well-balanced, Mont-sur-Rolle, Dezaley, Villeneuve and Aigle are worthwhile.
Swiss wines are difficult to obtain in the UK but for those who would like
to make the effort, or who are inordinately keen on fondue parties, try the

FT  13 FEB 93 / Food &amp; Drink (The Flavours of Switzerland): Stirred by a big
Swiss cheese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH ABOVE Chateaux d'Oex, in a picture book Swiss chalet, Jean-Claud
Reynaud is making cheese. Twice a day, from May to October, he goes through
the same careful routine, stirring, decurdling and heating the milk from his
60 Simmental and Red Holstein cross-bred cows to produce the 25 to 30 kilo
rounds of Fromage d'Alpage which will be individually numbered and stored.
Each season Jean-Claud and his family make 10 tons of L'Etivaz, a hard
cheese that is as far removed from factory products - usually made with lots
of different milks - as is possible to imagine.
After six months maturation in 'cheese caves' L'Etivaz is ready for the
table. Sitting in the Reynaud's kitchen last autumn with Lia, Jean-Claud's
wife, I was looking forward to trying their most recently matured product.
Instead Jean-Claud unearthed a big, dry wedge, cut from a huge golden wheel,
that was enough to make any self-respecting mouse tremble.
'Five years old,' he said proudly, as what appeared to be yellow wood
shavings fell on to a plate beneath the strange implement used to cut cheese
in the Alps.
It was like no other mountain cheese I have tasted; a distillation of the
most alpine tastes and smells - cut grass, flowers, thick milk and straw.
Unforgettable.
Not surprisingly, mountain cheeses were used for barter in centuries past.
From the 13th to the 18th centuries the alpine cheesemakers were able to
trade for coffee, tobacco and linen with the Italians, their neighbours on
the other side of the Gotthard pass.
Today, to taste a five-year old cheese such as the Reynaud's, you will
probably have to go to Switzerland to buy it. Sadly, much of the stuff
masquerading as alpine cheese in the UK is factory made.
If you are interested in trying to obtain the real thing, the Syndicat des
Exporteurs Suisse de Fromage, Case Postale 770, CH-300 Berne 14, Switzerland
(tel: 031 44 26 11) should be able to help.
The tourist office in Chateau d'Oex (tel 029 4 77 88, fax 029 4 77 89) will
be able to give you information on the Cooperative Des Producteurs de
Fromage Alpage, of which the Reynauds (pictured right) are part.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Food &amp; Drink (The Flavours of Switzerland): Bread lines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IT IS tempting to suppose that one of the reasons why the peaceable Swiss
have always shown so little in the way of riotous tendencies is to be found
in all those gorgeous breads they bake and consume,' says author Sue Style,
in A Taste of Switzerland (Pavilion, Pounds 15.99, 160 pages).
With 3,000 small bakeries, plus those owned by chain stores, the 6m Swiss
are serious bread fans. For my morning snack I was able to try tailleaux
grebons, leaves of wholemeal pastry with bits of lard, fougassette, a bacon
bread, sweet baby brioche and a croissant. Pain mi-blanc, pain a l'ancienne,
pain complet and pain Vaudois were among a dozen others on offer.
The thrifty Swiss never waste anything, as this Sue Style recipe shows.
TORTA DI PANE (serves eight)
A typical Tessiner family pudding made from stale bread, steeped in milk.
Ingredients: 8oz stale bread (about 11 medium slices); 1 3/4 pints milk; 1
vanilla pod or 1 tsp vanilla essence; 3 eggs; 1 tsp salt; 5oz sugar, 2oz
plain (semi-sweet) chocolate, grated, or cocoa powder; 2 1/2 oz raisins.
Optional: small grass of grappa, 2 1/2 oz pine nuts.
Break up the bread and put in a bowl. Boil the milk with the vanilla and
leave to infuse for a few minutes. Remove the pod, if used, and pour the
milk over the bread. Leave for three to four hours or overnight. Reduce to a
puree in a food processor or vegetable mill.
Beat together the eggs, salt and sugar until light and fluffy. Add to the
bread mixture, with the grated chocolate or cocoa powder, raisins and
grappa, if using. Heat the oven to 180'C/350'F, Gas Mark 4. Pour into a
shallow, buttered ovenproof dish, scatter pine nuts on top and bake for 1-1
1/4 hours or until set. Keeps well for several days in the refrigerator,
covered with foil.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Minding Your Own Business: In tune with nature - Gareth Hugh
Davies meets a man who ensures the call of the wild can be heard loud and
clear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARETH HUGH DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DUNCAN Macdonald, a vet and keen ornithologist, has created an immediately
successful business out of his hobby. He runs Wildsounds, Britain's biggest
mail order company for recorded bird song, from his home, at the
birdwatcher's Mecca on the north Norfolk coast.
His is an unlikely, pain-free story for a recession. First, Macdonald
launched his business without recourse to his bank manager, financing it
entirely out of his salary and the cash flow it generated. Then he went on
quickly to achieve the sort of sales figures most small businessmen can only
dream about in these grim days.
In just 22 months, Macdonald has sold 2,000 of his sets of compact disc
recordings of the birds of Britain and Europe at Pounds 50 each. In his
first full year of trading, he showed a 25 per cent profit on turnover; he
expects to do even better in the current year.
Macdonald had the good fortune, as a dissatisfied consumer, to happen upon a
vacant market niche waiting to be exploited. As bird watching took him to
more exotic and remote destinations overseas, he turned increasingly to the
tape recorder as an aid to identifying birds. But tapes were hard to find.
To obtain bird sounds for a trip to Venezuela, for example, Macdonald had to
write to a small company in the US. The rigmarole of international money
orders almost doubled the price of the tapes.
So he researched the market in bird sounds and put together the first
comprehensive catalogue of all the available recordings, worldwide. Then he
bought some stock and took it to the 1990 Bird Fair at Rutland Water, where
he set up a table and tentatively launched Bird Recording Services. He sold
out within six hours on the first day of the three-day fair.
One of the suppliers Macdonald had contacted was Jean Roch, by general
agreement the world's leading commercial bird-sound recorder. Roch invited
Macdonald to his studios near Grenoble and offered him exclusive
distribution rights in the English-speaking world. That visit gave the
business (by now renamed Wildsounds) instant lift-off.
For more than a year, Macdonald had the CD bird-sound market to himself in
Britain. One of his mainstays was the four-CD set of European birds Roch had
just released. Wildsounds's sales of the set have been phenomenal: in the
whole of the rest of Europe, where there is less interest in bird watching,
Roch has sold fewer than 500 sets.
Macdonald grew up and trained as a vet in South Africa, coming to Britain in
1986. When he started Wildsounds, he was working as a locum vet in east
London, processing orders from two rooms on the practice's premises during
slack periods.
With orders flooding in, he resigned his post and moved to his brother's
house. His brother ran the business during Macdonald's bird-watching trips
and his sister-in-law worked full-time packing and processing. Last summer,
as Wildsounds outgrew those premises, Macdonald moved the operation to a
house at Salthouse in Norfolk. He employs three people part-time.
His start-up costs were small. He bought two computers, on which he
generates the catalogue and literature that accompanies the tapes and CDs.
In keeping with the conservationist philosophy which permeates his business
 -he sends out most of his orders in recycled packaging - he fitted out his
office with second-hand chairs, tables and filing cabinets for about Pounds
60. His biggest spending is in stock - he buys large quantities in order to
take maximum advantage of discounts and can hold as much as Pounds 20,000
worth of CDs and tapes at a time.
He has managed to run the business largely on cash flow 'by balancing and
juggling funds'.
He says: 'When I started, Roch would give me 60 days credit. I found I could
sell my stock in two or three weeks. It has been running like that ever
since.'
Only now is he thinking of an overdraft facility to buy up stock and master
discs in lines which Roch is discontinuing, to prevent them being sold
elsewhere. Setting up offices in his garden is likely to be his first
substantial capital expense.
Wildsounds' success is based on the CD, which, with its instant access and
high clarity, has revolutionised the identification of bird song and calls.
When a bird sings in the garden, the listener can now rush to the CD
programme a few possible tracks and identify the bird before it flies away.
'With a tape, you wound backwards and forwards, got lost and confused and
then forgot the sound you heard in the first place,' said Macdonald.
His customers range from dedicated ornithologists, who use portable CDs to
attract and locate birds in the field, to the general birdwatcher who wants
to identify birds seen from the kitchen window.
He offers two 'satisfied customer' stories. Late one night in August, his
solicitor heard swans flying over his house. He ran to the CD to check his
hunch. It gave aural confirmation that they were Bewick's swans, one of the
earliest sightings in Britain of this winter visitor.
A group of Scottish bird watchers had been playing recordings to stimulate
the elusive water rail to call from a reed bed, in order to assess its
numbers, by playing its sound from a tape recorder. Fewer than 30 birds
responded. When they switched to a portable CD player, which can be played
very loud with little or no distortion or background noise, the number of
water rails heard calling increased to 147.
Macdonald admitted he was unprepared for the rapid growth of Wildsounds. 'We
missed out walking and went straight into flying,' he said. But until the
last few months, he has hardly felt the effects of the recession.
One problem inherent to Macdonald's business is the small number of titles.
Macdonald offers about 200. He has added many recordings of bird sounds from
specific locations, and has moved into the sounds of other creatures,
including whales and frogs, as well as soundscapes of particular
wildernesses. (One customer told him his perfect experience was reclining in
the bath listening to the creatures of the rain forest on CD.)
When he takes on extra staff at Salthouse, he plans to prepare some of his
own recordings from his world trips for commercial release. They have
remained untouched while he has been running Wildsounds. Then he wants to
re-edit some of Roch's work, and co-produce some new lines for the UK
market. To test the demand for the latest technology, he has just put out
the world's first mini-disc recording of birds entitled Our Favourite Garden
Birds.
Was it wise to make a business out of a hobby? (Ironically the business has
grown to such an extent that he now has no free time to pursue the very
hobby which spawned it.) He admits he has had to learn fast, for instance in
obtaining redress for spoilt adverts.
One problem remains. He has not found a way to make some radio stations pay
for broadcasting recorded bird sound. 'Exactly the same rules apply as
govern broadcast music. They would not dare do it to Madonna,' he says.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Minding Your Own Business: My first taste of an Apple -
David Carter finds that there is an accounting alternative to PC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CARTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'DEAR Mr Carter, I have read your column for several months with interest.
You have constantly been selling the Apple 'Macintosh' philosophy, but don't
seem to appreciate the fact. I think it is about time you were
indoctrinated. Why don't you come round to our offices and bring yourself up
to date?'
THE cheeky fellow who sent this letter turned out to be one John Byrom, a
Macintosh dealer. But really, what else would one expect from these Apple
people? Throughout the world the IBM-compatible PC is standard, but there
remains that group of Apple users - 'creative' types, juveniles, people in
advertising, people who wear bow ties - in short, people who are not
entirely serious.
I would be the first to admit that there is a need for computers to design
advertisements or produce Sunday colour supplements, and I am sure that the
Macintosh does this sort of thing extremely well, but if you are talking
about real computing, about number-crunching, about using a computer to
manage your whole business, well, I believe that a PC is the machine to get.
I am a broad-minded fellow and his office happened to be just next door to a
client of mine, so I agreed to pop in.
Like most PC users I knew next to nothing about Macs. However, as I was to
learn, Apple dealers have one or two sneaky tricks up their sleeves. The
first is always to demonstrate on an impressive 22 inch wide screen.
One irritating restriction of PCs is that the standard 14 in screen can only
display 80 columns at a time. Any PC user who has used a spreadsheet to
produce an annual budget will know that it is impossible to squeeze all 12
months on to one screen and see the overall picture.
The wide-screen Mac uses a GUI ('graphical user interface') and had no
problem displaying all 12 months of an Excel spreadsheet.
The DOS 80 column restriction is also a problem for designers of invoicing
and order processing systems. I saw a package called Astra which uses the
wider screen to show effortlessly all the information an order clerk might
need. In spite of one or two limitations - for example you cannot buy stock
in outers and sell in inners - Astra on a 22 inch screen Macintosh is
essential viewing for any company looking to install an interactive order
processing system such as telesales.
Not bad. I admit I was getting interested. But the real eye opener was an
accounts package called 'Mind Your Own Business'. Quite simply, this is the
best accounts package I have seen. As I worked my way through it a host of
common design problems were solved with a sophistication and an elegance
that had me purring.
MYOB is so sophisticated that you have to keep your wits about you. I
expressed surprise that the only way I could find to enter a credit note was
as a minus invoice. The designers gently set me to rights. MYOB has an
'auto-reverse facility' for any transaction. You do not have to key in
credit notes at all; you simply call up onto the screen the invoice you want
to cancel, apply auto-reverse, and hey presto, MYOB generates the credit
note for you automatically.
As I was to find, accounts packages on the Mac are generally of a high
standard with their own distinctive 'tradition'. PC accounts packages tend
to be formal and designed for accountants, whereas Mac packages are designed
to help the people who are actually running the company.
Cashflow forecasts, proper analysis of purchases, 'diaries' which summarise
what action you need to take today are common in Mac packages but still
unusual in the PC world.
Using the Mac is a pleasure too. Whereas Windows accounts packages often
seem painfully slow, the snappy response times of the Mac feel natural and
'right'.
So are there any drawbacks to the Mac? Yes there are. The central problem
affecting all GUI-based accounting packages remains - data entry is awkward
and slow. Keying a batch of invoices into a GUI package will take 20 or 30
per cent longer than into a traditional package. Mac developers have tried
to alleviate the problem, but really it is up to Apple to redesign their
interface so that data entry under a GUI is at least as efficient as under a
traditional system. When they have, the GUI will become industry-standard,
but until then Mac packages can only be recommended for interactive
applications or where the volume of transactions is relatively light.
In most small businesses the volume of transactions usually is relatively
light, and a professional company which buys, for example, a Macintosh LC II
together with Claris Works and Mind Your Own Business, is getting one of the
classiest combinations of hardware and software on the market.
So take a bow, John Byrom. You have more than proved your point. The
Macintosh is indeed a serious business contender and some of the most
exciting and innovative work in accounting software these days is being done
on the Mac. I hope to be reviewing some of it in future columns.

installation, training and support of Apple accounting packages. Tel:

<TEXT>
THERE HAS been some sniggering. The first season of the Football
Association's Premier League has been accompanied by a strident advertising
campaign by BSkyB, its television paymaster, proclaiming: 'A whole new ball
game.'
Even those who are busy banking BSkyB's cash have found it difficult not to
smirk. Robert Chase, chairman of Norwich City, said: 'They are the same
teams as in last season's First Division, playing each other on the same
pitches with the same players and watched by the same people. The only
difference the average supporter on the terraces would notice is that the
referee's shirt is a different colour.'
But there is a difference. The league table tells the tale. The lead has
changed hands 15 times this season, Norwich themselves are a close third
after two-thirds of the season. Just below them are other surprise
contenders Coventry City and Ipswich Town.
If the top three keep collecting points at the same rate they have over the
first 28 games, the champions will finish with about 76 points. This would
equal Arsenal's total in 1989, the lowest since the change to three points
for a win in 1982 and Arsenal played only 38 games.
The top half of the Premier League contains only one championship winner
from the last 24 seasons - Aston Villa, who won the league in 1981. The old
order has changed and the redistribution of television wealth, which was the
main plank of BSkyB's bid for the Premier League contract, has a lot to do
with it.
Arsenal, Liverpool and Everton are struggling below midway and Nottingham
Forest are bottom. The table is topsy- turvy. This sort of volatile,
tightly-packed league race was for many years the norm in the first
division. Only after 1968 did the competition become increasingly limited to
just a few big clubs. This period began and ended with Leeds United as
champions - but it is, of course, the Liverpool era.
In almost any ten-year period between 1919-20, when the first division
settled at 22 clubs, and 1968, the average number of points gained by the
champions was, at most, 58 - 16 ahead of the average club. The only blip was
between 1957 and 1961, when the general standard was mediocre and a series
of outstanding teams turned the championship race into a procession. In
1956-57, Manchester United's Busby Babes won their last championship with 64
points. The next year, Wolves also gained 64. In 1960-61, Spurs totalled 66.
In 1969 the pattern changed. Leeds set a record of 67 points. The next 24
championships were shared by just seven clubs. Liverpool won 11, Arsenal,
Leeds and Everton three each. In that time the champions averaged just over
60 points - the gap between the top teams and the rest had widened. Three
points for a win did not discourage draws. These peaked in years when the
chances of relegation grew: in 1973-4, when the number of relegation places
rose, and in 1987-8, when the play-offs were introduced.
The rich clubs were getting richer and richer and those with astute managers
 -Bob Paisley at Liverpool, George Graham at Arsenal and Howard Kendall at
Everton - used their financial muscle to overpower the competition.
One source of increased revenue was Europe. When Liverpool won their first
European Cup in 1977 they did so with the squad so astutely collected by
Bill Shankly. A year later they won again with three 1977 purchases: Kenny
Dalglish, bought for a British record fee, Graeme Souness and Alan Hansen.
The pattern of the next 15 years was set.
The financial inequality increased in 1983. That year brought the first
large television contract. It was worth Pounds 5.2m for two years, peanuts
by today's standards, but, as with all the subsequent ITV contracts, the
bulk of the cash went to the five or six clubs which could attract the
biggest TV audiences. It was also the year that the big clubs persuaded the
Football League to allow home teams to keep gate receipts rather than share
them with the away team.
Even the European ban could not erode the big boys' advantage. The ten
championships after those reforms were shared by Everton, Arsenal and
Liverpool. They won their titles with a quality of play that has not been
seen this season. But, off the pitch, English soccer became a sour and
unpleasant game. A cheque-book madness crept in. It reached its apogee in
1991 when Liverpool paid Pounds 2.9m for Dean Saunders - a player they did
not need and who did not fit their style - simply, it seemed, to stop him
joining one of their rivals.
There were seemingly endless wrangles between the clubs over the growing pot
of television and sponsorship money. The break-up of the old Football League
last season was the inevitable, disillusioning result of all this. But at
least it has brought a temporary rebalancing of power.
The changes have been wrought by BSkyB and also by the Taylor report on
safety. Every Premier League ground must be all-seater by the 1994-5 season.
Converting stadia costs money. For the big clubs with big stadia it is
disproportionally more expensive. Turning terracing into seats involves a
loss of between a third and a half of capacity.
For medium-sized teams with lots of empty terracing this is not a problem.
They can refurbish. Clubs drawing near-capacity crowds must rebuild to seat
all their fans. The maximum Football Trust grant of Pounds 2m goes a long
way at Norwich or Ipswich. It is a spit in the ocean at Anfield or Highbury.
Ipswich and Norwich, the two clubs closest to meeting the requirements, lie
third and fourth in the table, Arsenal are 12th and Liverpool 13th. One sign
that the big clubs are feeling the pinch is the moribund transfer market. In
November, for example, total spending was half what it was in the same
period a year earlier. The bulk of activity this season has come from
Blackburn Rovers and Derby County, which are spending not revenue but the
private fortunes of their owners.
When the new stands at Highbury, Anfield and Old Trafford are completed,
with executive boxes, banqueting suites and expensive seats, the balance of
power will tip back. But for now there is the prospect of an old-fashioned
title scramble to look forward to.
The favourites are the wealthiest of them all, Manchester United, who are
rebuilding Old Trafford but still have a little cash to spare. Over the last
25 years they have provided a healthy antidote to the worst excesses of the
Liverpool era. They spent more money than anyone else in an increasingly
dour, desperate and vain pursuit of the title, but providing a healthy
reminder that there is more to soccer than cash.
This year United have been relatively restrained in the marketplace. Their
one purchase was Eric Cantona for a modest Pounds 1m. He has helped the Alex
Ferguson's abrasive team rediscover the joy of football. If United win the
title for the first time since 1967 it really would begin a new era.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Sport: On course in Florida - John Hopkins visits two
resorts which were almost destroyed by debt / Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHOULD YOU meet Chris Blackman, an American, who is a bit of a bandit off
his handicap of 12, you could ask him what it was like to be at school with
Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader.
'Paddy was a handful' Blackman recalled. 'I used to keep him under control
by flicking a wet towel with a knot in it at him. I found that kept him in
line.'
Or you could ask Blackman about the collapse of the Savings &amp; Loans
institutions in the US. This financial crisis affected many golf-based
properties such as Lake Nona, the resort on the outskirts of Orlando,
Florida, which Sunleys, the British building company, started constructing
in the early 1980s.
But whereas the Sunleys experienced considerable financial turbulence at
Lake Nona as a result of the S &amp; L crisis, Blackman benefited from it. He
and his associates bought Grand Harbor, a resort 85 miles north of Palm
Beach, for a song from the Resolution Trust Corporation, the federal
government body set up to bail out casualties of the S &amp; L collapse. When
Grand Harbor got into difficulties after the New Jersey Savings and Loan
lent Dollars 125m (Pounds 83m) for its development and, perhaps as a
consequence, went bust, Blackman and his associates bid Dollars 34m for the
project.
Florida has dozens of large resorts, many of them on the east coast where
they are warmed by the Gulf Stream.
Grand Harbor, which is in a small town called Vero Beach, 100 miles south of
Orlando, is different from many in that it offers a 144-berth marina and a
beach club as well as two golf courses, one designed by Pete Dye, the other
by Joe Lee. To pay for all this, they offer for sale or rent hundreds of
apartments, villas and town houses dotted around the 900-acre site.
Vero Beach is best known as the pre-season home of the Los Angeles Dodgers
baseball team. It is a small community of fewer than 10,000 that sprang up
originally because the railway and US1, the main north-south road, passed
through. Citrus grows in abundance. Like many places in Florida, Vero Beach
tends to be populated by the elderly who have moved south for their
retirement. They are known, not very flatteringly, as VND, very near death.
What marks out Grand Harbor is a run of four holes, the 12th, 13th, 14th and
15th on its River Course, that are the equal of any four successive holes
anywhere in the US. They grabbed my attention because they are so unlike the
conventional Florida golf hole. They look superb, thanks to the imaginative
use of the protected wetlands, and are demanding to play. The 14th is one of
the best holes I have played, requiring length, accuracy and nerve to cover
its 550 yards. It is the only par five hole on which I have had to lay up
with my second shot.
Anyone who plays these four holes without losing a ball or in level par is
either a touring professional or playing better than he knows how.
After tangling with this course, I had to pay Dollars 20 to Blackman who had
played well below his handicap. As he pocketed my money, he impressed on me
the advantages of buying a property at Grand Harbor.
'The climate's great' he said. 'The Gulf Stream is only one mile off shore,
compared with nine miles at Palm Beach and 60 at Jacksonville, which is why
it is so warm here. And real estate in Florida has rocketed in value. As
Willie Nelson says in that song, they don't make land any more, so it will
appreciate. A property worth Dollars 15,000 20 years ago would now be worth
Dollars 700,000.'
The Sunleys project at Lake Nona is a very British venture. Mike Hughesdon,
a past captain of Sunningdale, seemed to win every club competition in the
first few years. Denis Thatcher and former minister Lord Young were in at
the birth of the club. The professionalis Gregor Jamieson, whose father Bob
has been pro at the Turnberry hotel since before the flood.
'The appeal of our golf club is that it is an understated decent sort of
establishment' said James Sunley, a director of the family company. 'It is
not like walking in to a rather over-the-top American golf club.'
Golf Magazine ranks the 18 holes designed by Tom Fazio at Lake Nona as the
37th best course in the US. They skirt the lakes that dominate this property
and wind through stands of pines where white tail deer and red fox roam.
David Leadbetter, the renowned golf teacher, has his school at Lake Nona.
Lake Nona was thrown into confusion late in 1989 when the Gibraltar Savings
&amp; Loan Association went bust.
'We were into a desperate period trying to renegotiate a loan while at the
same time wondering whether we were throwing good money after bad,' said
Sunley. 'Eventually, we concluded a refinancing deal in August in 1992 and
we're going flat-out again.'
The World Cup, the two-man team event, will be held at Lake Nona in
November.
For more information about Grand Harbor and Lake Nona, telephone Hugh
Roberts on 0223-840680.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Fashion: Undercover revolutions - Lucia van der Post watches
a new world of knickers taking shape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMETHING strange has been happening to underwear. I knew something was up
when it became hard to find a simple pair of white cotton knickers, and when
choosing a pair of tights meant embracing a whole new vocabulary.
Not that this has all happened overnight, you understand. Having thrown away
our suspender belts and wired bras in the 1960s and taken up the new
girdleless tights to make our mini-skirts look halfway decent, women at last
knew what it felt like to walk about unconstrained. As the cheesecloth
shirts and flowery skirts took over from the mini, breasts drooped and
bottoms wobbled - but nobody seemed to mind. It was quite a while before any
manufacturer dared again to suggest that the female figure in its natural
form needed a helping hand.
They started innocently enough - adding a little Lycra here and there,
transforming tights into the fashion accessory of the age, making cling and
fit the watchwords and leaving the wrinkle as obsolete as the horse-drawn
carriage.
Then along came the cling kings, the Azeddine Alaias and the Donna Karans,
with their figure-hugging, curve-revealing, high fashion statements and the
power suits adapted to flatter aerobics-honed limbs. What had once wobbled
merrily under cheesecloth began to look uncontrolled and - dare one say it -
just a little uncouth. Control crept back, clothed in glamour, modernised
and lightened by Lycra and newer technology and masquerading under a new
word: 'Contouring' - so much more 90s, so much less restricting. But the
message was the same: bulges are bad, bulges must be banished.
Which is why these days when you walk through Marks &amp; Spencer, or Harvey
Nichols, or any other up-to-the-minute underwear or hosiery department, you
are spoiled for choice. Simple decisions that used to seem taxing enough -
like what colour matches and how sheer should you go - have gone forever.
Today diversity is all. Body toners and Body shapers, Control Tights and
Thigh Slimmers, Control Briefs and Body Slimmers . . . there isn't a bulge
or a blemish that somebody has not catered for. No longer need you sweat and
toil in the gym or cut down on calories. As Cathy Volker, vice-president at
Hanes, which markets Donna Karan's Body Toner hosiery, puts it: 'It's just
60 seconds to firmer thighs.'
First of the new breed was the 'body' - no, not the type associated with the
mortician's trolley, but an all-in-one garment which fastens below the
crotch, flattening out bulges, giving a smooth line from bust to waist and
doing away with what in hosiery-land is called 'the panty line.'
Bodies came in all shapes, sizes and colours, plain, matt and serviceable,
as well as saucy as any Edwardian teddy. Even though many of us never wore
them, they softened us up for the next step - the Slim Slip, brainchild of
what was once the oldest, most fuddy-duddy of corsetieres, Rigby &amp; Peller. A
combination of knickers, slip and girdle, all wrapped up in one garment that
sold for Pounds 26.50, it was a wow - it cut out the fuss and trimmed the
line.
From then on it was no holds barred. Today, no hosiery department worth its
Lycra could keep the tills ringing without a control and contouring
selection.
This new generation of bulge-beaters looks quite different from the old.
Where once you had the girdle - stiff, restricting, boned - today you have
what looks more like a pair of tights attached to some support knickers. The
knickers come either standard shape (to control the stomach and bottom) or
short-line (to control the top of the thigh as well) or long-line (to
control further down the leg to mid-thigh). They come with cotton gussets,
which means they can be worn without extra knickers, and cost just Pounds
2.99. At M &amp; S the tights part still tends towards the sheer but opaques
will appear next autumn.
Aristoc's Bodytoners at Pounds 3.99 work on much the same principle - there
is a light contouring Lycra top (long-line or short-line, smoothing over
stomach, hips and thighs) but the attached tights come sheer, semi-sheer or
opaque in all the fashionable colours: plum, mocha, bottle green, as well,
of course, as the essential black.
Market research is a wonderful thing - how else would we know that London
women buy Bodytoners to smooth away their bumps and bulges, while good,
practical Yorkshire women buy them because it means they do not have to wear
knickers as well?
But the trend has only just begun - already a whole raft of new wheezes is
in the pipeline. At Marks &amp; Spencer you could move seamlessly from hosiery
to underwear and find 'Thighslimmers' - long-line controlling garments in
satin and lacy Lycra (Pounds 9.99) as well as a satin boxer short number
(Pounds 7.99), all promising to flatten the stomach and upper thigh.
You could go for Bodyslimmers at Pounds 25 ('the body for people with less
than perfect bodies'), all under-wired with medium-control corsetry fabric
and fancy extras such as detachable suspenders and halter-neck bra straps
and strapless support. For Pounds 6.99 you could get Second Skin, the M &amp; S
version of an up-market, hot-selling light control brief with double front
panels that holds the stomach in check (Pounds 6.99), while for Pounds 9.99
there is a sassy suspender belt which seems to perform miracles - it
flattens the stomach, slims the hips and holds your stockings up for free.
The choice, as you can see, is rich, intricate, bewildering. It's only if
you are after a pair of plain white cotton knickers that you may have
trouble.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Fashion: Body talk, it's wiser to whisper - There is life
beyond Lycra when it comes to sportswear. Christopher Brown illustrates some
choices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO KEEP young and beautiful is an impossible dream. Staying fit and healthy
is far more realistic. Most men know that getting fit is a noble ambition,
yet remarkably few have the stamina to sustain the initial challenge.
If you find it intimidating to choose a gym, or one of the many health and
fitness centres now springing up, then deciding what to wear on your first
visit is even more so. You probably did not notice what those perspiring
bodies were actually wearing as you were being choreographed around
carefully by a smiling member of staff.
You might have had visions of Chippendale-like bodies - but most gym-goers
could be described more truthfully as Biedermeier-like (over-stuffed, with
wobbly legs). So do not worry too much about what your body looks like:
after all, you have joined to improve it. And besides, gym clothing does not
have to be made of tight Lycra.
Do not, however, think that excavating an old rugby shirt or ancient pair of
tennis shorts from your wardrobe will do. Gyms are about working up a sweat,
but arriving in clothes that look as if they have been preserved in it will
not improve your gym cred rating.
Avoid the all-white look - you might be a gym virgin but do not advertise
it. Besides, white has a tendency to make you look like an overgrown
schoolboy on sports day as you sit, cross-legged, waiting for your first
aerobics class. You will also soon discover that all those shiny neon
colours are no longer popular.
One item worth investing in is a pair of decent training shoes - cross
trainers being ideal. The newly-redecorated Lillywhites at London's
Piccadilly Circus boasts the largest selection, but the choice is
overwhelming and slightly confusing.
I found that Cobra, with its 42 shops across the UK, offered a
more-than-comprehensive selection, with friendly and constructive advice. As
a bonus, you could also pick up a pack of three sports socks for Pounds
3.99.
With sports clothing increasingly making the cross-over to casual wear, the
big 'trend' names are Champion, Russell Athletic and Nike. Champion now has
a store in London's Oxford Street, but you do not need to shop along that
venue of hell - there are other options.
In the relative calm of Covent Garden's Floral Street, and Notting Hill
Gate's Pembridge Road, can be found the two branches of Sports Locker,
perhaps one of the best sportswear shops in London. In spite of its size,
its carefully-chosen and co-ordinated stock would shame a larger store,
selling not only the better-known names but also its own brand.
If, however, you have a phobia about shops and shopping, then do not despair
 -you can do it from home. The new Next mail order catalogue has four pages
of NX sports wear (the grey cotton marl shorts are a bargain at Pounds
17.99). Then there is the SWEAT mail order catalogue which, like Sports
Locker, offers the best of American and European gym wear. (There is also a
shop close to the City of London, with staff who know what they are
selling).
Having bought your gear, you now need something in which to carry it. Most
men seem to feel they need to get a Head bag, but Cobra is offering a
medium-sized black bag carrying its logo for just Pounds 19.99. The Head
bags are available in various sizes from the reasonable to the ridiculous -
the larger ones are roomy enough for a cricket team, let alone one man's
kit.
As the gym virgin becomes experienced, his confidence grows and his girth
decreases and he tends to cast aside the basic gym attire and becomes bolder
 -greys are replaced by colour and there might come the time when he appears
in a striped all-in-one.
The etiquette of gym wear varies from club to club. In some, there is a
preference for wearing the T-shirt outside the shorts; in others, it is de
rigueur to tuck it in.
Whatever you choose to wear, the main criterion is to feel comfortable -
there is, after all, something to suit everyone's body.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Briefcase, Q &amp; A: Tunnel vision
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE MANY other people, I was an original subscriber for Eurotunnel units
and warrants in December 1987. In return for the lump sum which I then
subscribed, I was allotted a holding of units and a holding of warrants. The
warrants lapsed in November 1992, of course, but I continue to hold the
units.
I know I can set the cost of the warrants against other investment gains for
the purposes of capital gains tax, but I have no idea how much of the
original lump sum was attributable to the units and how much to the
warrants. How can I work this out?
Of the Pounds 3.50 which you paid for each unit with warrant attached,
Pounds 3.3555992 is attributable to the unit (comprising a Eurotunnel plc
share and a Eurotunnel SA share) and the other 14.44008p is attributable to
the warrant.
This allowable loss on each warrant is accordingly 14.44008p x 139.7 / 103.3
= 19.52836p. This apportionment is based upon the quarter-up prices on
December 10 1987, viz Pounds 2.44 for a unit and 10.5p for a warrant.

<TEXT>
I AM A SINGLE British subject, born in 1947, resident in Italy since 1969
and working at the United Nations in Rome. As a UN staff member, I am not
liable for British tax. Medical problems mean I will have to return to the
UK eventually, so I am contemplating buying a small flat/house there.
How will my tax status change once I become a house-owner in the UK while
still resident in Rome? I have National Savings and a building society
account which earn gross interest, and I also pay Class 3 contributions to
the National Pension Fund.
For as long as you are working full-time in Italy, your status will not
change and you will continue to escape UK tax on your National Savings and
building society interest by virtue of extra-statutory concession B13:
'Where for any year of assessment, for the whole of which she is regarded as
being not resident in the UK, a person receives interest (eg bank or
building society interest) without deduction of income tax . . . no action
is taken to pursue her liability to income tax except so far as it can be
recovered by set-off in a claim for relief . . . in respect of . . . income
from UK sources . . .'
Write to the Inland Revenue Public Enquiry Room, Somerset House, Strand,

FT  13 FEB 93 / Briefcase, Q &amp; A: Double protection
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM TIME to time, Financial Times articles refer to the scheme that
guarantees 90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000 invested in a building
society. Does this mean that a married couple are protected if they have
Pounds 40,000 in a joint account, or do they need to have separate accounts
each of Pounds 20,000?
The protection to which you refer derives from section 27 of the Building
Societies Act 1986. The protection for 90 per cent of (currently) Pounds
20,000 is applied to joint accounts in the manner provided in the sixth
schedule to the 1986 act. Where the joint account is held for two or more
beneficiaries who are not in partnership, they are treated as if each held a
separate account, so that the protection for two such joint depositors would
be up to 90 per cent of Pounds 40,000.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Briefcase, Q &amp; A: Cottage for sale
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM A JOINT tenant with my mother in ownership of a bungalow, although I do
not live there. She is now in residential care and I have power of attorney
for her affairs. To obtain income support allowance for her, the DSS
informed me the bungalow must be put up for sale, and it has been. But can
they force me to do this?
My solicitor thinks it would be difficult for me to buy her out; is this so?
If I can, what equitable arrangement for valuation would be acceptable to
the DSS, and would it affect the present allowances?
The DSS cannot force you to sell the bungalow but they can, and will, assess
your mother's needs on the footing that she has available capital to the
extent of her half-share in the property - so the result is likely to be
much the same.
It is not too difficult to buy out your mother's share, but certain
safeguards are necessary as you are a trustee purchasing from your
beneficiary. The principal requirement is that you obtain a proper valuation
assessing the value of the property in the open market, so that you can show
that the price you are paying is a proper price and not detrimental to your
mother's interests.
It would be wise to inform the DSS that you are proposing to buy your
mother's interest at that valuation, provide them with a copy, and invite
them to agree the value or to appoint a valuer of their own if they do not
accept the valuation.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Briefcase, Q &amp; A: Do pre-nuptial pacts work?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU SUGGESTED (Briefcase, January 9) that a correspondent would be advised
to draw up an agreement defining respective financial rights in a marriage
should anything go wrong. I was under the impression that such 'pre-nuptial'
agreements (as they are called in the US) are not enforceable in the UK and,
while there is nothing illegal about them, they are simply of no use if
either party wishes to contest matters. I would appreciate your confirmation
that such agreements do, in fact, work.
You also say they cannot cover the rights of children. If the answer to my
general question is 'yes,' does this mean that any such agreement could
still be valid as to financial arrangements between parents, with separate
ones having to be made for the children when a marriage dissolves? Or does
the mere presence of children invalidate the entire matter?
We concur that agreements entered into by the parties before, or during, a
marriage are not enforceable in such a way as to oust the jurisdiction of
the court to make a property adjustment order on divorce; indeed, the court
can set aside any actual disposal under an avoidance of disposal order.
However, there is still a purpose in entering into a contract such as we
suggested because it is evidence of what the parties wanted to happen, and
of their having addressed their minds to the question, at a time when their
attitudes were not affected by the matters which will have led to the
divorce. It is also not necessarily the case that the court will interfere
with the parties' prior arrangements.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Finance &amp; the Family: How CGT can trap home-owners - Many
think their properties are exempt when selling, but that is not always so
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE GARNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE AN Englishman's home traditionally has been his castle, it might have
felt more like a mausoleum in recent years. Some people, unable to sell,
have therefore considered other ways of using their property.
You can let all of it and move away, or stay at home and sub-let some. You
might even work from home to save the cost of travelling and office space.
Doing any of these things could, however, risk the property's exemption from
capital gains tax.
Many people assume their home is exempt from the threat of CGT when they
sell it, but this is not always the case. Its liability for tax could depend
on the amount of time you have spent there and what it was being used for.
Relief is available in proportion to how long you have used the property as
your main or only residence. But certain periods of absence  - called
'permitted absences' - are treated as if you were still living there. For
the most part, the way you used your residence during the last 36 months of
your ownership is ignored by the Inland Revenue.
This does not mean that you can buy a property, leave it empty for three
years, sell it and still get 100 per cent CGT relief. You must have lived
there as your main or only residence at some time if the last 36 months are
to be ignored. But the exact amount of time is debatable.
Assuming the Revenue accepts that you lived there long enough to qualify for
the relief, you can then elect for another property to be treated as your
main residence, or even sub-let it during those last 36 months. The relief
will still be available in full. But if you have been using part of your
house exclusively for business purposes, full relief might not be available
although roll-over relief might be.
In addition to the last 36 months, there are three types of 'permitted
absence' which the Revenue will treat as periods in which you were living in
the property - provided that, both before and after your absence, you lived
there as your main or only residence:
Any period or periods not exceeding three years.
Any period, no matter how long, while you are employed abroad.
Any period or periods not exceeding four years when you are absent due to
your employment.
The Revenue can ignore the rule that you must have used the property as your
residence after a period of absence, but only if you were unable to take up
residence again due to employment. You cannot, during your permitted
absence, have another house on which you hope to claim relief as your main
and only residence.
These periods of absence are cumulative. Say Harold leaves 5 Acacia Avenue,
in which he has lived as his main residence, to go to Spain for five years.
He then returns to the UK to live for two years in rented accommodation,
followed by one year in Acacia Avenue as his main residence and two years in
another property before selling Acacia Avenue.
Any gain made on the sale would be tax-free. But if Harold had not returned
to Acacia Avenue, or had not used it as his main residence, he would have
lost the full relief.
You should also be careful that the property is your 'residence.' If you
have a flat in London and a house in the country, but the flat is used by
your daughter and your visits there are infrequent, the Revenue might argue
that the flat is not, in fact, your residence even though you own it and can
stay in it when you want. (In this case, you could consider transferring the
flat into the name of your daughter, or into a trust for her, so that the
relief can be preserved).
Even if the flat is treated by the Revenue as your 'residence,' it might not
be regarded as your main residence unless you have elected for it to be
treated as such, in writing. (Husbands and wives are treated as one so that,
if you own one property and your wife owns the other, only one can be your
main residence).
You can back-date the election for up to two years. In the Revenue's eyes,
this means you must elect within two years of first acquiring two residences
 -otherwise, the right to do so is lost. In that case, the Revenue can
decide which is your main residence, which might not produce the least tax
payable. Remember that an election could still be necessary if you live in
two properties but own only one.
You must also be careful that the whole of your property is treated as your
main residence. If you use the basement exclusively as your office, it
cannot be said that all the property is being used as your main residence;
thus, the relief will be apportioned according to the amount of space
actually used for residential purposes.
When you sub-let part of your house, it is no longer used as your residence,
so the main and only residence exemption will not be available.
If the basement was sub-let to a tenant for accommodation, there would be
another relief available (so long as you had not let more than half your
residence) and depending on the amount of gain made when the property is
sold.
The Revenue is also quite lenient if your house is used by lodgers or if
areas are occupied by your staff, such as housekeeper or nanny. But you must
be careful whose staff they are. If the chauffeur is actually employed by
your company, he will not be your staff. And you should also consider if all
or part of the garden or grounds will qualify as your residence. The Revenue
always allows one hectare, or such larger area of garden and grounds as is
needed for 'reasonable enjoyment' of the property. This could include woods,
a paddock, a tennis court and a swimming pool.
The rules relating to your main or only residence are detailed and fiddly
but, with CGT at a maximum rate of 40 per cent, it is certainly worth trying
to get it right.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Welfare goes private - The
government wants to spread the welfare bill. John Authers finds out what the
private sector can offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT hopes to contract out unemployment and other welfare benefits to
the private sector, widely reported last weekend, look unlikely to meet with
success.
Private insurers are reluctant to pick up the opportunity. As commercial
operations, they scarcely want to shoulder the risk of becoming unemployed
when this risk is growing higher than ever.
A spokesman for the Association of British Insurers put it emphatically:
'It's a total non-starter.'
However, the government's ideas, although they seem too crude at present,
fit a worldwide trend. In its global review for 1993, Noble Lowndes, the
actuary, comments on the 'privatisation of social security'. It said:
'Bastions of cradle-to-grave social security systems such as Italy and
Sweden have started the process of cost containment and shifting of burdens.
Reforms, the classic euphemism for cost cutting and redirecting
responsibility, are being implemented everywhere.'
The UK does have several routes by which the private sector adds to the
welfare protection on offer from the state. Personal and company pensions,
which top up the meagre allowance from the state pension, are the best
known.
Companies also offer insurance to restore your income both when you are off
work sick, and when you are made redundant. These have the potential for
growth. But the pressures on both forms of insurance show why the industry
is unenthusiastic about the opportunity the government has thrown its way.
Unemployment Insurance
Standard unemployment benefit stands at Pounds 43.10 per week. Those with a
dependent adult receive an extra Pounds 26.60.
This is nowhere near enough to keep up the payments on an average mortgage.
Most redundancy contracts on the market aim only to protect a flow of
payments, either on mortgages or on a consumer loan. It is almost impossible
to buy unemployment insurance on a 'stand-alone' basis as insurers cannot
make a profit this way. Redundancy cover is also usually only sold in
conjunction with accident and sickness insurance, with one premium for the
whole package. Premiums are quoted for every Pounds 100 of monthly outgoings
which the policy is to protect.
National &amp; Provincial's accident sickness and unemployment policy,
underwritten by Guardian Royal Exchange, charges Pounds 7.20 per Pounds 100
each month, and the benefit cover lasts for two years. You have to be in
work for six months before starting the policy.
Accident and sickness cover on their own cost Pounds 3.20 per month,
suggesting that unemployment costs around Pounds 4 per Pounds 100. According
to N &amp; P the premium for the whole package was less than Pounds 5 two years
ago, this increase shows the effect of rising unemployment.
Demand has grown. In the past two years, the proportion of N &amp; P new
borrowers taking out the protection rose from 20 per cent to roughly 33 per
cent.
Citibank Mortgage has offered free redundancy insurance, underwritten at
Lloyd's, for the last year, and plans to continue doing so. Abbey National
also offers free payment protection, including accident and sickness, as an
incentive to first-time buyers. For those who wish to pay for it, the
premiums have recently been increased from Pounds 6 to Pounds 6.95 per
Pounds 100 of monthly sum assured.
The rising premiums give a clue to the industry's opposition to the
government's plans. Paul Thompson, of Financial Insurance, one of the UK's
biggest unemployment insurance companies, reports a significant worsening in
claims experience. Claims on its payment protection package as a whole rose
by 54 per cent in 1991, and by a further 40 per cent in 1992. Meanwhile the
share of claims caused by unemployment, rather than disability, grew from 20
per cent to 55 per cent.
The length of time for which people have claimed unemployment insurance has
also increased, by around 60 per cent, and the company has evidence of
increased 'moral hazard' or fraudulent claims.
Another problem, pointed out by Gordon Mylchreest, marketing director of
Consolidated Insurance Group, is 'anti-selection' - most of the people who
take out the cover believe they are at risk of losing their job.
Demand is increasing, and the premiums charged look very reasonable as
unemployment approaches 3m, but the industry is unlikely to cover against
this risk much more than it does at present.
Permanent Health
Insurance
The level of statutory sick pay is enough to make many people feel ill.
Those on between Pounds 54 and Pounds 189.99 per week receive Pounds 45.30
per week. Anyone with an income of Pounds 190 or more per week will receive
Pounds 52.50.
This is payable for 28 weeks, after which it could be necessary to apply for
sickness or invalidity benefit.
Permanent health insurance, to use the industry jargon for income
replacement policies, offers to pay an income indefinitely if someone is too
ill to work. The industry norm is not to pay out more than three quarters of
the policyholder's previous salary minus the state single person's
invalidity benefit, to give an incentive to go back to work.
PHI is available both to individuals and through many company group schemes,
with premiums varying according to how long the policyholder is prepared to
wait after becoming unfit for work before receiving benefits.
Again, demand is rising, partly because people have less faith in state
benefits than they used to. But, like unemployment insurance, the number of
claims and the time for which people claim are also increasing.
This led Allied Dunbar, the market leader in PHI for individuals, to raise
premiums. These come into force on Monday, and will vary according to age,
sex, occupation, and the amount of time you are prepared to defer benefit.
The increases are greater for older ages in higher-risk occupations. A
25-year-old man in a low-risk occupation deferring for six months faces an
increase of only 7 per cent, a higher-risk man faces an increase of 29 per
cent.
The increases are greater for women. Premiums will rise 100 per cent for a
35-year-old woman in a high-risk occupation deferring for six months.
This does not mean that the insurance is bad value - a 29-year-old man in a
low-risk (white collar) job can insure a salary of Pounds 25,000 (allowing a
PHI pay-out of Pounds 15,935) with premiums of Pounds 17.88. A woman of the
same age would have to pay Pounds 33.98 for the same cover.
Alan Tyler, health and group manager of Mercantile &amp; General, the UK's
biggest reinsurer for individual PHI, believes Allied Dunbar's action is
justified. He said: 'When PHI came on the market, the premium rates were
just inspired guesswork.'
Now that the industry has built up some claims experience, difficulties have
emerged. According to M &amp; G, claims from people deferring the benefit for 13
or more weeks have been running 20 to 25 per cent higher than expected since
1985. Claims from those deferring for six months have 'deteriorated
rapidly', and since 1985 have been 75 per cent above expectation.
M &amp; G's suggestions for change in the market include limiting the benefit
payable to two thirds of salary less full state invalidity benefit.
The experience of Swiss Life, which offers a net group PHI scheme, paying an
income to employees net of tax and state benefits, suggests that this could
work. There is no incentive for employees to stay away from work longer than
they have to, and Swiss Life has noticed no increase in claims over the last
two years.
Nick Anderton, an actuary with management consultants AKG, said PHI is 'the
most undersold' product in the life insurance market. The problem for
insurers, he said, is that claims depend on work availability. In times of
unemployment this makes underwriting more difficult.
One look at the state benefits shows that the industry has a product which
many will want to pay for. But the way it has evolved also demonstrates that
it would be difficult to withstand a total removal of the state benefits.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Simplicity pays off for Alliance -
John Authers reports on the strategy behind a Scottish success story /
Investment Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPANY set up to lend money to sugar planters on the Sandwich Islands
does not sound like a prudent home for a small investor's money. Neither, in
the present economic climate, does a fund to invest in the debt of American
railway companies. But the Alliance and Second Alliance trusts, based in
Dundee, Scotland, sprang from these origins and have in recent years
provided exactly the kind of investment performance that most small
shareholders crave.
As their name implies, both were amalgamations of several land and mortgage
trusts and they now follow an almost identical investment strategy. Alliance
and Second Alliance also share the same offices and the same board. There is
no overall management company to control marketing and administration, as
both tasks are undertaken by the trusts themselves. With Dundonian
frugality, this means costs take up only 0.2 per cent of total assets - the
lowest of all investment trusts.
Alliance and Second Alliance also have a simple capital structure and a
conservative approach towards gearing. This does not appear to have affected
performance. According to Micropal, Alliance has grown by 395 per cent over
the 10 years to the beginning of this month, and Second Alliance by 412 per
cent. This places them ninth and fifth respectively in the International
General sector. Over five years Alliance is third, with growth of 137 per
cent, and Second Alliance fourth on 131 per cent.
They did this with a reassuringly broad geographical spread of investments.
According to Lyndon Bolton, managing director of both trusts, the present
asset allocation of Alliance includes 56 per cent in the UK, 9 per cent in
the rest of Europe, 31 per cent in North America, only 1 per cent in Japan
and 4 per cent elsewhere in the Far East. The cash holding, almost all in
foreign currencies, is low at 4 per cent.
This is a high weighting in the UK by historic standards but the trust, true
to its origins, also has a strong exposure to North America. The emphasis of
the company remains rooted in stock-picking and value investing, with
broader asset allocation given lower prominence.
The top 10 investments of Alliance, when last recorded, were split equally
between the UK and the US. They were: Shell Transport &amp; Trading, Glaxo
Holdings, Wal-Mart Stores (an American retailer), Philip Morris, Rentokil
Group, Johnson &amp; Johnson, British Telecom, PepsiCo, British Gas and Merck.
Second Alliance's top 10 are similar, the only differences being that BAT
Industries and General Electric substitute for PepsiCo and Merck.
Bolton makes no apologies for establishing long-term relationships with
companies and making close contacts with their managements. He says: 'The
people who can do the best job for the shareholders in a general trust or
fund are the managers of very good companies. It's our job to try to get
some added advantage by using changes in share valuation to add value.'
Both trusts remain rooted in Dundee's business community. The weekly board
meeting takes place in the company's offices there and all the board members
live locally. Many of the private shareholders also live in the Dundee area.
Alliance had 22,000 at last count, excluding those who invested only through
nominees, via Peps or savings plans. This figure has increased substantially
in recent years, mainly due to the trust's strong showing in performance
tables.
Bolton, who joined Alliance in 1964, became joint manager in 1978 and sole
managing director in 1987. He says Dundee differs from London as an
investment centre only in its slower pace of life. As far as he is
concerned, the rest of the investment community moved south - Robert
Fleming, who was to give his name to London's largest investment trust
group, was a Dundee man on the board of one of the companies which merged to
become Second Alliance.
The Alliance companies remain true to the guiding principles of investment
trusts and have achieved strong investment performance in a range of world
markets.
Key Facts. On February 9, Alliance had net assets of Pounds 931m and market
capitalisation of Pounds 850m. Net asset value per share was 1847.6p and the
share price was 1687p, making a discount of 8.6 per cent. Second Alliance
had a discount of 8.5 per cent. The yield was 3.4 per cent.
Board. Both trusts have the same boards. The executive directors are Bolton
(also a director of the TSB Group, General Accident and Scottish Financial
Enterprise); Gavin Suggett, an accountant who is deputy managing director;
and Alan Young. Sir Robert Smith, the chairman since 1981, is a director of
several large Scottish companies including Bank of Scotland, Edinburgh
Investment Trust and Standard Life.
The other directors are Christopher Blake, chairman of the Glenrothes
Development Corporation; Sir Douglas Hardie, chairman of Grampian Television
and a director of Clydesdale Bank, among other companies; Andrew Thomson, a
director of DC Thomson; and Bruce Johnston, a director of companies
including Mid Wynd International investment trust.
Savings Scheme and Pep details. A savings scheme allows a minimum monthly
purchase of Pounds 50. Charges are Pounds 1 a month for the normal purchase,
plus broker's commission of 0.15 per cent and stamp duty of 0.5 per cent.
Thanks to their high non-European content, neither trust qualifies for the
full Pounds 6,000 annual Pep allowance - maximum investment per year is,
therefore, only Pounds 1,500.
The Alliance Pep allows investors to hold other individual equities as well,
but fees for investing in the trust element are the same as for the savings
scheme.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Directors' Transactions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SELLING remains the key to directors' share dealings. This week's trading
was notable for the high value of some transactions. Through Imaging
Systems, Serge Crasninaski sold 2,705,000 shares in Photo-Me International,
raising almost Pounds 10m. He and Imaging Systems still hold 14 per cent of
the company.
At Menvier-Swain, Charles Swain, the non-executive president, sold 2,389,583
shares at 573p. Some 1,251,709 were held beneficially and the sale leaves
Swain with no holding. The company also announced it was to seek a full
listing and a 1-for-8 rights issue.
The sale of 72,851 shares in Tadpole Technology at 288-290p by H. Kitchener
follows a period of strong price performance since the company came to the
market at 65p in December 1992.
Last year, the Ashley family announced its intention to reduce its total
holding in Laura Ashley from more than 50 per cent to about 30 per cent. Sir
Bernard Ashley, the non-executive chairman, sold 10m shares at 78.5p. The
family still holds 49 per cent. Directors of Filofax, the personal organiser
stationery company, have been acquiring shares regularly since the middle of
last year at prices as low as 30p. Three directors, including the finance
director, have now bought 1,650,907 at 80p.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Trusts eye smaller companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALLER companies are finding favour on both sides of the Atlantic with the
creation of two smaller companies investment trusts.
Foreign &amp; Colonial US Smaller Companies is, as its name implies, a trust
managed by F&amp;C which will hunt for bargains among the smaller companies in
America. It will take the same long-term capital growth approach as F&amp;C's US
Smaller Companies unit trust, which leads its sector over five years, and
will share the same managers.
On standard counter-cyclical principles, this might not seem a good time to
dive into the US. According to Finstat, F&amp;C's unit trust has grown by 56.6
per cent over the past six months, a growth rate which is scarcely
sustainable. But the dollar's recent rise against the pound accounts for
much of the strong performance, and several economists are forecasting that
this will continue, although more slowly.
James Findlay, manager of the new trust, says the stronger dollar will help
smaller companies competing mainly in the US domestic market, providing the
conditions for them to out-perform larger concerns, and that economic
recovery should allow growth.
F&amp;C's management team also believes that many of the strongest performers of
the past 10 years, bought on the strength of their brand name recognition,
are now over-valued with low yields. This could lead to a switch of funds
within Wall Street from larger to smaller companies.
In order to limit the risk that the shares will move to a discount to net
asset value, F&amp;C is giving the new trust a fixed life of 10 years and
attaching warrants that allow the holder to buy shares, at 100p apiece, on
November 30 in the years 1994 to 2002. Most investment trusts trade at a
discount.
The offer period runs until March 5 and dealings will start on March 11.
Maximum Pep investment is Pounds 1,500, as the trust does not qualify for
the full annual Pounds 6,000 allowance. Minimum subscription is Pounds 500.
In the UK, Charterhouse Tilney, the stockbroker, yesterday launched the
Pilot investment trust which will target the 1,000 or so smaller companies
with a market capitalisation of only Pounds 30m.
Rutherford Asset Management, which will run the trust, say that given the
recent cuts in interest rates and growing expectations of an improved
economy, it expects smaller companies to offer attractive investment
opportunities.
Pilot's chairman, Sir Peter Michael, who also chairs Cray Electronic
Holdings, said that those smaller companies which have survived the
recession are particularly well placed to take advantage of an economic
upturn.
A total of 50m ordinary shares at 100p each are being offered, and
Rutherford says Pounds 23m has been raised. Like the F&amp;C trust, the trust
has a fixed life. One warrant is attached to five ordinary shares in an
attempt to limit the perennial problem of investment trust new issues - that
the shares fall to a discount to net asset value. Dealing starts on March 1.
Investors would be able to buy shares at 100p from 1994 to 1998 by
exercising their warrants. The trust will be wound up in 2000 unless
shareholders wish otherwise, in which case its life will be extended for
another five years. Shares in the trust qualify for the full Pounds 6,000
annual Pep allowance but there is no Pep attached to it. Minimum investment
is Pounds 1,000.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Risk and reward in recovery funds -
They buy recession-hit shares cheaply, then wait for the upswing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECOVERY funds are beginning to live up to their name. These are inherently
riskier than most, the idea being to invest in companies which have got into
difficulties, causing a slump in their share price. The theory is that a
point is reached where these difficulties are over-estimated; at that stage,
the cheapness of the shares allows for large gains once the company
'recovers.'
The theory does badly in recessions, something shown clearly by the table of
recovery funds in the unit trust sector. 'We've had three miserable years,'
says Richard Hughes, fund manager of M &amp; G's Recovery unit trust, the
largest recovery fund in the UK growth sector. 'Companies which are
struggling do not find it easy to solve their problems when sales are
falling.'
As the figures show, however, recovery funds displayed a marked improvement
in performance in the year to February. Fidelity's fund, ranked 131 in the
UK growth sector in the three years to February, is now top.
Recovery funds are not a sector in themselves, and definitions of what
distinguishes them from a general UK growth or a special situations fund are
debatable.
Graham Clapp, manager of Fidelity's fund, says: 'When a company has problems
and the share price falls significantly, I buy the shares if I think
something will happen to reverse that - usually a change in management - or
if I anticipate a change in the industry.' He bought into Burton Group, the
largest holding in his fund, early last year after a change in management.
The ailing Midland bank also was seen as recovery stock in mid-1991 when
Clapp invested in it. As he explains: 'We anticipated a change in the
banking industry in terms of the profitability of the UK banking business,
and there had been a change in management.'
Fidelity's fund holds a maximum of 10 to 15 per cent in Footsie stock, but
the strongest concentration is in smaller companies. Similarly, M &amp; G's
Hughes chooses companies with a weak balance sheet, bad management or a
troublesome subsidiary. 'I wouldn't go off and buy Glaxo just because the
share price is low,' he says. A maximum of about 30 per cent is invested in
FT-SE 100 stock.
Like recovery stocks, special situations' stock often is undervalued, but
the reason for this is different. Clapp cites the example of Racal. 'When it
was starting off Vodaphone, you could not class it as being in a
recovery-type situation.'
While the recession has provided few chances for investors to make money, it
has given fund managers opportunities to buy. Patrick Evershed, hired from
Framlington by Brown Shipley to revive its recovery trust, which was
languishing at the bottom of the league tables, has taken a more 'purist'
view of recovery stock.
He has been buying into highly depressed sectors in the past 18 months
including estate agents (such as Savills), car dealers, house-builders, and
retailers. 'Recovery stocks have got to be companies which are badly hit
because of management problems or the recession,' he says. 'I'll buy
anything which is depressed and which I think will rise sharply.'
There lies the risk for the recovery style of investment. 'If it is run as a
genuine recovery fund, it either does very well or very poorly,' says Simon
Atherton, of Barclays Unicorn. 'But the main attraction of these funds is
the speed with which they deliver capital performance once there is a change
in the economy.'
The spur to improved performance figures in the year to February was the
UK's exit from the exchange rate mechanism. In the past, cyclical stocks
have benefited from the devaluation of sterling as the UK comes out of
recession - a process unlikely to have been repeated while the UK remained
within the ERM. 'Coming out was the best thing to have happened to recovery
stocks for a long while,' says Hughes. 'Stocks which were struggling
suddenly became more attractive.'
Can it last? Recovery stocks should do well if there is a sustained recovery
in the economy. For the first five months of last year, they showed a brief
upswing, only to fall back in the summer as the government affirmed its
commitment to the ERM. But if the economy is emerging from the latest
recession, they should perform strongly over a substantial period.
'Companies which had problems before the recession, but have managed to last
this long, are likely to see their fortunes get dramatically better,' says
Clapp. Hughes adds: 'The upswing may not have started now but, when it does,
I would expect it to last for three to four years.'
Recovery funds are likely to appeal only to those with strong nerves,
though. 'They are suitable for long-term investors who are willing to sweat
out the dips,' says Hughes.
In theory, smart investors buy into them as the economy begins to recover
and sell as it enters the next recession. But, as Hughes points out: 'The
problem is that no one spots the bottom.'
Long-term investors should be rewarded, however. 'Recovery funds should
outperform the index in the long-term to justify their existence,' says Hugo
Tudor, manager of Schroder's institutional recovery fund. The table shows
that six of the eight recovery funds in the 10 years to February
outperformed the FT Ordinary share index, while half beat the average for
the UK growth sector over the same period.

BRITISH AIRWAYS, still struggling to restore its dignity following the
Virgin Atlantic 'dirty tricks' affair, will report its third-quarter results
on Tuesday. But a Pounds 30m exceptional charge for re-organisation at
Gatwick after the Dan-Air acquisition will knock the quarter's profits back
to about Pounds 10m (Pounds 100m). Profits for the nine-month period to the
end of December are likely to be about Pounds 237m (Pounds 285m).
Glaxo, the UK's largest pharmaceuticals company, is expected to report on
Thursday that profits in the six months to December 31 will rise from Pounds
709m to about Pounds 775m. Sales growth of Zantac, the anti-ulcer drug which
accounts for about 40 per cent of the group's sales, has slowed as cheaper
rivals prepare to enter the market. The profits rise has been held back by
higher spending on r&amp;d and marketing.
Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, will on Tuesday report its first-quarter
results, covering the period to end-December. A small improvement is
expected on the Pounds 226m pre-tax recorded a year ago - possibly up to
Pounds 240m, excluding profits on disposals.
Much of the increase, though, will come from the translation of dollar
profits at a more favourable rate. And analysts will look for further
clarification of Lord Hanson's comments at the recent annual meeting that UK
margins were likely to be tighter this year.
Dalgety, the food group, is reporting interim results on Monday for the six
months to end-December. These are expected to show a small increase, to
Pounds 56m, from pre-tax profits of Pounds 53.8m last time. UK trading is
dull although there will be the benefit of Sooner Snacks, acquired in
February. A good performance is expected from the US operation.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: New look for tax forms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY taxpayers can expect to receive a new, multi-coloured tax form inside
their traditional buff envelopes from the Inland Revenue at the end of this
tax year in April. Around 8m self-employed people, and others who get the
form 11 personal income tax return, will be the first to experience the
results of the Revenue's comprehensive overhaul of layout.
After months of work with Wolff Olins, the design and corporate identity
consultants, the Revenue is about to start circulating the first of its
new-style forms. It is starting with Form 11 in its eight variants -
including versions for the clergy, Britons resident abroad, members of the
armed forces and Lloyd's underwriters - which will be sent out from April 6.
Those who have all their tax deducted automatically through pay-as-you-earn
 -the majority - will not be affected.
The old, dull brown form had eight pages that were two-thirds the size of an
A4 sheet. The new version is full A4, in two-tone peach and blue-grey on
white. But it also contains far more text and runs to 12 pages.
'My initial impression was that it looked horrendous,' says Martin Donn,
personal tax manager at accountant Blick Rothenberg. 'But, in fact, it is
jolly good. It will be much easier to complete. It is much more
user-friendly.' Erica Stary, from tax lawyer Taylor Joynson Garrett, adds:
'I take my hat off to the Inland Revenue for trying, but I'm unhappy with
the consequences. It will help the Revenue more than the taxpayer.'
The Revenue says the aim is to allow taxpayers to understand and complete
the form more easily, while also cutting its costs in having to deal with
incorrect returns.
The form attempts to introduce a more logical format, with instructions down
the left-hand side and columns for figures to be completed on the right. The
language used is more helpful and consistent in style, and less
authoritarian.
Many see it as the start of a move towards self-assessment, by which
taxpayers will estimate their own tax and send in the amount to be paid with
their form. This could be introduced as early as 1996.
If the form turns out to be as easy to complete as the Revenue hopes, it
certainly should reduce the scope of work for accountants and other tax
practitioners.
It will also pave the way for 40 other forms and documents, scheduled for
the new tax year, which have been re-designed as part of a wider programme
to update all 800 official forms now in use.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Societies hit BES trail - John
Authers prepares for a flood of new tax shelter schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING societies jumped on the business expansion scheme bandwagon this
week. The result should be a flood of new tax shelter schemes which allow
access to money within five years.
Until now, societies have been unable to take advantage of the BES because
rules could not be agreed with their regulator, the Building Societies
Commission. Several banks have sold their repossessed housing to BES
companies in return for guarantees of loans after a short period, but
building societies cannot do this.
The solution, first hit on by Bristol &amp; West in conjunction with the
sponsor, Close Brothers, is to establish a separate company, funded by the
society, to sell the repossessed properties to a BES company. This 'middle
man' company then provides the guarantees.
Another scheme was produced quickly by National &amp; Provincial, and sponsored
by Johnson Fry. More seem certain to follow.
Bessa Bristol and West, with a capacity of Pounds 45m, will buy repossessed
B &amp; W properties from Residential Property Reversions. After five years, RPR
will pay Pounds 1.05 for every Pounds 1 invested now. This has been
underwritten with a sterling certificate of deposit from B &amp; W, which also
will make non-recourse loans to investors after six months at a rate of 73p
for every Pounds 1 invested. Anthony Yadgaroff, of the Allenbridge Group,
suggests that this scheme is appropriate only for those who want to take the
money after six months.
N &amp; P Multiple Choice Growth Scheme, with a capacity of Pounds 50m, is more
of an oddity. There is no guaranteed exit after five years but non-recourse
loans are available at several points - of 74p after six months, 78.3p after
a year, 87.7p after two years and 98.2p after three. Maximum investment is
Pounds 25,000 and only one loan will be made available to each investor.
The building society schemes are likely to hog investors' money. The other
new BES schemes launched this week, which are not to be confused with those
above, include:
Aegis II. Sponsored by Matrix Securities, this will buy properties for
Leicester university which, after five years, will pay Pounds 1.13 1/2 for
every Pounds 1 paid now. This has been underwritten by Barclays bank. There
is no non-recourse loan facility.
Cavendish Geared. Sponsored by Smith &amp; Williamson and Matrix-Securities,
this is an unguaranteed scheme which will try to exploit low prices in the
London residential property market. Its extra twist comes from the gearing
it can obtain from fixed or capped mortgages of up to 60 per cent of the
value after refurbishing the properties it buys. It aims to cover mortgage
interest payments from its rental yield; this allows greater profits if the
housing market recovers.
Hunter II. Sponsored by Property Enterprise Managers, this will look for
bargains in the London residential property market. It has no 'guaranteed'
level of pay-back after five years but is aiming to profit as much as
possible. Once the BES qualifying period is over, the company intends to
liquidate and pay cash to shareholders by April 5 1999.
Jerry's Home Store. This is definitely not to be confused with the others as
it invests in a trading company, not residential property. The company,
founded by a team of former Marks &amp; Spencer directors, will start a North
American-style home furnishings shop in the Sloane Square area of west
London. It is sponsored by London broker Townsley, and there are no
guarantees or early exit options.
The week also saw an innovative application of the BES from Fairclough
Homes, part of the AMEC group. Its Activator programme allows potential
house-buyers to rent their homes for four years at a fixed price, and then
convert to a mortgage.
The price at which they buy in 1997 is fixed at its present market level -
which could be of great advantage if the market takes off - and the rent
level is low. The weekly rent on a property valued at Pounds 40,000 is
Pounds 30.69, according to Fairclough, while interest payments on a mortgage
for this amount, at 7.99 per cent, would be Pounds 49.94. A Pounds 125,000
house would have a rent of Pounds 95.91.
Tenants would have to get clearance for a mortgage - from the Royal Bank of
Scotland - before taking up their tenancy. They would then have to buy the
property in 1997, whatever their circumstances. But the mortgage is
guaranteed, even if the tenant loses income during the four years, and the
options to buy the house are transferable if necessary (although this might
involve a lot of paperwork).
The finance for this comes from the Flexit BES companies, launched two weeks
ago. Their low guarantee to shareholders after five years (Flexit will pay
only Pounds 1.05 for every Pounds 1 invested this year) has allowed
Fairclough finance cheap enough to make the Activator offer. The scheme is
offering 750 new properties in 40 locations. If one of them seems
appropriate, then it is hard to see how purchasing it could be made much
cheaper.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Savers to get less
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAVERS will be relieved to discover that the building societies have not
taken advantage of the last one-point base rate cut to widen their margins
by more than a fraction.
Halifax, the UK's largest, this week announced gross interest rate cuts of
between 0.6 and 0.8 percentage points on its savings accounts.
When it cut its mortgage rate by just over half a percentage point (from
8.55 per cent to 7.99) on January 26 - the day base rates came down to 6 per
cent - Halifax said it had given 'special consideration' to its savers in
setting the new level.
In most cases, the gross rates on its 90-day savings and instant access
accounts are coming down by 0.65 of a point. In some cases, they are
reducing by 0.6 of a point.
This means that someone with Pounds 25,000 or over in Instant Xtra Plus
(Halifax's main instant-access savings account) will receive 5.5 per cent
gross, while a similar deposit in 90-Day Extra will earn 6.2 per cent. The
Tessa rate has been reduced from 7.5 to 6.75.
There had been fears that societies might be tempted to follow the banks,
which have cut savings rates by larger percentages to widen their margins.
Abbey National reduced its mortgage rate by 0.51 of a percentage point but
cut gross rates by 0.95 of a point on the highest band (Pounds 25,000 plus)
of Instant Saver, its instant-access savings account. The rate on this band
is now 5.1 per cent gross.
Lower balances have seen smaller reductions of 0.65 per cent, but this
represents a high proportionate drop. The gross rate on deposits up to
Pounds 500 has been cut from 1.15 per cent to 0.5 per cent.
Midland has also cut almost all gross savings rates by 1 point, with a
handful going down by 0.75 of a point and one by 1.25 points - but it has
also reduced rates on its credit cards. The annual percentage rate will drop
from 25.3 per cent to 23.1 per cent from March 2.
Overdraft rates have fallen by 1.3 to 1.4 points but the reduction on the
bank's mortgage rate was only 0.56 of a point.
The societies, which depend on savers for their funds, have, like Halifax,
been reluctant to cut savings rates too steeply for fear of losing deposits.
They had a net outflow of funds in five months of last year, and net
receipts for the year totalled only Pounds 295m compared with Pounds 5.8bn
in 1991.
Chelsea building society, which cut its mortgage rate by 0.51 of a point to
the market rate of 7.99 per cent, reduced its gross savings rates by up to
0.75 of a point this week.
Leeds Permanent reduced gross rates on Liquid Gold, its instant-access
savings account by between 0.5 and 0.75 of a point following its mortgage
rate cut of 0.56. The rate paid on Pounds 25,000 and above is 5.6 per cent
gross.
From today, gross rates on Solid Gold, Leeds' 90-day savings account, are
cut by 0.7 of a point on the top and bottom of its five bands with the
middle bands, covering deposits of between Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 49,000,
reduced by 0.55.
Someone with Pounds 50,000 and above will earn 7 per cent gross, while
deposits up to this level but over Pounds 25,000 will earn 6.55 per cent.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: So where does the market go now? -
Scheherazade Daneshkhu asks fund managers to pilot private investors through
its choppy waters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU

<TEXT>
THE STOCK market has had a strong start to the year with the FT-SE 100
touching an all-time high of 2,900 last week, although it had fallen back to
2,843 by last night. How, then, should private investors, especially those
with large cash holdings who have been disappointed by the fall in interest
rates, view their prospects?
The Weekend FT asked investment strategists from large institutions for
their opinions on the market over the short and long terms. All agreed it
would outperform fixed-interest instruments, such as gilts, in the long term
but there were differences about the extent.
Norwich Union
Investment strategist Mike Grimble says: 'The market has been strong since
the beginning of 1993 but we have short-term concerns, arising mainly out of
what will happen to UK interest rates.
'Our short-term view is that there will be a cut in base rates before the
Budget, which will have a positive effect on the market because it will
demonstrate the government's strong commitment to growth. Some of that
expectation has already been factored in to the present level of the market.
'In the medium to long term, we are expecting earnings and profits to
recover and better dividend growth prospects. We are expecting an upturn in
economic activity, but it is difficult to know how quickly it will pick up.
We would expect the FT-SE 100 to end the year at 3,000 and to rise to 3,300
at the end of 1994.
'There will certainly be volatility, particularly in the first half of the
year as the market responds to interest rate cuts. It should be more subdued
in the second half. Investors should expect large day-by-day movements but
the tendency of the market will be upwards.
'Gilts will benefit in the short term, but the overhang of the public sector
borrowing requirement (PSBR) will depress the longer-term outlook.
'We are expecting a low inflation and low interest rate environment in the
long term. There may be some short-term inflationary effects from sterling's
devaluation as a result of leaving the exchange rate mechanism (ERM), but we
do not expect a return to high inflation. Our estimate for the year-end is
2.5 per cent, with this figure rising a little in 1994 but not to a major
degree.
'In the long term, we still expect equities to outperform fixed-interest
instruments, but we do not expect the difference to be as great as it was in
the past. Our projection is that the average annual real return on equities
in the 1990s will be 8 per cent compared with 15 per cent in the 1980s. The
corresponding figure for fixed-interest instruments will be 6 per cent in
the 1990s compared with 7 per cent in the 1980s.'
Henderson Crosthwaite
Research director Eric Hathorn is cautious. 'We remain confident that the
index will end the year higher than at the beginning because certain
benefits will come through. I see Footsie at over 3,000 by the end of the
year, but not much more than that. By the end of next year it should be up
to 3,300, but only if there is no major crisis.
'My reasons for thinking the index will be higher is that companies involved
in overseas trade will get a boost, particularly those with US subsidiaries.
In addition, UK companies have pared themselves to the bone in the recession
and, if we assume some extra loading on their plants, the gearing effect
should be strong. But expectations of a very strong boost to exporters may
be exaggerated, since obvious export markets such as Europe are depressed.
'We also have fears that the market may be fully valued. Expectations that
there will be strong profit growth in 1993 have been factored in. But demand
would have to pick up pretty quickly to reverse closures which are still
continuing. There are also fears regarding the balance of payments,
particularly if interest rates were to come down too far. We also worry that
inflation will rise.
'The good side is that there still is a lot of private money to come into
the market. Against that is the PSBR demand. The government will rely on
gilt issues to fund it, so there will be competition for institutional money
from gilts. The effect will be to depress the equity market. By the end of
the 1990s, I would see the average annual real rate of return on equities as
not higher than 11 per cent, compared with 15 per cent in the 1980s.
Inflation helped to fuel share price performance in the 1980s, but that
performance will be more modest in the 1990s because of lower inflation.'
SG Warburg
Its UK economist, Kevin Gardiner, says: 'True, the market has risen quite
sharply. It reached the level of our year-end forecast of 2,900 last week.
We do not expect the level to be higher than this at the end of the year
because we expect rights issues to cap the overall level of the market. In
recent history, only in 1987 was the price/earnings ratio higher on the
market than today's 17. We foresee the p/e ratio falling back to 15 at the
end of the year.
'We believe that the current yield of 4.25 per cent on the market compares
favourably with current returns from banks and building societies. We expect
bad news in one or two areas which make us believe that in 1993 it will pay
to pick stock carefully. And the old motto, 'Never invest what you cannot
afford to lose,' holds as good now as ever.
'In recent months, institutional investors have pushed up the price of
stocks in the capital goods sector in areas such as building materials,
heavy engineering and construction. However, we believe there are dividend
cuts to come which will affect the price of these stocks. We favour strong
balance sheet sectors such as utilities, some textile companies, food
retailing and the media. These companies are not as dependent as the capital
goods industries on a revival of strong demand in the market.
'The economy will pick up steam in 1994, but we expect interest rates to
edge up to 8 per cent at the end of the year because of increased inflation.
Unit wage costs are falling, which will keep inflation subdued in the short
term, but we would see the underlying rate at 4.2 per cent at the end of the
year and 4.5 per cent in 1994.'
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
Mark Brown, the chief UK strategist, is relatively cautious about the
market's performance in the short term. He expects Footsie to drop to 2,700
by mid-year but to end it at 2,900. 'We have been positive for the past two
years but, since last November, I have turned cautious, mainly because the
market has done so well by anticipating recovery. The return on equities has
averaged 20 per cent per annum in the past two years and that cannot
continue.
'The other reason for caution is the obvious. The government will have to
face its funding problem in the next financial year. The PSBR will put
pressure on sterling and the government will have to change course on its
funding policy, which will be difficult for the markets to take. We think
the market is being too complacent about this. In the longer term, say two
to five years, equities are the place to be in, compared with other assets
such as gilts or cash.
'In the past 10 years, the average annual real return on equities was 13.4
per cent compared with 6.3 per cent from gilts and 6.2 per cent from cash.
Our assessment for the next five years is that the total annual real return
on equities will be 8 per cent, compared with 3.5 per cent on gilts.
Inflation would average 5 per cent a year over the next five years.
'It is normally not the best time to buy into the market when it is rising
but, historically, investors have tended to do this. The market would appear
to be on the expensive side on a p/e ratio; it is also on the expensive side
using the dividend yield on the FT-All Share, which is 4.3 compared with an
historical average of 5. But you have to weigh this against very low
short-term interest rates.
'However, if Footsie does get down to 2,700, that would be a more
comfortable level at which investors could enter. Our main advice to private
investors would be to think also of putting money into bond instruments and
overseas equities. Overseas bond funds look particularly attractive.'
BZW
Bill Smith, the head of UK research, also believes that, given the options,
savers with money on deposit should be looking elsewhere, particularly at
index-linked gilts and equities. 'On the income side, there is no longer a
big income penalty in owning shares because of the last cut in base rates.
But there will still be capital risk because the market is volatile.
'There is a high valuation on the market because of the low earnings
picture, and the first year of a recovery is always going to be risky.
Private investors could try to lessen risk by spreading it through the use
of collective funds such as unit and investment trusts.
'The main problem facing the market is that the government, in its need to
finance the PSBR, will structure its own financing needs sufficiently
attractively to make shares less appealing. We still see Footsie reaching
3,100 by the end of the year.'
Capel-Cure Myers
Simon Rubinsohn, the portfolio strategist, provided the most bullish
outlook. He expects Footsie to rise to 3,300 by the end of this year and
3,600 at the end of 1994. 'We haven't had much good news from companies but,
as they report their results, we expect the chairmen's statements to be
positive. This along with signs of profitability emerging, will help
sentiment.
'We also take a relaxed view of the influence of the PSBR on the gilt
market. There will be underfunding, but we do not think that the government
will necessarily be obliged to push up gilt yields to sell its stock.
'We have quite a high exposure to index-linked gilts, which we are
maintaining, but we are moving out of conventional gilts into equities
because we feel that, within the next year, the real returns available on
them will be less than for equities.
'The sectors we favour are capital goods such as building materials,
electricals and engineering, and the 'second-liners' such as FT-SE 250
stock. We are cautious on stores because we do not see a consumer pick-up in
sectors such as health and household. Companies with dollar exposure should
do well: we expect the dollar to strengthen to Dollars 1.30 to the pound by
the end of the year. We are also optimistic about inflation and think it
will average 2.7 per cent by the end of this year and 3.7 per cent next
year.'

FT  13 FEB 93 / Markets: Bright outlook for composites - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS LOOK good for Commercial Union, one of the biggest insurance
groups, judging by the stock market's positive response to the company's
Pounds 428m rights issue on Wednesday.
The one-for-five offer, which gives CU shareholders the opportunity to buy
new shares at the discounted price of 490p, was accompanied by a results
statement showing better-than- expected profit figures for 1992. It has been
well received by investors.
'The issue was designed to take off like a space rocket,' said one analyst.
It has come amid an improvement in market sentiment towards the sector
resulting from forecasts of an across the board return to profitability in
1993.
The five composites - so-called because they underwrite a mixture of general
and life insurance - lost around Pounds 2bn in 1990 and 1991, mainly because
of an upsurge of weather and recession-related losses. But because so much
capital has been sucked out of the industry, competition has declined and
companies have been able to increase premium rates substantially. The loss
of several thousand jobs in the last two years, has also improved
productivity and profits.
The two companies hardest hit in the downturn have both witnessed
spectacular rises in the share prices in recent months. Guardian Royal
Exchange was up 50 per cent last year, while the market capitalisation of
Royal Insurance, which briefly left the FT-SE 100 after omitting its
dividend last February, doubled between September and January.
Sun Alliance (up 19 per cent) and General Accident (up 26 per cent) also
grew ahead of the FT-A All-share index last year, while CU itself rose by 29
per cent in 1992.
CU's price has fallen only marginally since the rights issue and most London
analysts have been revising upwards profit forecasts for 1993.
The market has been impressed by the strength of the company's growth,
especially in the UK market in the fourth quarter of 1992, as well as
pre-tax profits of Pounds 32.4m for 1992.
Steven Bird, analyst with Smith New Court, expects the share to outperform
the All-share index by more than 15 per cent this year with the dividend
yield falling below the market average by the end of the year. He says that
of all the composites CU is in the best position to take advantage of the
improvement in insurance markets.
David Hudson, of Credit Laing Lyonnais, who has been sceptical about CU in
the past, has revised his view: 'It is the first time I have been a buyer
for seven years. The shares will outperform.'
'Upwards revisions in profit figures tend to be good for market sentiment.
The management is top notch. You cannot find any fault with what they have
done.'
There is less unanimity about the prospects for other insurers, however,
with many analysts suggesting that investors have already discounted future
profits.
Recent figures indicating that mortgage arrears are running ahead of
expectations, show that there may be more bad news in store for Royal
Insurance and Sun Alliance which have most exposure to domestic mortgage
indemnity (dmi) insurance. The policies cover mortgage lenders against
losses on some of their sales of repossessed properties.
Paul Hodges, of James Capel, suggests that if other companies follow CU's
example and seek to raise capital, the flood of cash into the sector could
re-expand insurance capacity, triggering price competition.
'The input of capital could lead to a curtailment of the upturn. This is the
risk that is emerging,' says Hodges.
He says this could aggravate a decoupling of the sector between companies
which have stronger balance sheets and were able to expand or maintain
market share during the downturn - CU, General Accident and Sun Alliance -
and those which have weaker balance sheets and have been forced to shrink
their business - Royal Insurance and Guardian Royal Exchange.

Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Widows has cut bonuses on its with-profits contracts. The company
said that in spite of a good 1992, bonuses had to take account of low
nominal investment returns compared with the 1980s, and the current low base
rates. Maturity values for a policy started by a 29-year-old man paying
Pounds 30 per month premiums are Pounds 58,754 for a 25-year policy, down
from Pounds 61,505 last year. Over ten years, maturity values on the same
assumptions fell from Pounds 7,295 to Pounds 6,619.

Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prudential, which provides one eighth of the UK's personal pensions, has
added three new flexible features to all its pensions. It is now possible to
take breaks from paying premiums of up to five years without incurring any
extra charges. Savers can also have as many five-year breaks in
contributions as they like, although this is not recommended. Conversions
between old-style retirement annuity contracts, personal pensions and
additional voluntary contributions, often necessary when moving jobs, can
also now be made free of charge. Finally, the level of premiums paid can now
be altered, with no extra charge. All the changes take effect
retrospectively - they affect all Prudential pensions, retirement annuities
and freestanding additional voluntary contributions already in force.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Pharmaceutical stocks slide - At a
Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Several UK pharmaceuticals stocks fell sharply this week as US investors
decided that there were still too many questions surrounding the health and
household sector.
The large US institutions have decided that the growth rate of a number of
drugs stocks, particularly Glaxo, is declining. They also note increasing
signs of a US recovery and the subsequent need to move away from stocks that
perform well in times of recession. Finally, they are concerned at the
threat of price reform proposed by the Clinton administration.
UK investors are more enthusiastic and there were signs at the end of the
week that prices might have stabilised.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Markets: Please sir, we'd like a little time - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK market got a Pounds 204.5m begging letter this week, disguised as
a one-for-two rights issue from Trafalgar House. True, the issue is fully
underwritten, so the company is something of a hypothetical mendicant. But
that does not make the request any the less pressing. For example, the issue
document makes clear that any shareholder taking up the rights will be
financing his own dividends, since the 3.25p payout promised for the year
ending in September 1993 will come from reserves. Those reserves are heavily
depleted by write-downs and exceptional losses on the company's Pounds 724m
property portfolio. Without the proceeds of the rights issue, Trafalgar
House would be Pounds 92m short of the Pounds 500m of capital and reserves
required under its banking covenants. It is not surprising, perhaps, that
the new ordinary shares are being pitched at a 32 per cent discount to the
market price. Or that they are accompanied by a significant tightening of
the grip of Honkgong Land, a sister company of Jardine Matheson and part of
the Keswick family group. The arrival of the Keswicks, who first took an
interest in Trafalgar House last year, has already brought about a change at
the very top of the company. Now, through the mechanism of the rights issue,
they may well take their stake close to the 29.9 per cent for which they
made an unsuccessful bid last year. While all this has been going on the
price of the company's ordinary shares has doubled. It touched a low of 39p
last year, before the Keswicks arrived, and was 88 1/2 p immediately before
the rights issue. Since then it has fallen, closing on Friday at 76p, down
16 per cent on the week.
The Keswicks have proved shrewd investors to follow in the case of one UK
company, Kwik Save, which has risen from roughly 300p to over 800p since
they took an interest in early 1987. Whether their judgment remains as sound
in the case of Trafalgar House is open to question: much turns on the
outlook for the heavy engineering business, which is now the company's core
activity, and the market for the group's other subsidiaries.
On the first point, the short-term prospects are poor, since levels of
activity in this business are still falling. On the second point, the
company makes it clear that the rights issue is intended to buy time to
allow non-core activities to be sold off at a reasonable price. A verdict on
the shares thus revolves around how much time is needed - and how much of it
Pounds 205m will buy.
Trafalgar's directors were not the only people buying time this week. The
governor-designate of the Bank of England, Eddie George, was busy at the
same task. He was attempting to stave off the moment at which it becomes
necessary to raise interest rates to prop up the pound.
The urgency of this activity stemmed from the slide in sterling, which fell
for most of the week, touching DM 2.3245 in early trading on Friday, a drop
of 7 pfennigs on the week and a devaluation of 21 per cent from the old ERM
central rate. The stock market, casting off the insouciance with which it
had regarded the falling pound in recent weeks, suddenly woke up to the fear
that its weakness might force the government to raise interest rates: on
Tuesday, the FT-SE 100 index dropped 38.7 points, to 2,831.3.
By Thursday, an urgent defence of the pound was clearly needed. First, on
Thursday, Eddie George gave an unusually personal speech in Frankfurt,
capital of hard-money rectitude, in which he stressed his commitment to
monetary stability. Then, on Friday, still in Germany, he gave a press
conference. 'It is clear,' he said, 'that if the exchange rate weakened
substantially further, we would have no option but to tighten policy
further.'
Of the two, the Thursday speech may prove the more memorable. George
stressed the importance of the Bank's new quarterly inflation reports - the
first of which is due on Tuesday - and the chancellor's emphasis, when
appointing the new team at the Bank, on the task of bringing about a lasting
reduction in the rate of inflation.
'We take both these responsibilities extremely seriously within the Bank,'
George told his German audience. 'They may not amount to constitutional
independence for the central bank, such as you enjoy here, but in our view
they represent a very considerable forward movement, which will do very well
to be going on with.'
In spite of these stirring words, the pound continued to fall after the
speech. Its recovery, which started in mid-morning on Friday, stemmed not
from any rhetoric from the Bank, but from the visible signs of lack of
inflationary pressure in the economy.
The consumer price index for January showed that prices were only 1.7 per
cent higher than a year ago, the lowest figure since 1967. Even stripping
out the effect of lower interest rates, inflation was still substantially
better than the City's economists had expected: the underlying rate was only
3.2 per cent, a drop of half a percentage point in a month when most
economists were expecting a rise close to the government's intended 4 per
cent ceiling.
The drop in underlying inflation was the more striking since Tuesday saw a
sharp rise in manufacturers' costs, which are growing at 7.2 per cent a
year.
Gilts rallied strongly on the inflation news, with the yield on 10-year
gilts dropping to 7.9 per cent, the first time it had been below 8 per cent
since at least 1976. Sterling recovered, to close at DM 2.3480. It was a
development the Bank of England's new man can regard with some satisfaction.
But it also offered a warning: from the market's point of view, deeds count
more than words.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Markets: General dismay turns to General glee - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'A BILLION here, a billion there, and pretty soon you're talking about real
money.' Senator Everett Dirksen, a prominent Republican senator during the
1960s, might have been talking about government spending but his sarcasm
echoed down the canyons of Wall Street this week after General Motors and
Ford announced collective annual losses for 1992 of more than Dollars 30bn.
The majority of the lost billions is not 'real' money in the normal sense,
though. GM reported a Dollars 23.5bn deficit, the largest in US corporate
history; but excluding the billions in special non-cash charges taken to
cover changes in the accounting of medical benefits, the auto-maker actually
was in reasonable shape last year.
For the fourth quarter, it actually made a profit of Dollars 273m - a
significant turnaround for the troubled Detroit behemoth which, in the same
quarter last year, lost Dollars 520m. Investors were delighted by the
improvements in operating earnings, especially the rebound in GM's cash
flow.
In fact, this past week must rank as one of the best in GM's recent history.
It opened with a host of negative newspaper stories about the previous
week's decision by a jury to award Dollars 101m in punitive damages to the
parents of a 17-year-old who died in a fiery crash in a GM pickup truck.
The company's decision to appeal the ruling, and to step up its fight
against charges that some of its trucks are dangerous because of
badly-placed petrol tanks, was criticised widely as ill-judged and risky. By
midweek, however, morale at GM was soaring after a devastating attack on the
television network NBC, which last year ran a documentary about the
controversial pickups and their allegedly deadly petrol tank design. Filing
suit against the network, GM argued persuasively that NBC had rigged a
televised test accident to show the explosive effect of a side-on collision.
On Wednesday, NBC offered a fulsome apology for the rigged accidents. Within
two days, GM was reporting its better-than-expected fourth-quarter results.
By the end of the week, GM stock had jumped 9 per cent in value to more than
Dollars 41.
While GM was bouncing back from adversity, Ford was also enjoying some rare
positive publicity. Despite a slightly disappointing fourth quarter, sales
of its cars and trucks in the US were up last year and its share of the
domestic market also was higher.
However, like GM and other big US corporations, Ford had to take a big
charge to cover accounting changes which, on top of the cost of a major
restructuring of its European operations, left it with a 1992 loss of
Dollars 7.4bn.
The billions were being thrown about liberally elsewhere among the country's
corporate elite (or former elite) this week. Sears, Roebuck said on Thursday
that it will spend Dollars 4bn over the next five years upgrading its 800
stores as part of the plan, announced last year, to return to its roots as a
retailer.
Investors welcomed the facelift, along with details of Sears' proposed
disposal of the Coldwell Banker property subsidiary and the Dean Witter
brokerage unit, and the retailer's stock rose by Dollars 2 to Dollars 52 1/8
.
While some of the nation's biggest corporate names were enjoying a good
week, the overall market picture darkened somewhat.
By midday yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which only a week ago
reached an all-time closing high of 3,442.14, was struggling to hold its
head above 3,400.
Nothing specific had triggered the setback, save for some typical post-rally
profit-taking and consolidation. But a slight uneasiness could be detected
on Wall Street about the previous week's advances - a feeling that the
markets may have been pushed too far, too early.
The recent rise in the Dow, and the more spectacular gains in the wider and
secondary markets, have been built on a growing confidence that, in his
first year, almost everything that can go right for President Clinton will
go right.
If the pace of economic growth (helped by a fiscal stimulus package)
continues to accelerate; if the Clinton administration manages to push
deficit-reduction measures through Congress; if inflation remains dormant;
if domestic interest rates stay low; if the dollar remains competitive on
foreign markets; if consumer confidence stays on its upward course; and if
the corporate restructuring and cost-cutting of 1990-1992 continues to pay
off dividends, then the recent surge in demand for stocks will have been
justified.
That, however, as many investors realised this week, is a lot of ifs.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Markets: For once, don't blame the insurers - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INSURANCE industry is worried about its image. The Association of
British Insurers, its trade body, is launching a campaign to counter the bad
publicity it believes it has incurred in the past year.
Some of the measures it is considering are welcome: for one thing, the ABI
says the advertising campaign will tell people not to take out life
assurance if they cannot afford it. This is an attempt to limit high lapse
rates in the industry. These early surrender levels have caused concern,
particularly since the Securities and Investments Board (Sib), the main
regulating body for the industry, disclosed the extent of early lapses at
the end of 1991.
Sib said that, in 1990, 37.1 per cent of unit-linked life policies and 23.1
per cent of with-profits policies were terminated within two years of being
started. Most of these were sold on the back of a mortgage.
As regular readers will know, early surrender values are so poor that most
who cashed in early will have lost money. There have long been fears that
endowment mortgages are oversold because of the high commissions paid to
intermediaries such as banks and building societies.
Sir David Walker, then chief of Sib, said he thought too much pressure was
being put on consumers to take out endowment mortgages because of the
industry's remuneration structure. At one stage in the 1980s, four of every
five mortgages sold were endowments.
Banks and building societies would deny they failed to give best advice to
customers on their type of mortgage. Yet, there are times when the limited
choice presented to consumers is all too obvious.
Take the case of fixed-rate mortgages. John Charcol, the insurance broker,
said this week it had received an unprecedented demand for fixed-rate
mortgages. This is not surprising, since the standard prevailing mortgage
rate is at its lowest since 1971.
Some of this week's offers certainly are attractive. Alliance &amp; Leicester
building society has a fixed rate of 5.95 per cent for one year, 6.35 per
cent for two years and 7.99 per cent for five.
Midland bank will fix your mortgage at 6.75 per cent for two years and 8.49
per cent until the end of January 1998. Woolwich yesterday launched a
two-year fix at 7.25 per cent.
But there is a snag. These fixed rates are available only if you take out an
endowment or pension-linked mortgage. Those wanting a repayment or
interest-only mortgage are being offered nothing at all.
One reader, who has a repayment mortgage with National Westminster,
complained that he would have to go through with the full costs of a
remortgage because NatWest will not offer him a fixed rate on his existing
mortgage.
One line of defence put out by lenders is that they are under competitive
pressure and can offer lower interest rates only by tying the mortgage to
life products - a tenuous argument. Another line of defence is based on the
funding of fixed-rate loans. The lender borrows funds on the money markets
at a fixed rate. It then offers them to customers at a higher, fixed rate.
'In order for this to be profitable for us, we lend it for the same period
at a fixed rate of interest,' said a spokesman for the Midland. 'We would,
potentially, get back less interest on a repayment mortgage.'
With these, each month's payments includes interest and an element of
capital repayment. The interest decreases as the capital reduces and the
rate of its repayment increases. Endowment or pension-linked mortgages are
interest-only loans which rely on the maturing fund to pay off the capital.
Nevertheless, this does not appear to prevent other lenders from being able
to offer fixed rates on repayment mortgages. Chelsea building society has a
fixed rate of 6.99 per cent until the end of June 1995, and 7.99 until the
end of June 1997. Leeds &amp; Holbeck has a one-year fix at 5.99 per cent and a
four-year rate of 7.99.
The catch in these offers is that you have to take out buildings and
contents insurance from the society as a condition of the loan. As the
Weekend FT has pointed out more than once, this is often more expensive than
similar insurance available elsewhere.
Abbey National, Halifax, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester and TSB are, however, among
those offering competitive fixed-rate loans without requiring
insurance-related products to be taken out, although packages for first-time
buyers still demand them.
Last year, the department of trade and industry said it was 'determined to
ensure that home-owners are not coerced into buying services from mortgage
lenders that they either do not want or would prefer to buy elsewhere.' But
measures have not yet been implemented and the Consumers' Association calls
the proposals wholly inadequate.'
So, the insurance industry should not take all the blame for the robust
selling tactics of the banks and building societies, which rely on insurance
products for an increasing proportion of income - Halifax earned 27 per cent
of its profits from insurance commission in 1990, according to the Office of
Fair Trading. But it could support measures such as commission disclosure,
and issue clear warnings that endowments do not guarantee to pay off a
mortgage, so consumers can make a more informed choice. If the insurance
industry really wants to improve its image, that would be a good start.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Fantasy land faces a change of direction: Is it art or is it
Hollywood? Nigel Andrews on the struggle between movie moguls and
movie-makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE HAVE always been two Hollywoods. One is the place on your crinkled
road map of Los Angeles. Drive there and you find a few bell-ringing names
like Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street jostling with acres of seedy
anonymity. Hardly a studio in sight: most of these are miles away in Burbank
or Culver City.
Then there is Hollywood the concept. This is a whole different mirage and
for most people it goes like this. In a palm-strewn kingdom on the Pacific,
men and women strive to create the dream of a demotic culture. Brash but
lovable moguls hand down commands; directors crack whips; and those
divinities we call stars act out our fantasies under a cloudless sky.
Any time up to the late 1950s the American film industry could have
recognised this image, however exaggerated, staring back from its mirror.
But today the business is prey to foreign takeovers, kamikaze production
costs and frantic head-scratchings over cinema's technological future. The
Dream Factory, goes the buzz, is waking up to new realities.
On a recent visit, I quizzed eight top movie people on the state of their
art. Behind the particular questions lay two broad ones. Is Hollywood still
'Hollywood' - the town that 50 years ago, circa Gone With The Wind and
Casablanca, set standards for high-power popular art unequalled in human
history? And is the American film industry, which once nurtured such keepers
of the new-world flame as DW Griffith and John Ford, still American in
spirit and letter?
The six main studios still keep their historic names. But two are now
Japanese-owned (Columbia/Sony, Universal/Matsushita); one was owned by an
Italian before falling into the hands of French creditors (MGM); and a
fourth, 20th Century Fox, is owned by an Australian newspaper tycoon who is
now a US citizen.
Although the first wave of invasion fright is over, some distinguished
people still shudder at the spectacle of - as they see it - the US's most
precious institution being asset-stripped for non-Americans.
I found the veteran Universal producer Ross Hunter, who poured money into
the studio's coffers for 20 years with hits such as Pillow Talk, Imitation
Of Life and Airport, still raging at the way the studio had been sold to
foreign interests.
Hunter belongs to the school that asks: could they now make a film about
Hirohito? 'Will there be interference in story matter? Of course there will.
If I owned a foreign studio, do you think I wouldn't interfere?'
But film-maker Barry Levinson, whose own sweet-and-sour versions of the
American dream include Rain Man and Bugsy, belongs to a newer generation.
For him, foreign ownership is a fact of life and a factor of American
incompetence.
'It's because we've run our own industry into the ground. Take MGM. Kirk
Kerkorian raped that company for 20 years, sold off everything he could,
destroyed studios. The 1980s was an age of corporate raiders who couldn't
care less about the products they were buying or selling. So you can't blame
foreign intrusion when our own greed has made the void for the Japanese or
Italians to come in.'
As for story interference, Levinson says you can always go to a rival studio
if you want to make Horror Of Hirohito. But Warner's chairman, Robert Daly,
raises another buzzword spawned by the new takeover fever: 'synergy.'
'When Sony bought Columbia,' he says, 'there was more concern in Washington
than in Hollywood about our culture and history being bought by someone
else. What the film community is worried about is the control of a software
company by a hardware company. There's a different mentality that goes into
running a creative business from one that markets hi-fi's and washing
machines.'
More bullish about both foreign ownership and industrial synergy is the new
president of the Motion Picture Academy, the outfit that runs everything
from the Oscars to grant programmes for up-and-coming film-makers. He is
Robert Rehme, a former head of Matsushita-raided Universal.
'We live in a world dominated by telecommunications and instant
communications; by satellites with 550 channels on them where you'll have a
footprint over the whole Orient and be able to broadcast movies in 80
languages. Do we really suppose we can keep Hollywood as an American cottage
industry? Or pretend that the new hardware won't impact every day on the way
we make the software?'
Rehme points out, too, that Sony's investment in Columbia has resulted
already in renovated studio space and a more ambitious production slate than
any rival studio.
But where does the film-maker stand in these battles of the giants? He is
supposed to make recognisable movies about life in the country or culture in
which he grew up, while his paymasters fight their cosmic wars over
interstellar transmission systems or the role of the film studio (small) in
the international conglomerate.
'A studio today is a tiny speck on the portfolio of major, major
corporations,' complains director Rob Reiner, who made the new smash-hit Tom
Cruise/Jack Nicholson drama, A Few Good Men. That was produced by Castle
Rock, the company Reiner formed six years ago after becoming disillusioned
with big-studio bureaucracy. CR offers its movie-makers the tender loving
care of a small business: exactly what is missing, claims Reiner, in big
studios that have been gobbled up by conglomerates.
'Film companies are no longer run by people whose main interest is film.
When the industry began in the early part of the century, you had these
European refugees, mostly Jewish, who were just getting started and who
liked putting on a show. It was their only means of income - the Sam
Goldwyns and Louis B. Mayers - so they took a hands-on interest. Today, the
studios aren't in the business of putting on shows but of turning out
product. And you can't make films as product.'
'Product'. After synergy and software, here is the third billion-dollar
buzzword. Only, you have to point out to most Hollywood people that they are
using it. They do not realise they are bandying this bleak assembly-line
term for something that used to be called a 'movie' or a 'picture.'
Just as the long arm of Oriental ownership terrifies some observers with its
threat of alien, remote-control leadership, others are daunted by the
industrialisation of the vocabulary. 'It's only a word,' argues Rehme.
But Daly, sitting on the pile of gold produced in 1992 by Warner's
'product,' is unapologetic about the business jargon used in an increasingly
competitive environment. What else when a studio must fight its corner with
other components in a conglomerate - in Time Warner's case, cable and music?
'In 1991, our movie division contributed Dollars 319m to company profits,'
he says. And I spoke to him before Warner's no-less-impressive 1992 turnover
was announced: Dollars 886m.
But wasn't there a whiff of 'product' about this performance? Warner's two
top earners last year both were sequels. Batman Returns and Lethal Weapon 3
alone accounted for Dollars 300m at the American box office and were, let's
face it, a case of shaking the same old tree for the same old fruit?
'It's great to have a franchise like that,' argues Daly. 'It means a
repeatable flow of profit from a dependable line of product. Try telling the
stockholders that we shouldn't make sequels. Try telling Time Warner.'
Yes, but this is exactly what the paths we have followed all lead up to, is
it not? The modern American movie world is assailed by the mentality of the
quarterly balance sheet, and by the alien disciplines of big global
companies used to making durable products rather than those more indefinably
durable things called films.
No surprise, therefore, that film-maker Joe Dante - who, in the 1980s,
goose-bumped a generation with the witty monster-mayhem of Gremlins - senses
a growing gulf between the administrative class in Hollywood and the artist
class.
'There are very few executives who understand what it takes to make a movie.
They understand the money part, the deal part, but not the creative part. If
there was a way for studio executives to make pictures without actors,
writers and directors, they'd be happier.'
Dante has another fear: that the ledger-book mentality is spreading from
film bosses to film audiences.
'Americans are so attuned today to what's making money. The grapevine is all
about 'What's the big hit this week?' If you don't make Dollars 10m on your
opening weekend, you may be finished by the next one.'
Director John Landis, who gave a screwball twist to the American dream in
comedy hits like The Blues Brothers and Coming To America, is less convinced
about the New Philistinism. He believes audiences can be trusted to
discriminate. And he believes there have always been art-resistant bosses:
only their style of command has changed.
'Old Hollywood was like the Old South. You had your plantation and the
'Massa' was very much involved in the production of the cotton. People say
they made better movies back then. In fact, they made more movies, so the
odds were better. But what was really different then was that each studio
had a style that came down from the man who ran them. Warner's realism;
MGM's glitter . . . Today, what is the difference between the majors? None.
They're distribution and marketing companies.'
And why have they become that? Historically, Landis argues, because they
lost control of their employees after the war: all those in-house writers,
directors, actors. In the century's second half, emancipated artists yelled
for higher fees; budgets rocketed to today's average of Dollars 26m; fewer
films were made each year (from 60 a studio to 20 or 30); and the search was
on for an art that was industrially dependable, that was 'product' - from
sequels to star vehicles to those modern-day trade fairs of Special FX like
Terminator 2 and Batman.
But all my witnesses to date are established members of Club Hollywood. Each
speaks with a career to pursue and a set of interests to protect. So, I
knock on the door of someone I have cast as the sardonic Tinseltown
outsider: Michael Tolkin, writer of that everyone-is-guilty Hollywood
satire, The Player. He will no doubt tear into artists and executives, God
and Mammon, Hollywood and Tokyo alike.
Tolkin, however, pulls the biggest trick of all. Cast as Thersites, he plays
the fair-minded sceptic. He thinks that, beneath the cosmetic changes, the
US film business is The Same As It Has Always Been. The studios' names have
not changed, nor has their mentality.
He says: 'The best movies have always been made by people who sneak in
through the door: a John Ford or Martin Scorsese who makes one film for the
studios and then one for himself. The people in power want to make profits -
nothing's changed. The people on the sound stages want to make movies -
nothing has changed. And the people who write about Hollywood know a good
story when they can hype one. Out here, we live in the fantasy business. And
fantasies don't necessarily stop at the studio exit gate.'
Food for thought; but still not, I suspect, the final course. Whatever the
adversarial certainties of Daly and Dante, Reiner and Tolkin, the truth
about Hollywood today will not be known fully until tomorrow. By then, we
shall know if Beverly Hills has become twin city with Osaka; if the average
movie budget has blown up to Dollars 100m or burst like a balloon; and if
sequel-mania and 'product' fetishism have steamrollered the last creative
fold out of a once glorious industry.
Like Tolkin, I believe that Hollywood will always be Hollywood. But, like
everyone else, I am crossing my fingers, scanning the tea leaves and praying
to St Cecil B. DeMille - or anyone else Up There who can help . . .

FT  13 FEB 93 / The Long View: Jetlagged judgments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I WISH British Airways were the only airline playing dirty tricks,'
grumbled Steve the strategist as he ate breakfast and I ate lunch one day
this week. 'My slides are apparently heading for Acapulco and my clients
will be heading for Goldman Sachs.'
Never mind, I said, it must be a pleasant change on his current world tour
of financial centres to be stopping off in a country where the stock market
was 15 per cent higher than this time last year. But he was distinctly
unfazed. 'That's OK for the locals,' he pointed out, 'but most of my clients
account in dollars and on that basis the UK is 10 per cent adrift
year-on-year. Wall Street is up - maybe only by 7 per cent, but that's in
real money.'
How did he view the UK stock market? I wondered. Did he subscribe to the
judgment that the UK economy was tracking the US, but six to nine months
behind?
There seemed to be some of the same elements, including a sharp fall in
short-term interest rates and a flood of private investor money into
equities, offset by a torrent of new issues. And of course there was a weak
currency too, just as the dollar was plunging for a good part of 1992.
'Obviously there are similarities,' said Steve. 'There is the same potential
for the development of a garbage stock market with the second-liners racing
away on exaggerated recovery hopes or hot technology hype, leveraged by poor
market liquidity.
'Private investors have been scared by the fall in savings deposit rates to
3 per cent in the States, and there was a net inflow of Dollars 200bn into
long-term mutual funds in calendar 1992 including Dollars 80bn into equity
funds. But because equity issuance exploded too, hitting Dollars 76bn, and
Wall Street therefore only went sideways, the average total return was no
more than 6.7 per cent on equity funds. Still, that was better than the
alternative.
'Also, a number of the big listed corporations are in secular decline,
because the structure of the economy is changing. In the 1970s you could
never get fired for choosing IBM, but now even the chairman of IBM himself
can be pushed out of the door. I guess the same applies even more in the UK,
which is a more open economy.'
Small company share prices have certainly been motoring in London, I said.
The new FT-SE SmallCap Index had gone up by 11 per cent so far this year
while the FT-SE 100 Index of the biggest companies was actually down a
percentage point or two. As for garbage stocks, British Aerospace was up 55
per cent in six weeks. Investors' appetite for low quality was being
underlined by the rights issue list, dominated by companies emerging from
losses, with sketchy stories about recovery.
'These rights issues often seem very strange from my international
perspective,' said Steve. 'I happened to be doing some sums on the
Commercial Union issue on the way from the airport. Three-quarters of the
Pounds 428m is simply going to fill the hole left by the past three years'
dividends which were paid when there were no earnings. In Germany they would
simply have cut the dividend out in the first place. It shows that the UK
equity market is uniquely income-driven. Unfortunately, dividend growth
prospects seem now to be historically poor, which is therefore a good reason
for being cautious. And there are others.'
Did that mean he did not believe in economic recovery here?
'Certainly it won't be vigorous enough to meet the political objectives,'
said Steve. 'It happens I've just come from Japan, which points up some
interesting comparisons. Japan has a debt deflation problem basically as bad
as the UK's, maybe worse in some ways. But it also has a huge balance of
payments surplus, over Dollars 100bn, which reflects an excess of domestic
savings.
'Japan no longer has equity and property bubbles because those markets are
busted flushes being propped up by the government, but instead there's a
bond bubble, so that yen bond yields are now the lowest in the world,
heading down to 4 per cent. Essentially this is because Japanese investors
are being forced to invest internationally but will only do so when overseas
returns are higher.
'Now look at the UK. Same debt deflation, but a massive payments deficit.
When the economy was stronger the gap could be covered by attracting hot
money at high short-term interest rates. Now short rates are having to be
slashed because the economy is collapsing. Exit the hot money.
'You could try cutting the trade deficit by increasing taxes to curb
consumption but the politicians don't like the look of that either. So you
have to find other investors to finance the deficit - essentially
international bond funds, maybe representing the Japanese with that surplus.
'Will they buy Dollars 30bn of UK government securities this year? Only if
they are offered some tempting rates, and only if sterling is looking
ridiculously cheap. Of course if sterling does weaken further it will tend
to boost UK share prices in local currency terms.
'But the more powerful factor will be rising sterling long bond yields,
already twice as high as the equity dividend yield.'
I agreed that it had rarely been a good idea in the past to buy the UK
market on a yield of 4.3 per cent and certainly not on a multiple of 20
times the past year's earnings. Besides, I said, the market was being
propped up by privatised utilities, which was fine while the rest of the
economy was weak but would dilute any recovery. These utilities accounted
for 11 1/2 per cent of the market's value, but 14 per cent of the dividends
and 19 1/2 per cent of the earnings. So the rest of the market was on an
average price-earnings ratio of 22.3.
'Don't worry, in Tokyo the p/e ratio is 50,' said Steve. 'Look at it like
this, things could be worse. And you don't have earthquakes here, do you?'

FT  13 FEB 93 / Peugeot UK faces strike over two-year pay offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEUGEOT UK yesterday became the second major company in Britain to face a
strike over pay by manual workers.
Conveners and local officials at Coventry will consider this weekend when to
launch the full-scale stoppage after a secret ballot by 3,600 production
workers earlier this week which produced a rejection of the company's offer.
Workers at the Yarrow shipyard on Clydeside went on indefinite strike over
pay last week in one of the biggest wages disputes in Britain for several
years.
The Peugeot workers are demanding a 'substantial' pay rise on the eve of the
launch of a new model at Peugeot. They rejected the company's two-year 7.5
per cent pay rise offer with 3.5 per cent this year and the rest in 1994 by
a margin of 3 to 1.
Mr Duncan Simpson, Coventry district secretary of the Amalgamated
Engineering and Electrical Union, said last night that no further
discussions were planned with the company, although Peugeot is expecting to
meet the unions next week. Mr Simpson said the Peugeot workers were in a
militant mood because the company had decided to cut their rest period from
42 minutes to 30 minutes a shift after June 20 this year.
Peugeot insists that this reduction is necessary to improve productivity in
its Coventry plant from 57 man hours per car at present to 43 man hours per
car by the end of next year.
'In recent years there have been excellent industrial relations at Peugeot,'
said Mr Simpson. 'It is tragic that a strike is looming at the company.' He
said the pay issue had become entangled with the rest period question and
heightened tensions.
Mr Graham Dymott, spokesman for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders in the Midlands, said: 'It is a great shame to see what is happening
when the auto industry is in such a parlous state.
'We are far removed from the 1970s and 1980s when strikes were one of the
main reasons why the industry nearly collapsed.'

FT  13 FEB 93 / Pounds 900m Heathrow expansion move likely to spark battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PLANNING application for a Pounds 900m fifth terminal at London's Heathrow
airport will be lodged next week. It is likely to spark a bitter planning
struggle lasting several years.
The plans, to be submitted by BAA, the airport's operator, would expand
Heathrow's cap-acity to more than 70m passengers a year from the present
42m.
Sir John Egan, BAA's chief executive, says the terminal is needed to cope
with forecast increases in air traffic and is essential for Heathrow to
maintain its position as Europe's premier airport.
However, strong opposition to the plans, originally announced last year, is
already mounting. The nearby London borough of Hounslow and Spelthorne
borough council in Surrey have indicated they will refuse permission on
noise and environmental grounds.
The London borough of Hillingdon has also expressed concern, but says it
wants to see details of the application before reaching a decision.
BAA's legal advisers, led by Lord Silsoe QC and solicitors McKenna, expect
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, to send the proposals, along with
a plan for a new motorway spur to the terminal, to a public inquiry.
It is unlikely that this could be organised to begin before autumn next year
because of the complexity of the issues and the variety of opponents lining
up against the BAA.
Hearing the evidence could take another year and BAA does not expect
ministers to announce a decision until late 1996 at the earliest - by when
the deadline for the next general election would be a few months away.
Construction of the first phase, which would provide capacity to handle an
extra 10m passengers a year, would not be expected to be finished until
2002. The terminal would be handling the extra 30m passengers when finally
completed by 2016.
Opponents of the plans fear that the terminal will be used as a springboard
to persuade the government to permit development of a fourth runway at
Heathrow.
The Civil Aviation Authority has said that additional runway capacity will
be needed in south-east England by early next century.
BAA says the increasing size of aircraft means the squeeze at Heathrow is on
terminal rather than runway capacity and that existing runways can cope with
expected rises in air passenger traffic.
The new terminal to the west of the airport would stand on 600 acres, of
which about half is already owned by BAA. The remainder of the site is
mostly occupied by the Perry Oaks sewage works.
The proposals call for a core building with two or three satellite buildings
from which passengers will board and disembark from aircraft.
In addition, there are plans for a hotel, aircraft stands, maintenance
hangars and taxiways as well as car parks.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Welsh gas project may secure shipyard's future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS FOR a Pounds 250m gas terminal on the North Wales bank of the Dee
estuary received government approval yesterday, in a move which may secure
the future of the Cammell Laird shipyard at Birkenhead.
But the consortium of oil companies planning to build the terminal stressed
it would go ahead only if PowerGen, the electricity generator, was allowed
to build a Pounds 580m gas-fired power station nearby at Connah's Quay,
which would use gas piped from the terminal.
The approval process for the power station has been frozen pending the
government's pit closure review; blocking further gas-fired power stations
is one option to boost markets for coal.
The North Wales project would create more than 3,000 jobs during the
construction phase and 200 permanent jobs. Investment for a new gas field in
Liverpool Bay, the terminal and the power station would total Pounds 1.5bn
in the depressed sub-region of Merseyside, west Cheshire and north-east
Wales.
Amec, the civil engineering and offshore construction group, said yesterday
it would reconsider whether to bid for the Cammell Laird yard, which is due
to close when it runs out of work this year. Sir Alan Cockshaw, Amec's
chairman, said recently the group would be interested in Cammell Laird if
development of the gas field allowed it to shift to offshore and related
work.
The consortium involved in the exploration and development of Liverpool Bay
and which wants to build the gas terminal includes Hamilton Oil, Lasmo and
Monument.
Yesterday, Mr Ed Blair, president of Hamilton Oil called for rapid
Department of Trade and Industry approval for the PowerGen project.
The terminal was approved by the Welsh Office after a public inquiry. It was
opposed by miners at the Point of Ayr pit, one of the 21 pits affected by
the closure review, and by environmental groups.
The DTI said yesterday there was 'no connection' between decisions on the
terminal, which was a planning matter, and the power station, which needs
approval under the 1989 Energy Act.
However, the companies involved were sceptical about government departments
taking decisions in isolation from each other.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who has been a
longstanding champion of Cammell Laird, as both environment secretary and
defence secretary, now has to make the decision on the Connah's Quay power
station, which in turn will have an impact on pit closure policies.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Elf ordered to shelve proposed plant closure: State
intervenes to protect regional economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government has ordered Elf Aquitaine, the public sector oil
group, to shelve the planned closure and relocation of a 480-staff
laboratory and industrial site, in a rebuff to the autonomy of one of
France's largest companies.
This is the latest in a series of clashes between the public administration
and Mr Lok Le Floch-Prigent, Elf's chairman, who has attempted to resist
state intervention in the company since taking the post in mid-1989.
It reflects the Socialist administration's growing anxiety over job losses
as it strives to lessen the defeat it faces in next month's general
election. The site at Boussens in south-west France is in the heart of a
strong Socialist area, although the plans have provoked protests from all
sides of politics.
Although the move involves no job losses, unlike Hoover's recent
controversial decision to close a plant near Dijon, Mr Paul Quiles, the
interior minister, yesterday said it would have 'grave consequences' for the
future of the region near the site. Mr Quiles is standing as a Socialist
candidate in the nearby constituency of Tarn in next month's election.
Elf yesterday insisted it had begun consultations on the relocation but had
not made a final decision. The company hoped a negotiated solution with the
government was possible.
Elf is 51.5 per cent state-owned, with the rest of its shares quoted on
stock markets in New York and Paris.
Elf was planning to transfer the jobs on the site, an environmental
laboratory and administration office, to other Elf offices in the
south-west. The move was designed to save FFr100m (Pounds 12.6m) a year. Elf
said it felt its plan had not been properly understood.
Mr Quiles said the prime minister had instructed Mr Le Floch-Prigent 'to
cancel the decision' because the move 'posed a problem to the government'.
He rejoiced 'in this decision which proves the will of the government to see
national companies fully assume their responsibilities'.
Mr Quiles added: 'A national company cannot hold its shareholder, in this
case the state, at arm's length.'
The government has fought recently to limit job losses among France's top
industrial companies both in the public and private sectors.
In the past, however, it has not stepped in to force a group chairman to
shelve a restructuring plan.
French industry has cut costs far faster in this economic slowdown than in
the last recession, a factor in the rise in unemployment to nearly 3m, 10.6
per cent of the workforce. However, this has aided French companies'
international competitiveness.
The direction to Elf could become a test of the future government's industry
policy. While the right is economically liberal, it is just as anxious as
the Socialists to limit job losses. Mr Le Floch-Prigent, a friend of
President Francois Mitterrand, is also thought to be among the several state
industry chairmen that a new rightwing government would consider for
replacement in a general reshuffle of top jobs.

FT  13 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Unigate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At last Unigate has done the decent thing and put Clifford Foods out of its
stock market misery. In sealing a Pounds 50.4m agreed bid for the milk and
juice company, Unigate has bolstered two important businesses. It has also
positioned itself to compete more effectively in the shake-up that will
follow the demise of the Milk Marketing Board.
Clifford will add 3 percentage points to Unigate's share of the liquid milk
market, taking its total to 16 per cent. This will give Unigate further
scope to rationalise and help it resist, at least for a while, the
encroachments of the giant supermarket chains. Unigate can easily afford the
cash. The deal is likely to enhance next year's earnings.
Still, yesterday's 5 per cent share price increase looks overdone. Although
handy, the acquisition does little to settle the bigger strategic qualms
about Unigate. Mr Ross Buckland, who became chief executive in 1990, has not
yet charted a convincing new course at Unigate. Unigate may now be buying a
string of milk businesses. Only four years ago it sold half its milk
operations to Dairy Crest. Milk was seen as an unattractive business, prone
to margin erosion. Not much has changed since then.

FT  13 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: UK electricity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The run-up in electricity shares this week suggests the market appreciates
the likely outcome to the British Coal conundrum. Assuming the government
can bribe the generators into taking subsidised coal, perhaps 12 pits will
be saved. If Tory back-benchers can then be persuaded to accept such a plan,
National Power and PowerGen will be free to sign five-year contracts with
the regional electricity companies. There will be some cost to the
generators as coal stocks are run down more slowly than planned. But that is
a small price for a deal which guarantees earnings and dividend growth up to
1998. The danger is that a change in the regulatory status quo could upset
the apple cart.
By opting not to delay the planned liberalisation of the electricity market,
the government appears eager to avoid conflict with Mr Stephen Littlechild,
the electricity regulator. With a 40 per cent stake in the generators and
hopes of privatising British Coal, it has good reason to be cautious.
Equally, Mr Littlechild has already indicated that he will not stop the Recs
from signing five-year contracts with the generators, but he could yet
decide prices offered by the generators are unfair.
The generators' shares have risen more than 12 per cent this year and yield
no more than the market average. Having recently been mauled by the Commons
Select Committee for being too soft, Mr Littlechild may be in the mood to
get tough. If so, that share price rating will be hard to justify.

FT  13 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Chancellor and the future Governor of the Bank of England have made
plain they see little room for further interest rate cuts. The markets are
disinclined to believe either. Yesterday's unusually explicit statement from
Mr Lamont was brushed aside by an equity market rising in anticipation of
lower rates. A rise in the short sterling future was an unambiguous sign of
the market betting on easier money to come. With inflation falling to the
lowest level since 1967 - and the government's lengthening record of U-turns
in mind - that looks a rational response.
The inflation figures suggest exceptionally weak demand across the economy.
Import and producer prices are rising but retailers would rather swallow
lower margins than pass the cost on to consumers. Next week's slew of
economic statistics will show why, as unemployment pushes through three
million. Given Mr Major's problems with the coal industry and the Maastricht
treaty, keeping rebellious Tory MPs sweet on the economy will be top
priority. The odds must be on another cut in rates around the time of the
budget.
But sterling gained almost two pfennigs from its low against the D-Mark
yesterday. Unless the foreign exchange market was alone in taking notice of
Mr Lamont, that can only be because the market senses recovery without
inflation. That would support sterling in the same way as the dollar is now
strong. If the sentiment can be sustained, the government will have room to
cut rates again.

FT  13 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyds out in front
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyds Bank has set a cracking pace for other banks to follow. A 28 per cent
recovery in pre-tax profit, a 10 per cent increase in the dividend, and a 17
per cent net return on shareholders' funds are evidence of the extraordinary
inner strength with which the bank has come through the recession. Dividend
growth can easily continue to outstrip the market average. If nothing else,
the residual surplus of Pounds 820m on problem country debt should help take
care of that. Strip away the veneer, though, and familiar strategic
questions re-emerge. That may prevent the shares from outperforming.
Annual profits were bolstered by a Pounds 64m increase in foreign exchange
trading profits. That bodes well for banks such as Barclays and HSBC with
heavy specialisation in this market, but, though Lloyds denies it sold
sterling short on September 16, the bonus will not necessarily recur. By
happy coincidence almost all the Pounds 50m of permanent diminution of UK
property values could be charged to reserves. Had the remaining Pounds 153m
diminution not been temporary, it would have had to be charged against
profits. Above all, though, Lloyds' flow of operating income looks
structurally weak despite an improvement in the second half.
One problem is that Lloyds' large cash surplus means lower UK base rates hit
its domestic income more than that of other banks. Another is that
second-half net interest income grew more strongly on international business
where Lloyds has retrenched in recent years. Yet another is the limit on
further cost reduction and growth in fee income. The easy answer is to go
for volume, but Lloyds will not sacrifice margin for the sake of market
share. That makes an acquisition more likely. Sensible opportunities are few
and far between. After its embarrassing withdrawal from last year's Midland
bid, Lloyds may have to wait until a willing partner hoves in view. It will
be accused of dithering just the same.

FT  13 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US shares fall on uncertain
outlook
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
IN spite of more good news on inflation, US share prices fell across the
board yesterday in thin pre-holiday trading, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 30.26 at 3,392.43,
at its lows for the day and the first time the index has been below 3,400 in
more than a week. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended
lower, down 3.07 at 444.59, while the Amex composite finished 1.58 lower at
415.47, and the Nasdaq composite 5.34 weaker at 690.54. Trading volume on
the NYSE was some 217m shares, and declines outnumbered rises by 1,100 to
740. Again, uncertainty about the outlook for equities dogged investors, who
are worried that recent gains may have been overdone and that shares may be
heading for a prolonged period of stagnation.
One analyst noted yesterday that about 40 per cent of the S &amp; P 500 stocks
have fallen substantially from their highs since a week ago - an indication
that a significant correction may be under way.
Such was the mood of the market that more good news on inflation, a modest
0.2 per cent rise in January producer prices, and yet further gains in bond
prices (which pushed 30-year rates down to a historic low of 7.135 per cent)
failed to generate any enthusiasm. The markets' poor performance, however,
may have been affected by thin trading, with many participants taking the
day off ahead of the weekend President's Day holiday.
General Motors was one of the most actively traded issues, rising Dollars
1/8 to Dollars 40 5/8 in volume of 2.7m shares as investors continued to
respond positively to Thursday's news of a turnround in operating earnings
at the car manufacturer. The other two motor stocks, however, were both
weaker, with Ford down Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 49 1/4 and Chrysler Dollars
1 lower at Dollars 39 7/8 .
For the second consecutive day the prices of Student Loan Corp and the
Student Loan Market Association (Sallie Mae) fell in heavy trading on
reports that the Clinton administration is planning to replace the current
guaranteed student loan programme with student loans issued directly by the
government. Student Loan fell another Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 18 5/8 and
Sallie Mae plunged Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 58 1/2 .
Schering-Plough rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 63 1/2 after the drug maker's
board approved an additional Dollars 500m buy-back of shares.
Weak technology stocks led the Nasdaq market lower. Microsoft fell Dollars 1
5/8 to Dollars 83 5/8 , Oracle Systems dropped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 29
3/4 , Novell slipped Dollars 1 to Dollars 27 3/4 and Intel gave up Dollars 1
3/8 at Dollars 111.
Canada
TORONTO closed little changed as the market's two-week rally showed signs of
running out of steam.
According to preliminary data, the TSE-300 index closed up 2.38 points, or
0.07 per cent, at 3,445.55. Volume was 49.104m shares, down from 52.819m
shares on Thursday.

<TEXT>
A FURTHER rise in the yen against the dollar weakened sentiment, and the
Nikkei average slipped below the 17,000 level for the first time since
January 27, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index closed 238.39 lower at the day's low of 16,851.51, 2.8 per cent
lower on the week, depressed by arbitrage selling and profit-taking by
investment trusts and foreigners. It had registered a day's high of
17,120.40 in early trading, on buying linked to February option settlements.
The morning impetus pushed up volume to 270m shares after Thursday's
holiday, against Wednesday's 199m. Declines led advances by 598 to 313 with
192 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks lost 6.98 to
1,288.95 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.54 to 1,036.29.
Most investors remained on the sidelines ahead of the meeting in Washington
between Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, finance minister, and Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US
treasury security. The dollar continued its slide against the yen, as
dealers expect Mr Bentsen to press for a higher yen to reduce Japan's
swelling trade surplus.
Amid the currency uncertainty, dealers focused on short term trading in
stocks reflecting domestic demand. Morinaga, the confectionery maker, was
the day's most active issue, gaining Y42 to Y581. Reports that the company
will develop a new system to detect lung cancer cells encouraged some
dealers.
Utilities rose on the strength of the yen, with Tokyo Electric Power gaining
Y10 to Y2,580. The sector has also been popular recently on a dividend yield
of around 2 per cent, against an average of 0.9 per cent for the Nikkei
index. 'Investment trusts seem to be buying steels and utilities on the back
of higher dividends,' said Mr Hiroshi Nasu at James Capel.
High-technology issues were sold on worries over the higher yen. Matsushita
Electric Industrial declined Y30 to Y1,070 on reports of a sharp profit
decline for the current year to March.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 101.23 to 18,373.15 in volume of 14.4m
shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets were mostly firmer.
TAIWAN turned in the strongest performance in the region as the market gave
its approval to the nomination of the governor of Taiwan province, Lien
Chan, as premier. The weighted index ended 153.76 or 4.3 per cent higher at
its intra-day high of 3,775.19, up 4.2 per cent on the week. Turnover nearly
doubled to TDollars 36bn, the heaviest since last June.
Strong retail demand emerged, particularly for financial issues in the wake
of Lien's nomination, which is seen as improving the prospects for political
stability.
HONG KONG edged ahead after some late buying emerged after a day in which
trading continued to be inhibited by worries about the political outlook.
The Hang Seng index was rose 1.15 to 5,858.15, 1 per cent higher on the
week, in turnover of HKDollars 2.03bn.
AUSTRALIA saw foreign demand take the All Ordinaries index up 4.4 to
1,603.5, 3.9 per cent higher on the week, in turnover of ADollars 341.21m.
Blue chips led the upturn, Western Mining and Commonwealth Bank both rising
on positive interim results. Western Mining, which plans a major nickel
expansion, finished up 16 cents to ADollars 4.56. Commonwealth Bank rose 14
cents to ADollars 6.44.
SINGAPORE went against the higher trend and the Straits Times Industrial
index shed 7.95 to 1,613.52, down 0.3 per cent on the week.
MANILA saw demand shift from commercial and industrial issues into oils, and
despite some late profit-taking, the composite index closed at a four-month
high, 1.04 higher at 1,404.65 for a weekly rise of 4.6 per cent.

FT  13 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Fiat leads the way with 8 per
cent gain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Continent was firmer ahead of the weekend, writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN turned its back on politics after the excitement of the previous two
sessions and it was corporate news and rumour, once again, that took the
market forward.
The Comit index rose 4.61 to 492.13, a 2.4 per cent decline on the week, as
the market overcame the inhibiting effect of Monday's close of the February
trading account and yesterday's expiry of options.
The mood was encouraged by a government move to speed a package of measures
to spur the bourse, including fiscal inventives for equity investments.
Fiat was the star performer, adding L105 to fix at L4,696 before rising to
L4,955 after hours, a daily rise of 7.9 per cent. The stock found support
from the opening after news that the company had risen to second place in
the European car sales rankings in January; but it spurted amid a host of
vague market rumours that the company might be about to announce a
commercial tie-up.
Insurers were also firm: Fondiaria rose L739 to L28,562 and Toro put on L550
to fix at L24,550 before edging up to L24,650 after hours.
FRANKFURT extended its climb, reaching its highest close in nearly seven
months with the DAX index at 1,661.43, up 10.38 on the day and 1.2 per cent
on the week. Turnover rose from DM6.5bn to DM7bn.
The underlying argument continued between the underweight position of
domestic and foreign institutions in German equities, their willingness to
increase their commitment - bringing high liquidity into the market  - and
the crisis position of the steel, engineering and automotive industries.
However, pointed out Mr Eckhard Frahm of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, top
performers in the DAX this year include Volkswagen, up another DM2.80 to
DM297.70 yesterday, Daimler and Continental, the tyre company, which rose
DM4.50 to DM229.50. Huge earnings gains have been forecast for VW - three
years from now.
Meanwhile, second liners gained on earlier improvements, or the prospect of
them. AEG, which said it would return to profit for 1992, put on another
DM3.80 to DM176.30 for a 10 per cent rise on the week. Suedzucker, the sugar
company, ended DM19 higher at DM625 for a two-day gain of DM34, following a
good 1992 beet harvest and this week's Hoare Govett buy recommendation.
PARIS went into the weekend unenthusiastically with a 6.40 point rise in the
CAC-40 to 1,911.47, barely changed on the week. Turnover weakened to
FFr2.7bn after Thursday's FFr3.5bn.
Peugeot was one of the day's better performers with a rise of FFr14 to
FFr615 ahead of announcing 1992 results after the close. The group said that
it expected a rise in 1993 turnover after a 3 per cent decline last year.
Havas lost 2 per cent after reporting a 24 per cent fall in profits after
Thursday's close, the shares closing down FFr9.80 at FFr428.90.
Carnaud Metal Box gained FFr10.40 to FFr210.00 in good volume amid rumours
that it might soon enter the CAC-40.
AMSTERDAM moved higher with Fokker gaining Fl 1.00 to Fl 10.50 prior to
unconfirmed reports, after the close, that the state had agreed to its
takeover by Dasa of Germany. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.4 to 98.9, a
week's gain of 1.2 per cent. Elsewhere Royal Dutch shed Fl 1.70 to Fl 155.10
and DSM lost Fl 2.50 to Fl 75.00.
ZURICH continued the consolidation seen earlier in the week but the firmer
dollar underpinned leading industrial issues and helped the market ahead.
The SMI index ended 8.3 higher at 2,136.2, little changed on the week.
Nestle rose SFr15 to SFr1,095 and Roche gained SFr20 to SFr4,170.
STOCKHOLM featured Astra B, which put on SKr17 to SKr693 as investors began
to take interest in the pharmaceutical group ahead of its 1992 results due
later this the month. The Affarsvarlden index rose 12.7 to 981.2, a gain of
5.7 per cent on the week.
Another strong performer was Sandvik, up SKr24 to SKr429 in the B shares, as
investors looked to strong export stocks likely to benefit from the krona's
devaluation.
VIENNA was helped to a higher close by short covering as the ATX index
gained 8.26 to 791.01, down 1.3 per cent on the week. The papermaker,
Leykam, led the rise, gaining Sch9 to Sch267.
ISTANBUL closed at its highest level in nearly two years as investors were
encouraged by lower interest rates.
The 75-share index finished 116.02, or 2.3 per cent higher at 5,244.84 in
turnover of some TL600bn. The market had risen some 11 per cent on the week.

FT  13 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Government package boosts Tokyo
equities - But fundamentals are weak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT measures to boost the Tokyo stock market have triggered a wave of
criticism among the country's financial community.
Heavy buying, which pushed the Nikkei index up 3.3 per cent on January 28,
was part of the government's attempts to boost the ailing stock market,
through the extra public pension and postal funds which were allotted for
equity investment. Some investors and brokers complain that this artificial
support outweighed weak earnings and economic fundamentals, but only in the
short term.
'We are not trying to prop up prices, but the stock market is almost dead
and we are only supplying a cure to revive its functions,' retorts an
official at the Ministry of Finance.
After the Nikkei fell to a new six-year low last August, the government
announced support measures, which included additional public investment to
be placed in the stock market. The government allocated an additional
Y1,120bn (Dollars 967m) for stock investments, boosting the amount allowed
to be invested in equities this fiscal year to Y2,280bn.
The boost in January came amid mounting market worries of a February crash,
with heavy selling expected from companies and financial institutions
wanting to prop up profits ahead of the March year-end book closing, and
from companies in need of funds to refinance equity-linked bonds.
The ministry tried to soothe concerns by announcing that 70 per cent of the
Y9,000bn in redemptions of the equity-linked bonds had been procured through
bank borrowings and bond issuances. It also launched what the local media
dubbed the PKO - Price Keeping Operations - by analogy with the UN's Peace
Keeping Operations, through adding extra demand, and by curbing additional
supply by ordering banks and life assurers not to sell shares to shore up
profits.
Most market participants believe that the support will be maintained until
March book closing, since the 16,000 line is a critical level for banks to
sustain their capital ratio requirements set by the Bank for International
Settlements. The level is also crucial for many life insurers, which rely on
unrealised gains on stocks to cover their heavy losses on foreign bond
investments and a decline in returns on domestic investments due to the fall
in interest rates.
In order to stop life insurers from selling stocks to prop up financial
profits, the ministry is likely to postpone booking their foreign exchange
losses on Australian and Canadian bonds, while allowing them to book
unrealised profits on stock holdings.
Ms Alicia Ogawa, financial analyst at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, points out
that the government is increasingly worried over the health of the smaller
life insurers, whose unrealised gains on stocks have already been run down
and who have no more scope to cover further losses.
The government seems to have been the sole buyer of the market. Last month,
banks, including trust banks which manage public funds, posted net stock
purchases for the eighth consecutive month, buying a net Y366bn in equities.
However, life and non-life insurers and investment trusts were net sellers
for the third consecutive month, and foreigners and individuals were also
net sellers.
Overall activity has also failed to revive, with January trading volumes
remaining around a daily average of 200m shares. Moreover, the market
support operations have flushed out the growing inefficiency of share prices
in reflecting fundamentals, leaving many strategists uncertain over how much
of earnings and economic news is being discounted into stock prices.
Although the Nikkei is currently trading at 54 times earnings, Baring
Securities maintains that on realistic earnings estimates, the p/e ratio
would be around 60.
However, some fund managers are more positive over the ministry's efforts.
'If company profits are to recover next fiscal year, current share prices
are cheap,' says Mr Kaoru Shimura, head of pension fund management at
Sumitomo Life.
Some economists foresee an additional supplementary budget ahead of the
royal wedding and summit this summer, and leading politicians of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party are calling for an income tax cut of some Y5,000bn
to Y6,000bn to revive consumer spending. Salomon Brothers in Tokyo forecasts
that a recovery in consumption will allow the economy to grow by 3 per cent
this year and next.
However, doubts over whether consumption will respond to fiscal stimulus and
scepticism over structural problems in corporate and banking sectors cloud
the economic outlook, and pessimists maintain that a recovery in corporate
profits may not be achieved until the winter of 1994.
Meanwhile, the need for financial authorities to prop up share prices will
soon weaken. Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel in Tokyo, expects
volatility on the stock market during April or May, since capital ratios for
banks will not be an issue until September and stock valuation losses can be
forgotten until March 1994.

FT  13 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Inflation slide sends equities
forward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIAL news that UK inflation fell to its lowest level for 25 years in the
year to the end of January produced a sharp turnaround in share prices.
Equities rallied from initial big falls to close with good gains as the
two-week trading account ended.
The inflation news, described by one seasoned market dealer as 'stunningly
good', transformed the gilts market where initial falls of around a quarter
in long-dated stocks were replaced by gains of up to 1 1/2 points.
Index-linked stocks, on the other hand, saw early gains erased and replaced
by falls extending to  1/4 .
Taking advantage of the sharp gains in conventional gilts, the authorities
issued Pounds 800m in new stock, where dealings will commence on Monday. The
stock comprises Pounds 200m of 9 per cent Conversion, maturing in 2000,
Pounds 300m of 8 per cent Treasury stock maturing in 2003, Pounds 50m of 3.5
per cent Funding, due 1999-2004 and Pounds 250m of 9 per cent Treasury,
redeemable in 2012.
Earlier, there was considerable unease in both the gilts and equity markets
after the speech in Frankfurt on Thursday evening by Mr Eddie George,
governor-designate of the Bank of England. He warned against further cuts in
UK interest rates. Markets have been increasingly focusing on the likelihood
of a further reduction in UK interest rates to coincide with Budget day.
Share prices began the day on a steady note but began to lose ground quickly
as sterling weakened. Just over a point firmer at the opening, the FT-SE 100
index was over 20 points lower within an hour of the opening, led down by
sterling and a flurry of weakness in the Footsie future.
A modest rally ensued and the Footsie was around seven points lower ahead of
the inflation numbers. After absorbing the economic data, dealers hoisted
share prices and the 100 index accelerated to reach a day's high of 2,854.8,
up more than 20 points, just ahead of Wall Street's opening. However, the US
market proved a disappointment after the release of economic data, and took
some of the shine off the UK market where profit-taking saw the Footsie
close a net 8.7 firmer at 2,843.0, although it fell 19.9 over the week. The
Mid-250 index lagged behind the 100-index yesterday, settling 0.2 off at
3,006.3.
Equity turnover rose sharply after the inflation news, totalling 830m
shares, just below Thursday's 889m, but well ahead of activity during the
first three days of the week.
Marketmakers adopted a bullish view of equities but cautioned that the
coming week would see another spate of rights issues.

FT  13 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lloyds loses out to rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANNUAL profits from Lloyds Bank were at the top end of market forecasts, but
an early spurt for the shares was staunched as buyers perceived more value
in the high street clearer's rivals Barclays and National Westminster.
Lloyds announced a headline profit of Pounds 801m, which appeared to be a
sharp rise against the previous figure of Pounds 625m; there was also a hike
in the dividend to 18.4p. The share price shot up by 22 initially, but the
market then considered the pre-provisions figure and decided that the
performance was less impressive. Also, speculation that Lloyds might make a
bid for either TSB or Standard Chartered continued. It was felt that though
a bid might not necessarily prompt a rights issue, it would put pressure on
the share price.
Lloyds was trimmed back to a net gain of 6 at 534p with 7.6m shares traded,
while TSB eased 2 to 170p on profit-taking at the end of the current trading
account; Standard Chartered rose 8 to 653p. Meanwhile, new-time buyers,
investors trading for the account which officially begins on Monday, were
looking at National Westminster, which announces its figures on February 23,
and Barclays, which reports on March 4. Both have heavy debts and would be
beneficiaries of a further interest rate cut, which was signalled by the
latest inflation figure yesterday. NatWest rose 20 to 452p on turnover of
8.6m shares while Barclays lifted by the same amount to 435p on turnover of
6.8m.
Asda recommended
Food retailers rebounded from recent underperformance with Asda leading the
charge as NatWest Securities put the stock on its list of 'top ten buys'.
The house said Asda's fears of a small decline in sales in the first two
months of the year in the face of stiff competition had not been realised.
Instead, NatWest estimated that sales have risen some 2 per cent
year-on-year, while the group also continued to reduce its debt mountain.
NatWest said market profits forecasts for this year of around Pounds 130m to
Pounds 135m might prove conservative and the shares have the potential to
reach 80p by the early summer. Yesterday, the ordinaries climbed 2 to 60 1/2
p in turnover of 37m. The nil-paid also closed 2 ahead at 7p in volume of
26m.
A trade press report that Kwik Save is considering a joint venture with
Santego, the Spanish discount chain, caused little surprise to many in the
market but excited enough interest to edge the shares forward 2 to 804p.
Santego and Kwik Save have been linked before, chiefly because Kwik Save's
largest shareholder, Dairy Crest, owns the Spanish group. The report said
that the two were planning a new joint discount chain in Europe.
Talk that Tesco would achieve a low pay settlement for its employees helped
the shares, which gathered 13 to 243p. A figure of 3 per cent had been
rumoured, but word leaking into the market was that a lower number was more
likely.
Hotel group Forte strengthened again with hints that a sizeable overseas
purchase was being lined up and any consequent fund-raising exercise would
banish doubts over whether the dividend would be maintained. Word in the
market was that the group recently came close to paying Pounds 400m for
Australian-based chain Southern Pacific. Forte shares added 2 to 192p.
As expected, Unigate emerged as the buyer for Clifford Foods, sending shares
in both companies racing forward. Unigate paid Pounds 50.4m for the
family-owned dairy group in a move welcomed by food specialists in the
market. Mr Carl Short at Nomura described the purchase as 'sensible rather
than spectacular', adding that he expects further acquisitions as Unigate
attempts to build up its milk and food business. Other analysts also said
Unigate was casting around, although few candidates were forthcoming.
Upgrades on the back of Clifford were generally in the Pounds 1m to 3m
range. Unigate shares jumped 15 to 342p, and Clifford 50 to 573p.
Pharmaceuticals stocks were firmer with Glaxo picking up 8 to 704p and
Wellcome, helped initially by optimism over an article in a medical journal,
improving 9 to 922p.
Lehman Brothers recorded an active two-way pull in SmithKline Beecham. The
house has been recommending that clients switch into Wellcome but there were
also enough buyers to mop up the loose stock. Although the 'A's eased a
penny to 465p, the Units firmed a penny to 410p.
The takeover speculation that has surrounded Fisons faded with the account
and the shares slid 1 1/2 to 241p.
Conglomerate Hanson eased 2 1/2 to 255p ahead of first quarter profits on
Tuesday.
Dealers reported a stock overhang in IMI and the shares fell 7 to 261p.
Ferranti had a busy session and turnover rose to 11.7m, double the daily
average, as bid talk returned. There was also a suggestion that the company
might have won a significant contract from Saudi Arabia. The shares closed
unchanged at 13p.
Another stock that has attracted bid talk is Vickers and the shares put on 3
to 134p.
Among transport stocks, British Airways was a nervous market ahead of next
Tuesday's third-quarter figures. The shares fell 5 to 283p, in trade of 5m.
Trading in Trafalgar House was again busy following Thursday's rights issue.
Volume reached 11m by the close and the shares eased  1/2 to 76p.
The inflation figures proved to be good news for the stores sector as fresh
speculation over interest rate cuts lifted sentiment. Boots surged 11 to
490p, Kingfisher 13 to 527p, Marks and Spencer 6 1/2 to 330p and WH Smith 4
to 422p.
Perception that the US side of its business is performing well helped paper
manufacturer Arjo Wiggins Appleton to increase a further 4 1/2 to 173p.

FT  13 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETTER than anticipated figures on UK inflation enlivened the stock index
futures sector, writes Joel Kibazo.
Early fears of a high inflation figure led to a poor opening in the March
contract on the FT-SE at 2,821, a 14-point discount to the underlying cash
market. Such was the initial impact of the poor opening in March that
dealers in the cash market quickly moved to mark prices lower, sending the
equity index into retreat.
However, by mid-morning, traders felt the earlier falls had been overdone
and bargain hunting was seen.
This gained momentum after the release of the inflation figures, climbing to
the day's high of 2,866 at around 1.15pm.
The early falls on Wall Street saw March come off and it finished at 2,853,
up 19 on the previous close and at an 8-point premium to cash with turnover
reaching around 12,521 contracts.
In traded options, total volume was 31,593 with the FT-SE 100 option trading
11,069 lots. BTR was the busiest stock option at 2,315 lots.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Money Markets: French futures dive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECTS for rate cuts in France dimmed in the eyes of many dealers
yesterday as French franc futures fell sharply once again, writes James
Blitz.
A 50-basis point fall in the June French franc contract yesterday
highlighted the extent to which dealers now think that French interest rates
will remain high for some time to come.
The June contract closed at 90.69, at which level it prices 3-month money at
9.31 per cent in the summer. That is a remarkably high level, considering
that the annual rate of inflation is at about 2 per cent.
Cash rates also reflected the bearish tone, with 3-month money rising to 12
3/8 per cent from 12 per cent on Thursday, and 6-month money up at 11 1/4
per cent from 11 per cent the previous day.
The pressure in interest rate markets had little to do with the position of
the French currency, which was more-or-less stable throughout the day.
However, there has been speculation in France all week, most notably from Mr
Raymond Barre, the former French prime minister, that another attack on the
D-Mark/franc parity will take place around next month's parliamentary
elections.
Mr Barre said earlier this week that he did not believe another speculative
attack would succeed. But Paris dealers were concerned yesterday that the
Bank of France was finding it difficult to build up its foreign exchange
reserves, following the huge intervention to support the franc before
Christmas.
One dealer suggested yesterday that the Bank had spent some FFr150bn worth
of foreign currency supporting the franc last December. However, a reading
of its latest weekly report led him to believe that, in the week ending
February 4th, the Bank had only managed to recoup FFr10bn in foreign
exchange.
Sterling futures fell sharply yesterday morning as the pound dropped to a
new historic low against the D-Mark in Asian trading.
The March future was down 12 basis points to a low of 94.03 at one stage.
But it later recovered to close at 94.17 after retail price inflation fell
to an annualised 1.7 per cent against 2.6 per cent in December.
In the cash market 3-month money closed  1/16 per cent softer at 6 1/8 per
cent.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Another big fall for sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING recovered sharply against both the D-Mark and dollar in European
trading yesterday, after falling to a new historic low against the German
currency in Asia the night before, writes James Blitz.
In Tokyo, the pound fell to an all-time low against the D-Mark of DM2.3245.
It also fell to a new low against the dollar this year of Dollars 1.4070.
In London, the pound later opened at a new all-time low on the trade
weighted index of 75.7. This meant that sterling was worth 75.7 per cent of
its 1985 value against a broad basket of currencies.
Once European trading was underway, the currency rebounded, possibly helped
by a comment from Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, that there was no
scope for a further reduction in interest rates. There was also strong
speculation in markets that the Bank of England was intervening in support
of the currency.
The pound peaked at DM2.3610 at lunchtime before closing at DM2.3575, half a
pfennig up on the day. Against the dollar, it peaked at Dollars 1.4321,
before closing at Dollars 1.4180, virtually unchanged on the day.
Sterling's strong rebound in Europe suggested that the earlier selling had
been speculative, rather than the product of quality selling. At these
levels, institutional investors are probably very short of the currency, or
wondering whether its effective floor against the D-Mark has finally been
reached.
But there were reasons to believe that the currency was not 'out of the
woods' yet. One worrying factor for sterling holders was that further cuts
in UK interest rates were still being discounted at the end of the day by
money market dealers.
Yesterday's UK inflation figures, which showed a dramatic fall on the month,
may also raise speculation in the next few weeks that the UK authorities
could afford to see a weaker pound.
The yen had a much calmer day following the robust rally that has dominated
the week. The rally has been caused by speculation that US and Japanese
treasury officials would try and reach an accord for a stronger yen this
weekend in order to reduce the Japanese trade surplus.
Officials' comments were very ambivalent yesterday. The yen closed slightly
weaker against both the D-Mark and dollar at Y72.65 and Y120.80
respectively.
The US currency continued to trade within a range of DM1.6415 and DM1.6615
against the D-Mark. Dealers are also waiting to see what fiscal package
President Clinton will announce on Tuesday. The dollar closed in London
nearly  1/2 a pfennig higher on the day at DM1.6625.

good result

<TEXT>
COCA-Cola Amatil, the Australian soft drink and snack food company, has
raised its annual dividend to 17.5 cents a share from 15.5 cents after a
solid profit and sales performance in 1992.
Net profit rose 13.8 per cent to ADollars 77.4m (USDollars 52.2m) on a 17.7
per cent sales rise to ADollars 2.1bn. But some gloss was taken off the
result by an ADollars 11.6m adverse tax settlement which reduced earnings
after abnormal items by 4.4 per cent to ADollars 65.8m.
The result was achieved in spite of a 6.7 per cent decline to ADollars 33.7m
from ADollars 36.1m in pre-tax profits from the snack food division, which
was sold just after balance sheet date to United Biscuit of the UK.
THe snack division increased sales and market shares, but was hit by reduced
margins and higher input costs. Beverage operations, the largest in
Australia, lifted pre-tax earnings 8.6 per cent to ADollars 182.1m.

FT  13 FEB 93 / International Company News: Schering-Plough plans further
stock repurchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHERING-PLOUGH, the US drugs and healthcare products company, has
authorised the repurchase of an additional Dollars 500m of its common
shares.
The buy-back is being made 'because current market conditions make the stock
a good value'. It will be funded through existing cash balances and
operating cash flow. A previously-authorised buy-back of Dollars 1bn is 97
per cent complete.
The news prompted Moody's Investors Service, the US ratings agency, to cut
the group's long-term debt ratings.
Moody's said the extended repurchase programme 'will further reduce
liquidity and raise leverage'.
'Schering-Plough has historically maintained large cash balances relative to
debt, but share repurchases are substantially eroding the cushion.'
Standard &amp; Poor's, another US ratings agency, yesterday affirmed its rating
on Schering-Plough.

300m charge

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CAMPBELL Soup, the US food group, yesterday said it would take after-tax
charges of Dollars 300m, or Dollars 1.19 a share, to cover restructuring
moves including closing two plants which together employ more than 1,300
people.
The charges will be taken against 1993 second-quarter earnings. In the 1992
second quarter, to end-January, the company had after-tax earnings of
Dollars 160.6m, or 64 cents a share.
Campbell said the actions would allow the company to concentrate on core
business and remain cost competitive. Mr David Johnson, president and chief
executive, said: 'As we focus primarily on soup and biscuits - products
which have the highest growth potential - we will phase out those businesses
which sap management time and are not strategic.'
The company will consolidate its frozen food operations by closing a plant
in Maryland and another in Philadelphia.
It will offer employment assistance packages to employees at those plants.
It plans to sell several non-strategic businesses.
Campbell recently acquired a 58 per cent controlling stake in Arnotts, the
Australian cookie and cracker company, in a bitterly-fought takeover battle.
Mr Johnson said the Arnotts stake would leave Campbell 'poised for expansion
of our biscuit core competency in Asia'.

FT  13 FEB 93 / International Company News: Tapie sale of Adidas holding
near completion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADIDAS, the troubled German sporting goods company, is expected on Monday to
announce that Mr Bernard Tapie, its controlling shareholder, has sold his
shareholdings to a consortium of investors led by Mr Robert Louis-Dreyfus,
chief executive of the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi advertising group.
Mr Tapie, one of the most controversial figures in French business and
politics, is under pressure to sell his Adidas stake, to raise capital to
reduce borrowings amassed by the acquisitions of Bernard Tapie Finances
(BTF), his holding company, in the late 1980s.
He has been in negotiations for weeks with a consortium of investors headed
by Mr Louis-Dreyfus, a wealthy French businessman who announced last year
that he would be leaving Saatchi this spring to pursue his own interests.
The consortium, which includes a number of French financial institutions,
notably Credit Lyonnais, the bank, and Assurances Generales de France (AGF),
the insurer, which are minority investors in Adidas, is believed to have
finalised terms with Mr Tapie last week.
Mr Tapie is selling his 78 per cent holding in BTF the German holding
company that controls 95 per cent of Adidas. An article in yesterday's Les
Echos, the French financial newspaper, suggested that the takeover would
include Mr Louis-Dreyfus buying 15 per cent of BTF with Credit Lyonnais and
AGF raising their stakes to 18 per cent from 10 per cent and 5 per cent
respectively.
Adidas's supervisory board will discuss the deal at a meeting on Monday
afternoon.
Mr Tapie, who has sold most of BTF's businesses, has set a deadline of
Monday to complete the sale of the Adidas stake, which is his only
substantial remaining asset.

FT  13 FEB 93 / International Company News: Ciments Francais slips into red
with FFr1.3bn net loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CIMENTS Francais, the troubled French cement group hit last autumn by a
scandal over off-balance sheet dealings, has fallen into the red with a net
loss of FFr1.3bn (Dollars 238m) for 1992.
The losses, which are mainly due to the exceptional deficit of FFr1bn made
by unauthorised transactions, are worse than expected. Less than a week ago
Ciments Francais estimated the level of last year's losses at FFr1bn.
Ciments Francais yesterday disclosed that it had been forced by the Spanish
stock market authorities to make a Pta4.11bn (Dollars 35.9m) partial bid for
Cementos Molins, the Spanish cement company embroiled in this autumn's
scandal.
The partial bid follows the discovery that, in the course of the illegal
dealings, Ciments Francais, a minority shareholder in Cementos Molins with
an authorised 25.3 per cent holding, had raised its stake further which took
it above the maximum level permitted under Spanish law.
The French group has agreed to the Spanish authorities' request to bid for a
further 10 per cent of Cementos Molins at a price of Pta3,700 a share.
Ciments Francais has sold the other shareholdings amassed in its off-balance
sheet dealings. The partial bid for Cementos Molins was the final stage of
Ciments' restructuring after the scandal which triggered the resignation of
Mr Pierre Conso as chairman.
However, the FFr1bn exceptional losses on the unauthorised investments took
a heavy toll on Ciments Francais last year.
The group which, like other building material manufacturers, has been badly
affected by the downturn in the European construction industry, saw turnover
fall to FFr14.9bn in 1992 from FFr16.45bn in 1991.
The group said that FFr574m of the FFr1.55bn fall in sales was due to the
decline in trading, FFr672m to disposals and FFr300m to currency factors.

FT  13 FEB 93 / International Company News: Bronfmans sell Labatt stake for
close to CDollars 1bn

<TEXT>
CANADA'S Bronfman family has parted with a second prized asset in less than
a week by selling its controlling stake in John Labatt, the brewer and
entertainment group.
Senior Bronfman officials insisted yesterday that the disposal, which will
realise close to CDollars 1bn (USDollars 700m) was part of a plan to
'simplify and streamline' the vast industrial and financial-services empire.
Mr Bob Harding, president of Hees International Bancorp, the Bronfmans'
merchant banking arm, said that the Bronfman group has a 'very strong heart'
which has been built on equity, rather than short-term debt.
The Bronfman group's explanation was greeted with scepticism in the
investment community. The disposal comes on the heels of the CDollars 970m
sale earlier last week of the Bronfman's interest in MacMillan Bloedel, the
Vancouver-based forestry company.
Companies in the Bronfman empire, which are intertwined through complex
cross-shareholdings, have recently been rocked by investor uncertainty over
the impact of financial problems at Bramalea, the real estate developer
currently in bankruptcy protection, and Royal Trust, the financial-services
group which is seeking an infusion of outside capital.
Brascan, a Bronfman-controlled holding company, sold its 38 per cent stake
in Labatt to a group of Canadian securities dealers, led by Wood Gundy, at a
price of CDollars 28.25 per share.
As in the case of the MacMillan Bloedel deal, the price will be paid in
three instalments over the next two years, giving a net present value to
buyers of less than CDollars 27 a share.
Mr David Cohen, an analyst at Research Capital in Toronto, said that the
Labatt shares 'were priced to sell'.
Bronfman officials said that the Labatt sale was initiated on short notice
by Wood Gundy following the strong response earlier this week to the sale of
Macblo shares.
The two deals are among the biggest equity offerings ever made by Canadian
companies.
Wood Gundy said the shares were snapped up yesterday, with 20-25 per cent
being placed with European investors and the rest in Canada. Labatt has a 44
per cent share of the Canadian beer market and substantial brewing interests
in Europe, including the Rolling Rock brand in the UK.
Its entertainment interests include an all-sports cable-TV channel, and the
Toronto Blue Jays baseball team, which won last year's World Series baseball
championship.
Labatt's net income rose to CDollars 104m on sales of CDollars 2.3bn in the
six months to October 31, from earnings of CDollars 89m and sales of just
less than CDollars 2bn a year earlier.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Week in the Markets: Zinc price rally goes into reverse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE PARTY seems to be over for the zinc market
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
for the time being at least. The rally sparked off two weeks ago by news of
an Australian output cut became history this week when prices at the London
Metal Exchange slipped back to the levels ruling before the cut was
announced.
The zinc market had been trading sideways for some time before it was
wakened from its slumber on January 28 by Pasminco's announcement that it
was restructuring its loss-making lead and zinc operations at Broken Hill,
New South Wales, with the result that zinc production would be reduced by
25,000 tonnes a year. While the tonnage involved looked unimpressive when
set against the 1m tonnes of zinc in western world stocks the news raised
hopes that enough companies would follow Pasminco's lead for substantial
inroads to be made into those stocks.
Those hopes were nourished last week when Cominco of Canada, and Ruhr-Zinc
of Germany, a Metallgesellschaft subsidiary, weighed in with cuts amounting
to 80,000 tonnes this year. That was enough to keep the three months
delivery price near the post-Pasminco peak of Dollars 1,137 a tonne, but the
market was still looking for more, much more.
In the absence of further cuts this week - the only production announcement
was about a 70,000-80,000-tonnes-a-year rise planned by Spain's Asturiana de
Zinc - the market went into reverse. As LME warehouse stocks of the metal
rose by another 12,300 tonnes on the week to a record 537,225 tonnes the
three months price slid close to Dollars 1,070 before finding support
yesterday. At the close it stood at Dollars 1,082 a tonne, down Dollars 46
on the week.
The copper price was supported early in the week by the threat of a strike
by workers at Poland's KGHM, but it went into decline when the strike plan
was called off and the three months position, which had peaked at Pounds
1,585 on Tuesday, closed yesterday at Pounds 1,581.75 a tonne, up Pounds 26
on the week. However, sterling's weakness was again the main support of
copper; in terms of the US currency the price was down Dollars 8 on the
week.
Dealers said hopes raised by improving US economic data were counteracted by
low European physical offtake of copper and by the continuing high level of
CIS shipments.
The strongest LME contract was nickel, which reached four-week highs early
on and moved on to Dollars 6,170 a tonne for three months metal in midweek
as concern about tight scrap supplies in western Europe was backed up by
bullish technical factors. The investment fund buying that had fuelled the
rise then dried up, however, and the price dropped back by about Dollars 100
before recovering yesterday to Dollars 6,152.50 a tonne, up Dollars 225 on
the week.
Among the precious metals palladium was the liveliest performer as supply
tightness, widely attributed to reduced Russian shipments, encouraged
Japanese buyers. The London price climbed to Dollars 119 a troy ounce,
adding Dollars 4.10 to last week's Dollars 2.75 advance, before falling back
Dollars 3 yesterday after a Russian official insisted that his country was
still meeting all contracts to supply the metal to world markets. Traders
had earlier suggested that increased Russian sales to the Far East had
reduced availability for the US and Europe.
The gold market tried to break through both ends of its recent narrow
trading range this week. Physical offtake prevented a breach of the Dollars
327-an-ounce level on Monday and a move above Dollars 332 on Thursday ran
into determined selling. Yesterday the price fell back Dollars 3.30 to
Dollars 328.45, up 45 cents on the week, and some traders were predicting a
renewed test of the Dollars 327 support.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange's robusta coffee market bearish
technical factors continued to vie with bullish fundamentals - and a narrow
verdict went in favour of the former. Heavy selling in New York's arabica
coffee market on Monday night was followed by a dip to Dollars 853 a tonne
for London's May delivery position on Tuesday. But the buyers were soon back
and the price touched Dollars 945 a tonne on Thursday. Yesterday saw another
swing of the pendulum, however, and the London price closed at Dollars 916 a
tonne, down Dollars 15 on the week.
Thursday's strength had been encouraged by news that Brazilian coffee
exports dropped sharply in January compared with the same month last year.
Shipments were down 71.2 per cent, from 2m bags (60 kg each) to 578,000
bags. With an average price of Dollars 53.88 a bag, compared with Dollars
68.95 in January 1992, revenues were down even more sharply, by 77.5 per
cent.
In addition to reduced supply, the drop was blamed on a seven-day port
strike, according to the Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters.
Latin-American coffee-growing nations were yesterday expected to sign a
declaration aimed at kick-starting stalled efforts at reaching a new
economic coffee pact, Venezuela's deputy foreign minister said in Caracas,
according to the Reuter news agency.
Mr Fernando Gerbasi said the statement would be directed at the
International Coffee Organisation and would be signed by regional presidents
who are in Caracas to forge a free trade pact between Central America,
Venezuela and Colombia. 'Our intention is to make a call for us to once
again enter into negotiations, especially with important countries that have
a special weight on production,' he said.

FT  13 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Pausing to reflect on strategy - Lloyds'
result gives Pitman plenty to mull over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BRIAN PITMAN was performing his role as British banking's philosopher
king yesterday as the Lloyds chief executive pondered what the future held
for his bank.
The bank's struggle to maintain profitability in its British retail
business, and speculation that it may soon seek an acquisition, gave him
plenty to mull over.
Lloyds' results, the first of the UK clearing banks to report its full-year
results for 1992, had some encouraging aspects for the sector. It achieved a
modest rise in operating profits to Pounds 1.5bn, and its pre-tax profits
rise was aided by a net Pounds 122m release of Latin American debt
provisions.
Among the highlights of the results were much improved earnings from foreign
exchange trading, caused by currency volatility last year. This income rose
from Pounds 72m in 1991 to Pounds 136m, and Mr Pitman emphasised that
earnings were likely to continue at a high level while volatility remained.
The bank held down its costs - reducing operating expenses by Pounds 20m and
cutting its ratio of costs to income from 62.3 per cent to 61.6 per cent. It
reduced its employees by 4,159, or 6 per cent, and its staff numbers are now
22 per cent down on their peak in the expansionary late-1980s.
It also displayed a far better performance in its corporate banking and
treasury division as provisions for lending to companies with turnover above
Pounds 25m fell from Pounds 228m to Pounds 58m. The division's performance
rebounded from a small loss of Pounds 1m in 1991 to healthy profit of Pounds
174m last year.
But despite these achievements, the results also displayed a fundamental
challenge to Lloyds in keeping up its record as Britain's most profitable
clearing bank. Profits in the UK retail bank, which has traditionally
generated much of its earnings, fell sharply, from Pounds 105m in 1991 to
just Pounds 5m.
This performance partly reflected the size of provisions on lending to small
and medium-sized businesses, which Mr Pitman emphasised yesterday had been
loss-making in 1992. Provisions for corporate and personal lending in the
retail bank rose obstinately to Pounds 563m from Pounds 551m as other
provisions fell.
More fundamentally for Lloyds' long-term performance in the domestic market,
it showed the domestic profit squeeze created by the combination of a fall
in loan volumes and a reduction in base rates. The second produced a 32
basis point cut in domestic net interest margin, and cost the bank Pounds
115m.
This prompts a fundamental question over Lloyds' future: whether its current
UK business can raise loan volumes and margins - as well as fee income -
enough to renew profit growth. The alterna-tives are to sit on its current
capital strength, or to seek an acquisition to provide growth.
Mr Pitman was not giving anything specific away yesterday, but he had many
general thoughts. The first was that the bank would be happy to keep
strengthening capital. 'We are going to make ourselves as strong as
possible, so we can take knocks, and take advantage of any opportunities,'
he said.
Although the second half of the year showed a marginal growth in domestic
interest-earning assets over the first, Mr Pitman insisted that the bank
would remain careful. 'Chasing market share just for sheer volume always
ends in tears, though the tears may take two or three years,' he said.
Mr Pitman argued that Lloyds' capital strength and retail profitability were
not the only reasons for it to reflect carefully on strategy. Another was
uncertainty over whether Britain was in long period of low inflation and
interest rates - something on which Lloyds directors have mixed views.
If so - and if gilts then held an attractive enough yield over bank base
rates - then it might make sense for the bank to return to the tradition of
not being 'fully lent'. Instead of offering using all its funds in loans, it
could instead invest in government gilts or on swaps markets.
But this uncertainty over strategy does not mean Mr Pitman has abandoned his
view that the British banking market is due for rationalisation. Despite the
failure of the Midland bid - which cost Lloyds Pounds 4m - he believes his
well-capital-ised bank should still look for ways of achieving
consolidation.
'The gap between good performers and poor performers will continue to widen,
and if you look at US bank mergers it is usually a strong bank taking over a
weak one,' he said. This was one reason why he was sanguine at the prospect
of the bank's capital rations climbing further.
He did not give the impression that his thoughts were confined to looking
for weakness in the TSB Group and Royal Bank of Scotland. 'I will be
terribly interested to see the other bank results. I think there is a
tremendous amount of hope value in other shares,' he said.

FT  13 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Lloyds Bank rises to Pounds 801m - 28%
advance despite sharp fall in UK retail banking profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS BANK yesterday disclosed a 28 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 801m, despite a sharp fall in UK retail bank profits from Pounds 105m
to Pounds 5m. This was partly caused by losses on small and medium-sized
business lending.
The bank announced a 10 per cent increase in its dividend to 18.4p (16.7p),
payable May 5. This was criticised by Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow
chancellor, who said it reinforced the case for an inquiry into banking
practices.
Lloyds' profits were at the top end of expectations. The shares opened at
528p and rose to 543p on the announcement, closing at 534p.
The results were helped by a net release of Pounds 122m (Pounds 40m) of
problem country debt, and increased profits on foreign exchange trading
income of Pounds 136m (Pounds 72m) because of currency volatility.
Pre-tax profits were raised Pounds 153m because Lloyds decided not to
attribute this portion of a Pounds 203m cut in the valuation of its British
premises to profit and loss. Directors decided that only Pounds 50m of the
deficit would be permanent.
Sir Robin Ibbs, Lloyds' chairman, said the figures for UK retail banking
were disappointing, but losses on small and medium-sized lending showed that
criticism of banks' behaviour in the sector had been 'enormously
exaggerated'.
Sir Robin said he would not comment on speculation that Lloyds might bid for
another bank. But he said Lloyds remained 'convinced that sooner or later
substantial restructuring of the industry will have to take place.'
The bank's operating profit before provisions rose 2 per cent to Pounds
1.54bn (Pounds 1.5bn). Operating income remained virtually unchanged at
Pounds 3.99bn (Pounds 3.98bn), while operating expenses fell by 1 per cent
to Pounds 2.46bn (Pounds 2.48bn).
Overall net interest income dropped 5 per cent to Pounds 2.23bn. The volume
of domestic loans fell 11 per cent to Pounds 1.82bn, and the net interest
margin on domestic loans narrowed to 5.01 per cent (5.33 per cent).
Shareholders' funds rose 10 per cent to Pounds 2.73bn (Pounds 2.48bn), and
total assets rose to Pounds 61bn (Pounds 56.1bn). The bank's total risk
asset ratio strengthened to 10.5 per cent (9.7 per cent), while tier 1
capital rose to 6.5 per cent (6.2 per cent).
Dividend cover was 1.9 times (1.7 times), and net asset value per share rose
9 per cent to 215p (197p). Earnings increased by 26 per cent to 35p (27.7p).
Pre-tax return on shareholders' equity advanced to 26.1 per cent (21 per
cent). Post-tax return on average shareholders' equity rose to 16.9 per cent
(14.5 per cent). Pre-tax return on average assets improved to 1.5 per cent
(1.15 per cent).
Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said that small
businesses would view the figures 'with great suspicion. It seemed unfair
that banks were raising prices just as small businesses were cutting theirs
to stay afloat.'

FT  13 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Bucknall losses trimmed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A DIFFICULT period for Bucknall Group saw the construction consultancy group
trim its interim pre-tax losses from Pounds 752,000 to Pounds 745,000, after
continuing rationalisation to eliminate loss-making businesses.
Operating losses from continuing businesses fell to Pounds 411,000 (Pounds
528,000) for the half year to October 31, on turnover of Pounds 7.15m
(Pounds 7.56m).
After restructuring costs - mainly for redundancies - overall operating
deficit was Pounds 607,000 (Pounds 571,000). Interest took Pounds 138,000
(Pounds 181,000).
Losses per share emerged at 5.7p (5.6p). There was again no interim
dividend.
Mr Richard Miles, chairman, said considerable progress had been made in
stabilising the group and he was confident that results would show further
improvement in the next six months.

FT  13 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Changes by Isosceles chief lead to
departures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID Simons, the new chief executive at Isosceles, yesterday moved to
simplify the management structure of the Gateway food retail business and
put the development of new retail formats 'on pause'.
He said a review of head office costs had started this week which would take
between 10 and 12 weeks to complete.
As part of the changes, two directors are leaving the company. They are Mr
Paul Highett-Smith, the buying director, and Mr Jim Grant, managing director
of the Somerfield chain. Mr Simons said that terms of their departure were
still being negotiated.
Earlier this week Isosceles, the vehicle for the Pounds 2.1bn 1989 leveraged
buy-out of Gateway, agreed the sale of Herman's Sporting Goods, the US
chain, leaving Gateway as the only operating business. Isosceles is
currently working on a business plan to put to its lenders and shareholders
as the basis of a refinancing of the group's Pounds 1.4bn of loans.
Gateway includes a number of different fascias, some of which the previous
management had been rolling out to replace the Gateway name. Mr Simons, who
joined the group on January 4, has decided to put the development of the
Somerfield format on pause. He said 'the fascia debate is a non-debate. We
must upgrade the quality of what we do inside the store before the outside
of the store'.
He plans to merge most of the different business units within Gateway's head
office in Bristol. Mr Simons said this would avoid duplication, improve
accountability and make for a more efficient organisation.
However, the Food Giant discount store business will remain separate, he
said, because 'the mindset of a discount operation is so different we could
destroy the concept if it was mixed in'.
Mr David Jury, from the Gateway chain, is to become store operations
director.
The London head office of Isosceles will close at the end of April, and the
boards of the two companies are being merged. Isosceles held its board
meeting in Bristol for the first time on Thursday.
Mr Simons denied suggestions that structural changes were being made because
the group's lenders had demanded cost cuts. He said 'this is not about
money, it is about a simpler organisation'.
He said that the business plan now being finalised aimed to address
Gateway's problems. These included systems which were 3 to 5 years behind
its main competitors, the fact that 'we have allowed ourselves to get into a
position of price uncompetitiveness', and Gateway had been 'lousy at
executing things we had said we would do'.
Priorities would be 'making sure the shelves were full and tidy, the chiller
cabinets are working and the staff are interested'.
Poor availability of stock in the stores had meant pre-Christmas sales had
been weak. Gateway had been going through a period of 'sharp decline in
sales' but in recent days that decline was slowing, he said.
He said that the group's lenders and shareholders were being supportive.
Rumours that Wasserstein Perella, the US investment house which has a veto
through its holding of half the A shares, had refused to support the
refinancing were 'absolute bunkum'.
Discussions on the refinancing would not start until there was a business
plan on the table, he said.

FT  13 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Liquidation for Belling as trade creditors
fight unusual contest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIQUIDATORS were appointed yesterday to Belling, the cooker manufacturer
which collapsed in May, after an unusual contest between groups of trade
creditors.
Buchler Phillips and Touche Ross were elected joint liquidators with the
support of some creditors and the Belling pension fund.
The opponents, which had backed Cork Gully and Robson Rhodes, are seeking to
limit claims against the estate by the pension fund, whose current trustees
are seeking Pounds 8m.
The creditors argued during a four-hour meeting yesterday that a portion of
the pension scheme claim may be dubious and consequently should not be
granted full voting rights.
The pension scheme was allowed to vote Pounds 6.9m of its Pounds 8m claim,
according to Mr David Buchler, partner at Buchler Phillips. This appears to
have been crucial to Buchler's and Touche's election.
The former trustees of the pension scheme, Mr Richard Belling and Mr Michael
Stewart - chairman and finance director of Belling respectively - have been
served with writs by the current trustees, Law Debenture Corporation.
The writs seek the return of Pounds 2.1m representing a payment from the
fund authorised by the trustees to a Staffordshire-based solicitor Mr
Charles Deacon, intended as an advance for a Dollars 50m loan to Belling
itself.
Also, a total of Pounds 5.5m is claimed in connection with the pension
fund's acquisition of a subsidiary of Belling.
Touche Ross, told creditors yesterday they might receive no more than 10p in
the pound from the liquidation.
A severance claim by employees - many of whom are owed holiday pay and some
wages - was being examined by the liquidators, Touche Ross said.
The pension fund, represented by The Law Debenture Trust, is seeking to
receive at least Pounds 2m of its Pounds 8m claim directly rather than as a
dividend from the general fund.
However, trade creditors are anxious that all claims should be treated
equally.
This forms part of their argument against the appointment of liquidators
supported by the pension scheme's trust-ees.
'The fund is competing for the return of Pounds 2m and we feel it needs an
independent examination of whether that should be spread among other
creditors', said Mr David Cooke, a solicitor representing some 70 creditors
owed about Pounds 8m. 'The liquidator should not be seen to have been
elected on the reliance of the pension fund votes.'

FT  13 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Private banking bad debts rise to Pounds
21m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS Bank disclosed yesterday that provisions against bad and doubtful
debts in private banking increased from Pounds 5m to Pounds 21m largely
because of a single bad debt provision in its international private banking
operations, writes John Gapper.
About Pounds 12m of the provision is believed to relate to an incident
involving an employee at its Geneva branch, who disappeared last year
following the discovery of Pounds 11.6m in losses on unauthorised foreign
exchange dealings.
Geneva police put out a warrant for the arrest of the Lloyds' employee in
August, and Lloyds said at the time that clients' money was not involved.
The branch specialises in portfolio management for wealthy clients.
Sir Robin Ibbs, Lloyds' chairman, said yesterday that the bank could make no
comment on the Pounds 21m provision beyond the fact that it largely related
to a single incident in its private banking operations overseas.
The Lloyds' incident was one of two irregularities disclosed in a
British-owned bank in Switzerland last year. Rothschild Bank, an affiliate
of NM Rothschild &amp; Sons in London, had to shore up its equity base after
large loan losses.
Investigators in Geneva said in August that the Lloyds employee, who was
believed to have fled to Egypt, was a portfolio manager for some of Lloyds'
Middle East clients.
Some clients instructed him to put their money into foreign exchange futures
and instruments only offering the possibility of capital gain because they
wanted to comply with the Koran's prohibition of interest-bearing
investments.

FT  13 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Unigate launches Pounds 50m bid for
Clifford
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIGATE, Britain's fourth largest dairy group, yesterday launched a Pounds
50.37m recommended cash bid for Clifford Foods, the Berkshire-based dairy,
juices and food company which recently suffered a sharp drop in profits.
Unigate is offering 573p for each Clifford ordinary share and 251p for each
non-voting A share. The bid has been accepted by Clifford's directors and
family shareholders, who together control 51.8 per cent of the ordinary
shares.
Unigate said it expected the acquisition to enhance earnings in the first
year. It would add about 3 percentage points to Unigate's share of the
liquid milk market in England and Wales, taking it to about 16 per cent.
Clifford has two milk processing facilities and five depots in southern
England and provides doorstep deliveries to 170,000 customers. It also
produces fruit juices, food ingredients and chilled and frozen convenience
meals.
Mr Ross Buckland, Unigate chief executive, said the addition of Clifford
would strengthen his group's dairy business, which covers a band stretching
across the south of the country from Kent to Cornwall. As well as expanding
the dairy capacity, the acquisition would provide a modern fruit juice plant
to replace a Unigate facility in London due to close shortly.
Clifford's pre-tax profits fell 60 per cent to Pounds 1.03m in the first
half last year on turnover of Pounds 70.1m. It blamed the cost of
modernising a dairy, lower sales of convenience foods and the impact of
price-cutting on supermarket milk sales.
The deal is conditional on there being no reference to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission, but Mr Buckland said he expected no competition policy
problems. Clifford's share price closed at 473p yesterday, down 50p, while
Unigate closed at 342p, up 15p.
Unigate, which is also involved in food processing, road transport and used
car auctions, has steadily added to its liquid milk operations recently.
Last year it acquired two small dairies, Abbots and Sussex, and last month
acquired some of the Co-operative Wholesale Society's milk distribution
businesses.
This is the second time Unigate has bid for Clifford. Its first offer, which
was hostile, was rejected in 1980.

FT  13 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Cupid may seek cash injection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUPID has not had the run-up to Valentine's Day that it might have wished in
terms of sales, but the bridal wear group's attractions to a group of new
investors are expect-ed to lead to a cash inject-ion.
An announcement is expected soon about the fund raising, which is likely to
involve some individual equity investors. The move might be linked to board
appointments.
The USM-quoted company warned yesterday that it would make 'a substantial
loss' for the year to March 31. This comes only two months after it said
pre-tax profits would be no more than last year's Pounds 867,000.
The share price has been hitting new lows ever since and yesterday shed
another 3p to close at 35p.
The December warning was accompanied by news of the resignation of the
founder, Mr Michael Murray, as chief executive after a disagreement with the
rest of the board.
Mr Richard Lee, chairman, has taken on the role temporarily, leading a
review of the business. As a result, activities are being concentrated on
two sites instead of five. The head office is being moved from Accrington to
the main factory in Blackburn.
The cost of these cuts is one reason for the company falling into the red.
The other is that sales of bridal wear and nursery products have fallen
below budget in the crucial last quarter of the year.
If there is another equity issue it will be the third in little more than
two years. Last June a 1-for-2 rights issue, priced at 82p a share, raised
Pounds 2.68m. However, more than 80 per cent was left with the underwriters.
The proceeds helped ease net debt of Pounds 4.2m - gearing of 93 per cent -
built up partly through the acquisition of the Youngs formal wear business.
In December 1990 the acquisition of the Pronuptia retail chain was
accompanied by a placing and offer which doubled the equity.
Cupid's share price peaked at 143p in July 1989, shortly before it moved up
from the Third Market to the USM. It also rose to more than 120p ahead of
last June's rights.

FT  13 FEB 93 / UK Company News: BP to spend Dollars 840m upgrading refinery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Petroleum is to spend Dollars 840m (Pounds 556.2m) to upgrade its
Singapore refinery so that it will be able to produce more
environmentally-friendly fuels.
Mr Russell Seal, BP Oil's chief executive, said the project would position
the refinery as a benchmark in the region and enable the company to take
advantage of the growing market for transport fuels. The refinery is on the
southern tip of Singapore at Palau Merlimau.
The Japanese Gasoline Corporation, which originally built the plant, has
been awarded the contract to upgrade the 220,000-barrel refinery. The work
is due to be completed in 1995. The refinery is a joint venture between BP,
the Singapore Petroleum Company and Caltex - a partnership between Chevron
and Texaco.
The improvement will involve the construction of a residue cracker which
will enable the plant to process heavy fuel oil and turn it into petrol -
including unleaded - and diesel. It will also include a hydrofiner capable
of reducing sulphur levels in diesel to acceptable levels.
The south-east Asian market for oil products has been one of the few areas
to show growth over the past two years and oil demand remains strong while
it has been stagnant in the US and Europe.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Game boys and girls go out to play: Retailers cannot afford
to ignore the recession-proof teenage market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The generation that spent the 1960s and 1970s confounding and appalling its
elders now faces the embarrassment of not knowing the answer to this
question: what do the youth of today really want?
This week, the music industry, home to many a former flower child, admitted
that young customers were slipping away. Music suppliers' and distributors'
revenues dropped 2.4 per cent to Pounds 692.5m last year - the first fall
since 1980.
While music companies were not short of new compilations of old hits by Cher
and Pink Floyd, they said they had found little to enthuse today's
teenagers.
Some marketing experts admit to being mystified by teenagers' tastes. Mr
Richard Hyman, chairman of Verdict Research, a retail consultancy, says:
'One of the striking things about people of this age is they're a million
miles from being a homogenous group. The difference between a 14 and a
17-year-old is as big as the difference between a 17 and a 30-year-old.'
Yet the teenage market is not one that retailers and providers of leisure
goods can afford to ignore, not least because its spending power appears
unaffected either by the recession or the fall in the young population.
Research carried out late last year for EMAP, which publishes several
magazines for teenagers, including Smash Hits and Just 17, found that while
the number of young people aged 11-20 fell from 8.7m in 1986 to 7.3m last
year, their total disposable income had never been higher.
The EMAP survey found that the 11-20 age group had Pounds 9.4bn to spend -
19 per cent higher in real terms than in 1988. This did not include living
expenses such as rent and utilities, on which they spent an additional
Pounds 6.5bn.
EMAP's interviews with 532 under-20s found that they were leaving their
parents' homes later than in the 1980s. The company's research report said:
'This could be one of the ironies of the recession. It may well be that the
very reason kids have so much more disposable income is because they live at
home longer - and they live at home longer because they cannot afford to
move out.'
A more puzzling finding was that their recession-hit parents were giving
them more money. Average pocket money rose from Pounds 2.86 a week in 1988
to Pounds 10.10 last year. Girls did better with Pounds 11.20 a week,
compared with boys who got Pounds 9.10.
Miss Delyth Chapman, the author of the EMAP report, says she is not sure why
pocket money has proved so recession-resistant. 'Maybe kids have got a
little better at getting money out of their parents,' she says.
Miss Chapman says the biggest change in the past four years has been the
number of under-20s being paid by their parents to do odd jobs such as
washing the car. 'Chore money is now huge. It didn't exist four years ago.
During a recession, parents are more aware of the value of money, and they
are passing that attitude on to their children.'
The average 11-20 year-old has income from all sources of Pounds 46.50 a
week, of which Pounds 24.65 goes towards discretionary consumer spending,
according to the EMAP research. The rest goes on savings, living expenses or
contributions to the household.
So what do the young spend their money on? Much of it still goes on music,
despite the industry's current travails. Mr Simon Burke, managing director
of the retail arm of the Virgin group, says that young spenders still
account for half the music industry's turnover. He says: 'While it's fair to
say that the market has moved away from that age group in the past five
years, they are vital to us and they always will be.'
Much of the money that used to go on music is now spent on computer games.
Music retailers such as Virgin and W H Smith have been able to devote more
of their store space to computer games because of the decline of vinyl
records and their replacement by smaller compact discs. Mr Nigel Kenyon
Jones, general manager of music and computer games at W H Smith Retail,
says: 'It was a happy coincidence.'
Miss Chapman says that while the under-20s are big readers of magazines and
newspapers, books are not a high priority. 'I don't think book-reading has
been a major leisure occupation for some years,' she says.
Mrs Sally Brummitt, product group manager for children's books at W H Smith,
says girls read more than boys. Horror stories are popular, accounting for
15 of the company's top 20 teenage paperbacks.
'They're very similar to adult horror fiction - the covers have knives
sticking in doors - but they're not as violent or graphic. The protagonists
are teenagers and they're about ghost themes and being stalked,' she says.
Some teenagers move on to adult crime novels by Agatha Christie and Ruth
Rendell. W H Smith has found that even young teenagers didn't want to be
seen in the children's books section. 'We had to hide because Stevie and the
gang arrived,' one 13-year old said.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Gene therapy for an industry's health: Clive Cookson on UK
efforts in a crucial area of research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government, industry and scientists in the UK are scrambling to mobilise the
country's resources in the international race to exploit the astonishingly
rapid pace of genetic research.
At stake is the future of the only manufacturing sector in which the UK is
still an undisputed world leader - pharmaceuticals. Its success has been
based firmly on conventional chemistry. But a different industry will emerge
over the next 20 years, based on genetics and aiming directly at the
ultimate cause of disease - the genes that give instructions for every
living process.
'Our historical success with a chemistry-driven pharmaceutical industry does
not mean we will automatically succeed in the biology-driven industry of the
future,' warns Dr David Owen, industrial collaboration director at the
government's Medical Research Council.
Every week, the world's molecular biologists announce the discovery of new
genes associated with human disease. They are not only identifying the
precise molecular causes of classic inherited disorders, such as cystic
fibrosis, but are also finding unexpected evidence for the way particular
genes trigger the most widespread illnesses of modern society, includ-ing
forms of cancer and heart disease.
Scientists have already identified several thousand of the estimated 100,000
genes that make up the whole human genetic blueprint and, working through a
loosely co-ordinated international effort known as the Human Genome Project,
they expect to have decoded the entire 'handbook of man' within 10 years.
At the same time, other scientists are rapidly developing ways to manipulate
the newly discovered genes. More than 20 clinical trials have started within
the last two years, mostly in the US. Some involve 'gene therapy' - giving
patients perfect copies of defective genes. Others are testing 'anti-sense
therapy', a bizarrely named technique for switching off malfunctioning
genes. Target diseases range from rare inherited blood disorders to cancer.
Leaders of UK biomedical research such as Sir Walter Bodmer, director of the
Imperial Cancer Research Fund, insist that the country's basic genetic
science still matches the best in the world. But its application through
human gene therapy is lagging two to three years behind the US.
Professor William Stewart, the government's chief scientific adviser, sees
human gene research as the most important of all the scientific issues
facing the UK. 'It will make a big impact on improving health care, quality
of life and industrial competitiveness,' he says. Over the last month he has
orchestrated a series of moves, in concert with leading scientists and the
pharmaceutical industry, to improve the UK position:
A new Advisory Committee for Human Genome Research will draw up a national
strategy. Its members include research directors of the four largest
UK-based drug companies (Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham, Imperial Chemical
Industries and Wellcome).
The Department of Health has approved the first UK gene therapy trial;
doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London will soon inject
genetically engineered bone marrow cells into a child suffering from a rare
immune disease. Next week the department is expected to announce permanent
arrangements to supervise gene therapy; until now these have been in the
hands of a temporary committee chaired by Sir Cecil Clothier.
The allocation of next year's government science budget includes several
million pounds more for genetic research. The Pounds 25m Clinical Sciences
Centre which the Medical Research Council is building at the Hammersmith
Hospital will become an important centre for gene therapy.
The UK is bidding to bring the proposed European Bioinformatics Institute to
Cambridge - the first instance for many years of the UK government setting
out to win an international science facility. EBI will provide computerised
information about human and animal genes to researchers throughout Europe.
Germany is competing to host EBI in Heidelberg.
The government cannot afford to appear overtly nationalistic in its EBI
campaign, for fear of offending the other 14 European nations that will pay
a total of Pounds 5m a year to fund the institute. But Dr Richard Sykes,
Glaxo research director, has no doubts about its potential benefits: 'EBI
will send a positive message to young scientists in the UK and will create
excitement and enthusiasm,' he says.
One advantage which Britain enjoys in increasing support for genetic science
is the new wealth of the Wellcome Trust, the world's richest medical
charity, after last year's sale of its majority stake in Wellcome, the drug
company. That doubled the trust's income to more than Pounds 200m a year -
almost as much as the state-funded MRC. Dr Bridget Ogilvie, the trust's
director, has moved fast to help the MRC build genetic research facilities.
However there is nothing in the UK to match the hundreds of millions of
venture capital dollars pouring into dozens of new US companies established
to commercialise genome research and genetic medicine. The MRC struggled
hard to attract enough seed funding to start one small company to exploit
its gene therapy technology; Therexsys, as it is called, will apply the
technology 'in a number of disease areas including cancer, cardiovascular
and inflammation'.
Besides funding, an important obstacle to the exploitation of genetic
research in the UK is the restrictive attitude taken by overseas companies
to licensing out patents for vital techniques. The best known case is PCR,
the gene-copying technology invented by Cetus in the US and bought by Roche
of Switzerland for Dollars 300m.
'At present progress is being held up in critical areas, where diagnosis is
being impeded,' says Dr Peter Doyle, ICI research director.
Dr Sykes agrees: 'The only thing some biotechnology companies have is their
intellectual property so they patent everything in sight. That inhibits
research.'

FT  13 FEB 93 / Something rotten in the state of Italy: Corruption scandals
involving MPs and businessmen could lead to a reform of the electoral system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like the passengers on the Titanic, Italy's politicians have tended to
assume that they operate in an unsinkable environment.
But the resignation this week of Mr Bettino Craxi, forced to step down after
16 years' leadership of the Socialist party because of alleged corruption,
is proof that the postwar political ship is sinking. The departure of Mr
Craxi marks the end of an era, and will accelerate the extraordinary and
confused process of political change that is now sweeping Italy.
The country is lurching towards reform of the unstable system of
proportional representation that has produced 51 coalition governments in
the last 47 years. Reform in turn will produce early elections, perhaps by
October; and these elections are likely to redraw the political map.
Change has come from an unexpected quarter - the magistrature. Since the
second world war, the Italian judicial system has been weak, easily
subverted by political interference or the tangle of conflicting laws. But
over the past year, an investigation, begun by Milan magistrates into
corruption on public works contracts has brought into its net 47 members of
parliament and several leading businessmen.
'It's as if we are putting parking fines on cars in a city which has had no
parking laws: no matter how many fines you impose there are always more cars
 -it's an indictment of an entire regime,' observed one television
commentator this week.
Each day a new set of arrests is announced, producing a 'who-is-next?'
hysteria among much of the public. On Thursday, Milan stock prices tumbled
and treasury bills were sold in panic, as rumours spread that more top
businessmen and members of the government were in line for investigation.
These reactions underscored the way in which the scandals have touched the
core of the system. For more than a decade Mr Craxi has been a central
figure, guiding the Christian Democrat-Socialist alliance which has
dominated every aspect of state. The 59-year-old autocrat, along with his
Christian Democrat colleagues, Mr Giulio Andreotti and Mr Arnaldo Forlani,
symbolised the permanence of the status quo. This time last year, there was
an understanding among Italy's political leaders that Mr Andreotti would
move from the premiership after the April general elections to become the
next president. Mr Craxi was to become prime minister and Mr Forlani was to
retain control of the Christian Democrats.
Of this trio, dubbed the 'CAF' from their surnames, the veteran Mr Andreotti
has withdrawn discreetly to the sidelines and Mr Forlani has reluctantly
accepted responsibility for mismanagement of the elections by stepping down
last autumn from the leadership of the Christian Democrat party.
Mr Craxi, however, refused to recognise that the Socialist party's poor
election results were a consequence of of his arrogant style of leadership
and of the public's identification of his party with a corrupt power
structure. Then President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro (chosen because Mr Andreotti
was too identified with the corrupt system) rejected him as an unacceptable
candidate for the premiership and chose Mr Craxi's deputy, Prof Giuliano
Amato.
But it took a revolt within the party and six separate warrants from Milan
magistrates to force his resignation. The warrants advised Mr Craxi he was
under investigation for alleged illicit party financing through kickbacks on
public contracts and deals.
By protesting his innocence and clinging to power, Mr Craxi merely
accumulated more public odium. Lately he has been insulted in the street
with a venom not seen since the days of fascism. In contrast, Mr Antonio di
Pietro, the Milan magistrate leading the inquiry, has become a national
hero, emblazoned on t-shirts and praised in graffiti.
The exit of such an unpopular figure as Mr Craxi could assuage some of the
public's appetite for justice over what they regard as a monstrous robbery
perpetrated on the electorate by a corrupt political class. Mr Di Pietro,
for his part, raised the question this week of whether it was feasible to
bring an entire regime to justice in a democracy without undermining the
fabric of democracy itself.
Evidence leaks out daily from the magistrates of the scale on which the main
political parties subverted the state apparatus to their own profit. More
than 105 politicians, businessmen and civil servants have so far confessed
to taking part in a system whereby public works contracts were awarded on
the basis of illicit payments to fund party organisations. The proceeds were
then split on the basis of the importance of the various parties in a
particular city or their share of the national vote.
The current scandals were revealed almost accidentally last February, when
Mr Mario Chiesa, a Socialist apparatchik in Milan, was caught red-handed
taking a L7m (Pounds 3,200) bribe for a hospital contract. Mr Chiesa proved
a small cog in a much larger wheel. Magistrates have since been on the
trail.
The latest line of investigation centres on the electricity industry.
Political leaders are alleged to have placed their representatives on the
board of ENEL, the state electricity authority, to win a share of some
L22,800bn (Pounds 10.4bn) in contracts at five power stations.
Under the Italian judicial system, the magistrate plays the accusatory role,
amassing evidence which must then pass through a lengthy court process. More
than 70 per cent of prosecutions fail. However, whatever the outcome of the
court cases, stories in the press mean that the reputations of a large
number of politicians have been damaged, many irretrievably.
For instance Mr Claudio Martelli, one-time heir to Mr Craxi, was forced to
resign from the justice portfolio on Wednesday, following an announcement he
was under investigation for alleged corruption. Mr Martelli was seen as one
of the few people capable of rejuvenating a demoralised Socialist party and
perhaps forging an alliance of the left with the former communist Party of
the Democratic Left (PDS).
The series of corruption scandals has left Mr Amato in an increasingly
anomalous position as prime minister. The legitimacy of his coalition has
been undermined because its two principal components, the Christian
Democrats and Socialists, have become so tainted by the corruption scandal.
But no one denies his achievements, such as introducing a tough budget and
reforming the state pension scheme in the past eight months, and he has the
backing of President Scalfaro.
Mr Amato is expected to seek ways to broaden support for his government and
carry out a cabinet reshuffle. This week he said his priority was to ensure
approval for electoral reform as quickly as possible. Parliament has a
scheme before it, prepared by a joint commission, which proposes the
majority of seats in both houses be filled on a first-past-the-post basis.
The proposal is in line with the ideas for electoral reform put forward by
the Referendum Movement. The cross-party group's proposals have already been
accepted as the subject of a referendum due to be held between April and
June. In any event, legislation changing the existing system of proportional
representation should be ready before the summer recess.
However, the current system's crisis is affecting Mr Amato's authority. From
now on, he will find it more difficult to govern. In particular, it will be
hard to keep the budget on target, implement the government's privatisation
programme and ease the impact of growing unemployment.
He recently likened his government to a hydrofoil riding on a cushion of air
 -capable of lasting, as long as no one realises the support was merely air.
With luck, and in the absence of an alternative, this cushion of air will
last until early elections. In the present climate, these cannot be put off
much later than the autumn.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Letter: Satisfied customer comes to defence of banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms FELICITY ROBERTSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Over the past 12 months criticism has been heaped upon the banks for
not passing on interest rate cuts to their customers and for their often
quoted 'uncaring attitude' in dealings with their small business customers.
I would like to redress the balance with our experience with Barclays Bank.
We are a small (12 bedroom) country house hotel in Cornwall with average
borrowings. We have benefited with a review of our monthly loan repayments
at every interest rate cut including the most recent.
I have been constantly in touch with the bank's branch in Bath which could
not have been more helpful and patient in working out the best arrangement
for us, including extending the length of the loan to help our cash flow
position. The past two years have not been all one would wish them to be for
the catering industry and Cornwall particularly has suffered with many
owners being forced into liquidation. With that scenario we were
apprehensive about whether Barclays would further extend its loan facilities
to us last year when an opportunity to expand into the next door property
proved irresistible even though the timing was not opportune.
Not only did Barclays provide us with the loan, it has since extended an
overdraft facility, accepting that while the business is marginally making a
profit, our track record shows that once the country is out of recessionary
conditions, we will be in a position to start reducing the overdraft.
I am convinced that if more small businesses kept in touch with bank
managers, keeping them up to date honestly with their financial situation
then the banks would be in a better position to be more helpful.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Letter: Pensions argument rests on long-term low inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TIM SCHOLEFIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In discussing the pressure on UK pension funds to increase holdings of
bonds ('Time to tilt the balance', February 9), Mr Plender takes a
remarkably sanguine view of the outlook for UK inflation.
The case for a permanent increase in bond weightings at the expense of
equities must surely rest with a belief that the UK economy has somehow
achieved a fundamental improvement in its ability to deliver lower inflation
over the entire economic cycle. Few would argue that events since September
1992 have reduced the uncertainty over the ultimate course of inflation,
since, having abandoned the ERM, the UK authorities have failed to establish
a credible medium-term economic strategy.
Equally, UK economic history suggests the ultimate consequence of a sharply
weaker pound is higher inflation. Lastly, given the state of public
finances, it would be dangerous to ignore the attractions of higher
inflation as a means of reducing the real burden of government debt. Hence,
from a longer-term asset allocation perspective, the case for a sustained
reduction in equity weightings becomes less convincing, and dangers inherent
in assuming that inflation has been permanently laid low are understated.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Letter: Legislation needs costing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BERNARD MANSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You report that the number of civil servants is increasing ('Whitehall
fails to keep its numbers in check', February 8). If the government is
serious about reducing their numbers, may I recommend that it passes the
following Act of parliament:
'Each Bill placed before parliament shall contain an accurate estimate of
the number of civil servants needed to implement the provisions therein.'
This would be a useful lever to encourage the government to give a
cost-benefit justification of proposed legislation. It is not unreasonable
to hope that it would at least marginally reduce the flow of legislation,
thus easing the pressure on the civil service.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Letter: Banks have variety of options to avoid introducing
charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON C BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Having worked for one of the largest banks until last year, and as a
still captive customer of that bank, I think creditworthy bank customers
should bear in mind a few points that weren't in your otherwise reasoned
article 'A charge that's set to shock' (February 9).
First, it is misleading to suggest that pressure to reintroduce charges has
been caused by the fall in the base rate. The level of the base rate is not
as important to the banks as lending margins, since a bank's assets comprise
mainly of personal and commercial lending. While rates of interest paid to
depositors have fallen, rates for borrowers have been sticky downwards,
through lenders' delays in adjusting rates and because many borrowers pay
high fixed-interest rates, fixed when the base rate was twice its present
level. Even variable rate loans are usually subject to a minimum interest
rate, below which the effect of base rate falls are not passed on to the
customer. Banks' margins are probably higher now than when base rate was
above 10 per cent.
On the other hand, the banks have not done enough to rationalise their cost
bases. Consequently, too large a part of bank charges is required to fund
overheads. If Marks and Spencer, with some 300 branches, can provide retail
services used on occasion by a majority of the population, why do the top
banks still need to maintain thousands of branches? Too little has been
invested in information technology to increase efficiency.
The banks could avoid introducing across-the-board fees, which would prove
most unpopular, by charging for certain services. The logical extension of
the banks' joint campaigns to encourage use of Switch and direct debits
would be to introduce charges on cheques. This would go some way to
offsetting the cost of each cheque processed (about 70 pence). 'Free'
banking could also be linked to the sales of other products and services,
without compromising standards, since none of the main banks (and only three
building societies) now normally offer independent financial advice.

FT  13 FEB 93 / For whom the road tolls: Britain's government is seeking
more ways to extract money from motorists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Slowed to a crawl on a heavily congested motorway or fuming in a town-centre
traffic jam, British motorists are likely to be incensed by the suggestion
that they have had it too good for too long. But that is the message coming
increasingly loudly from the government. Road users, it seems, are going to
have to pay more for their dubious pleasure.
Sometime this spring, the government confirmed this week, a green paper will
propose new ways of extracting money from motorists: the introduction of
tolls on trunk roads and motorways. The Department of Transport also hinted
that this could be a first step towards the eventual privatisation of the
trunk road and motorway network, raising fears that tolls could soar if
ownership of the roads passed to private sector profiteers.
If there were any doubts about the scope for a possible furore over these
proposals, they would have been dispelled by events in Germany this week,
when the country's ruling coalition coincidentally came up with similar
plans for the German autobahn network. Such was the backlash from car
owners, politicians and trade unions that the government was driven into
ignominious retreat. No charges for the motorways had yet been agreed, it
said, nor had any date for their implementation been set.
In Britain, too, even before the publication of the government's green
paper, the attacks have begun. Opposition parties say it is just a way of
creaming off some extra funding from the hard-pressed motorist to help fill
the country's yawning budget deficit; the Automobile Association says it
will create a two-tier road network, leaving better-off drivers on the
motorways and diverting worse-off ones on to unsuitable roads through towns
and villages; and freight transport groups say higher road charges for goods
traffic will weaken the competitiveness of British industry.
Just what the government is proposing is still far from clear, but what it
professes to be doing is getting the private sector to help meet Britain's
growing demands for roads. While recession may have temporarily taken the
heat out of the congestion crisis, road traffic is forecast to double by the
year 2025, and the government cannot afford to meet the cost of
accommodating the growth on its own.
Inviting the private sector to build toll roads would seem an obvious
solution. The trouble is, these only work where users have no cheap or easy
alternative. In other European countries where they exist, such as France
and Spain, they tend to work either because other routes are also tolled or
because the free alternatives are impractical for drivers travelling long
distances.
In Britain, criss-crossed with trunk roads and motorways that are all
toll-free, attempts to get private roads built have met with little success.
Only one project, the Birmingham Northern Relief Road, has so far reached
the planning stage - in this particular case because the motorway route for
which it provides an alternative is saturated.
The implications for Britain are clear. If the private sector is to build
new toll roads, then tolls will have to be introduced on the public roads
that compete with them, too. But yet to emerge is just where the toll
revenues would go: to the exchequer, or to the Department of Transport to
build more roads?
One possible outcome is that the answer will be neither. Instead, the
government may invite companies to bid for franchises to take over the
operation of existing motorways and trunk roads, introduce tolls on them,
and use the cash generated to fund the construction of extra lanes or new
roads running parallel to them. That would effectively mean the
privatisation of the trunk road and motorway network.
It is too early to say precisely what this would mean for road users. The
toll roads would be easy to use - technology already in existence would
debit charges electronically from devices in motorists' vehicles on entering
and leaving the roads, so there would be no need for dozens of toll booths
at entrances and exits. The tolls would push up motorists' costs - but if
better and less congested roads were the result, the charges could be
outweighed by savings in users' time.
So what is there to object to in such a plan? As in Germany, the main factor
is the overwhelming sense of injustice among British motorists who feel they
are already paying far more for the roads than they should. According to the
Automobile Association, road users pay two and a half times as much in
motoring taxation each year as the government spends on building and
maintaining the roads. If that money were ploughed back into roads, the AA
argues, there would be no need for tolls. So how can the introduction of new
charges be justified?
One answer is to say that it is not so much a matter of justification as of
expediency. The Treasury does not acknowledge a link between the money it
collects from road users and the money it spends on roads: that, it says,
would be like arguing that the money collected in cigarette tax should be
spent on the production of tobacco. Instead, it sees road users as a
convenient source of revenue; and, quite separately, it sees the Pounds
2bn-a-year roads programme as an unwelcome burden on the exchequer.
And yet, given the likely controversy over the toll road issue, it is worth
taking a look at the AA's case - not least since the public transport lobby
claims, equally vociferously, that motorists are getting a cheap ride on the
roads and ought to be paying more.
The easier side of the equation is the government's annual revenue from road
users. According to Department of Transport statistics, fuel tax from cars
and goods vehicles currently totals Pounds 11.47bn a year and vehicle excise
duty Pounds 3.23bn. That makes Pounds 14.7bn. The AA also adds in more than
Pounds 4bn collected from car drivers in value added tax: but there seems
little justification for this, because VAT is a uniform tax applying to
nearly all goods and services. (It should be noted, though, that public
transport is exempt.)
On the cost side, Department of Transport figures tell us that capi
tal spending on roads is running at Pounds 2.87bn a year, and this is the
figure the AA uses. But it is the wrong number: what we need to know is how
much the capital invested in the roads has cost the government to obtain.
For this we turn to Professor David Newbery, director of the Department of
Applied Economics at Cambridge University, whose back-of-the-envelope
calculations suggest a total capital value for the whole road network of
around Pounds 90bn. Applying to that the government's discount rate of 8 per
cent yields an annual cost of Pounds 7.2bn - a rough but serviceable figure,
and one considerably higher than the government's annual capital spend.
The Department of Transport provides the next two figures: Pounds 3.21bn a
year for road maintenance and Pounds 420m for police and traffic warden
services. Adding those to the cost of capital makes Pounds 10.83bn, still
well short of the money collected in tax. And that is the end of the list,
as far as the department is concerned. Yet still absent from it is any
consideration for the cost to society of accidents, pollution, congestion,
noise and nuisance.
This is controversial ground because it is impossible to put a precise
figure on these costs. But it is worth making the attempt because ignoring
them distorts the market for road transport. According to economic theory, a
socially efficient market is one which distributes resources according to
the wishes and needs of the community, and a necessary condition of such a
market is that the price of a good is equal to its marginal social cost.
This cost must include not only the cost borne by the individual, but the
cost which the individual imposes on society by consuming it.
In the case of roads, the only social cost for which a figure is available
is the one for accidents, estimated by the Department of Transport at Pounds
6.1bn. But that figure includes debatable calculations on matters such as
the value of a human life, and the AA prefers to add in only a small sum to
take account of direct costs to the hospital and ambulance services.
Environmental costs are even more debatable. It can be argued, for example,
that these are already reflected in the high prices being paid by vehicle
owners for anti-pollution measures such as catalytic converters in the
purchase price of their cars. But Prof Newbery says studies in the US
suggest that estimates for environmental damage tend to come out at roughly
10 per cent of other road costs, so it is possible to add in this factor.
The effect is to take the total figure for road use costs to Pounds 18.6bn -
some Pounds 3.9bn more than road users pay.
This is not intended to be an accurate figure: some of its components may be
too generous, others too mean. But it shows that it is possible to arrive at
a conclusion very different from the AA's and the Department of Transport's:
that, far from paying too much for their roads, Britain's vehicle owners may
be paying 20 per cent too little.
If this were true, the consequences could be far reaching. The public
transport lobby argues that railways are at a competitive disadvantage with
roads because road users do not pay their full costs. Neither do railways,
the road lobby could say: trains do environmental damage, too. But if the
government's green paper attempts to quantify the full economic and social
costs of the road network, and compares them with those of the railways, the
long-term effect could be a significant shift in the pricing structure in
favour of rail.
Then again, it is salutary to remember that toll roads are nothing new: they
were widespread in 18th-century Britain. But when the first turnpikes were
introduced in the late 17th century, they were accompanied by riots and mass
destruction. Given the government's current antipathy towards any decision
that smacks of controversy, it might think twice before risking another row
on the roads.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Man in the News: Mission to mend fences - Dieter Bock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Dieter Bock, the German financier appointed joint chief executive at
Lonrho with Mr Tiny Rowland, has set himself a challenging task. He wants to
bring one of the most independent-minded British companies back into the
City fold.
'We have to repair the image of the company; it has to become an equal
member of the business community' he says. This can only be achieved, he
feels, if Lonrho 'plays by the book', becomes 'more open with the investment
community' and appoints non-executive directors. In short, Mr Bock says he
wants the company, effectively run by a rebel tycoon for 31 years, to become
viewed as part of 'the establishment'.
To many Lonrho watchers Mr Bock's ambition may sound implausible. This is
partly because the diversified conglomerate finds itself so far from the
establishment and partly because the company is perceived as Mr Rowland's
vehicle. There are few other UK companies where the mark of a single man has
been so strongly imprinted.
In 1973 the affairs of Lonrho were famously described by Edward Heath, then
the prime minister, as 'the unacceptable face of capitalism'. Since then Mr
Rowland has repeatedly enraged the financial establishment. Last year, while
the west sought to treat Libya as an outlaw because of its alleged
involvement in the Lockerbie air disaster, Lonrho sold a one-third stake in
its Metropole Hotels to the government-controlled Libyan Arab Investment
Company for Pounds 177.5m.
'Tiny has been trapped into a fight with the establishment; it is a bad
situation,' says Mr Bock. 'But I hope my presence will give him more freedom
to move.'
He does not expect, however, to bring Lonrho back into the City fold within
a few weeks. He thinks it could take as long as a year and a half. He cannot
simply remove the Rowland imprint, and he does not want to minimise the role
Mr Rowland has played in building the group. But the 53 year-old Mr Bock has
served notice to the investment community that he is not about to play a
subservient role to the 75 year-old Mr Rowland.
'As much as I respect Tiny, he respects me. I can bring in more new ideas
than any of his board members can. If someone is new he is more able to
develop new ideas than someone who has been in the same position for a long
time.'
For the moment, he is somewhat guarded about what such plans may comprise.
What he does say is that Lonrho must reduce its borrowings which, at the
year to the end of September 1992, were about Pounds 850m. That figure has
recently fallen as a result of disposals, and he favours further small
divestments to ease the debt burden. He says that he and Mr Rowland agree
that the company should remain focused on its core businesses - mining,
trading, agriculture and hotels - in an attempt to improve its performance.
Last year's collapse in pre-tax profits, which fell to Pounds 80m from
Pounds 205m the previous 12 months, show the scale of this task. Equally
difficult will be his more immediate aim of establishing ties with the City.
Mr Bock could not be described as a pillar of the establishment. He is more
renowned in Germany for being an effective, if mysterious, Mr Fixit. Indeed,
there are two big mysteries surrounding Mr Bock: where he gets his money
from; and whether he is acting in partnership with anyone else?
Mr Bock's main business interests are his commercial real estate activities
in Advanta Management, of which he controls a majority of the issued share
capital. In 1991, Advanta reported pre-tax profits of DM63m (Pounds 27m) and
its net assets were around DM200m (Pounds 85.8m).
Last October, Advanta, in a high-profile deal, brought a 50 per cent stake
in the Kempinski Hotel chain after the failure of attempts to merge
Kempinski with Air France's Meridien business. The deal, worth about DM300m
(Pounds 128.7m), again raised questions about the source of Mr Bock's
finances.
He is listed in the German edition of Forbes magazine as number 380 of the
country's 400 richest people, with an estimated net worth of DM200m (Pounds
85.8m). Yet Mr Bock's purchase of an 18.8 per cent stake in Lonrho - made
through his privately owned company Laerstate, registered in the Netherlands
 -cost him Pounds 135m.
When pressed about the state of his personal finances the financier has a
look of exasperation. 'I have already told everyone that I am not paying for
my Lonrho stake out of cash.' He dismisses the Forbes estimate of his wealth
as 'bunk' and says he has made some short-term borrowings while negotiating
the sale of 20 to 25 per cent of his holding in Advanta.
As to whether he is acting with anyone else, Mr Bock laughs off the idea as
ridiculous. 'I am acting for myself, not with or for anyone else. I have
never been a front for anyone. My friends in the German community know that
I act for myself.'
Mr Bock says there is no secret about where he has come from and how he made
his money. Born in Dessau in the former state of East Germany, his family
moved to what was then West Germany in 1953. He studied law at Marburg
University followed by accountancy at Munich University, and worked as an
apprentice for the Frankfurt law firm Boesebeck &amp; Bart. He moved on to a
small accountancy firm which was taken over by KMPG Peat Marwick.
In 1973, struck by how many Germans were investing in property to save
taxes, he formed his own consulting firm in Frankfurt. The next year he
established his first partnership for real estate investment in Munich.
Later he expanded his property interests to South Africa and the US, and
formed Advanta.
An intensely private man, Mr Bock is married with four children. He is a
patron of the arts and established a charitable foundation to help German
museums fund their exhibits.
Regardless of Mr Bock's background there remains the question of whether Mr
Rowland will be supportive of Mr Bock's plans. What if the joint chief
executives were to fall out? Mr Bock admits that there is always a risk, but
dismisses it as insignificant. He says he is confident that he can change
the public's perception of Lonrho without alienating Mr Rowland.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Better ways to fund
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE self-respect of chancellors and central bankers hinged on the way
markets reacted to their rhetoric, few would complete their allotted term.
Mr Eddie George does not take up his post as Governor of the Bank of England
until July. But this week he had a foretaste of the currency markets' notion
of courtesy. When he warned in Frankfurt against further cuts in UK interest
rates, sterling fell against the dollar and the D-Mark. While there is no
reason to doubt Mr George's sincerity and determination, this scepticism is
all too understandable.
Yesterday's unexpectedly good figures for the retail prices index showed
that the year-on-year headline rate of inflation in the UK is now running at
1.7 per cent, while the underlying rate excluding mortgage interest payments
is 3.2 per cent. This suggests that short-term interest rates of 6 per cent
at this depressed stage of the economic cycle are still high in real terms.
After the badly handled one-point cut in rates late in January, few believe
that Mr George's political masters will show the same resolve as he.
That feeling is reinforced by the state of Britain's public finances. The
markets understand that when next year's public sector borrowing requirement
is heading for 9 per cent of gross national product and oversize budget
deficits threaten to extend as far as the eye can see, there is only one
solution to the problem: economic growth. If the government puts obstacles
in the way of growth by keeping rates unduly high or, worse, raising
interest rates in a panic as sterling overshoots downwards, a barely
manageable problem becomes a nightmare.
Stabilise sterling
Here, then, is a difficulty that cannot be addressed by making speeches. If
the government wants to stabilise sterling and restore confidence to a
market that is all too aware of these pressures, it would help to adopt an
approach to funding the PSBR that convinces people that the authorities
actually believe in their own policies. If, in the words of the chancellor
Mr Norman Lamont, the government's aim is to achieve a long-term rate of
inflation of 2 per cent or less, funding the PSBR with long-dated gilts
yielding about 8 3/4 per cent will prove appallingly costly in real terms.
The market's inflation expectations are, in fact, more pessimistic. Long
fixed-rate gilts are yielding around five percentage points more than the
longer index-linked gilts - well above both the long-term inflation target
and the declared short-run range of 1-4 per cent over the present
parliament. Many institutional investors, meantime, are unwilling to believe
that the government will be able to fund the PSBR at today's gilt yields
because the funding requirement is so large in relation to institutional
cash flow. Finance directors in industry appear to share that view. The
recent spate of rights issues, and Thursday's announcement by hotels group
Forte of a Pounds 200m debenture that matures in 2018, amount to a
pre-emptive strike by people who anticipate funding pressure.
Budget deficit
This fear that the private sector will somehow be crowded out of the market
is, in one sense, odd. The US has lived for years with a structural budget
deficit without facing investor resistance in the market. There is little
evidence in either the US or UK of a positive correlation between the PSBR
and the level of bonds in institutional portfolios. And the absence of
exchange controls around the world means that any shortage of domestic
buying power can be supplemented from overseas.
Against that background, the priority should be to establish a firm floor
under sterling to activate capital flows on a global scale. One prerequisite
is a convincing fiscal package in the budget. Another is a funding policy
that lends credibility to Mr Lamont's inflation targets. That would involve,
first, borrowing heavily in foreign currencies to support intervention in
the sterling market. It would also involve more active resort to
index-linked issues. And the so-called full funding rule, whereby the
government finances the whole of its borrowing requirement with non-bank
financial institutions, should go, allowing the banking system to buy less
costly short-dated IOUs.
It is, of course, more easily said than done. When the conditions for
successful funding are difficult, a government needs to demonstrate some
finesse in its management of the markets. That is difficult while the same
people who mishandled sterling within the exchange rate mechanism remain in
charge. The best reason for thinking that long gilt yields will rise is not
that the fundamentals are necessarily against the authorities; it is that
fund managers will be reluctant to give such a maladroit team the benefit of
the doubt. That reluctance has been reinforced by the botched cut in
interest rates last month.
When the long-run trend in equities is still upwards, UK investors will take
some persuading to buy a devalued government's bonds. Only with a great deal
of luck - sorely absent in recent months - will it pull off the trick at
today's prices.

FT  13 FEB 93 / International Company News: Dutch state gives ground on
Fokker deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE HAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PURCHASE of a 51 per cent stake in Fokker, Holland's financially
troubled aircraft manufacturer, by Deutsche Aerospace (DASA) moved a step
closer last night when the Dutch government accepted sharply revised terms.
However, a difference remains over the level of state support for
redundancies.
The Dutch government, which holds a 10.6 per cent stake in Fokker, says it
remains committed to 'an economically viable take-off' of the planned
airline consortium. But in a letter to DASA, the aerospace subsidiary of
Germany's Daimler-Benz, Mr Koos Andriessen, Dutch economic affairs minister,
said The Hague could not accept 'the open-ended support' on redundancies
demanded by DASA in a final offer earlier this week.
In that letter, DASA asked for broad 'support in adjusting the capacity of
Fokker to an appropriate and sustainable level', but the vague wording of
this clause kept alive hopes that a mutually acceptable accommodation dan be
reached in the near term.
Under the terms of the revised deal, which is aimed at raising some Fl 720m
(Dollars 396m) in new liquidity for the troubled group, Fokker will issue
some 13.2m shares at Fl 30 per share for a total of Fl 396m, to a newly
formed holding company 51 per cent controlled by DASA. This will bring the
total number of outstanding shares to 46.7m.
In a second stage, Fokker will seek an additional Fl 334m on the open market
through a subordinated convertible loan subscribed by DASA and underwritten
by the Dutch state.
The Hague will exchange its stake in Fokker for a 22 per cent share in the
newly formed holding, and will subscribe to the loan offer and will receive
Fl 196m in two tranches. The total purchase price for DASA will be about Fl
685m.
Under the terms of the original deal, signed last October, DASA was to pay
DM800m (Dollars 506.3m) for its 51 per cent stake in Fokker which it was
seeking to acquire as part of its bid to create a new European airliner
consortium. However, DASA demanded renegotiation of terms early this year,
arguing that the financial and business position of Fokker had deteriorated
sharply in the interval.
Fokker gained Fl 1 to close at Fl 10.50 yesterday.
The Dutch government's counter offer to DASA comes after a week of intense
speculation about Fokker's financial position, following the cancellation of
a number of important orders and the deterioration in the global civil
airliner market.
Regional and commuter aircraft manufacturers such as Fokker have been
particularly hard hit.
At the same time, the government has been under intense pressure to avoid a
repeat of the debacle at Daf, the Eindhaven-based truckmaker which
financially collapsed and was forced to seek protection from its creditors
earlier this month.
In a letter to parliament, Mr Andriessen likened the government's position
to steering a course 'between Scylla and Charybdis'.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Ulster deal may avoid Maastricht defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of the government being defeated over the Maastricht bill has
prompted ministers to consider offering to set up a Commons select committee
on Northern Ireland to win the support of the province's Unionist MPs.
Relaxing opposition to a committee could help win the votes of nine Ulster
Unionist and three Democratic Unionist party MPs - and head off a defeat on
Labour's amendment on Maastricht's social chapter.
The chances of a government defeat, which could wreck the bill, heightened
this week as Euro-sceptic Tories and Liberal Democrat MPs indicated they
would back Labour.
Sir Peter Emery, chairman of the Commons procedure committee, is seeking
views on whether a committee on Northern Ireland, with powers to launch
investigations, should be established. All other main Whitehall departments
have a corresponding select committee.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, has argued that a committee
should only be part of a wider settlement between Unionists and
nationalists. But he has stressed to colleagues that, technically, any
decision on setting one up is a matter for MPs, not the government. In
practice, however, the government's view would be decisive.
One Northern Ireland Office insider said Unionists had a list of demands
that would increase their say on the province's affairs. 'Things crop up
from time to time which may make it necessary to accede to one,' he said.
No offer would be made by the government until nearer the vote, at least
four weeks away, and then only if the government was convinced it would
otherwise lose.
But it is far from clear whether a select committee would convert enough
Unionists, who are strongly opposed to Maastricht. Mr James Molyneaux and
the Rev Ian Paisley, the two Unionist leaders, may refuse to offer support
at any price.
Ministers accept that there is no logical reason why the Northern Ireland
Office should not be made accountable to parliament such as other Whitehall
departments, including the Scottish and Welsh offices - possibly as a
justification for relenting to Unionist demands.
Agreeing to a select committee, however, would undermine government policy
on Northern Ireland by angering the Irish government and nationalists in the
province. It could lead to further delay to resumption of 'round-table'
talks on Northern Ireland.
Separately, the Northern Ireland Office is preparing to come under attack
from Unionist MPs when the government publishes its white paper on the
future of the union between Scotland and the rest of the UK.
That document is expected to be strongly pro-union and opposed to devolution
 -almost the opposite of government policy on Northern Ireland.
Sir Patrick wants a devolved government in Northern Ireland and says it will
remain part of the UK only as long as a majority of its population so
wishes.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Sunday trading case decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN industrial tribunal in Hull yesterday awarded former shop assistant Mrs
Ruth Taylor Pounds 324 for unfair dismissal, but ruled she had not lost her
job for refusing an order to work on Sunday.
The decision is a setback for those campaigning against Sunday opening, who
regarded Mrs Taylor's dismissal appeal as a test case over Sunday working.
Mrs Taylor, a devout Baptist, claimed she had been fired unfairly by her
employer, Franlow, a clothing store, because she would not work on Sunday
for religious reasons when the company began Sunday trading last May.
The tribunal chairman said Mrs Taylor had been fired on July 5 last year,
two days after rejecting a request to work on Sunday after a 'long-running
dispute' with a manageress at the store.
He said her dismissal had been 'an instant decision' owing to a 'personality
clash'.
Mr Garfield Davies, general secretary of the Usdaw shop workers' union, said
that the tribunal decision was a 'disappointment' because it had avoided
giving a judgment on the Sunday working issue.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Private-sector pay at 3.6%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE-SECTOR pay settlements are continuing to average about 3.6 per cent,
according to two reports published yesterday.
In spite of the continuing downward pressure on pay in the private and
public sectors, private-sector increases look high relative to inflation of
1.7 per cent and a public-sector norm of 1.5 per cent.
Pay analysts said uncertainty about the direction of the inflation rate
after leaving the European exchange rate mechanism might have contributed to
the relatively buoyant private-sector pay rates of the final quarter of last
year.
Industrial Relations Services, which found average awards at 3.6 per cent in
the final quarter of last year, said that eight out of 10 deals were above
the inflation rate during that quarter. The union-funded Labour Research
Department has also found average settlements settling at 3.6 per cent in
the three months to the end of January.
Some analysts, such as the Confederation of British Industry, have already
reported much lower rates in the private sector - 2.8 per cent in
manufacturing in the final quarter of last year and one in three companies
making pay freezes, according to the latest CBI figures.

FT  13 FEB 93 / British prices attract foreign househunters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DEPRESSED property prices and attractive exchange rates are drawing
increasing numbers of foreign buyers back into the UK housing market.
Estate agents say that interest in London and country house properties which
began to pick up in the last year has shown a surge since sterling's
devaluation last September when it left the European exchange rate
mechanism.
A significant proportion of purchases continues to involve buyers from the
Far East seeking investment opportunities. This includes Hong Kong Chinese
looking for bolt-holes ahead of 1997 when China will regain control of the
colony.
One Hong Kong buyer scouring Belgravia, central London, this week said that
because of the difference in exchange rates she was finding prices more than
50 per cent cheaper than they were last year. She has been viewing houses
priced at about Pounds 1m which were on the market a year ago at Pounds
1.6m.
The rate of exchange against the US dollar when she first looked meant that
she would have had to pay about Dollars 3.2m whereas today, because of the
devaluation and the further fall in house prices, she only needs to find
Dollars 1.45m for the same sort of property.
The same conditions are also attracting European buyers, particularly
Germans and Italians, and some estate agents have reported deals with
eastern European buyers such as Russians and Serbs.
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley say they have seen an increase of 50 per cent in
foreign buyers looking for London and country houses at the top end of the
market. According to its research some 64 per cent of all buyers purchasing
property priced at more than Pounds 750,000 were foreign last year, against
42 per cent in 1991 and 35 per cent in 1990.
In London 70 per cent of buyers were from abroad and country house sales
were evenly split between UK and foreign buyers. Some 40 per cent of sales
for the year were completed in the last quarter.
Mr Patrick Ramsay, the partner in charge of country house sales, said that
foreign interest was spread fairly evenly across the board.
One effect of foreign buyers arriving in numbers was to soak up properties
on the market since they had no houses to sell in the UK.
However, Mr Andy Buchanan, a director of estate agent John D Wood, said the
scarcity of new instructions was the worst he had experienced in 20 years in
Chelsea, west London.
Italian buyers, in particular, were prominent at present. 'We had three
Italians in today looking at properties,' he said. Italian house purchasers
still asked for confidentiality, he said, 'But it's not like the old days
when I used to ring a hotel in Milan and say the bird has flown the nest to
tell the buyer the sale had gone through.'
John D Wood's office at Regent's Park says that South Africans are its most
active foreign customers, but their preferred area is Hampstead, north
London.
Mr Paul Taylor, head of residential sales at Savills, said a number of
Russians and Serbs had bought property at about Pounds 500,000 in Hampstead
and Kensington in west London.
He said that several factors were combining with exchange rates to attract
buyers, including signs that the country was coming out of recession and a
large stock of properties on the market.
Mr Adam Leighton, manager at Benham &amp; Reeves in Hampstead, said that about
50 per cent of sales in the last quarter had been to foreign buyers. 'We
have sold three properties to Russians in the last couple of months and I
know that two of my competitors have had sales to Russians.'
London remains the most popular centre for foreign buyers. The French in
London tend to congregate in South Kensington, because of the French lycee.
Germans prefer to be further west whereas house-hunting Americans head for
St John's Wood or Hampstead. Ealing is popular with Japanese buyers.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Food retailers say they expect to increase prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOOD retailers warned yesterday that, while they had been able to absorb
much of the effect of sterling's devaluation so far, consumers could see the
cost of their grocery baskets rise in the next few months.
They said the effect of devaluation had taken time to have an impact on food
prices, and a number of special factors had helped offset it. As the full
impact starts to be felt, however, food prices are bound to rise.
Much will depend on the intensity of competition. While retailers might
expect to be cushioned somewhat from the recession, they have seen sales
volumes falling. This has made it imperative for them to keep prices down.
This has meant absorbing price rises within their own margins to some
extent, as well as sharing the load through tough negotiations with
manufacturers and suppliers.
Many retailers already source much of their food from the UK, lessening the
impact of devaluation. J Sainsbury, the UK's largest food retailer, said 90
per cent by value of goods that it could buy from the UK - excluding
specifically non-indigenous goods - are sourced from the UK.
Safeway, the third largest food retailer, said it had raised the proportion
of UK-produced food in its stores to 82 per cent.
The Food and Drink Federation added that, while the 'green pound' had been
devalued by 22 per cent since sterling left the ERM on September 16, it had
taken some time for this readjustment to occur, and its full impact was
still not being felt.
But there will be pressure on a number of food categories, such as sugar,
dairy produce, cereals and beef.
There is evidence that manufacturers have been absorbing some costs. One
retailer said its research had shown that, while the input cost of raw
materials to manufacturers and processors had risen by 8 per cent, their
output prices had risen by only 2 per cent. This was put down to the ability
to keep other costs down, thanks to lower interest rates and lack of wage
inflation.
Other factors included the unusual phenomenon of several important commodity
markets - such as some meats and dairy produce - all moving into a surplus
phase at the same time, putting downward pressure on prices.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Ballot for 12,000 London bus staff
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 12,000 London bus staff will be balloted on industrial action over pay
and conditions, including pay cuts of between Pounds 30 and Pounds 60 a
week, the TGWU general union said yesterday. The ballot has been set for
February 19.
The union said any action would probably be a series of one-day stoppages.
The ballot result will be known on February 22.
The union accused 10 subsidiaries of London Buses of 'blackmail', saying the
companies had threatened to withdraw compensation for loss of earnings if
staff did not accept the package within varying periods of time.
Some companies told staff they would have to waive their right to take
action, including legal action, as a condition of receiving compensation.
The compensation is worth about two years lost earnings, on average about
Pounds 3,000.
Driver-operators earn about Pounds 280 a week before overtime.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Fowler warns Tory rebels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservative party leadership yesterday stepped up its warnings to rebel
Euro-sceptic backbenchers over the consequences of backing a Labour
amendment to the Maastricht bill intended to implement the social chapter,
Ivo Dawnay writes.
Opponents of the treaty say a vote for the amendment would wreck British
ratification and, because of the way it is drafted, have no bearing on
whether or not Britain joined the protocol on workplace rights.
In a speech aimed at party dissidents, Sir Norman Fowler said Tory rebels
would be backing a social chapter that was 'nothing less than an engine of
job destruction'.
The party chairman's speech is part of a campaign to pressure
anti-Maastricht MPs back into line with the leadership.
Government business managers are also warning the rebels that an abstention
or a vote with Labour on the social chapter amounts to a vote for socialism.
Sir Norman was careful yesterday to target the employment implications of
the chapter, saying it would raise business costs, lower competitiveness and
increase unemployment.
'It is essential that we promote policies in this country which will help to
stop the increase in unemployment and bring forward the time when it begins
to fall,' he said.

FT  13 FEB 93 / MP says nearly 2m voters 'missing'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS MANY as one in 10 eligible voters could be missing from electoral
registers, MPs were told yesterday.
Mr Harry Barnes, Labour MP for Derbyshire North East, made the claim as he
failed to secure a second reading for his Representation of the People
(Amendment) Bill, seeking to adapt the registration process and increase the
powers of electoral officers.
Mr Barnes said official figures indicated that about 1.9m people, equivalent
to 5 per cent of eligible voters, were not registered. But inaccurate
entries for people who had moved or died masked the possibility that twice
that number could be missing. He blamed a range of factors including the
poll tax.
Mr Peter Lloyd, Home Office minister, said the government agreed with the
bill's objectives but could not support it because it had come a year too
early.
He stressed that five working groups of Home Office officials and electoral
registration officers had begun consultations on all aspects of the existing
system.
Defending government efforts to maximise registration, he said 'we have
estimated registration levels of about 95 per cent and every year about
Pounds 40m is spent in England and Wales on registration'.
The bill failed to gain a second reading after only 78 MPs - fewer than the
100 required - voted for a closure motion to end the debate. No MPs voted
against the closure.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Shops absorb devaluation costs: 1.7% inflation rate is
lowest for 25 years; Fall in mortgage costs reduce figure; Most RPI elements
drop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RETAIL sector is taking sterling's devaluation on the chin. That was the
main message from yesterday's announcement that headline inflation is at its
lowest level for more than 25 years - in spite of the extra costs sparked by
the declining pound.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is no doubt relieved that the UK's
departure from the European exchange rate mechanism has yet to show through
in the prices consumers pay.
Many shopkeepers and others in the retail sector are less sanguine. The
stagnant demand due to the lingering recession has forced much of the sector
to absorb the costs of the devaluation through price cuts and reduced
margins.
Since Britain left the ERM on September 16, sterling has declined by 15 per
cent, forcing retailers and wholesalers to pay more for foreign-made
products. It has also pushed up costs of imported raw materials and energy
purchased by British manufacturers, a factor which might lead eventually to
higher prices for retail items.
Under European Community rules, the devaluation has also pushed up the
'green pound', the artificial currency which sets how much UK farmers earn
for their products. That has meant price rises for items such as milk and
butter sold to food processors for turning into consumer products.
No reliable figures exist for the extra costs on the retail sector resulting
directly from the slide in sterling. But the Central Statistical Office
reckons that - in the six months between August last year and January, and
unadjusted for seasonal variations - prices paid by manufacturers for raw
materials jumped by 10.6 per cent, much of this resulting from the
devaluation.
In retailing, the recorded increase in prices of goods and services has been
many times less. The government's favoured level of underlying inflation -
the retail prices index excluding mortgage costs - rose over the period by
just 0.4 per cent. The increase has been from 136.9 to 137.4, counting
January 1987 as 100.
Including mortgage costs, the RPI has shown a 0.7 per cent fall over the
same period, from 138.9 in August to 137.9 last month. This measure has been
pushed down principally by reductions in mortgage payments, triggered by the
fall in base rates from 10 per cent to 6 per cent. The year-on-year increase
in the RPI in January - the so-called headline figure - was 1.7 per cent,
the lowest since September 1967.
While many retailers have suffered through absorbing higher costs of
merchandise, their wage costs are under little pressure. Rapidly rising
unemployment has depressed rises in earnings throughout industry.
Between December and January, six out of the 14 main categories which
comprise the RPI showed a fall in prices. The highlights were:
Housing costs. These fell by 3 per cent on the month for a year-on-year
decrease of 2.8 per cent - due mainly to the fall in average mortgage
interest payments over the period from 9.4 per cent to 8.4 per cent.
Household goods. Shops cut prices of items such as furniture, furnishings
and cookers by 2.3 per cent in January compared with December, the largest
monthly reduction since CSO records started in 1956.
Clothing and footwear. Continued bargain sales mean these items have dropped
in price by 4.6 per cent over the month for a year-on-year fall of 0.7 per
cent.
Leisure goods. There was a 0.2 per cent month-on-month fall in these items,
including sporting equipment and hi-fi systems. Motoring expenses. The price
of petrol fell between December and January with a gallon of 4-star going
down by 7p to Pounds 2.31. Second-hand car prices fell in January by 4 per
cent compared with the previous year. Fuel and light. In spite of higher
prices for heating oil, this sector had a 0.2 per cent decrease in prices on
the month.
Food saw a small 0.3 per cent increase in prices on the month. Non-seasonal
foods such as meat, sugar, sweets and chocolate saw a year-on-year rise in
January of 2.1 per cent, the lowest increase since November 1987.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Cotswolds roll over the Rockies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BILL Kuhn is due to arrive from Denver, Colorado at Heathrow this morning
to pick up the keys to his Cotswold cottage.
He has just bought a two-bedroom 16th-century cottage with a guest cottage
attached in Stow-on-the-Wold, Gloucestershire, for Pounds 148,000. He says
it cost 35 per cent less than last April when it first went on the market.
Mr Kuhn, a management consultant, said the high cost of internal flights in
the US had influenced his decision to buy in Britain. 'We can get there as
cheaply and spend no more money than someone would having a piece of
mountain property right here.'
'Air fares from the States to Europe are very favourable. We are paying
Dollars 478 (Pounds 337) per person for the round trip. A week ago I went
from Denver to Phoenix for Dollars 680 and that is a 1 1/2 -hour plane
ride.'
He and his wife Sandie had been looking at English properties for about two
years. 'Then we came across in November and were amazed at the prices.'
Mr Kuhn said friends in Denver had not realised the extent of bargains in
the UK because of falling property prices and the exchange rate.
'In Denver a lot of people have a condominium in Vale or Aspen. We would
just as soon have a second home in England. We plan to spend about three to
four months in the year over there (in the UK) in time.'

FT  13 FEB 93 / Birmingham's engine room is slowing down: Paul Cheeseright
reports on the changing face of employment along the M6
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE troubles at Daf, the UK-Dutch vehicle maker, have raised fears for the
future of the company's van plant in an area once considered the engine room
of Birmingham. Yesterday, 589 of the Washwood Heath plant's workers were
made redundant.
'We always viewed Leyland Daf as a jewel in terms of east Birmingham, acting
as a focus to encourage continued development and growth,' said a Birmingham
Training and Enterprise Council official.
Leyland Daf and its predecessor companies, working at Washwood Heath since
before the second world war, gave substance to the boast that the area,
covering the wards of Aston, Nechells, Small Heath and Washwood Heath, was
'the engine room' of Birmingham.
This engine room, visible on both sides of the M6 as the motorist approaches
Spaghetti Junction from the south, works more slowly these days. Companies
such as Ansells brewery, TI Tubes and GKN Automotive have long left. But
large employers remain, including BTR with its aircraft tyre plant, British
Gas, British Steel, SP Tyres, GEC Alsthom at the old Metro-Cammell railway
equipment plant, HP Sauce, IMI which manufactures, among other products,
titanium and explosives, and Jaguar Cars.
Employment patterns have changed with manufacturing techniques and markets.
More than 20,000 worked at IMI during the second world war. Now there are
1,600.
In January 1988, Jaguar had 2,200 hourly paid workers and 360 staff - in
January this year it had 850 hourly paid workers and 230 staff. At British
Steel's seamless tubes plant, 400 people work where 500 did five years ago.
There are exceptions - GEC Alsthom, just across the road from Leyland Daf,
has 1,200 employees compared with 400 five years ago - but the employment
trend has been downwards. Half the jobs in the Birmingham Heartlands
Development Corporation area, more than 2,000 acres of east Birmingham,
disappeared between 1978 and 1988.
Loss of employment in large groups has been offset by the arrival of smaller
companies. But national economic growth during the 1980s left east
Birmingham behind.
In November 1989, just before the resent recession pushed up unemployment,
the jobless levels in the four wards was between 13.1 per cent in Washwood
Heath and 22.1 in Aston - the national average was 5.7 per cent.
Unemployment levels today are between two and three times the national
average - 22.1 per cent in Washwood Heath, 25.7 per cent in Small Heath,
28.5 per cent in Nechells and 31 per cent in Aston.
The recession, combined with the area's decline, has defeated the range of
active regenerating agencies - not only the development corporation, which
last year succeeded a mixed private-public sector urban development agency,
but also Birmingham City Council and the government's East Birmingham Task
Force, a group designed to foster employment.
If such agencies find it hard to cope, the likelihood of them helping
redundant Leyland Daf employees back into the labour force is remote. Mr Jim
Beeston, chief executive of the development corporation, said: 'The
prospects of vacancies in Heartlands, or in Birmingham for that matter, are
quite low.'
Ms Christine Heard, the task force leader, said it would be 'a ripple on the
pond.'
The majority of Leyland Daf employees live within five miles of the plant.
Most are semi-skilled and will find it difficult to find alternative jobs
without some re-training.
Birmingham TEC has prepared a package of assistance for Leyland Daf
employees involving pre-redundancy advice, vocational training and
assistance for those considering self-employment.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Users fear cost of road-toll plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOLLS ON Britain's motorways and trunk roads could cost road users Pounds
2bn a year, Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said yesterday.
Commenting on government proposals to hive off responsibility for the roads
to a body called Highways Command as a prelude to privatisation, Mr Prescott
denounced the tolls as a revenue-raising exercise.
His views were echoed by motorist and freight groups, who insisted that,
although they would welcome the creation of a co-ordinating body for roads,
privatisation must be matched with new guarantees on road investment.
The AA said: 'Motorists are already paying too much road tax,' Adding to
criticism that the government was failing to provide any clear strategy on
roads, the AA added: 'If this toll is just for extra tax, then we are dead
against it.'
Freight companies warned that British industry and commerce might also be
hard hit by road charges,
Mr Bryan Colley, director general of the Road Haulage Association, said: 'If
they are going to introduce road charges then these are going to be passed
on to manufac-turers and consumers.'
He added that profits were already 'paper thin'.
Fears were have also been expressed that tolls on motorways would force
traffic on to minor roads.
Mr Alan Jones, the managing director of TNT, which has 3,000 trucks each
travel-ing 100,000 miles of British roads every year, said: 'I can't see why
anyone would want to put tolls on motorways when these roads are designed to
take people out of cities. It will just encourage people to go into towns.'
Mr Colley suggested that, with road taxes for British freight vehicles
already considerably higher than in Europe, new road tolls could weaken the
competitiveness of British industry.
Road tax on a 38-tonne British truck is Pounds 3,100 a year, against Pounds
638 in France and Pounds 264 in Spain.
Mr John Guttridge, head of external affairs of the Freight Transport
Association, agreed: 'Britain is already in a geographically peripheral
position compared to Europe. This would make it harder to compete.'
Environmental groups have argued that road tolls would encourage use of
railways. But road user groups point out that, since most freight trips are
less than 50 miles, railways are too inflexible.

ANGRY and emotional scenes at the gates of Leyland Daf's British plants
yesterday afternoon reflected the deep sense of outrage among workers at the
receiver's redundancy announcements.
They are especially incensed about the contrast between the position of
those whose jobs have been cut in the UK and that of their colleagues from
the company's Dutch plants who have also lost their jobs as a result of
Daf's liquidation.
Mr Michael Smyth, 45, who has worked for the company at Leyland, Lancashire,
since January 1970, said: 'I'm leaving with my shoes, my brew and my tea cup
after 22 years. The gaffer just called me over and said I had lost my job.
Where will I get another at my age?'
The company is not obliged to pay any redundancy money, either in the
Netherlands or in Britain, and it will not be doing so. Daf workers in both
countries will have to rely on state help to survive.
In Britain statutory redundancy provision is one week's pay to a maximum of
Pounds 205 for every year's employment with the company to a maximum of 20
years' service - a total of Pounds 6,150. Average redundancy payments at
Leyland Daf are estimated by the Department of Employment to be Pounds
2,812.50.
Yesterday the company said that at the request of the receiver the
Department of Employment had agreed to speed up payment of redundancy to the
Leyland Daf workers from the usual 14 weeks to one week.
They will receive unemployment benefit at Pounds 43.10 for a single person
and Pounds 26.60 for a dependent adult.
The Department of Employment estimates that the 1,635 redundancies will cost
the taxpayer Pounds 4.5m. If Leyland Daf had been able to honour its
redundancy agreement it would have cost the company Pounds 30m, according to
the receiver.
In the Netherlands, the state will give Daf's dismissed workers their normal
pay for the next six weeks, followed by weekly payments to those who remain
jobless of 70 per cent of previous earnings up to a maximum of Pounds 20,000
a year for up to three years. Redundant workers must satisfy the authorities
that they are seeking work.
'It is a scandal that British workers are being treated in this cavalier
fashion,' Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEEU engineering and
electricians' union, said yesterday. 'Other European countries make
provisions to treat their redundant workers decently.'
Mr Tony Woodley, the TGWU general union's national secretary for the auto
industry, said unions at Leyland Daf were 'ready to assist in any way to
secure the future of the Daf plants'.

FT  13 FEB 93 / British Gas heads world profits table: Survey likely to
provoke row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS is probably the most profitable gas transmission and
distribution company in the world, according to a study of the international
gas business by Sheffield Energy and Resources Information Services, an
energy consulting group.
In one of the first international comparisons of gas companies, British Gas
came top out of 41 companies worldwide, measured against three key criteria
to determine profitability. Second was Ruhrgas, Germany's main gas supplier,
and third was Gas Natural of Spain.
The findings are likely to prove controversial since British Gas remains the
monopoly supplier to its 18m UK household customers and is under review by
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Mr Ian Rutledge, one of the report's authors, said he was 'surprised and a
bit amused' by the outcome - the company had not planned the study as a
contribution to the debate about the future of British Gas.
The three criteria used for judging profitability were: operating profit on
the gas transmission part of companies' business, rate of return on gas
assets and operating profit per 1,000 cubic feet of gas production. These
were combined in a composite profitability index.
The report showed that gas companies were more than twice as profitable in
Europe and Australasia as in the US, where intense competition since market
deregulation 10 years ago has reduced margins.
Market liberalisation is occurring in many gas industries worldwide and the
report found that this was prompting increased internationalisation of the
world gas business. More competition had led to a drop in profitability
since 1985.
The average rate of return for a group of 31 companies fell to 7.8 per cent
in 1991 from 10.6 per cent in 1985.

FT  13 FEB 93 / SIB issues warning over banned futures director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECURITIES and Investments Board yesterday warned that a futures company
whose managing director has been banned from dealing with UK retail
investors may be touting for business again.
SIB, the financial services watchdog, has received a copy of an undated
sales brochure purportedly issued by First European Futures International
which sells financial futures and commodities from Brussels and Copenhagen.
The managing director is named as Mr Enver Deen, formerly with Vandersteen,
a Belgian futures broker against which SIB obtained injunc-tions in 1990 to
prevent it cold-calling investors and issuing unauthorised advertisements.
In 1991, SIB was granted a distribution order by the High Court to pay
Pounds 129,000 to 68 investors in Vandersteen, after the liquidation of the
company.
Under the Financial Services Act, it is illegal for unauthorised investment
companies to solicit business in the UK, but some companies try to elude the
rules by operating from overseas.
SIB says there was a flurry of such business immediately after the act came
into force, but that such cases are now rare.
In the brochure obtained by SIB, the company falsely claims to be authorised
by the Securities and Futures Authority, the regulator for the securities
industry, and by SIB and to be a member of a number of futures exchanges.
An official said SIB had no evidence that First European Futures had been
cold-calling UK retail investors.
A booklet, 'How to spot the investment cowboys', is available from SIB,
which also offers information on 071 929 3652.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Daf receivers make 1,635 redundant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, DAVID OWEN and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY a third of the UK workforce of Leyland Daf, the beleaguered
commercial vehicle maker, were made redundant yesterday. A total of 1,635
employees lost their jobs at the company's five sites.
The collapsed company's receivers warned that the rest of the workforce
would also have to be laid off if components suppliers continued to
frustrate attempts to restart production at the truck plant at Leyland,
Lancashire and at the van plant in Birmingham.
In a letter to the chief executives of some suppliers the receivers warned
'if we cannot restart production because we cannot get the co-operation of
all key suppliers, the remaining workforce will be laid off. 'If this
happens the prospects of the plants reopening are extremely bleak.'
The receivers have failed to restart production since being called in early
last week. Suppliers are unlikely to receive payment of outstanding bills
but the receivers say orders for components placed since the collapse would
be paid as an expense of receivership.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, backed the call to
suppliers to resume deliveries to Leyland Daf and said he hoped they would
'feel able to rely on this assurance' from the receivers that they were
'certain' to be paid.
Mr John Allen, chief negotiator for the AEEU engineering and electrical
union, said the unions feared yesterday's job cuts were not the end of the
redundancies.
The first job losses among the 5,500-strong workforce were met with bitter
resignation and anger. A total of 997 hourly paid and 638 salaried employees
were made redundant. The biggest cut was in Leyland, Lancashire, where 768
out of 2,114 jobs were cut. At the Leyland Daf Birmingham van plant 589 of
the 1,960 jobs were shed, while 136 jobs were shed at the company's parts
centre in Chorley, 75 jobs at the Thame, Oxfordshire sales and marketing
operations and 67 jobs at the Albion axle plant in Glasgow.
Mr Murdoch McKillop, joint administrative receiver, said the redundancies
were 'necessary if we are to maintain the business and carry on trading as a
viable operation'.
The job cuts had been structured so as to 'maintain viable businesses at
each plant'. The receivers were seeking 'to continue trading with a view to
eventual sale of each business as a going concern'.
Leyland Daf could neither pay its creditors from before its collapse nor
meet contractual redundancy obligations, Mr McKillop said. Dismissed workers
would receive only statutory redundancy payments.
Mr Jim Thomas, national officer for the white-collar Manufacturing Science
and Finance union, said the workers made redundant were paying 'a very
personal price for the lack of government intervention'. Workers would
receive only the state redundancy payment of one week's pay for every year
of service.
Production workers at the Leyland plant voted by four to one against taking
strike action. National and local union officials will meet in Birmingham on
Monday to discuss their next move in the campaign to save jobs at the
company.

Discussions between the two sides continued yesterday and it appears
unlikely that they will be concluded until early next week. Progress on
reaching an agreement is reported to have been slow.
Virgin is still threatening to pursue action against its competitor unless
it is satisfied with BA proposals to compensate it for the commercial damage

FT  13 FEB 93 / McMahon attacks 'insult to Bank'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
    By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR KIT McMahon, a past deputy governor of the Bank of England, has accused
the government of delivering a 'breathtaking insult' to the Bank in the way
that it appointed Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea to occupy his former office, Robert
Peston writes.
In the magazine Euromoney he says the appointment of deputy governor Mr
Eddie George as governor 'must be taken as a compliment to the Bank'.
He is a 'highly professional insider' with an 'impeccable (even frightening)
hatred of inflation'.
But he adds that 'the effect (of Mr George's appointment) was rather spoiled
by the appointment as deputy governor of an outsider, Rupert Pennant-Rea,
editor of the Economist, who, whatever his intrinsic merits may prove to be,
has prima facie no qualifications for the job and who was approached for the
first time that morning'.
The government's behaviour was a 'breathtaking insult to the Bank (and in
some ways to Pennant-Rea himself)'.
Sir Kit accuses the government of giving the Bank too little independence
over the operation of monetary policy and the fight against inflation.
He was deputy governor for two years after Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the
current governor, took up office in 1983. He is also a former chairman of
Midland Bank.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Lack of boost for lower-paid attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE public-sector pay limit has not been significantly tilted towards the
lower-paid among the 1.5m people covered by pay-review bodies.
Almost all the doctors, dentists, nursing staff, teachers and members of the
armed forces covered will, from April 1, get a rise of around 1.5 per cent,
the limit announced by the government in November.
Only the teachers pay-review body proposed any significant reforms to the
structure of pay determination, and even teachers will not be fully subject
to performance pay until the outcome of pilot studies is known.
The lack of tilting towards the lower-paid in the other pay review bodies
was condemned by some pay analysts. Mr Chris Trinder of the Public Finance
Foundation said: 'An opportunity has been lost to protect the living
standards of the lower-paid and to set an example in the rest of the public
sector.'
He believes that the implementation of the 1.5 per cent limit by the
pay-review bodies will set an example for the other 3.5m public-sector
workers covered by the pay limit.
The 1.5 per cent rise will apply to settlements not to wages bills, some of
which could rise slightly more than 1.5 per cent as a result of an increase
in the number of people on higher pay scales.
Over the past two years the NHS pay bill has increased by 22 per cent while
the increase on pay scales has been only 15 per cent.
Managers may have room for uneven distribution of the 1.5 per cent within,
but not between, negotiating groups. All the unions continue formally to
oppose the 1.5 per cent limit but industrial action is not expected. The
health unions made no attempt to tilt the award towards the lower paid,
saying that they did not want to disturb 'internal relativities'.
One of the armed forces pay review body members, Prof John White, resigned
after the government imposed the 1.5 per cent limit. The doctors and
dentists review body also refused to produce a report because of the limit.
The review bodies are expected to report in the normal way next year
although the government is determined to prevent any public sector pay
'catch up'.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Most teachers to receive pay increase of 1 to 1.5 per cent
over year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST all teachers will receive a pay increase worth between 1 per cent and
1.5 per cent over the full year from this April, Andrew Adonis writes.
The rise will be accompanied by an overhaul of the teachers' pay scale, but
plans for full-blown performance pay have been shelved pending pilot
studies.
All qualified teachers will receive a 0.55 per cent increase on April 1, and
a one-off payment of Pounds 90 on May 1. On September 1, they will be
transferred to a new pay scale, giving a further increase to most.
Teachers are presently paid on a 10-point scale from Pounds 11,184 to Pounds
18,837, with five different incentive allowances - ranging from Pounds 1,296
to Pounds 7,692 - for those assuming extra responsibilities or demonstrating
'outstanding ability' in the classroom.
The allowances will be abolished from this September, and all teachers will
be placed on a 18-point scale, ranging from Pounds 11,295 to Pounds 30,573.
Teachers will have their present salaries converted to a safeguarded
entitlement on the new scale. Thereafter, the award of extra points will
depend on 'qualifications, experience, responsibilities, excellence, and
recruitment and retention factors'.
In the process, some highly rated teachers could gain well above the average
increase, possibly as much as a 2.5 per cent rise overall. But others stand
to fare below average.
Head teachers and deputy heads will receive a 1 per cent increase on April
1.
Overall, the package will cost an extra 1.5 per cent. Local education
authorities, most of which are presently spending at their capping ceiling,
yesterday expressed concern at their ability to foot the bill without
redundancies.
The pay increases and new scale structure are as recommended by the
teachers' pay review body, but have been reduced slightly by the government
to keep the additional cost for 1994-95 down to 1.5 per cent.
In its report, the review body emphasised that, for the past two years, pay
rises for teachers outstripped those for non-manual employees generally. It
noted: 'Starting salaries for teachers now compare more favourably with
those for other newly employed graduates - although we recognise that more
needs to be done to improve subsequent salary progression for teachers.'
Mr John Patten, education secretary, endorsed the new structure, welcoming
in particular the review body's proposals for rewarding excellent teaching.
'School governors have shown that they are ready to reward high-achieving
heads and deputies.
The new structure will encourage them to be equally positive in taking
decisions on the pay of classroom teachers,' he said.

Increased energy costs and car prices contributed to the rise.
The advance was in line with economists' predictions.
Meanwhile, business sales jumped 1.9 per cent in December, the largest gain
in more than two years and outpacing a 0.4 per cent increase in inventories.

FT  13 FEB 93 / N Koreans defy nuclear demands

NORTH KOREA yesterday indicated it would reject a demand by the
International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect suspected nuclear facilities.
'In our country there are no nuclear facilities that have not been reported,
nor are there any nuclear-related materials hidden,' declared the Rodong
Shinmun, the newspaper of the ruling Korean Workers' Party.
If Pyongyang refuses the inspection, the issue could eventually be discussed
by the United Nations Security Council, which could impose sanctions on
North Korea.
Officials at the IAEA in Vienna said Pyongyang had until Monday to approve a
special visit by the agency's inspectors. 'The North Koreans are pretty much
under the gun,' said one official.
Failure to approve a visit would trigger a meeting later next week of the
IAEA's 35-member board to which North Korea would be invited. The IAEA board
includes the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the US, UK,
France, Russia and China.
Mr Hans Blix, director general of the IEAE, met senior agency officials
yesterday to consider what options the board might have in the event of
Pyongyang's continued refusal.
The special inspection is the first time in the IAEA's history that it has
demanded to examine facilities that have not been declared to be part of a
nation's nuclear programme.
South Korean officials regard the IAEA demand as important in increasing
pressure on North Korea to allow more nuclear inspections, including
challenge inspections demanded by Seoul.
But they expressed doubts whether China, North Korea's closest ally, would
support sanctions if the issue reaches the UN Security Council, although
Beijing might agree to mediate with Pyongyang to resolve the dispute.
North Korea has refused IAEA inspectors access to two buildings in the
Yongbyon nuclear complex that the agency suspects are nuclear material
storage facilities.

FT  13 FEB 93 / UN asks world's leading companies to join war on drugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations is to ask leading companies to watch their share
registers for signs that drug barons are trying to launder money through
international stock exchanges.
The aim is to pool information to help identify what UN officials believe is
one route through which the profits of drug dealing are made legitimate.
Money laundering experts in UN or other international agencies would look
for patterns of share buying and selling in international markets by the
same, or connected, nominees.
The share register watch would be one function of a partnership the UN wants
to form with the private sector worldwide to involve companies in the global
war on drugs.
Much of the UN's anti-laundering work is relatively unsophisticated at
present, and is related to training police officers in Third World
countries.
Apart from helping in the fight against organised crime, companies will also
be asked to sponsor public awareness initiatives to reduce demand for
illegal drugs, and to support industrial development in the Third World.
UN projects in drug-growing countries have shown that crop-substitution
campaigns only work if there is parallel development of economic and
physical infrastructure to enable transport and sale of new crops, such as
strawberries and vegetables. Large retail chains buying out-of-season
produce from across the world could help by providing guaranteed markets.
Six large US companies - Exxon, Texaco, Boeing, Delta Airlines, Coca Cola
and IBM - have agreed to a preliminary meeting in May in Vienna, where the
UN's Drug Control Programme is based. Hoffman La Roche, the Swiss
pharmaceuticals company, will also attend.
The May meeting will set an agenda for a large conference in Vienna in
October, to which the UN will invite about 200 leading companies. Targets
include Fiat, Lufthansa, Philips, Volvo, BP, Hyundai, Canon, Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, and Mitsubishi.
The UN wants the private sector partnership to be a forum and information
exchange on the world's illegal drug markets so that companies can be more
aware of trends in drug production, trafficking, abuse and laundering
activities, and how they can help.
A voluntary share register watch is regarded as a potential source of
crucial intelligence. Combined with similarly networked intelligence from
banks on money transfers, it opens the possibility of tracking back some
illegal funds to their sources.
Tracking is very difficult because nominees - often based in offshore
financial centres - can disguise what they are doing by buying many small
stakes to frag-ment their efforts worldwide.
The UN particularly wants co-operation from chemicals and drug companies.
The UN already has agreements with them to monitor sales of chemicals needed
to refine raw opium and coca, or to manufacture drugs such as LSD and
ecstasy.
One way way of cutting down illegal drug production would be to control
sales of such chemicals more tightly, although the difficulty is
acknowledged of controlling sales of commodity chemicals such as acetone,
which is used in cocaine production.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Unita poised to capture crucial city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGOLA'S rebel Unita movement was yesterday on the verge of winning the
battle for the central highland city of Huambo as fears grew for the
security of the vital oil producing enclave of Cabinda in the north.
Control of Huambo, traditionally a Unita stronghold, would help the rebel
campaign in southern Angola and reinforce its bargaining power at peace
talks, diplomats in Luanda said yesterday.
A second round of talks between the government and Unita should have taken
place in Addis Ababa on Wednesday but was called off at the last minute by
the rebels.
'The situation is fluid but it looks very bleak for the government. It is
plausible that Unita could take control within the next two days,' a western
diplomat said.
Aid workers said thousands of wounded were trapped in Huambo, where the
government and Unita have been fighting for more than a month.
The battle is the centrepiece of the war which resumed after Unita rejected
its September electoral defeat and began to expel local authorities from 75
per cent of the country in violation of 1991 peace accords.
UN officials were trying to arrange a truce to allow flights of food and
medicines the city, which has been devastated by artillery and air attacks.
But UN special representative Margaret Anstee has been unable to contact
Unita leader Jonas Savimbi whose whereabouts were unknown.
Rebel radio said Unita forces had seized Huambo airport and captured the
riot police barracks after heavy fighting.
The government said its hard-pressed troops were resisting a Unita
onslaught, which it said was led by white mercenaries in South African-made
armoured cars.
'Fierce clashes have taken place on the outskirts of the government palace
and the military academy,' it said.
Angola's prime minister, Mr Marcolino Moco, said this week the number of
casualties was impossible to calculate. 'All we know is that many, many
people have died.'
A second diplomat said Unita looked set to capture a string of provincial
capitals. 'The Portuguese are of the opinion that the government is on the
verge of military collapse. They expect that within days if not hours Luena,
Cuito, Bie and Menongue will also fall,' he said.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Brazil tax move unsettles markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S financial markets were in turmoil yesterday as a result of a shock
change in accounting rules which will mean higher corporate tax bills.
The accounting decree, announced by President Itamar Franco, apparently
without consulting his economic team, was seen as retaliation for protests
mounted by the Sao Paulo business comm-unity on Thursday to block a new tax
on cheques, crucial in the govern-ment's attempts to balance its budget.
The announcement sent the main Sao Paulo stock market index falling 5 per
cent in the morning.
The decree overturns a law introduced in June 1991, altering the index used
for monetary correction of corporate assets.
The 1991 law was an attempt to compensate for the fact that between 1989 and
1990 successive gov-ernments gave figures for monetary correction of assets
below inflation in an attempt to suppress inflationary pressures in the
economy.
The result was high profits and consequent over-payment of taxes.
Under the 1991 law companies were required to revalue assets to reflect this
difference and could claim back taxes overpaid in the previous year.
Now officials of the Franco government say that the 1991 law went too far
the other way, allowing profit to be presented as losses.
According to the Brazilian inland revenue, the government lost Dollars 5.5bn
in potential tax revenue last year because of the 1991 law and with
abolition will obtain an extra Dollars 7bn this year - exactly the amount
the government had hoped to raise through the new tax on cheques.
The move was roundly condemned by businessmen, who claimed that the
Braz-ilian tax burden is already one of the heaviest in the world.
Mr Antoninho Trevisan, a business consultant, said: 'This will definitely
mean companies in Brazil paying more tax and will put them in an even more
precarious situation.'
Mr Miguel Jorge, vice president of Autolatina, the holding company for Ford
and Volkswagen in Brazil, added: 'This certainly looks like retaliation to
me.'

<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum, Caltex and a Singapore company have announced plans to
invest SDollars 1.3bn (Pounds 548m) in a refinery project in Singapore.
The project involves construction of a residue catalytic cracker at an
existing refinery off the main island of Singapore.
The new complex will upgrade low-value fuel oils to high-value motor
gasoline and diesel fuels which form a growing segment of the market in the
Asia Pacific region.
Singapore Petroleum Company, owned jointly by Singapore and foreign
interests, and Caltex will be the lead investors in the project, with BP
taking a smaller share.
Singapore is the world's third largest refining centre after Rotterdam and
Houston, with a total refining capacity of more than 1m barrels per day
(bpd).
The project, due for completion towards the end of 1995, is the latest step
in a multi-million dollar upgrading programme at Singapore's refineries.
Oil industry analysts say that, with the considerable investments in new
plant and equipment, Singapore is ensuring it retains its position as Asia's
main refining centre.

FT  13 FEB 93 / 'Safe' leader to replace Craxi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BITTERLY divided Socialist Party yesterday chose Mr Giorgio Benvenuto, a
former trade union leader, as a compromise candidate to become
secretary-general following the resignation on Thursday of Mr Bettino Craxi.
The choice of the dour 55-year-old Mr Benvenuto underlined the turmoil in
the party as a result of poor performance at the polls and damage caused by
the Milan corruption scandal. Mr Benvenuto, for 14 years leader of the UIL,
the Socialist-controlled trade union confederation, emerged as a possible
successor to Mr Craxi earlier this month.
According to party insiders, he was chosen as a 'safe pair of hands',
winning out against Mr Valdo Spini, a 47 year-old protestant intellectual on
the left of the party. Mr Benvenuto got 306 votes against 223 for Mr Spini,
with 14 other votes either invalid or blank.
Mr Spini lost out because he came from a minority faction and his opponents
considered him likely to take an active part in redefining the party's role.
In contrast Mr Benvenuto is not expected to impose his own views so strongly
on the party. His chief virtue is his proven integrity and honesty.
Coming from a middle class family near Naples (his father was an admiral),
Mr Benevenuto studied law but on graduating joined the trade union movement
through the UIL and remained there until 18 months ago, earning the
reputation of a dogged but moderate negotiator. Latterly he has been working
in a specially created post of director general in the finance ministry,
helping to propagandise tax reforms.
Mr Craxi was obliged to step down after having lost the confidence of the
party and when he faced six warrants from Milan magistrates advising him he
was under investigation for alleged corruption.
The election was also conditioned both by the refusal of Mr Giuliano Amato
to mix the office of prime minister with the party leadership, and by
Wednesday's resignation of Mr Claudio Martelli, the justice minister, once
considered the front-runner.
The Socialists got 5.3m votes, 13 per cent of the total, in last April's
elections. But since then, on the basis of municipal polls, the percentage
has slipped to below 10 per cent, and it has lost many paid-up members.
Mr Amato last night announced that Mr Giovanni Conso, a distinguished judge
and a leading criminal law expert, had been appointed justice minister to
replace Mr Martelli.

</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Alain Madelin, the leading proponent of a floating franc in the probable
next French government, yesterday conceded that he had, at least for the
moment, lost his argument for more currency flexibility.
On behalf of his centre-right UDF party, Mr Madelin negotiated with the RPR
Gaullists the joint programme which the two parties are pledged to put into
effect if, as the polls overwhelmingly suggest, they win the March general
election.
This programme, unveiled on Wednesday, commits a new government to 'use all
necessary means to maintain the value of the currency' including reinforced
monetary co-operation with Germany. Asked yesterday how he could reconcile
this with his earlier public support for unhooking the franc from the D-Mark
and therefore from German interest rates, Mr Madelin said he had defended
his viewpoint in negotiations inside the opposition.
'I did not succeed in convincing my friends,' Mr Madelin said. 'Nevertheless
they do agree that France cannot tolerate for any length of time interest
rates which stifle its economy, push companies into receivership and risk an
explosion of unemployment.'
The French opposition is effectively calling for greater monetary
co-operativeness from Germany.
If this is not forthcoming, Mr Madelin's views might gain ground.
His influence resides in the fact that, unlike other devaluation proponents
in the opposition, he is pro-European and a leader of a mainstream party.

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, yesterday unveiled details of a
first round of budget cuts in defence spending which will save an estimated
DM700m (Pounds 300m) over the next few years.
The expected cuts are part of the post-unification decision to reduce the
German army to 370,000 men by 1995 and lower its budget to under DM50bn by
the end of the year.
Additional rounds of cuts are expected after the federal government recently
raised 1993 defence savings to DM863m.
The cuts are part of the federal government's attempt to cut spending and
find revenues to rebuild eastern germany. It had originally set this year's
cut at DM300m but decided to raise this amount rather than go ahead with an
unpopular move to means test children's allowances.
The planned cuts will reduce or close down 35 garrisons in both the eastern
and western parts of the country out of the 745 garrisons of the German
Bundeswehr.
The largest savings, set at DM350m, will come from the scrapping of a large
military exercise area in Wunsdorf, near Berlin.
The military base there is currently still occupied by Russian soldiers, who
are due to return home by the end of next year.
Other cuts include the closure of one of the four main naval bases in the
country.
The naval base, in Opelnitz, in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein,
will be gradually closed down, with its fast petrol boats transferred to the
marine base of Warnemunde near the east German town of Rostock.
The cuts do not include an immediate reduction in army personnel.
A spokesman at the defence ministry in Bonn said that the military personnel
posted in garrisons due to be closed would be transferred to other bases.
But the defence ministry will continue seeking additional ways to make cuts.
Mr Ruhe is due to review staffing levels in the Bundeswehr after Chancellor
Helmut Kohl announced last weekend that personnel cuts could be made below
the planned level of 370,000 men by 1995.

<TEXT>
RUSSIAN investors yesterday blocked roads in St Petersburg demanding their
money back from fraudsters who have cheated a third of a million of the
city's inhabitants of privatisation vouchers.
It is the first big scandal to hit Russia's mass privatisation campaign.
Investors demonstrated near the offices of companies that promised big
returns in exchange for the vouchers but which have since disappeared. At
least 350,000 people are believed to have lost their vouchers this way. The
vouchers entitle holders to Rbs10,000 worth of shares in privatised
companies.
Five or so companies, one of them called Revenge, collected the vouchers
late last year with a promise to return them in February with a Rbs12,000
bonus.
But when the individuals, one of them an engineer at the Lomo optical plant
who recalls giving away a kilogramme of sausage to jump the queue to sign up
to the scheme, went to pick up their vouchers and money, the companies had
vanished without at trace.
Police, overwhelmed with claims from the victims, have appealed to the
population for patience while Mayor Anatoly Sobchak has promised people will
get their vouchers back. 'Look after your vouchers' screamed a frontpage
headline this week in the St Petersburg Gazette, which published a list of
the eight licensed investment funds allowed to invest vouchers on behalf of
ordinary citizens.
The free distribution of vouchers to every Russian citizen was completed
last month.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COUNTRIES which want to pick and choose which policies of the European union
created by Maastricht they want to sign up to 'should consider whether they
really want to belong to this Community,' according to Mr Martin Bangemann,
Germany's senior commissioner in Brussels.
Flatly rejecting 'any idea of an a la carte Europe' as a step back into
nationalism which would threaten the Community's survival, Mr Bangemann
reiterated his well-known view that 'there is no alternative to a European
federal state.'
His remarks, due to be made at a dinner given in his honour by Bremen city
council last night and circulated in English and French in Brussels, made
explicit reference to the current problems facing ratification of the
treaty, and could provide ammunition for anti-Maastricht forces in the UK
and Denmark.
On the eve of last November's narrowly won 'paving debate' vote on
Maastricht in the House of Commons, Mr Bangemann infuriated the British
government with a speech arguing that the treaty was a milestone to a
federal European state, and that 'more and more decisions can only be taken
at European level.'
Both the UK and Denmark are attempting to secure ratification on the basis
of opt-outs from the treaty, and the German commissioner appeared to be
taking square aim at these in his speech, as much as warning EC applicants
like Austria, Sweden and Finland that they would have to sign up to the
whole treaty.
'A united Europe in which each state is allowed to pick and choose has no
realistic chances of survival,' Mr Bangemann said. 'Those who have other
conceptions of the future Europe should consider whether they really want to
belong to this Community,' he added.
Mr Bangemann's remarks were distinct and sharper in tone from what
Commission president Jacques Delors said in his 'state of the union' address
to the European Parliament on Wednesday. It is the official policy of the
12, laid down by December's Edinburgh summit, that new EC members must
accept the full Community 'acquis'. But Mr Delors distinguished between that
and 'grandfather rights' of existing members like Denmark and the UK - whose
opt-outs he regretted, but said should be seen as an earned 'long-service'
bonus'.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Energy utility companies' monopoly under challenge
</HEADLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE right of Germany's large utility companies to be the sole providers of
energy in urban areas has been challenged by the Bundeskartellamt, the
federal cartel office.
In a move which could start to open Germany's energy market to foreign
competition, the Bundeskartellamt said RWE Energie AG Essen, one of the
country's three main utility companies, 'had not the exclusive right to
provide' energy to the town of Kleve, on the German-Dutch border.
Mr Dieter Wolf, president of the Bundeskartellamt, said the relationship
between local communities, towns and state utility companies, whereby
utility companies had the sole, automatic right to provide power,
contravened European Community competition policy. But he added that
Brussels had not yet agreed how far it would go in breaking down these
monopolies.
'If towns want to buy energy from other countries, and if neighbouring
countries want to supply them, then these communities should have the
choice,' a Bundeskartellamt official said.
However, even if there is reform over the next few months, analysts believe
Germany's three utility companies will in practice retain the monopoly.
'Both the town, and any new supplier would have to invest a great deal - in
some cases we would be talking about a new grid system,' an analyst said.
'Furthermore, a certain amount of co-operation would be needed from the
German utility companies themselves. I cannot see the utility companies
competing against each other,' he added.
The outcome will be watched closely by the local authorities in eastern
Germany which are challenging the terms of the unification treaty which
essentially gave west German companies the monopoly.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Spain cuts rates by a quarter point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE BANK of Spain yesterday cut its benchmark intervention rate by a
quarter-point from 13.25 per cent to 13 per cent in a cautious response to
last week's reduction in German interest rates.
There was disappointment in the market, which had hoped for a cut of 40
basis points in the rate at the repurchase tender of the bank's
certificates.
The bank's caution reflected its view that there could be tension in the
monetary system in the run-up to next month's elections in France. 'There
are imponderables ahead and we are keeping our powder dry,' a bank spokesman
said.
'It is quite clear that the bank's policy is to protect the peseta against
even the slightest risk,' said Mr Jose Luis Feito, chief economist at the
Madrid securities firm Asesores Bursatiles.
Other analysts also said the authorities were reluctant to move too quickly
while the peseta remained potentially vulnerable to speculators. They said
the move was probably a way of testing the water on cuts and their impact on
the peseta, noting interest rates are still well above desireable levels.
The bank's wariness, particularly in the light of the German reduction,
contrasted with its more positive mood three weeks ago when it implemented a
half-point cut at the repurchase tender, bringing the key rate down from its
13.75 per cent high in late November. The bank justified that cut by
claiming 'the progressive normalisation of the currency markets'.
The cut yesterday brought the key interest rate back to the level before the
Bank of Spain lifted the rate by 75 basis points to 13.75 per cent, a day
after the peseta was devalued six per cent on November 22.
Analysts believe that there could be a far more significant cut in Spain
next month if the money markets remain steady and the Bundesbank once more
eases its rates. There is considerable room for such a reduction as the
differential between the peseta and other EMS currencies remains very high.
Fuelling this speculation is the belief that Spain's inflation rate, which
stood at 5.4 per cent in December, is poised to register a sharp fall when
figures for January and February are published next month. The January
inflation figure has been held over until March because weighting of the
different components in the inflation index is being adjusted by the
statistics authorities.

FT  13 FEB 93 / EC surprised by Clinton's attack on Airbus subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Commission officials reacted with a mixture of anger and surprise
to President Bill Clinton's attack on EC subsidies for Airbus, describing it
as an unhelpful addition to the growing tension in transatlantic trade
relations.
'Either the Europeans are going to have to quit subsidising Airbus. . . or
we're going to have to take on the competition. I'm not going to roll over
and play dead,' Mr Clinton told a televised 'town meeting' on Wednesday
night.
Very much against the odds the EC and the US last year reached an agreement
on limiting subsidies to their respective civil aviation industries, and it
came into force last July.
'We have an agreement with the Americans and we hope they stick to it,' was
the official reaction of Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, according
to his spokesman.
Brussels is playing down Mr Clinton's remarks - made in answer to a question
at the Detroit 'town meeting' - as a heat of the moment reaction. 'It seems
as though he was shooting from the hip a bit,' one Commission official said.
Officials add that since the subsidies agreement last July, there has been
no new state-subsidised civil aircraft programme in the Community. Rehashing
the old arguments about Airbus is 'sterile', one official said, and merely
reflected the European consortium's increasing success in winning world
market share from its two US competitors, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.
One Commission official insisted that, in any case, US civil aviation
subsidies far exceeded EC subventions. 'They say we have spent Dollars 15bn
in direct subsidies,' said one official. 'We don't accept that and in any
case that figure includes cumulative interest. The US civil aeronautics
industry has benefited from about Dollars 22bn in indirect support from
defence spending over the past decade; and if we accumulated their interest
it would be nearer Dollars 30bn,' he added.
Senior US trade officials negotiating the Uruguay Round with the Community
on behalf of the Bush administration last year made clear as part of their
bargaining stance that they had come under a lot of pressure from industry,
trades unions and Congress for the aviation subsidies agreement.
One Brussels official said yesterday that the Clinton administration might
seek to renegotiate the terms of the accord as part of a settlement of all
current EC-US trade disputes.

   THE UN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL mediator Lord Owen said yesterday that talks between the
Croatian government and Serbs would begin at the United Nations next week in
an effort to renew a peace agreement blown apart in recent fighting, Reuter
reports from the UN.
He said that Serbs in the Croatian enclave of Krajina who had earlier
boycotted such negotiations had now agreed to attend peace talks at the UN
in New York.
'The Serbian authorities from Krajina are coming here on Monday and ready to
work on Tuesday,' he said.
Croatia's defence minister, Mr Gojko Susak, spoke to Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus
Vance, co-chairmen of a conference on the former Yugoslavia, last week. But
Lord Owen said initial discussions would be with Croatian Serbs alone.
The Croatia meetings, he said, would be parallel to talks on
Bosnia-Hercegovina which are expected to resume in the middle of next week
after the new US envoy, Mr Reginald Bartholomew, arrives in New York.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, in a report to the
Security Council has proposed lengthening the mandate of UN peacekeepers in
Croatia by six weeks to give Mr Vance and Lord Owen an opportunity to break
the impasse.
Lord Owen said the negotiations would consider the mandate, criticised by
Croatia and others as being too weak to allow peace-keepers to prevent
violations.
But he said it was up to the Security Council and did not say how he wanted
it changed. He told reporters he thought there was no chance the troops
would be withdrawn.
'It is the question of how you reflect a national identity within a country
in which you are a minority,' Lord Owen said.
'This is what will have to be done for Serbs in Bosnia-Hercegovina, for
Serbs in Croatia, for Albanians in Kosovo.'

FT  13 FEB 93 / Brittan tells US of trade war dangers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Leon Brittan, the EC external trade commissioner, yesterday ended two
high-profile days of talks urging Clinton administration officials and US
businessmen to renew efforts to complete the long-stalled Uruguay Round of
world trade negotiations.
After two meetings with Mr Mickey Kantor, the US Trade Representative, Sir
Leon said 'the chemistry' had been 'excellent' and the two 'intend to bring
fresh vision to the Round'.
He said he had successfully alerted key figures in the administration and
Congress to the dangers of a trade war. Serious conflict on trade issues
could 'seriously impair' US-EC co-operation on issues of foreign security.
But after the meetings, Mr Kantor's tough positioning on trade disputes with
the EC seemed little changed.
Mr Kantor expressed surprise that the Bush administration had thought the US
and EC were close to agreement on tariff reductions in the Uruguay Round.
'As far as we're concerned, we're not close at all,' he said.
On one issue the two sides were in total harmony: it was the turn of Japan
to be brought to the table for concessions.
But at the US State Department, meanwhile, there were public assurances from
the Clinton administration to Japanese Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe. The
US was committed to an open trading system, said Mr Warren Christopher, the
secretary of state.
Sir Leon's hope of injecting momentum into the Uruguay Round became an
exercise in damage control as the number of US and EC differences became
apparent. The EC commissioner had not been in the country three hours before
President Bill Clinton attacked Airbus subsidies, as he did frequently in
last year's election campaign.
Responding to a question from Seattle, where Boeing is the leading employer,
about layoffs in the US aerospace industry, Mr Clinton said he would not
'roll over and play dead' if the EC continued to subsidise aircraft
development.
Mr Kantor, who is thought to be sceptical about threats of trade war, said
he 'had problems' with sections in the Uruguay Round negotiating draft about
market access, intellectual property, services and anti-dumping, as well as
with the farm reform deal worked out with the EC.
If he had concerns about trade hawkishness in the new administration, Sir
Leon sought to obscure them by making much of Mr Clinton's long-expected
support for an extension of his 'fast-track' negotiating authority. This
must be agreed by Congress if the administration is to submit an unamendable
trade agreement for approval.
But it is not clear that Congress will agree to an extension without
conditions, or if, indeed, the administration even wants an unconditional
'fast-track'.
There is talk of adding a new 'Super 301' on to the 'fast-track' extension.
This is a much criticised provision - supported by Mr Clinton - that orders
the US Trade Representative to negotiate away foreign trade barriers or
impose sanctions on those governments that resist.
Sir Leon said Mr Kantor would go to Brussels 'at his earliest convenience',
while Sir Leon would return to Washington in April. 'The momentum is there,'
he insisted.

FT  13 FEB 93 / The Perks War: Who is cutting back at the top

<TEXT>
WITH growth rates falling and budget deficits soaring across the
industrialised world, governments are facing pressure from electorates to
tone down extravagance.
Lavish life-styles of political leaders and their staff, though acceptable
when economies are booming, can become a political liability at a time of
recession.
President Bill Clinton this week has launched a campaign to trim fringe
benefits in his new administration, in a bid to show Americans that thrift
can provide the key to economic regeneration. Unlike government leaders
elsewhere, Mr Clinton is rather too new in office to have frozen his own pay
packet.
In other countries, politicians and civil servants have been feeling the
squeeze for some time.
One big question is whether the Group of Seven leading economies will mount
a show of austerity when the extravaganza of the annual G7 summit takes
place in Tokyo in July - or whether the expensive show will go on as normal.
Britain's John Major
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, is not - in contrast to his
predecessor, Mrs Margaret Thatcher - endowed with a millionaire spouse. Up
to now, he has not felt able to afford her grand gesture of waiving an
annual pay rise, writes Ivo Dawnay.
Nonetheless, the parlous state of the exchequer this year forced all members
of parliament and ministers to agree a zero pay rise for 1992-93. Mr Major's
remuneration thus remains fixed at Pounds 78,000.
Sandwiches, teabags and instant coffee are the main fare at London's premier
political residence, all paid for out of private purses.
Outside, ministers draw up in strictly graded cars - Jaguars for the grandee
secretaries of state, low powered Rovers for the less distinguished and
humble Ford family saloons for the lowest orders. Most ministers tend to sit
alongside their drivers in the front.
As for ministerial expense accounts, British government ethics dictate that
while journalists, lobbyists and businessmen can wine and dine their
contacts, it would be immoral for the transaction to take place the other
way round. After all, that would be squandering taxpayers' money.
America's Bill Clinton
The perks of office are not the flavour of the week in Washington, writes
Jurek Martin. Bill Clinton's Cabinet has been laying waste to many of them,
abolishing executive dining rooms, restricting access to chauffeured
limousines, limiting magazine subscriptions, closing riding stables in
Virginia and enforcing economy air travel.
The Clinton family has not benefited financially from the move to
Washington. Bill's salary has gone up to Dollars 200,000 (Pounds 132,000)
from Dollars 35,000, but Hillary's estimated Dollars 150,000 a year as a
lawyer has disappeared, even though her workload has not, and Chelsea,
state-educated in Arkansas, is now in a Dollars 14,000 a year private
school.
Less prominent government employees are now facing up to harsher times.
Under the new ethical standards, government employees can only accept free
lunches from reporters if they cost less than Dollars 20 a year.
This week's campaign was predictable for a populist president intent on
setting a good budgetary example, especially after all the criticism of
Congress's perks. The Clintons do not have expensive tastes, but they have
the bowling alley, the tennis court and use of the ultimate perk, Air Force
One.
Germany's Helmut Kohl
The German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, anxious to set an example of
belt-tightening, will keep his annual salary of DM450,000 (Pounds 187,000)
unchanged in 1993, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin.
In a climate of concern about the recession, politicians' pay increases have
come under growing scrutiny. Members of parliament last month received a pay
increase of less than 2.2 per cent, well below the 4 per cent rate of
inflation. Ministers, who earn an annual gross income of DM390,000, and
parliamentary state secretaries, will receive no pay increase for the second
consecutive year. Bonn fringe benefits are already kept under relatively
tight control. Three categories of government official have access to a car
with driver: a department head, a state secretary, and of course, a
minister. But these officials are taxed for the kilometres they are driven
either from home to work, or to meetings.
In the civil service, still regarded as offering life-time employment,
officials who do not pay unemployment benefit contributions from their
salaries are expected to be granted a pay increase of about 2.5 per cent
this year while civil servants who pay contributions will receive a rise of
3 per cent.
Canada's Brian Mulroney
Mr Brian Mulroney, the Canadian prime minister, is on a salary of CDollars
138,000 (Pounds 77,530) - now frozen, like other ministers' pay, until 1995,
writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
'We discovered economy before the Americans did,' says an official at the
Treasury Board in Ottawa, the agency which oversees Canadian government
spending. As long ago as 1984, the prime minister took a 15 per cent pay
cut, with other ministers' salaries being reduced by 10 per cent.
For the next seven years, the rise in salaries was capped by a formula
which, in essence, was the consumer price index minus one percentage point.
But ministerial pay was cut again - by 5 per cent - in February 1992, and is
due to remain pegged until 1995.
For the past two years, use of government aircraft by cabinet ministers has
been all but banned for trips to any place served by commercial airlines.
Two of the government's eight Challenger executive jets have been converted
for search and rescue missions on the east coast.
On commercial flights, ministers must use business-class. Each minister is
supplied with a car and driver, but any use outside official duties is a
taxable benefit.
France's Francois Mitterrand
President Francois Mitterrand is making his own modest contribution to
promoting rigueur in Paris, writes William Dawkins in Paris. His salary  -
FFr433,436 (Pounds 54,500) last year - is being raised 1.8 per cent this
year, in line with the low increase coming into effect this month for French
civil service pay.
France's army of 5m public administration employees already live in relative
austerity by comparison with politicians, who commonly receive favours in
cash and kind from friends and supporters. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime
minister, admitted recently receiving a FFr1m interest-free loan from a
friend.
The civil service, by contrast, is starting to feel the pinch. The state is
to cut just over 4 per cent from the running costs of the public service
this year, though this will not come from officials' salaries.
On paper, it looks as if the public administration is generously paid. with
advantages in kind. Some 12,000 cars are reserved for senior civil servants,
while 2m state-funded homes are allocated to public employees. Most of
these, however, are humble appartments allocated to school teachers and
hospital staff. Worse still, all benefits of this kind are taxed.
Japan's Kiichi Miyazawa
There is little sign that the Japanese economic crisis has been denting
ministerial well-being, writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa,
the prime minister, whose annual pay (including bonus) is Y43.1m (Pounds
229,000), recorded a Y5m rise in assets to Y149.45m during his first year in
office, in spite of the stock and property market collapse.
Wining and dining of Japanese politicians and bureaucrats has taken a slight
turn for the austere, because Japanese companies have been slashing their
entertainment budgets. In general, though, the fringe benefits of government
have been maintained in spite of the downturn.
An important perk of office in Japan is to allow yourself to be entertained
at somebody else's expense. The recession has forced most leading companies
to cut their entertainment budgets by 20 to 30 per cent. Ministers' salaries
are generally not an issue, even though the average worker is earning less
overtime and has annual bonuses capped. Japanese political scandals are
normally founded not on the greed of an individual politician, but the need
of faction leaders to gather enough funds to keep their political machines
moving.
Italy's Giuliano Amato
Prof Giuliano Amato, the Italian prime minister, who receives an annual
salary believed to total L78m (Pounds 35,840), has presided over a move
towards unfamiliar austerity in Rome, writes Robert Graham in Rome.
The free spending habits of Italy's body politic have been checked, with
salaries and allowances of members of parliament frozen, and perks cut back.
The most important innovation has been to end the practice of deputies who
are civil servants - doctors, teachers, university professors, lawyers etc -
from claiming two salaries.
Until now they received their civil servants pay as well as their
parliamentary salaries, but this year they must opt for one or the other. A
total of 310 out of 945 senators and members of the chamber of deputies are
affected.
In parliament, checks have been placed on foreign travel. In the prime
minister's office, the number of official cars has been cut from 110 to 40.
The number of newspapers received daily has been reduced from 200 to 100,
and staff are also subject to limits on the number of newspapers for which
they can claim.

THE chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff unveiled a plan yesterday for a
post-Cold War military that calls for consolidating all US-based forces so
as to better meet crises at home and United Nations peacekeeping missions
abroad, Reuter reports from Washington.
In a report billed as his own strategic blueprint for the armed forces,
General Colin Powell stressed the need to join some elements of the military
to save money and gain efficiency, such as consolidating depot maintenance
functions, but left others intact, including the four separate air forces of
the Air Force, Army, Marines and Navy.
'The report should be seen as a snapshot - a snapshot in a continuous
process of self-evaluation,' Gen Powell said.
The main points were to maintain US commitments around the world and the
quality of the military, emphasise US technological superiority, adjust to
the 'changing security environment' in the post-Cold War world and further
trim military programmes.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations yesterday launched a humanitarian offensive following the
Bosnian government decision to reject aid for Sarajevo until further
emergency relief reached Moslem enclaves besieged by Serb forces.
UN officials blamed all three sides - Serbs, Croats and Moslems - for
sabotaging the delivery of humanitarian aid, but singled out Serb leaders
for blocking relief to besieged Moslem enclaves in eastern Bosnia.
Mr Jose Maria Mendiluce, the special envoy of the High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR), pledged to step up pressure on the leaders of Bosnia's
three ethnic groups as well as their patrons in Croatia and Serbia to ensure
that aid reaches the victims of the ten-month war.
'We cannot wait for a political solution while people are dying, suffering,
being expelled and subject to all kinds of violence and harassment,' he said
in Belgrade, the federal capital.
He vowed to push ahead with relief deliveries regardless of whether warring
leaders gave their permission to pass. He said: 'We will present Serb
leaders with a schedule of convoys. . . and explain the need to reach all
besieged enclaves with no restrictions' at a meeting on Sunday in Pale, the
Serb mountain stronghold near Sarajevo.
Mr Mendiluce estimated that up to 200,000 people were trapped by the Serb
stranglehold of the Moslem pockets in eastern Bosnia. 'The food situation in
some of the areas is as dramatic as in Sarajevo. . . there is a complete
lack of medical supplies.'
He dismissed as 'cynical' the claim by Bosnian Serb leaders that they had
opened a humanitarian corridor for refugees from Cerska, in the hills over
the River Drina, to Tuzla, 100 miles north-east of Sarajevo. 'We see it as
an ethnic cleansing corridor,' he said.
'They crossed the front line of minefields, under enemy fire without any
belongings in freezing temperatures,' he said of the 6,000 refugees, many of
whom arrived in Tuzla suffering frostbite, scabies, head lice and hepatitis.
He said Tuzla had also threatened to join the boycott of UNHCR aid called by
the Bosnian government on Thursday. The government said it would accept no
more aid for Sarajevo out of solidarity for people cut off from the outside
world by the Serb siege.
Mr Mendiluce said relief workers faced a harrowing task delivering aid in
Bosnia. 'This is a very serious humanitarian tragedy. . . We will go ahead
despite the risks, the shelling, shooting and all threats we are suffering
every day when just trying to feed women, children and the elderly,' he
said.
'The UNHCR in its 41-year history has never been in a situation so
radicalised, so polarised with such a high level of hatred and lack of
humanitarian behaviour.'
As Mr Mendiluce appealed to all sides to allow the humanitarian aid to reach
some 3m people, clashes continued in neighbouring Croatia and Bosnia. Croat
and Serb forces fought artillery duels in the Dalmatian hinterland around
Maslenica, which was seized in a Croat offensive last month. Fighting was
also reported between Serb and Moslem fighters in northern and eastern
Bosnia.
Artillery barrages on Sarajevo yesterday appeared to ease after fierce
fighting on Thursday. A French UN soldier died from injuries he and three
compatriots suffered at the city airport, bringing the death toll to 27 UN
peacekeepers in Bosnia and Croatia.

14,000-strong UN Protection Force in Croatia - which expires on February 21
 -for an interim period only, ending on March 31.
In a report to the Security Council, Mr Boutros Ghali said he could not, for
the moment, recommend extending the mandate for a longer period.
This was because of the unstable situation created by the recent Croatian
military offensive in the Krajina region and, more fundamentally, the
failure to implement fully the original peace-keeping plan of January 1992.
The report is due to be discussed by the Council at the end of next week.
The secretary general said he had asked the co-chairmen of the conference on
the former Yugoslavia, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, to address these basic
problems urgently so conditions could be established for a 'substantive'
extension of the mandate.
Mr Boutros Ghali's report blames both sides for the renewed fighting in the
region.
'Even if the (Croatian) government had some reason to be impatient with the
local Serb leadership's obstruction of the original peace-keeping plan, its
offensive has had a devastating effect on co-operation between UNPROFOR and
the local Serb authorities at all levels and has put in doubt the
feasibility of a return to the original plan.'
Under the terms of that plan, UN peace-keeping troops were deployed in three
UN protected areas in Croatia, corresponding largely to areas where
intercommunal tensions had led to armed conflict.
Other important provisions were the withdrawal of the federal Yugoslav army
from the whole of Croatia, the demilitarisation of the UN protected areas
and the continued functioning, on an interim basis, of existing local
authorities and police under UN supervision.
The secretary general's report makes clear that, while the withdrawal of the
Yugoslav army had been ensured, the non-co-operation of the local Serb
authorities had prevented the demilitarisation of the protected areas and
the disarming of the Serb territorial defence and irregular forces.
Serb hostility to UNPROFOR, on the other hand, had been inflamed by the
Croatian offensive, since the local Serb leadership felt 'betrayed' by what
it sees as the UN's failure to protect them.
'Neither the Croatian government's position that an overall political
solution already exists, nor the local Serb authorities' demand that they be
recognised as an independent republic provides a solution to the conflict,'
the report states.
'Instead, these positions, if maintained, could lead to large-scale
hostilities.'
Examining the various options for a future extension of the UNPROFOR
mandate, Mr Boutros Ghali underlines the problems of giving the force more
teeth.
The mere adoption of an enforcement resolution by the Security Council
risked threatening the safety and security of UN peace-keeping personnel in
the protected areas.

FT  13 FEB 93 / South African pact may lead to power-sharing
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A LANDMARK agreement in South Africa which could lead to a power-sharing
government of national unity has been reached between Pretoria and the
African National Congress.
The outline pact on the country's constitutional future - concluded after
protracted talks - allows multi-party constitutional talks to resume within
a fortnight after a nine-month hiatus.
The agreement follows the ANC's decision late last year to postpone pushing
for majority rule in favour of power-sharing. It represents the most
important step in the country's peace process since the release of Mr Nelson
Mandela in 1990 and the all-white referendum last year which endorsed
President F W de Klerk's negotiating strategy.
At the end of this month, groups from across the political spectrum will
meet to try to establish a new multi-party negotiating forum to replace the
Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa) which collapsed in
acrimony last May.
The ANC and the government will go to these talks with a joint stand on
crucial constitutional issues, including agreement that a power-sharing
'government of national unity' should rule South Africa for five years after
the first multi-racial elections, due to be held next April.
However, many hurdles need to be overcome before this agreement can be
implemented: the ANC's negotiating team must get the endorsement of the
organisation's policy-making national executive committee; government
negotiators must get approval from the cabinet; and, even more critically,
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party and other
political groups from right and left must approve the deal, or be overruled
with a risk of violence.
The government and Inkatha will meet for three days of bilateral
negotiations next week.
Agreement between the ANC and the ruling National party, the two main
political groupings, is the first step to a solution. Negotiators from both
sides stressed that, though details had not been agreed on many crucial
matters, the main stumbling blocks to formal agreement had been removed
during a three-day meeting which ended yesterday in Cape Town.
The two sides reached broad agreement on devolution of power to regional
governments (though detailed agreement may yet prove difficult), and agreed
that consensus in detail should be reached on this issue before a
constituent assembly is elected - a key National party demand. The National
party also agreed to be flexible on the issue of power-sharing under a
permanent constitution.
Yesterday's deal involves a five-year 'sunset clause' during which white and
black will share power in a multi-party cabinet.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Inflation rate falls to 1.7%: Lamont rules out interest rate
cut; Union anger at public pay limit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, yesterday ruled out a further cut in
interest rates to spur Britain's economic growth, despite a fall in the
annual inflation rate to 1.7 per cent - its lowest level for 25 years.
His efforts to bolster sterling came as the government reinforced its
determination to continue the fight against inflation and crack down on
public spending. Speaking in the Commons, Mr John Major, the prime minister,
said pay rises for hundreds of thousands of public sector workers would be
limited to 1.5 per cent.
The announcement provoked outrage from public sector union leaders, who
described it as a wage cut. Health union negotiators refused to accept the
award for Britain's 600,000 nurses, midwives and health visitors.
In a further attempt to boost sterling, Mr Eddie George, deputy governor of
the Bank of England who takes over as governor in July, warned that interest
rates would be raised if the pound were to weaken 'substantially' from its
current level.
Speaking to journalists in Frankfurt yesterday, Mr George also said the
pound would be helped if the government and parliament were to declare that
the Bank should be made independent of government.
Despite the efforts of Mr Lamont and Mr George to lift sterling, many in the
City believe the need to spur UK growth will push the government into
cutting interest rates from 6 per cent around Budget day on March 16. The
pound closed last night up half a pfennig on the day against the D-Mark at
DM2.3575. Before the European markets opened, it had dipped to a new
all-time trading low of DM2.3245. Against the dollar, sterling closed little
changed at Dollars 1.418. In New York, sterling closed at DM2.357 and
Dollars 1.4205.
Buoyed by inflation news, the gilt market had one of its best days in recent
months, with long-dated securities gaining nearly 2 points.
The 0.9 per cent fall in the retail prices index, from 2.6 per cent in
December to 1.7 per cent in January, was the biggest monthly drop for nearly
35 years.
The year-on-year rise in the RPI last month was the lowest since September
1967. Britain now has the lowest headline inflation rate in the European
Community apart from Denmark.
In a statement, Mr Lamont said: 'The task now is to consolidate this
progress and maintain downward pressure on underlying inflation. Interest
rates will be set to achieve that objective. On the basis of all the
available evidence I do not believe that there is any scope for a further
reduction in interest rates.'
The inflation figures did not impress Mr Gordon Brown, the Labour shadow
chancellor. He said they reflected the fact that people were 'not buying
anything or producing anything', with the economy still stuck in recession.
News of the reduction in inflationary pressures, which the government hopes
will ultimately provide a platform for steady economic expansion, came even
allowing for the 15 per cent depreciation in sterling since it dropped out
of the European exchange rate mechanism last September.
The Central Statistical Office said there was as yet no sign that rising
import prices resulting from the devaluation had fed through to increased
prices at the retail level.
Further good news for Mr Lamont was that the RPI excluding mortgage payments
 -the Treasury's favoured measure for underlying inflation - dropped by 0.5
per cent in the month to January, the biggest fall since the CSO started
records in 1975.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Major's 'classless' honours plan upsets forces chiefs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOLLIPOP LADIES, postmen and shop-floor workers are to be accorded the same
status as bank managers, headteachers and office managers under Mr John
Major's plans to revamp the honours system.
But generals, admirals and air marshals have voiced indignant opposition to
the prime minister's attempt to inject his vision of a classless society
into the twice-yearly distribution of royal awards.
The British Empire Medal (BEM), the traditional royal recognition of active
citizenship by members of the working class, will be abolished later this
year
Instead the nation's humbler citizens will be eligible for the MBE (Member
of the British Empire), hitherto reserved for the genteel inhabitants of
middle-class suburbia.
The class-conscious armed forces chiefs have lined up in Whitehall
negotiations against Downing Street's plan to deprive the top brass in the
officers' mess of the automatic right to a knighthood.
At the heart of Mr Major's recommendations to the Queen on reform of the
honours system is a plan to apply a little more equality when rewarding
service to the community by the great, the good and the plain humble.
Under the present arrangements, a baker judged to be a worthy pillar of the
local community might aspire to a BEM. But the doctor next door, deemed to
have delivered similar charitable or voluntary service, would expect an MBE.
Mr Major has also made headway in his attempts to balance merit with rank in
awards for civil servants.
Politicians will still be eligible for retirement in the House of Lords. But
Whitehall's mandarins are resigned to the fact that a trip to Buckingham
Palace to pick up a Companion of the Bath or a Knights Batchelor (the basic
knighthood) will no longer be automatic for deputy and permanent
secretaries.
Nor will diplomats necessarily be offered compensation for a posting to
nowhere by being appointed a Companion of St Michael &amp; St George.
The prime minister will not get his way without a fight with the armed
forces chiefs. They are arguing that classlessness may be all very well in
civilian life but the rigid observance of social status is a vital component
of a well-oiled military machine.
Services opponents of the plan to abolish the BEM say the criteria for
awards are different. Officers are rewarded with an MBE for specific
achievements rather than the 'meritorious service' which qualifies, say, a
long-serving army cook, for the BEM.
But Whitehall insiders say the military's main concern is Mr Major's
decision to reform the award of knighthoods to the 50 or so senior officers
on the active list.
Knighthood does not come before the rank of lieutenant-general, vice-admiral
or air marshal (in US terms, three-star appointments), but then it is
automatic.
The wrangling is delaying a Downing Street announcement of the reforms, but
Mr Major is determined to have his way. The officials charged with preparing
recommendations for the Queen's birthday honours in June have been told to
draw up as usual a list of nominations for the BEM - but on the basis that
the recipients will then be 'bumped up' to MBE.

<TEXT>
NEARLY one third of Leyland Daf's 5,500 UK workforce were made redundant
yesterday. The rest could also lose their jobs shortly if leading components
suppliers continue to delay their deliveries, the receivers of the collapsed
vehicle maker warned.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, backed a call to the
suppliers by the receivers, who have not restarted production since being
called in last week.
Although the receivers have assured suppliers they will be paid, Leyland Daf
could neither pay its creditors from before its collapse nor meet
contractual redundancy obligations. Outside the UK plants yesterday, there
were angry scenes as workers contemplated the terms of their redundancies.

FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Western Mining halves payout as
profits tumble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN Mining, the Aus-tralian metals and commodities producer, has come
through another six months marred by low prices and asset write-downs with a
halved dividend and reduced profits.
The company is cutting its interim dividend from 6 cents to 3 cents a share
following a 44.3 per cent reduction in net equity-accounted earnings to
ADollars 53m (USDollars 35.8m) for the six months ended December. Total
revenue improved 2.6 per cent to ADollars 820.4bn.
The result was before an abnormal loss of ADollars 26.2m, mainly reflecting
amortisation and asset write-offs. This compares with abnormals a year ago
of ADollars 200m when the company wrote down the value of its mining
properties, mainly in the gold mines.
The biggest blow to the group, headed by chief executive Sir Arvi Parbo,
came from low world nickel prices which cut nickel earnings from ADollars
19.5m to ADollars 7.9m. Average nickel prices received fell 8.8 per cent in
the year, with a 6.8 per cent cut in output contributing to higher unit
costs.
Oil earnings fell to ADollars 27.1m from ADollars 31.2m and the equity
contribution from the Alcoa aluminium group fell to ADollars 56.5m from
ADollars 77.8m.
Gold earnings remained static at just over ADollars 40m, but the Olympic Dam
copper-uranium project pushed ahead strongly, lifting earnings to ADollars
27.4m from ADollars 10.3m.
Despite the tight trading conditions, the company lifted capital expenditure
to ADollars 194m from ADollars 170m, mainly on expansion of nickel capacity.
Western Mining is to proceed with development of the Mt Keith nickel deposit
in Western Australia at a likely cost of about ADollars 350m and had also
reached agreement in principle for the sale of the Chibougamau gold mine in
Canada.
The result followed a tax credit of ADollars 11.3m (against a ADollars 24.7m
charge) and depreciation of ADollars 174.5m, against ADollars 135.6m.
Exploration expenditure written off fell to ADollars 34.1m from ADollars
45.4m and the company's interest expense fell to ADollars 16.1m from
ADollars 21m.

WALL Street reacted with enthusiasm yesterday to further evidence that
Sears, Roebuck, long-regarded as the sleeping giant of US retailing, has
woken up and is ready to fight to regain market share.
Yesterday, the company revealed details of its restructuring plans,
including a Dollars 4bn five-year capital expenditure for its stores and a
58.6 per cent cut in debt and deposits.
Sears has become uncharacteristically responsive to charges that it has
neglected its retail operations. Over the last five months it has brought in
a new head of retailing and announced plans to sell its loss-making
catalogue business and spin off much of its non-retailing operations.
As if to emphasise its renewed focus on retailing, the thrust of yesterday's
analysts' meeting centred on upgrading about 500 of its 800 US stores.
Mr Arthur Martinez, the former finance director of Saks Fifth Avenue who
took the helm of Sears' retail operations in October, stressed the need to
shift Sears's retail strategy from a national approach to a regional
approach.
'We believe we have the best retail store locations at major regional malls
in the country, which offer us tremendous growth potential. While a
considerable amount of work has been done in our stores in recent years,
much more needs to be done and at an accelerated pace,' Mr Martinez said. He
is credited with shutting Sears's loss-making catalogue business. Sears
plans to spend about Dollars 4bn upgrading its US stores over the next five
years.
Mr Edward Brennan, chairman and chief executive, said the company expected
the share issue of 20 per cent of its Dean Witter Financial Services
subsidiary to be priced and completed by the end of the month, slightly
ahead of schedule. The level of interest in Dean Witter is 'about as high as
one could hope', he said.
The spin-off of the remainder of Dean Witter, which includes the profitable
securities brokerage and Discover credit card unit, is to be completed by
the end of the year.
Sears expected cumulative proceeds of about Dollars 3bn from the Dean Witter
share issue and spin-off, a 20 per cent share issue of its Allstate
insurance subsidiary and the sale of its Coldwell Banker property broker.
Sears shares rose Dollars 1 5/8 to a 52-week high of Dollars 51 5/8 . The
stock was trading at around Dollars 41 before the demerger was announced in
September.
Sears said it was cutting its quarterly dividend to 40 cents from 50 cents
to reflect its strategic repositioning. It predicted an 11.5 per cent
decline in revenue to Dollars 52.3bn after the repositioning, a 29.6 per
cent drop in assets to Dollars 79.8bn and a drop in debt and deposits to
Dollars 15.4bn.

FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Union Discount in talks on its future
ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION DISCOUNT, the discount house group which was the subject of a bid
approach late last year, is now discussing a merger with another specialist
operator in the short-term money market, it emerged yesterday.
Union, under chief executive Mr George Blunden, has been fighting to rebuild
its core money market businesses since a disastrous diversification into
leasing and property lending in the 1980s. The group's share price slipped
from a high of 500p in 1990 to only a tenth of that value before the bid
approach, and yesterday remained steady at 100p.
In a statement after the market closed, Union said that talks about its
future ownership were continuing, but that they 'may be resolved by a number
of possible structures.'
These include a takeover, a merger with another company or an offer for the
other company. The announcement is thought to indicate that Union is in
merger talks with another specialist money market group, although a bid is
still possible.
Directors of Cater Allen, the money broker which owns 3 per cent of Union
and whose name has been most often mentioned as the potential bidder, could
not be contacted for comment yesterday evening.

<TEXT>
SHARES in Cummins Engine, the world's biggest independent manufacturer of
diesel engines, rose sharply yesterday after the US company reported
fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 24m, a sharp turnround from the Dollars
2.3m it lost at the same stage a year ago.
The company's earnings in the latest quarter would have been higher, but for
the extraordinary charge of Dollars 5.5m Cummins took to cover early
retirement of high-cost debt.
Despite the charge, however, investors were cheered by the news from
Cummins, which has now made a profit in the last four quarters thanks to a
combination of cost-cutting measures and a revival in key markets that has
helped the company recover from a string of losses. Cummins' shares rose
Dollars 3 to Dollars 84 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange.
For the full-year, Cummins earned Dollars 67.1m, compared with a Dollars
65.6m loss incurred in 1991. The net effect of adopting three new accounting
standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, however, left
the company with a net loss of Dollars 189.5m last year.
Sales to the North American heavy-duty truck market, where the company
maintains a market share of about 38 per cent, rose in the fourth quarter.

<TEXT>
EURO Disney, which operates the FFr4.2bn (Dollars 768m) EuroDisneyland theme
park near Paris, has warned shareholders it would make a substantial loss
this year.
Mr Philippe Bourguignon, who last month took over as chairman, told an
investors' meeting in Paris that he expected to see an improvement in the
second half of the year, but that Euro Disney would stay in the red for the
full year.
Euro Disney, which made a pre-tax loss of FFr339m in its last financial year
to September 30, has announced a deficit of FFr492m for the first quarter of
this year.
Mr Bourguignon said it was on course for slightly worse losses in the second
quarter. When asked whether Euro Disney would be profitable in the second
half he replied: 'The third quarter - I don't know. The fourth quarter - I
hope so.'
Since its opening last spring, EuroDisneyland has been hit by shortfalls in
attendance and merchandise revenue due to the economic environment and
strength of the French franc against other European currencies. The group is
burdened by high financing costs after being forced to postpone its property
development programme because of the Paris property slump.
Analysts estimated that Euro Disney would attract 10m-10.5m visitors by the
end of its first year. This compared to Euro Disney's forecast of 11.5m
visitors. Mr Richard Simon, analyst at Goldman Sachs in New York, expected
Euro Disney to produce a net loss of 'at least FFr750m' this year.

FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: BP faces Dollars 630m charge to end Alaskan
dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum's US subsidiary is faced with a tax charge of Dollars 630m
(Pounds 417m) to end a dispute with the state of Alaska.
The charge reflects a wrangle between the company and the Alaskan
authorities which dates back to 1982 over the way the state taxes non-US
corporations doing business there.
The company has said it will pay the charge by June 30.
Mr Steve Ahearne, finance director, said that BP had made provisions to
cover the tax payment and that it would have no backdated effect on last
year's financial results which were announced yesterday.
BP reported a loss for 1992 but pointed out that its fourth quarter
replacement cost profit of Pounds 193m showed an improvement on Pounds 172m
in the third quarter and Pounds 72m in the same period of 1991. Replacement
cost profit strips out the effects of oil stock losses and gains.
Within the figures, there were bright spots such as a 30 per cent increase
in profits from the exploration and production division in the fourth
quarter when compared with the third quarter.
The business reported a replacement cost operating profit of Pounds 515m for
the final quarter compared with Pounds 396m in the third quarter and Pounds
427m in the same period of 1991.
The improvement was largely a result of the stronger dollar since oil prices
are quoted in dollars.
For the full year the exploration business made an operating profit of
Pounds 1.68bn (Pounds 1.7bn, or Pounds 1.8bn before the FRS 3 accounting
change) on a replacement cost basis.
Mr Ahearne stressed that BP has cut its costs and improved its operating
efficiencies in exploration to report average income per barrel produced of
Dollars 3.40 compared with Exxon, the industry leader, which makes Dollars
3.50 a barrel.
BP said it will book an extra 450m barrels to its oil reserve figures this
year. Oil output fell last year to 1.29m barrels a day from 1.36m b/d in
1991.
Gas production slipped from 1.26bn to 1bn cu ft a day.
The refining and marketing division also improved its income in the final
quarter in spite of difficult market conditions.
The division reported replacement cost operating profits of Pounds 117m for
the fourth quarter, compared with Pounds 75m. Profits for the year, however,
declined to Pounds 304m (Pounds 779m; Pounds 945m).
Mr David Simon, chief executive, reported 'green shoots,' in BP's US
marketing operations. But Mr Russell Seal, director of refining and
marketing, said that European refining margins were 'still giving a poor
return' and that there were short-term pressures in the market because of
over-capacity in some unsophisticated refineries.
The chemicals business reported a fourth quarter replacement cost operating
loss of Pounds 22m (loss of Pounds 34m a year earlier) but the business was
showing few signs of recovery.
Mr Simon said it was a 'hard slog' in chemicals and that the company would
be looking to make several disposals this year. The division incurred a loss
of Pounds 24m for the full year, (profit of Pounds 32m; Pounds 7m a year
earlier).
Operating profits at the nutrition division were Pounds 20m in the fourth
quarter, compared with Pounds 11m in the previous year. For the full year,
profits were Pounds 73m (Pounds 39m; Pounds 37m).
Group turnover for 1992 was Pounds 33.25bn (Pounds 32.61bn).

<TEXT>
ERSTE Oesterreichische Spar/Casse Bank, a large Austrian savings bank, is to
start merger talks with Girocredit to form Austria's second largest bank.
Erste, which holds 21.5 per cent of Girocredit, is planning to acquire the
30.5 per cent stake held by Bank Austria, the country's largest bank.
Erste and Bank Austria plan to finalise the transaction in time for
Girocredit's annual meeting in April. Erste is looking for other partners,
such as smaller savings banks and insurance companies, to help finance the
acquisition.
A full merger would be postponed for several years, Erste said. The takeover
of Girocredit by Erste would mark the largest change in the Austrian banking
industry since Zentralsparkasse, another large savings bank, merged with
Laenderbank last year, to form the new market leader Bank Austria.
Girocredit, the product of a merger between Girozentrale and the much
smaller retail bank OCI, has acted as the clearing house of the Austrian
savings banks, but the wave of mergers between savings banks and commercial
banks has left it without a franchise.
The Erste-Girocredit group would be the third Austrian bank with balance
sheet assets of more than Sch500bn (Dollars 44bn).
However, banking analysts said the country's banks may be too small to
survive in the more competitive environment of the European single market.

FT  12 FEB 93 / The Property Market: London bears brunt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHOP RENTS have increased by an average 44.6 per cent since November 1987,
according to Hillier Parker, chartered surveyors. Rents reached a peak in
May 1990, since when the Investors Chronicle-Hillier Parker All-Shops Index
has fallen by 7.6 per cent.
A study of the nine locations charging the highest rents in the UK showed
sharp variations in rental movements between different areas.
The sharpest falls since the peak in 1988 have been in London, which has
been affected by the recession and high increases in business rates. Oxford
Street, which commanded the highest rents in the UK in 1990, has seen its
rents fall from a peak of Pounds 350 per sq ft in 1988 to Pounds 260 per sq
ft today.
The smallest fall was in Newcastle, in north-east England, where top rents
declined from a peak of Pounds 200 per sq ft to Pounds 190 per sq ft.
These figures measure the movement in open market rents on new leases, and
so tend to react more sharply to changes in market conditions than portfolio
measures, which include existing leases. However, they may underestimate the
extent of the downturn by excluding the impact of incentives such as
rent-free periods and capital contributions.
Hillier Parker reports that the retail sector is performing better than
offices and industrials, in spite of oversupply and falling retail sector
profits. At the peak of the development cycle in 1989, 14.4m sq ft of retail
space came onto the market. Last year the figure fell to 6m sq ft.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Nalgo challenges contracting out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NALGO has launched a drive to ensure that the terms and conditions of
employees remain the same when government departments contract out their
computer services.
The local government union is demanding a judicial review to compel the
London boroughs of Hackney, Haringey, Tower Hamlets and Hillingdon to apply
the EC directive - known as Tupe - which protects workers' pay and
conditions.
A review in Nalgo's favour, would, the union believes, create a precedent
which would force all local and central government departments to adhere to
the regulations.
The boroughs, which share a single computing bureau, plan to contract work
out to the private company CFM, a subsidiary of ICL, in April and not apply
the regulations.
CFM has refused to recognise Nalgo but has otherwise offered the 200 staff
identical employment terms and conditions for the transfer. American
Airlines has agreed to pay Pounds 80,000 to two unions - the TGWU general
union and the AEEU craft union - in an out-of-court settlement involving an
alleged breach of Tupe.
The airline took over the Heathrow slots and staff of TWA in July 1991 and
then offered workers new contracts without informing their unions. Under
Tupe unions have to be informed of any changes in working practices.
The Home Office yesterday announced the first contracts in the privatisation
of the prison education service but many of them have been delayed by a High
Court challenge under Tupe.
Kent County Council is seeking a judicial review of the amount of notice
given by the Home Office for the competitive tendering.

<TEXT>
FIAT-IMPRESIT, the construction and civil engineering arm of Fiat, is
reorganising its operations in Spain in a complex deal that could represent
a partial disinvestment from its Spanish activities.
Fiat-Impresit is buying a substantial stake in Construcciones Lain, one of
Spain's 10 biggest building concerns. The holding, to be taken through a
capital increase by Lain, will be 'significant, but not controlling', Fiat
said. Lain is understood to have bought Fiat-Impresit's 33 per cent share in
Hasa, the parent company of one of Spain's largest construction groups,
Huarte, yesterday.
The operation would appear to release cash for Fiat-Impresit, which is
selling a substantial stake in a large company for at most a similar-sized
participation in a smaller one.
Fiat said the deal was designed to increase co-operation between
Fiat-Impresit and Lain in the established construction business.
Fiat-Impresit will take its stake in Lain via a Pta5.4bn (Dollars 46m)
capital increase by the Spanish company. Fiat will make a public tender
offer of Pta10 each for share rights linked to the transaction.

L'AIR LIQUIDE, the French industrial gases group, increased net consolidated
profits by just over 2 per cent to FFr2.64bn (Dollars 472m) last year, from
FFr2.59bn in 1991.
The increase reflected continued growth in the group's gas interests. But it
suffered a setback in its chemical activities, mainly because of an accident
at one of its plants.
Consolidated sales fell by 5.9 per cent to FFr29.9bn last year. A big factor
in the decline was the fluctuation in exchange rates since September, it
said.

MR VOLKER Ruhe, the German defence minister once regarded as a likely heir
apparent to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, appears to be fighting for his political
life in a bitter battle over cuts in the defence budget.
Twice in the past week Mr Ruhe has been publicly humiliated by Mr Kohl after
he attacked a government decision to order new spending cuts of more than
DM860m in his DM50bn budget and to consider further cuts in troop strength.
First he was rebuked in an official statement from the Chancellor's office,
which rejected his accusation that he was facing 'the dictatorship of the
finance minister', Mr Theo Waigel. Mr Kohl said the defence cuts were agreed
by the whole cabinet.
Then he was left sitting outside a meeting of the coalition leadership in Mr
Kohl's office for more than an hour, only to be abruptly told there was no
time left to discuss the defence cuts. After he went home they discussed the
cuts after all.
Mr Ruhe, who last year won popular acclaim for attempting to pull out of the
European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) project, only to be forced to retreat in the
face of furious opposition from the German defence lobby and the British
government, has made no secret of his fury at the latest round of cuts.
Although he launched himself as defence minister last year on the promise of
delivering the 'peace dividend' to the German taxpayer, he now believes the
cuts have gone too far.
When Mr Kohl announced last weekend at the Munich security conference that
he had ordered a new review of numbers in the Bundeswehr, beyond the current
target of 370,000 men by 1995, Mr Ruhe sat in silence, looking set to
explode. That night, he appeared on Bavarian television to charge Mr Waigel
(and by implication, Mr Kohl) with high-handed dictatorship.
At stake is a drastic increase in the savings being demanded from this
year's budget, as part of the government's consolidation programme to
finance spending in east Germany. Originally set at DM300m, the sum was
suddenly raised to DM863m in order to scrap a politically unpopular move to
means test children's allowances.
Last week Mr Ruhe announced an immediate freeze on all new defence
contracts, and the cancellation of plans to buy a DM3bn aerial
reconnaissance system from the US.
'I was merely saving money I did not have in the first place,' he said
later. 'It certainly will not mean there is any extra money for the
Eurofighter.'
Mr Ruhe was promoted to the Cabinet last April after the resignation of Mr
Gerhard Stoltenberg.
He was previously secretary-general of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU),
Mr Kohl's party, and long seen as key figure in the new generation of party
leaders.
Lacking a strong grassroots base of his own - he comes from Hamburg, where
the local CDU organisation is weak - Mr Ruhe has traditionally relied on Mr
Kohl's personal support and his own considerable political wits.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Assemblee Nationale (Elections '93): Pensions dilemma gives
politicians grey hairs - Alice Rawsthorn on ageing France's growing gap
between contributions and benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Marie-Christine Revel works at a Paris stationery shop which is closing.
A widow in her late 50s, Mrs Revel has little hope of finding another job.
'I'm not worried,' she said. 'Whatever happens I'll have my pension.'
France's pension system is a point of national pride. People who retire
after 60 having worked for 37.5 years are entitled to a state pension
equivalent to 50 per cent of their average salary in their 10
highest-earning years, up to a maximum of FFr149,820 (Pounds 18,475) a year.
This means that most of France's 7.8m pensioners live in comparative
comfort, a 'fundamental right' that President Francois Mitterrand has vowed
to protect.
The system, introduced after the Second World War, is run by the state,
which pays for pensions from the money received from those in work.
But the French population is ageing. There are fewer working people
supporting more pensioners. The problem is getting worse. And it is one of
the trickiest political issues in the electoral campaign.
So far a succession of French governments has chosen to ignore the pension
problem. They have been deterred by the complexity of the issue and by the
opposition of the trade unions and the president.
The present Socialist administration has continued the tradition. An attempt
last year by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, to supplement the
state system with a private scheme was stymied by the unions. Mr Beregovoy
was forced to compromise with modest proposals for personal equity plans.
But the strains on the system are now so intense that the next government
may not be able to delay. The system already operates at an annual deficit
of FFr20bn with a ratio of 1.8 employees to each pensioner. By the year
2010, there will be just 1.4 employees for every pensioner. This means the
deficit will widen unless pensions are cut or employees' contributions
increase.
So far the treatment of the pension issue in the election campaign has shown
all the danger signs of fudge and compromise that have impeded past attempts
at reform. Mr Beregovoy last month tried again to focus the Socialists'
attention on the issue by trumpeting new proposals for reform.
The prime minister watered down his earlier ideas about introducing private
pensions into a less ambitious plan for a fund (financed by the FFr100m
proceeds of the privatisation programme) to plug the pension deficit. But
his tentative suggestion that the Socialists might consider encouraging
people to work for 40, rather than 37.5 years, met with an immediate rebuff
from President Mitterrand. He saw it as a threat to an earlier Socialist
reform that reduced the retirement age to 60.
Mr Beregovoy hastily denied that he had any intention of raising the
retirement age. But the row over the Socialists' pension policy has rumbled
on. The prime minister will begin to try to thrash out a final policy with
the unions and employers on Monday. He is also expected to revive the tricky
question of the minimum working period.
The conservative coalition of the RPR and UDF, the firm favourite to win the
election, has revelled in Mr Beregovoy's embarrassment. The right has at
least hammered out a joint pension policy, but in many respects its plans
are as vague as those of the Socialists.
The conservatives have fought shy of raising the retirement age which,
according to Mr Jacques Chirac, head of the RPR, would be 'psychologically
impossible'. But they do plan to offer incentives for people to work longer
by offering full pensions to those working for 40 years, with reduced
payments for 37.5 years.
They have also revived Mr Beregovoy's old ideas for private pension funds,
which would be welcomed by the French financial community as a needed source
of new investment for the stock market.
But this would involve persuading the French electorate to invest in their
own pensions as well as funding the current state system. Mr Edouard
Balladur, tipped as a future conservative prime minister, has suggested
softening the blow with tax cuts. 'Let's allow people to choose between
spending and saving,' he said.
But the RPR and UDF have yet to spell out how they plan to structure their
private pension proposals. All they have said is that they will commission a
study into the issue 'as soon as possible'. The French voters have heard
that before. There have, after all, already been five official studies into
France's pension problem since 1985.

<TEXT>
PRICE WATERHOUSE, the court-appointed administrators to Maxwell
Communication Corporation, yesterday filed with a New York bankruptcy court
a reorganisation plan for MCC that was accompanied by a separate filing
required by UK insolvency rules.
The filing of the proposed sale of MCC assets under Chapter 11 of US
bankruptcy law, and the filing of a scheme of arrangement under the 1985 UK
Companies Act, represents the first time that an insolvent company's
reorganisation plan has been submitted to jurisdictions in two different
countries. Price Waterhouse said the actions were 'unprecedented in
international insolvency.'
Price Waterhouse is seeking buyers for MCC's main assets, which include the
publishing house Macmillan and the Official Airlines Guide. Together they
are expected to raise at least Dollars 1.1bn.
The full details of how Price Waterhouse intends to sell the MCC assets will
be revealed in a disclosure statement to be filed in the New York court at
the end of this month.

L'OREAL, the French company that is the world's largest cosmetics group, saw
sales increase by 12.3 per cent to FFr37.57bn (Dollars 7bn) last year and
estimated that net profits grew at a faster rate.
The global market for cosmetics came under pressure last year because of the
economic squeeze in important markets, notably the US, Germany, France and
Italy.
However, L'Oreal has strong positions in a number of sectors, notably sun
products (with Ambre Solaire) and make-up (through Lancome).
L'Oreal, which made net profits of FFr2.15bn in 1991, has also pursued an
active product development programme.
Gio, the new Giorgio Armani fragrance, was one of the most successful
perfume launches in Europe last year and is now being introduced in the US.
Gio took a record Dollars 25,000 in its first three days on sale at Saks
Fifth Avenue, the New York department store.

FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Charges push ITT to Dollars 617m
loss in final term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITT, the US conglomerate, yesterday reported a fourth-quarter net loss of
Dollars 617m after one-time charges, but said net income would have been 52
per cent higher if special items were excluded.
The company announced last month that it would be taking big fourth-quarter
charges, notably one of Dollars 612m after tax at its finance subsidiary,
ITT Financial, which included large loss provisions in its domestic
unsecured consumer loan portfolio.
The fourth-quarter loss was equivalent to Dollars 4.74 a share, compared
with net income of Dollars 165m, or Dollars 1.20, in the same period last
year. Sales and revenues were Dollars 5.7bn, up from Dollars 5.4bn.
For the full year, ITT reported a loss of Dollars 885m, or Dollars 6.90 a
share, compared with restated net income of Dollars 749m, or Dollars 5.49,
in 1991. Sales and revenues totalled Dollars 21.7bn, up from Dollars 20.4bn.
The full-year figures included a Dollars 622m, or Dollars 4.71 a share, gain
from the sale of ITT's 30 per cent interest in Alcatel NV, the
telecommunications products group; a Dollars 582m, or Dollars 4.41,
third-quarter charge at the ITT Hartford insurance group; and a Dollars 580m
charge for an accounting change.
ITT Hartford reported a jump in fourth-quarter income from Dollars 90m to
Dollars 178m, in spite of lower capital gains, thanks to 'favourable
domestic casualty underwriting experience and higher north American life
operations.'
The automotive components business moved from a Dollars 7m loss to a Dollars
39m profit, which was attributed to 'higher anti-lock brake system volume
along with the favourable results of continuing cost improvement actions.'
However, ITT Financial reported heavy losses, due to the restructuring
charges, and the electronic components business reported a loss of Dollars
100m, up from Dollars 38m.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton, twice frustrated in his search for an attorney
general, last night nominated Ms Janet Reno, a criminal lawyer from Miami,
to run his Justice Department.
Ms Reno, 54, has an Ivy League education (Cornell and Harvard Law School)
and has been state prosecutor for Dade County, Florida, for 15 years.
Introducing her in the Rose Garden of the White House, Mr Clinton praised
her legal and administrative experience. He described her as 'a tough crime
fighter and a caring public servant'.
He insisted he had 'somewhat, but not entirely' wanted to appoint the first
woman attorney general but in this latest search had given 'very serious
consideration' to four male candidates before settling on Ms Reno.
She is unmarried and childless and enjoys a 'squeaky clean' reputation in
Miami. In response to the inevitable question, she asserted that she had
never hired illegal immigrants and had paid all appropriate taxes.
Ms Zoe Baird, first nominated by Mr Clinton, withdrew after disclosing she
had broken the law in employing two illegal immigrants as household help.
Judge Kimba Wood, top of the president's next short list but not nominated,
also backed out because of controversy over her nanny.
Ms Reno appears to bring to bear some qualifications lacked by both Ms
Baird, predominantly a corporate lawyer with no trial experience, and Judge
Wood, appointed to the federal bench by President Reagan and best known for
presiding over the trial of Mr Michael Milken, the Wall Street financier.
She has been, by all accounts, an extremely successful court attorney, with
a number of notable criminal convictions under her belt in cases involving
child abuse, sexual harassment and racial discrimination. She said yesterday
that she was 'personally opposed' to capital punishment, which Mr Clinton
supports, but had sought the death penalty in some of the cases she had
prosecuted.
She runs a 900-strong department in Miami, handling, Mr Clinton said,
120,000 cases a year, and thus has the administrative experience less
evident in the other two. She has also been active in various local drug
prevention programmes. These qualities should appeal to the Senate judiciary
committee when it considers her nomination.
Her political connections also seem far stronger than those of Ms Baird and
Judge Wood, both largely unknown to the Democratic party.

FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: London and Manchester expansion
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London and Manchester Group, the life insurance and financial services
company, yesterday announced it had acquired a car hire purchase company
which will allow it to expand its distribution network for insurance
products.
London and Manchester recently reduced its existing tied agency network to
weed out sales agents with low performance or poor persistency. As a result,
its new annual premium business has fallen in recent months.
The group said it paid Pounds 100,000 in cash for the subsidiary of
Provident Financial. Financing for the unit, whose auto loans portfolio is
valued at Pounds 26.3m, will be achieved through a Pounds 22.1m non-recourse
loan from Union Bank of Switzerland and Pounds 4.1m provided directly by
London and Manchester on a subordinated basis.
Mr Martin Jackson, group finance director, said that the new company will be
merged into Welcome Financial Services, London and Manchester's consumer
lending division, which also acts as a tied agent selling insurance products
to Welcome borrowers.
In recent years, some 25 per cent of Welcome's existing client base have
purchased other London and Manchester products from sales agents and it is
expected that the new car hire purchase customer base will provide a similar
level of cross-product selling, Mr Jackson said.
The new subsidiary has an existing client list of 14,000 who have purchased
used cars through dealers. Of these, 80 per cent live in areas serviced by
London and Manchester sales agents.

Ryanair, the independent Irish airline, reported after-tax profits of
IPounds 850,000 (Pounds 885,000) for 1992 on turnover of IPounds 50.1m.
The outcome marks the second successive year of profitability for the
airline since it was set up in May 1986. Ryanair had accumulated losses of
IPounds 20m up to 1990.
Mr Conor Hayes, chief executive, said the improved performance resulted from
the closure of the loss-making regional routes from Ireland to the UK, the
disposal of its turboprop aircraft and the introduction of a new competitive
fare structure with a 'no-frills' service on its principal Dublin-Stansted
route.

FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Net asset value growth at Pantheon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the six months to December 31 the net asset value of Pantheon
International Participations advanced from 139.7p to 177.7p. A year earlier
the value was 120.5p.
Mr Tom Griffin, chairman, said part of the increase was caused by the agreed
takeover of a direct investment, Womens Federal Savings &amp; Loan, at a
significantly enhanced value, and the strength of the dollar.
However, because of a redemption of loan stock and a number of large
investments, there was an overall reduction in cash balances and accordingly
a lower level of income. That resulted in a net loss for the six months of
Pounds 57,000 (Pounds 241,000 profits). Losses per share amounted to 0.39p
(1.65p earnings).

<TEXT>
Black &amp; Edgington, the USM-quoted manufacturer and supplier of tubular
steelwork, incurred a loss before tax of Pounds 2.9m for the year to
end-July 1992 against a restated deficit of Pounds 8.83m.
Of this, continuing operations were responsible for a deficit of Pounds
231,000 (Pounds 4.35m). Discontinued operations lost Pounds 1.97m (Pounds
2.98m) and interest payable took Pounds 698,000 (Pounds 1.49m).
The result was struck on turnover of Pounds 9.48m (Pounds 11.3m) of which
Pounds 8.43m (Pounds 9.17m) stemmed from continuing operations.
Losses per share were 0.57p (3.98p).
Mr David Gordon, chairman, said the figures indicated a return to profit in
the second half, where there was an overall profit of Pounds 1.28m (losses
Pounds 400,000).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LOUIS Newmark, the Surrey-based watch merchanting, engineering and
specialist equipment group, tumbled further into the red in its half year to
October 3.
On turnover down 13 per cent to Pounds 10.7m (Pounds 12.2m), partly
reflecting the loss of the Swatch agency in June 1991, the pre-tax deficit
increased to Pounds 993,000 against Pounds 187,000 in the comparable period.
Turnover in continuing activities dipped by 1.6 per cent.
The outcome was struck after interest charges increased to Pounds 531,000
(Pounds 62,000) as a result of the decision to cease capitalising interest
on the group's investment in access control systems.
Losses per share were 33.5p (6.3p).
The directors said the second half would be materially better than the first
and next year should show continuing recovery.
The company is in discussions with a third party with a view to their making
a capital injection.

FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: EFM Dragon bids for Drayton Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EFM DRAGON Trust, an Asian investment trust managed by Edinburgh Fund
Managers, has made a bid for Drayton Asia Trust, a similar concern managed
by Invesco MIM which is almost twice its size.
Invesco MIM did not comment on the bid, which follows last year's payment of
Pounds 9.5m in compensation to shareholders in another investment trust,
Drayton Consolidated.
The bid is for the whole of Drayton Asia's share capital and warrants. The
terms are complex, and involve EFM Dragon offering to issue ordinary shares
at fully diluted net asset value in exchange for Drayton Asia's ordinary
shares at a rate equivalent to 96.4 per cent of the latter's formula asset
value. EFM Dragon is also offering to issue three 2005 warrants for every
Drayton Asia warrant.
Mr Iain Watt, EFM's managing director, said the aim was to increase EFM
Dragon's size, making it the largest UK investment trust for Asia, and
benefit from economies of scale.
He pointed out that EFM's share price performance has been better than
Drayton Asia's, with growth over the three years to the beginning of this
month of 35.43 per cent, compared with growth of only 0.79 per cent by
Drayton Asia, according to Micropal.
EFM is also offering to pay half of the compensation fees to Invesco MIM for
loss of the management contract. The other half, equivalent to two year's
notice, would come from Drayton Asia shareholders.
EFM claims irrevocable undertakings from 13.6 per cent of Drayton Asia's
issued share capital and 1.6 per cent of the warrants. It had received
letters of intent from 21.4 per cent of the share capital and 16.5 per cent
of the warrants.

FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Forte to refinance short-term debt via
Pounds 200m debenture issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTE, the hotels group, is raising Pounds 200m in the first large debenture
issue in the UK for a year and a half.
The long-dated secured bonds are being used to extend the maturity of the
group's debt, and to take advantage of low long-term interest rates, said Mr
Donald Main, finance director.
'Corporates will face increasing competition for funds with the very large
(UK) government borrowing requirement.'
The money is being used to refinance part of the group's Pounds 940m of
short-term facilities, Pounds 350m of which is covered by a multiple option
facility which falls due next year. The company has Pounds 620m drawn under
these facilities, said Mr Main.
The bonds, which carry a coupon of 10 per cent and mature in 2018, are
secured on 11 of the group's hotels around the UK, including the Waldorf in
London. Only Pounds 20m of the group's other assets have been used to secure
borrowing.
The bonds were priced yesterday to give investors a yield 1.15 percentage
points above the nearest comparable gilt, the 8.75 per cent stock due 2017.
At that level they offer less than a similar Pounds 200m issue from Queens
Moat Houses, which yields 1.35 points more than the gilt.
However, the shortage of new long-dated corporate bonds recently prompted
good reported demand for the bonds, which came mainly from UK insurance
companies and pension funds looking to match the maturity of their
liabilities to long-dated assets.
The issue comes less than a week after investors received Pounds 120m from
the early repayment of a Pounds 130m debenture from London &amp; Provincial, the
first secured issue in recent memory to repay below par.
Some of this cash is thought to have been reinvested in the Forte issue,
helping to create demand.

FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: French affair that ended in radio silence -
Crown Communications was enthusiastic about its investment in the RFM
network, but the move eventually led to its demise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOBODY REALISED it at the time, but the high point for Crown Communications
and Mr Christopher Chataway, its chairman, came early in 1989.
On February 6 Crown came top of the Financial Times Leaders and Laggards
charts for 1988 with a rise in its share price for the year of no less than
409 per cent.
In an 18-month period the shares had gone from 40p to a peak of 274p and
Crown made pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.25m in the 12 months to September
1989.
A few weeks later Mr Chataway, a former Conservative minister, enthused
about the opportunities in France as Crown bought into RFM, an emerging
French commercial radio network.
It was the beginning of the end for Crown, darling of the Unlisted
Securities Market, owner of LBC, the London talk station and a company with
stakes in more than a dozen other UK radio stations and a rapidly expanding
television business.
'A great mistake was made in France and in the end that proved fatal,' says
Mr Chataway, talking in detail for the first time of the nightmare which led
to Crown's receivership last month with debts of Pounds 16m.
Mr Chataway, who is also chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, adds: 'It
was France that brought the company down. The original investment was a bad
one.'
He happily admits that both he and Mr David Haynes, chief executive, were
enthusiastic for the venture at the time.
The Crown chairman believes that they got 90 per cent of the analysis right.
It was then or never for an outside investor.
Networks were beginning to emerge from the chaos of French commercial radio
with its thousands of competing stations. There was serious money to be
made.
In fact there were disastrous flaws in the analysis, which Mr Chataway
readily admits.
'We weren't equipped to deal with the French broadcasting environment.
Despite thousands of stations it is quite a closed world.'
It was difficult selling advertising as an independent competing against
large groups such as Europe or NRJ. They never, he says, found a manager
really capable of effectively running a French radio station. On top of that
the ever changing French regulatory system was a quagmire.
'You may be in the radio business and have people who understand radio, but
radio is a much more national business.' says Mr Chataway.
In short they made virtually every mistake in the book.
Less than 18 months after taking managerial control of the network, which
has 114 stations either owned or affiliated, Crown compounded its errors.
By the summer of 1990 the company had started to realise what a mess it was
getting into and asked Lazard Freres, the merchant bank, to seek a buyer.
The search, never to be consummated, further underlined the radio network's
stability.
'In retrospect what one ought to have done was close it down - if one had
known how long the recession was going to last in the UK and therefore the
pressures one was going to be under,' says Mr Chataway.
Mr Patrick Meyer, founder of RFM, is scathing about the Crown management.
He sold 35 per cent of his stake to Crown, 30 per cent went to Credit Mutuel
d'Artois et de Picardie and he retained the rest. Crown, however, took full
managerial control and equally full responsibility for both development
costs and losses.
'They didn't know the job and they can't blame anyone else. They changed
formats all the time. They did everything wrong from the beginning,' says Mr
Meyer, who now lives in Arizona.
Apart from changing formats, Mr Meyer claims that Crown:
Spent money unnecessarily, advertising the station before the format had
settled down
Installed a production studio when there were plenty in Paris to hire
Misjudged the Conseil Superieur de l'Audiovisuel, the French broadcasting
authority, and how it was likely to react.
'They have been very incompetent, which is sad because the people are fair.
David Haynes seemed to be the person who knew what he wanted. He brought
people together. He was very very very sure of himself. I think Mr Chataway
had a more humble approach,' said Mr Meyer, who plans to approach the French
receiver to buy his network back.
Soon after the RFM acquisition Crown encountered a series of difficulties,
aggravated by the recession.
The merger of BSB with Sky meant the end of a lucrative television news
contract. The move to new headquarters at Hammersmith, London - inevitable
because the company's existing central London lease was running out -
increased costs.
It also took a lot longer than expected to cope with the split of AM and FM
frequencies to create two separate services.
LBC, however, is not in receivership and has floated free of the Crown
debris after a financial restructuring.
Mr Chataway and other Crown directors insist that without RFM Crown could
have coped with its other problems and survived the recession.
Instead the company spent much of the past two years selling its remaining
radio stakes in the UK to service debt and losses, while increasingly
despairing attempts were made to sell the RFM holding.
They ran into a brick wall last month when the CSA turned down a sale to a
consortium that included the rival network NRJ and Mr Alain Ayache, owner of
Le Meilleur magazine.
The CSA issued a bitter statement accusing Crown of taking control of 70 per
cent of the capital of the company without permission and failing to
distribute 21 per cent to the staff and management as promised.
Crown denies this, says the CSA was fully informed at every stage and hints
at darker French political machinations.
The sale of RFM was turned down, Crown believes, partly at least because of
heavy lobbying from rivals who wanted to make sure NRJ did not get its hands
on another network.
Mr Chataway says that he informed Mr Jacques Boutet, the CSA president, in a
letter on February 4 that Crown no longer intended to sell 21 per cent to
management and that the shares were still in the name of Mr Patrick Meyer.
Who precisely controlled RFM has been a thorny issue from the outset. The
agreement between Crown and Mr Meyer was confidential.
Both Mr Chataway and Mr Meyer insist that Mr Meyer did indeed own the shares
he said he owned, rather than merely holding them on behalf of Crown.
Mr Meyer also emphasised that Credit Mutuel always acted like real
shareholders, taking an active part in board meetings.
Mr Chataway says all the shareholder agreements were drawn up by
Freshfields, Crown's Paris lawyers, and were given to Price Waterhouse, the
company's auditors, and summaried in the annual report.
It is believed that the confidential shareholder agreements provided for
Crown to acquire more shares from Mr Meyer in due course, where this was
permitted by the CSA.
What has the debacle cost the Crown chairman? His investment of Pounds
170,000 was once worth Pounds 2m on paper and now is worth nothing.
'I don't suppose anyone benefits from being associated with a company that
goes into receivership. But I am certain I was right to stay on. If I had
left at that point (when the problems began) I could have rightly been
criticised for leaving a sinking ship,' says Mr Chataway, who has decided to
step down as LBC chairman.
Mr Chataway, who speaks serviceable French, declares himself still a
Francophile - though he is no longer much of a fan of French radio.

FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Crest returns to the black with Pounds 2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREST NICHOLSON, the Surrey-based housebuilder, commercial developer and
construction group, moved back into profit in the year to October 31,
reflecting improved performances in all three divisions.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.03m compared with losses of Pounds 59.4m in the
previous year when the group made exceptional provisions of Pounds 39.8m to
cover the write-down of its residential and commercial land and developments
because of falling property prices.
At the operating level the group swung from losses of Pounds 7m to profits
of Pounds 9.47m. Turnover declined to Pounds 238.2m, a fall of 27 per cent
on the previous year's Pounds 324.2m.
The pre-tax figure was struck after interest charges of Pounds 7.44m (Pounds
12.6m) reflecting a decline in both average borrowings and interest rates.
Net borrowings at end-October of Pounds 62.7m (Pounds 54.7m) represented
gearing of 59.6 per cent (50.6 per cent).
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 2.93m mainly related to the sale of the
loss-making En-tout-cas sports surface and leisure business last year.
Losses per share worked through at 0.13p (55.67p) and the company is again
paying a nominal 0.01p dividend.
Commenting on the results Mr John St Lawrence, chairman, said the improved
per-formance demonstrated the benefits of the group's determination to
concentrate on core businesses.
However, both he and Mr John Callcutt, chief executive, cautioned that the
market remained 'extremely tough' and that the first half results this year
were likely to be below those of last year.
For 1991-92 the core residential division reported flat turnover of Pounds
121.2m (Pounds 120.9m) and an operating profit of Pounds 7.8m (Pounds 6.4m
loss) while the absence of write-downs enabled the division to record a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 4.8m (Pounds 47.2m loss).
The division sold a record 1,465 (1,435) units last year at an average price
of Pounds 76,000 (Pounds 78,000). The margin on house sales increased from 7
per cent to 16 per cent.
The property and construction divisions also recorded modest operating
profits last year despite declining turnover.
The construction division made an increased pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.9m
(Pounds 1.5m) while the property division managed to substantially reduce
its pre-tax loss from Pounds 12.4m to Pounds 2.3m.
COMMENT
The new management team has refocused the group and pointed it towards
recovery, but it remains an uphill struggle. It is taking longer than
expected to find tenants for the completed commercial portfolio, which will
then be sold to reduce borrowings. In the meantime, bank facilities of
Pounds 151.5m look more than adequate. Despite renewed signs of life in the
housing market, the management remains cautious. Construction margins are
under pressure and the property division remains becalmed at best. Interim
results are likely to be disappointing and full year profits of Pounds 2m
are likely again. The management, and the market, are looking to 1994 for
any real improvement. In the meantime those looking for housing recovery
stocks can find purer plays.

FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Industrial Control Services improves 30% to
Pounds 2.37m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL Control Services Group, the electronic safety systems
manufacturer which obtained a listing last May, yesterday reported a 30 per
cent increase in interim pre-tax profits.
For the six months to November 30 profits rose from Pounds 1.82m to Pounds
2.37m. Earnings per share increased to 3.82p (3.47p) out of which an interim
dividend of 1.33p will be paid.
Turnover edged ahead to Pounds 30.1m (Pounds 29.9m), as did operating
margins which improved to 9.1 (8.7) per cent. Operating profit, including
Pounds 142,000 (Pounds 30,000) of foreign exchange gains, was Pounds 2.73m
(Pounds 2.62m).
The group also benefited from interest savings arising from the flotation
proceeds and interest rate cuts during the period. Interest charges fell to
Pounds 357,000 (Pounds 805,000).
Mr Peter Hall, chairman and chief executive, said that although the global
economic position continued to affect adversely the rate of investment in
ICS's markets, 'increased safety and efficiency standards in the oil and gas
industries continue to create opportunities for retrofit projects for the
group.'
He said continued focus on reducing costs had ensured that both margins and
competitive position had been maintained which had enabled ICS to invest in
a strong sales operation in the Middle East.

MERIVALE MOORE, a property company, has won several million pounds as a
settlement of its four-year dispute over the collapse of a building in
Battersea.
The company took legal action against Royal Insurance, Commercial Union,
Bovis, Fairclough and Grove Consultants, a subsidiary of Wimpey. The size of
the final settlement will depend on the resolution of a related dispute with
another insurance company.
The dispute concerned a 45,000 sq ft building at Ransomes Dock, near Albert
Bridge in Battersea, that was being converted into flats and offices. In
January 1989, a wall collapsed after the building's sub-structure was
weakened by nearby construction work.
Mr Granville Dean, chairman, said that the settlement would have a healthy
impact on the company's net assets. At the last year end, on June 30 1992,
it had net assets of Pounds 10m and borrowings of Pounds 40m.
Two thirds of Merivale Moore's business is concerned with commercial
property, particularly an office campus in Cambridge. It also owns flats in
London's St Johns Wood.

FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Motor World shares hit 275p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trading in Motor World Group, the car parts and accessories retailer, got
off to a racing start yesterday when the shares jumped to 275p, a
substantial premium to the 210p at which 45.3 per cent of the group's equity
had been placed.
Beeson Gregory, the stockbroker, placed 5.97m ordinary shares, valuing the
group at Pounds 27.7m, but last night's close gave the group a market
capitalisation of Pounds 36m.
The shares started trading at 259p, and dealers said interest from private
clients was behind the heavy turnover.
Motor World now has 180 outlets.

FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Rothmans to merge Far East tobacco
interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROTHMANS International plans to merge its tobacco interests in Malaysia,
Singapore and Hong Kong into a single regional company to strengthen its
attack on the Far East's developing cigarette markets.
The move would provide the new company, Rothmans of Pall Mall, capitalised
at more than Pounds 1bn, with cash resources and management expertise to
accelerate the exploitation of cigarette markets in China, Vietnam, Japan,
South Korea and Taiwan.
In what Lord Swaythling, Rothmans International chairman, described
yesterday as a 'constructive reconstruction,' the group would integrate its
wholly owned Hong Kong-based interests with the operations in Malaysia and
Singapore in which the group has a 50 per cent stake.
The new company, with ownership equally divided between Rothmans
International and public shareholders, would have an estimated Pounds 242m
cash - currently held by the Malaysian and Singapore companies - to develop
production, sales and distribution in the growth markets.
Mr Nyren Scott-Malden, analyst at BZW, said yesterday: 'This is a clever
plan which would bring more coherence to the Far East operations. It would
enable the group to use the cash built up in the mature markets of Malaysia
and Singapore to exploit the biggest growth markets in the world.'
The Hong Kong subsidiary has rights to the markets in China, which accounts
for a third of world cigarette consumption with 1,700bn cigarettes a year,
Japan (320bn), South Korea (96bn), Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Singapore
company has access to markets in Thailand, with consumption of 40bn
cigarettes a year, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Burma.
Rothmans International has already invested heavily in the Hong Kong-based
development. Trading losses of Pounds 16m, reflecting the establishment of
distribution networks and marketing costs, were written off last year.
Lord Swaythling said: 'It takes a long time to turn developing markets into
profit. We believe that this plan would quicken the process by using the
full management and cash resources available in the region.'
The merger will require the approval of public shareholders who hold 50 per
cent of the Malaysian and Singapore companies, as well as that of regulatory
authorities in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia.
Establishment of the new organisation, to be incorporated in Bermuda and
managed from Hong Kong, is expected to take at least nine months. The
company would seek listings on the Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore
stock exchanges.
Directors would be drawn mainly from the present Malaysian and Singapore
boards and regional executives would play an active role in developing the
group.
Rothmans Malaysia, capitalised at MDollars 3bn (Pounds 800m), made pre-tax
profits last year of MDollars 326.6m on sales of MDollars 1.1bn Rothmans
Singapore achieved pre-tax profits of SDollars 48.3m (Pounds 20m) on sales
of SDollars 161m in the nine months to March 1992. It is capitalised at
SDollars 750m.
Rothmans International said yesterday that the merger would result in some
initial dilution in the earnings attributable to public shareholders in the
present Far East companies but should enhance the potential for future
growth.
'The expected financial strength of the new company would be such to
indicate that a higher pay-out of dividends should be appropriate in
future,' it added.

FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Six MPs support Airtours' bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX MPs have supported Airtours in a parliamentary early day motion, hitting
back at a larger group of MPs who last week called for the holiday company's
bid for Owners Abroad to be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
The MPs, led by Mr Barry Porter, Conservative MP for Wirral South,
congratulated Airtours on its 'innovative practices'.
The cross-party motion said the proposed acquisition would benefit consumers
and would bring a wider selection of affordable holiday destinations
departing from regional airports.
The name of Mr Gordon Oakes, Labour MP for Halton, initially appeared on
both the motion calling for referral to the MMC and the motion supporting
Airtours.
Mr Oakes is understood to be completely in favour of the takeover. A
signature purporting to be his is understood to have been placed on an order
paper at the Commons Table Office saying he was in favour of the motion
calling for referral. His name has now been withdrawn from that motion.
Yesterday Owners Abroad's shares rose 3p to 118p while Airtours slipped 1p
to 280p as the market moved towards the belief that the bid would not be
referred.

FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Lonrho tumbles 61% to Pounds 80m - Net
borrowings cut to Pounds 849m and likely to be further reduced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO, the international trading group, reported a 61 per cent fall in
pre-tax profits for the year to September 30 1992, in line with the forecast
made before its recent rights issue.
Profits before tax fell from Pounds 205m to Pounds 80m on reduced sales of
Pounds 3.87bn (Pounds 4.85bn).
Profits before extraordinary items fell from Pounds 90m to Pounds 8m.
Net borrowings have fallen from Pounds 1.09bn to Pounds 849m because of
minority investment in group businesses and the sale of subsidiaries and
assoc-iates.
Last year the government controlled Libyan Arab Finance Company purchased a
one third stake in the Metropole Hotels for Pounds 177.5m.
Without the disposals and minority investments net debt would have
increased, mainly because of the high capital expenditure running at Pounds
182m (Pounds 237m).
At the time of the rights issue Lonrho said net debt had risen to Pounds
947m.
This has now fallen after the Pounds 124m sale of VAG, the UK importer of
Volkswagen and Audi cars, and the cash call.
The bulk of the group's bank loans are due within one to five years.
Mr Dieter Bock, the German financier who was recently appointed joint chief
executive with Mr Tiny Rowland, said the group was committed to further
reducing borrowings through minor disposals.
Net interest payable amounted to Pounds 99m (Pounds 112m). A further Pounds
21m (Pounds 27m) was capitalised during the period.
The 1991 figures were adjusted to take account of the group's decision to
eliminate the 'intangible' value of Pounds 117m of its remaining newspaper
title, The Obser-ver.
The separate businesses reported the following pre-tax profits: motor and
equipment distribution Pounds 14m (Pounds 32m); general trade Pounds 14m
(Pounds 35m); manufacturing Pounds 3m (Pounds 6m); mineral extraction and
refining Pounds 29m (Pounds 77m); leisure Pounds 3m (Pounds 13m); financial
services Pounds 4m (Pounds 23m) and agriculture Pounds 13m (Pounds 19m).
The tax charge for the year fell from Pounds 63m to Pounds 38m because of
the fall in profits and the sale of VAG.
Net assets per share, adjusted for the rights issue and the sale of VAG,
were 157p.
Earnings per share fell from 13.9p to 1.2p and a recommended final divided
of 2p brings the total for the year to 4p (13p).
COMMENT
Lonrho's only real surprise was that it published a set of figures which
contained no surprises. The City has come to expect the worst from Lonrho
and was therefore relieved that the group's results were no more
disappointing than its own forecast of last year. This mainly explains the
7p rise in the shares which closed at 82p. But the figures are not a cause
of celebration. In terms of fundamentals nothing has changed. Profit before
tax fell in all the group's activities and geographical areas. It will take
a significant rise in the price of gold and platinum before mineral
extraction and refining profits return to previous levels. With forecast
pre-tax profits of about Pounds 100m, giving earnings per share of 3p, the
shares are on a pros-pective multiple of 27, which reflects the collapse in
profits.

FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Exchange rate gains behind rise at BOC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOC, the industrial gases and healthcare group, reported a 13 per increase
in first quarter profits, helped by gains on translation into sterling.
The company said that while the increase was in line with expectations, the
quarterly comparison would not be indicative of trends during the remainder
of the year.
Pre-tax profits for the three months to December 31 rose from Pounds 80.1m
to Pounds 90.8m on sales up 9 per cent at Pounds 776.8m.
Earnings per share rose 11 per cent to 11.81p.
Using constant exchange rates, BOC said its operating profit after interest
would have increased by only 6 per cent instead of the reported 12 per cent
increase to Pounds 89.7m.
The health care division improved sharply, with operating profit rising 42
per cent to Pounds 32.5m on sales up 27 per cent at Pounds 152m.
BOC said this improvement followed aggressive restructuring, a more regular
sales pattern than last year and the benefit of dollar exchange rate
movements.
In the gases division, operating profit edged ahead from Pounds 72.7m to
Pounds 73.8m on sales up 8 per cent to Pounds 545.3m. The increase in
operating profit in North America was partly offset by a fall in operating
margin and profit in Europe.
The company warned that the expiry of the patent protection for Forane
anaesthetic pharmaceutical would begin to affect the health care business
during the year.
Mr Patrick Rich, chairman, said there were few signs of better trading
conditions. 'We are fairly optimistic about prospects in the US, but in some
parts of the world the conditions deteriorated further during the first
quarter.'

FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Union Discount in talks on its future
ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION DISCOUNT, the discount house group which was the subject of a bid
approach late last year, is now discussing a merger with another specialist
operator in the short-term money market, it emerged yesterday.
Union, under chief executive Mr George Blunden, has been fighting to rebuild
its core money market businesses since a disastrous diversification into
leasing and property lending in the 1980s. The group's share price slipped
from a high of 500p in 1990 to only a tenth of that value before the bid
approach, and yesterday remained steady at 100p.
In a statement after the market closed, Union said that talks about its
future ownership were continuing, but that they 'may be resolved by a number
of possible structures.'
These include a takeover, a merger with another company or an offer for the
other company. The announcement is thought to indicate that Union is in
merger talks with another specialist money market group, although a bid is
still possible.
Directors of Cater Allen, the money broker which owns 3 per cent of Union
and whose name has been most often mentioned as the potential bidder, could
not be contacted for comment yesterday evening.

FT  12 FEB 93 / GM improves in fourth quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors yesterday reported improved fourth quarter results from its
troubled North American car business, but also announced a Dollars 23.5bn
(Pounds 15.5bn) loss for 1992, largely because of a non-cash change in
accounting principles.
The net loss for the year was the largest ever recorded by a US company but
was discounted by Wall Street, which focused instead on the group's
encouraging fourth quarter figures.
GM had fourth quarter income before special items of Dollars 273.3m, or 10
cents a share, compared with Wall Street expectations of a loss of up to 50
cents a share and its loss of Dollars 520m in the same period of last year.
Analysts said the figures boded well for improved 1993 profits and GM's
shares closed up Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 40 1/2 .
GM said North America lost Dollars 4.5bn in 1992 before interest, tax and
special items, down from Dollars 7.9bn in 1991.
The full year loss of Dollars 23.5bn, or Dollars 38.28 a share, included a
previously announced Dollars 20.8bn charge for the change in accounting for
retirees health benefits.
All sizeable US companies face this accounting change, but GM's charge is by
far the largest, because of the size of the business and the age of its
workforce.
In the fourth quarter, the loss was Dollars 966m, down from Dollars 1.27bn a
year earlier.
Mr Jack Smith, chief executive, said the company had enjoyed strong positive
cash flow in the quarter and continued to aim for the 'aggressive but
achievable' goal of break-even in North America in 1993, before interest,
taxes and retiree health expenses.
The company is restructuring to return its North American vehicle operations
to profit. This involves factory closures, staff cuts, new working practices
and a reduction in money-losing sales to bolster market share.
GM expects the highly prof-itable European market to weaken.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Trafalgar House in Pounds 204.5m rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFALGAR House yesterday announced a one-for-two rights issue at 60p to
raise Pounds 204.5m, and warned of further property write-downs.
The ordinary and A shares of the construction, property and shipping group
fell by 12p and 11p to close at 76 1/2 p and 75p respectively.
Only months after the group unveiled massive write-downs for 1992 it warned
that another Pounds 120m of exceptional losses and write-downs may be
required by the year ending September 30. The total dividend is to be cut
from 6p to 3.25p. Since the year-end net borrowings have risen from Pounds
352.6m to Pounds 580.3m, reflecting the effect of the devaluation of
sterling on the translation of US borrowings.
Mr Allan Gormly, chief executive, denied that Trafalgar had been 'forced' to
raise cash. He said the group had decided to take advantage of the support
of its biggest shareholder, Hongkong Land, the Jardine Matheson-controlled
property company, which recently lifed its stake to 20.1 per cent and has
pledged to take up its rights.
Robert Fleming, the merchant bank advising Hongkong Land, is underwriting
the balance of the issue, after putting the idea to Trafalgar. Under the
terms of the issue, Hongkong Land has the right to increase its holding to
27.2 per cent. It plans to take it to 29.9 per cent. But in the absence of a
bid from a third party it has agreed until April 1, 1994, not to make a full
offer for the company. A second of its directors, Sir Charles Powell, will
be appointed to Trafalgar's board at the beginning of April.
Trafalgar will accelerate its withdrawal from the US commercial property
market and reschedule the development of its principal UK commercial
property projects. It recently realised Pounds 21m from the sale of
properties.
The group's borrowing covenants require it to maintain adjusted share
capital and reserves of at least Pounds 500m. Following the rights issue and
taking account of the expected property write-downs, pro-forma adjusted
share capital and reserves would be Pounds 612.6m.
Trafalgar has renegotiated the ratio of adjusted profits it is required to
meet under the US notes, which have a nominal value of Dollars 225m (Pounds
149m), to allow it to borrow more.

<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecom's third-quarter profits before tax were down on last year
and below City expectations but analysts were satisfied with a sound
performance in a difficult economic climate.
The shares rose 4p to 412p, roughly in line with the rise in the market
yesterday.
Mr Iain Vallance, BT chairman, said a slight improvement in inland call
volume in the second quarter had been maintained but warned: 'The economic
outlook remains difficult while competition and regulation continue to exert
pressure on our performance.' Profit before tax was Pounds 705m, a 7.1 per
cent fall from Pounds 759m for the same period last year. Profit before tax
for the first nine months of the year was Pounds 1.73bn, down 26.9 per cent
on last year's Pounds 2.37bn.
Analysts had been expecting between Pounds 720m and Pounds 750m for the
quarter but were surprised by an exceptional charge of Pounds 56m for the
premium paid on the repurchase in December last year of government-held
bonds.
They had also overestimated the cost to the company of restructuring in the
quarter which was Pounds 17m rather than the Pounds 60m anticipated.
Earnings per share were 7.2p for the third quarter, 12.3 per cent down on
last year, and 17.3p for nine months, 32.4 per cent down.
Turnover of Pounds 3.28bn for three months and of Pounds 9.81bn for nine
months was essentially flat compared with last year.
It refused to comment on rumours that it was negotiating to take a stake in
Electronic Data Systems, the computing services arm of General Motors.
Inland telephone call revenues were almost static in the nine-month period
but grew 1.2 per cent in the third quarter.
Capital spending in the nine-month period fell to Pounds 1.51bn from Pounds
1.75bn a year ago; in the three months it fell from Pounds 575m to Pounds
561m suggesting the organisation is keeping a tight grip on spending.
Analysts are maintaining pre-tax profit estimates for the full year at
Pounds 2.55bn.

FT  12 FEB 93 / BP upbeat as cost-cutting reduces debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum said yes-terday that its stringent cost-cutting measures
adopted to tackle its huge debt burden were beginning to show up in the
company's results. At the same time, BP has managed to arrest its large cash
haemorrhage in spite of extremely difficult market conditions.
In an upbeat presentation yesterday, Mr David Simon, group chief executive,
said: 'There are signs we are following the track we chose in the middle of
last year more confidently now.' He was referring to targets set for the
company to make profits of Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) by 1995 and pay down
its debt at the rate of Dollars 1bn a year.
Under the new FRS 3 accounting rules, BP reported a loss for 1992 of Pounds
352m on a replacement cost basis - which strips out the losses and gains
from stockholding - after a restructuring charge of Pounds 994m. Net profit
a year earlier was Pounds 1.035bn under both new and old accounting
standards.
But fourth-quarter profit more than doubled from the previous year and the
company had a net cash inflow in the final quarter of Pounds 135m. This
compares with outflows of Pounds 607m for the full year and Pounds 1.14bn in
1991.
The company said it would pay a dividend of 2.1p for the final quarter,
making a full year payout of 10.5p, down 37.5 per cent from 16.8p in 1991.
The loss per share was 8.5p against earnings of 7.7p in 1991.
Lord Ashburton, the company's chairman said: 'The company is occupied with
reaching the targets it set itself and only then will it look at increasing
the dividend.'
Mr Fergus McLeod, oil analyst at NatWest Securities, said the figures showed
some evidence that the pain the company was going through was worthwhile.
'It's encouraging, it suggests that what is being done on costs is having
some positive impact on the bottom line.'
The company has cut 14,500 jobs and will restrict capital expenditure to
Dollars 5bn this year from Dollars 6.1bn last year.
But in spite of paying down almost Dollars 1bn of the company's Dollars
15.3bn debt burden, BP's debt to equity ratio rose to almost 100 per cent
following the devaluation of sterling - most of the company's debt is
denominated in dollars.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Bank shares set to shake off their dowdy reputation: Why the
banking sector is now seen as a bet on recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British banks have three audiences to please: customers, staff and
shareholders. In the past 18 months, they have angered customers by raising
charges, and dismayed staff by cutting jobs. But these failures have been
balanced by a remarkable resurgence in how shareholders regard them.
As the banks' full-year results season opens today with Lloyds expected to
announce increased pre-tax profits of about Pounds 700m, the banks are close
to shaking off 20 years of share underperformance. The sector may hit parity
with the FT-A All-Share this year for the first time since 1976.
This is partly because of the addition of HSBC Holdings to the sector
following the takeover of the Midland Bank by the Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation last year. Brokers calculate that the sector's ratio to
the All-Share would drop from yesterday's 93 per cent to about 83 without
HSBC.
But it also reflects a feeling that the worst of the bank's poor
profitability since their peak in 1988 is behind them, and they are largely
recovery stocks. Banks are expected to benefit further if Britain has
entered a period of low interest rates, because loan risks will be reduced.
Shares have risen strongly since the interim results on hopes that full-year
operating profits will reflect concerted efforts to cut costs, and raise
income from sources other than loans. Banks' profitability has also been
helped by the widening of loan margins as base rates have fallen.
This optimism seems strange in view of the size of provisions for bad and
doubtful debts on lending in the 1980s. SG Warburg Securities expects a
total bad debt charge of Pounds 6.3bn for Barclays, Lloyds, National
Westminster, HSBC, Abbey National and Standard Chartered.
But Mr Nick Collier, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, says bad debts are
largely on a downward cycle while rises in pre-tax profits this year will
reflect a long-term strengthening of operating profitability. Banks are
expected to approach their 1988 level of return on capital by 1995.
Results will depend on the two factors. A shrinking balance sheet is
expected to cut profits before provisions at Lloyds, but also to reduce its
bad debt charge. Barclays is expected to disclose a rise in operating
profits on March 4, but is set to be taken into loss by a higher debt charge
of more than Pounds 2bn.
Barclays' bad debt charge will attract the most criticism. The bank has
suffered from appearing not to make provisions early enough compared with
National Westminster. Mr Julian Robins, an analyst at BZW, argues that it
could still be underprovided by about Pounds 1bn despite the rise.
Abbey National's bad debt charge is expected to double to around Pounds 320m
because its lending is still largely based in the depressed residential
housing market. Abbey's provisions will also reflect bad loans in France and
Spain - a common theme in continental lending.
For other banks, operating income and costs will be the focus of attention.
The most important element of income is likely to be charges. Because loan
demand is not expected to recover rapidly in the depressed economy, such
non-interest earnings are vital to medium-term profitability.
'There will be pretty sluggish growth in interest income because of low
lending volumes, and non-performing loans,' says Mr Hugh Pye, an analyst at
Robert Fleming Securities. But banks are expected to have improved
non-interest income by raising charges, and selling more financial products.
Mr Terry Smith, an analyst at Collins Stewart, says banks have achieved
'astonishing' rises in charges on business such as small corporate lending
because of their customers' lack of bargaining strength in recession.
NatWest's non-interest income is expected to rise by 9.5 per cent.
The other side is costs. Banks have made strenuous efforts to reduce
overheads through branch closures and staff cuts. Those that took longer to
make cuts had more scope last year. Mr Robins says Lloyds' headcount is
already 18 per cent below its peak, compared with only 9 per cent below for
Barclays.
In the longer term, share performance may depend as much on the strength of
balance sheets - showing the banks' capacity to expand loans in recovery -
as the profit figures. British banks are still well-capitalised, but they
have been somewhat weakened by low dividend cover in the past two years.
Although they would remain comfortably within Basle capital ratios given
anticipated levels of loan growth over the next two years, stronger
expansion could strain ratios. Standard Chartered has strengthened its core
tier 1 capital ratio by disposing of Pounds 200m of properties in Asia.
This has led to strong speculation about one of the banks making a rights
issue soon. But most analysts believe this is unlikely until next year
because of market disenchantment at the manner in which previous issues such
as Barclays' Pounds 922m issue in 1988 went to poor-quality lending.
'I am sure they would like issues, but whether they could get away with them
is another matter,' says Mr Ian Poulter, an analyst at Yamaichi
International. Market sentiment is also affected by the fact that Barclays
could cut its dividend this year to reduce an anticipated retained loss of
Pounds 600m.
Uncertainties of this kind mean bank shares are far from guaranteed to
continue their outperformance. An unexpected rise in provisions, or poor
performance in reining in costs, could easily disturb the market's
confidence of the past six months.
Such uncertainties aside, the market appears to think the results will mark
a break with the problems of 1989-91, and a phase of steadier profitability.
The banks can at least take comfort in this new-found popularity among
shareholders amid the chorus of criticism from others.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Craxi resigns in new setback for Italian Socialists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BETTINO CRAXI, one of the most influential and controversial politicians
in postwar Italy, yesterday resigned from the leadership of the Socialist
party which he has headed since 1976.
The 59 year-old Socialist leader, who served as prime minister from 1983
until 1987, was forced to step down because of his alleged involvement in
the growing corruption scandal in Milan, the centre of his power base.
He has received five warrants from Milan magistrates advising him he is
under investigation for alleged illicit party funding by obtaining kickbacks
on public works contracts. A sixth warrant has been served relating to the
fraudulent bankruptcy of the Banco Ambrosiano in 1982.
The resignation came after 24 hours of remarkable political events. On
Wednesday, Mr Claudio Martelli, once Mr Craxi's closest political ally and
possible successor, resigned from his justice ministry portfolio and
membership of the Socialist party after being implicated in the scandal.
Yesterday morning, Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister and Mr Francesco
Saverio Borrelli, the Milan attorney-general, were obliged to make public
statements to scotch rumours that more senior figures in government and
industry were in danger of being caught in the corruption scandal.
For nearly an hour just before midday there was heavy selling of shares and
government paper in the markets and the lira began to slide. However,
intervention calmed the markets and brought prices and the lira parity back
to the previous day's levels.
The reaction of the markets underscored the extraordinary atmosphere of
rumour and uncertainty caused by the ever widening investigations by Milan
magistrates into corruption. Yesterday a special assembly of the Socialist
party met to decide on a successor to Mr Craxi. Last night there were
reports that the party leadership was nominating Mr Giorgio Benvenuto, a 55
year-old finance ministry official and former union leader. Mr Valdo Spini,
a 47 year-old member of parliament considered to be on the party's left, had
appeared a likely compromise candidate.
Mr Martelli resigned on being informed he was under investigation, like Mr
Craxi, for the fraudulent bankruptcy of Banco Ambrosiano. Milan magistrates
have alleged they were involved in using a Swiss bank account to receive an
illicit contribution from the late Mr Roberto Calvi, the head of Banco
Ambrosiano who was found hanged in London in 1982. The contribution was
allegedly made after a Dollars 50m loan from ENI, the Italian state oil
concern.
