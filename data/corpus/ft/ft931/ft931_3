FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Latin American Finance (3): Too much of a good
thing?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HOWEVER good for growth, the extent of the inflows has complicated the task
of governments across Latin America in managing economic policy.
The flows have had important repercussions on exchange rates, the money
supply, inflation, interest rates and wages. They have often pushed
economies economy in the opposite direction from that intended by
governments. They have made it more difficult to increase exports, have
increased dependence on international capital markets and on developments in
the industrialised world, and have played a role in bidding up prices of
existing assets, the general benefits of which have not always been clear.
Most governments have handled the inflation risk caused by the capital
inflows with some skill. The proof of this is in the decline, except in
Brazil, of inflation rates across the region as governments have responded
with tight monetary and fiscal policies.
However, this has, in some countries, been at the cost of an exchange rate
pitched too high to ensure that domestic industry remained competitive in
international markets.
The appreciation of real exchange rates caused by the inflows to some
countries has - by making exports more expensive and imports cheaper - added
to the difficulties of expanding exports. It has placed additional pressures
on domestic industries also facing the tough adjustment to lower tariffs and
the lifting of import quotas. As Chile's finance minister, Alejandro Foxley,
said last year: 'We already know from the previous crisis that a sudden
inflow of capital can be extremely destructive: it forces an appreciation of
the currency that can be of such a magnitude that it will severely hurt the
domestic productive structure.'
The exchange rate has been a real bind for many governments. If they allow
their currencies to appreciate, domestic industry is damaged, imports
increase and the current account deficit worsens. If they attempt to
maintain exchange rates by intervention in the currency market, the inflows
are absorbed through increases in foreign exchange reserves.
However, this latter course - because the government issues domestic
currency to buy foreign currency - expands money supply and increases
inflationary pressures.
The government can take action to offset the increase in money supply by
selling government debt. But if it sells debt, this pushes interest rates
higher - thereby deterring physical investment (which is actually what it is
trying to encourage).
It also spurs even more short-term inflows of capital. In the mean time,
central banks lose money as they buy up foreign exchange on which they earn
single-digit interest rates, and pay double digit interest rates or higher
to buyers of the debt.
The problems caused by selling debt to 'sterilise' capital inflows were
particularly acute in Brazil last year. There was a rapid expansion of
internal debt and a sharp rise in reserves. But because inflation and real
interest rates were so high, the interest rates paid on the extra debt added
critically to the overall fiscal deficit, which fed into the country's
inflation problem.
COLOMBIA also had great difficulty: foreign exchange reserves rose in 1991
by Dollars 1.9bn, equal to its entire monetary base. High real interest
rates, which resulted from attempts to sterilise these inflows, meant that,
according to the InterAmerican Development Bank, in Colombia and some other
countries there had been 'no real benefit of the inflows of capital to the
national economies in terms of increased investment or faster growth.'
By common consent, Mexico has probably struck the best balance. Although it
had the largest inflow, its fiscal surplus allowed internal debt to be paid
back and interest rates to be lowered.
Without the fiscal surplus - which is difficult psychologically to justify
in a developing country - interest rates in Mexico would have had to be
higher and therefore economic growth slower.
The Mexican government has also used foreign currency reserves to buy back
foreign debt, although this has the disadvantage again that it uses
high-cost capital to buy back low-cost capital.
Significantly, a further possible policy reaction has hardly been discussed
in the region: direct obstacles to capital flows. It is clear that most
governments recognise that this would send a strong signal suggesting a
reversal of the recent financial liberalisation.
Furthermore, there must be substantial doubts about the efficacy of capital
controls or foreign exchange controls either to keep funds in a country or
to stop them from entering. Such controls would probably have little effect
at a substantial cost.
There is no doubt that the inflows would probably have been more useful if
they had been somewhat slower. As the InterAmerican Development Bank said,
late last year: 'It would have been preferable if they had entered the
countries more gradually and on a sustainable basis.'
Indeed, forecasts suggest that inflows to the region will slow down in the
current year. This will happen for a variety of reasons, but an important
contributory factor will be the impact on the figures of Brazil. That
country's continuing economic difficulties will feed continuing fears about
another asset confiscation through some kind of shock plan, while the
government's growth orientation may bring about a decline in real interest
rates.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Latin American Finance (2): The return of capital
to Latin America
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AT THE beginning this year, the Financial Times celebrated its 100 years of
publication on pink paper and carried a reproduction of its first pink
issue.
News on Latin America was prominent. One front page article declared that JS
Morgan and Co and Baring Brothers declined an invitation 'to send delegates
to Buenos Aires to discuss the debt question'. JS Morgan saw 'nothing to
negotiate about in regard to loans.'
Mexico's debt had been renegotiated five years earlier. On the last day of
1892, Mexican 6 per cent bonds issued in the 1888 restructuring by the
Porfirio Diaz government closed up a quarter point on the London stock
exchange, at 78 per cent of face value.
One does not have to look far to be reminded of the boom-and-bust nature of
the international financial markets' 200-year-old affair with Latin America.
The question now is whether the recent unusual upsurge in private capital
flows is sustainable, or whether once again the whole process is going to
end disastrously.
The flows have been spurred by developments both within and outside the
region. Latin American governments have set the scene by introducing
economic policies which have met the approval of investors. To greater or
lesser degrees, governments have opened economies to outside competition,
curbed budget deficits, privatised state industry and generally increased
the role of the market. High real interest rates, designed to bear down on
inflation, have more than compensated investors for the perceived risks of
investment.
The foreign debt problems which plagued governments during the 1980s have
been temporarily ameliorated by sharply lower US interest rates. Mexico and
others have benefited from longer-term, albeit modest, debt relief through
the plan launched in 1989 by former US Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.
Outside the region, low US interest rates and recession in the US and other
industrialised countries have lowered investor returns in more traditional
markets, and led investors to look at higher returns offered in Latin
America. These investors include Latin Americans who, over the previous 20
years, had moved capital away from the region.
According to preliminary estimates from the Economic Commission for Latin
America and the Caribbean (Cepal), the region's net inflows of all types of
capital amounted to Dollars 57bn last year, 50 per cent up on the preceding
year and nearly three times the level of 1990. The greater part of this
inflow was private capital.
Mexico's inflows were up to Dollars 23.3bn from Dollars 21.5bn; while
Argentina's rose to Dollars 9.3bn from Dollars 5.3bn. The most remarkable
rise was Brazil's, to Dollars 10.1bn from Dollars 1.2bn.
After nine years in which Latin America transferred resources to the rest of
the world, net transfers - that is new finance minus capital repayments and
interest and dividend remitted abroad - became positive to the tune of
Dollars 5.5bn in 1991 and trebled in 1992 to Dollars 17.1bn.
The inflows to date have been critical in the restoration of economic
growth: economic expansion exceeded population growth in 1991 and 1992. They
have helped to lift the financing constraints that have plagued the region's
economies since the beginning of the debt crisis.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Singapore (1): Murmurings of anxiety - Singapore
continues to dazzle the world with its rapid economic growth and its
prosperous and stable society. But there are signs of strain as it faces
ever keener competition with its equally dynamic southeast Asian neighbours
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
'A COUNTRY is like one big corporation. Its gross national product is
equivalent to a company's revenue and its population its employees. A
national economy competes with other national economies for market shares in
the world. If it fails to compete, its population or employees will not be
paid well. If it is competitive, its standard of living will rise.' (Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong, October 15 1992).
It may not be immediately obvious from the sleek facade of Singapore Inc.
But among senior managers of the world's most successful corporate state,
there are unmistakeable, and quite deliberate, rumblings of unease about the
future these days.
Mr Lee Kuan Yew, founder and now non-executive chairman, complains of a lack
of enterprise among his employees and compares the 'corporation'
unfavourably with its buccaneering rival to the north, Hong Kong. Mr Goh
Chok Tong, his successor as chief executive, worries aloud about Singapore's
position in the accelerating race for trade and investment in Asia and frets
that the workforce may be going soft or getting greedy. On cue, a chorus of
middle managers takes up the call for a reorientation of corporate strategy,
another efficiency drive, a fresh push into overseas markets.
At first glance, it is hard to see what the fuss is about. Singapore
remains, by any standard, a phenomenal case study in economic achievement.
After nearly three decades of almost uninterrupted rapid expansion, its
gross domestic product continues to grow at annual rates around 6 per cent,
without significant inflation. On a per capita basis, it is richer than any
of the other Asian 'dragons', and has already overtaken several countries in
Europe.
It boasts full employment, remarkable political stability, an incorrupt and
efficient public administration, and the highest home ownership and national
savings rates in the world. Foreign investment continues to pour in, to the
extent that an island state of 3.1m people hosts one foreign company per
1,000 inhabitants. And Singaporeans enjoy a quality of urban life without
parallel in the region.
Yet if the message from the top is to be believed, now is no time for
resting on laurels. The constantly reiterated theme of ministerial and prime
ministerial speeches over the past year is that the challenges of the next
decade will be as stiff as anything Singapore has faced since it was thrust
out of the Malaysian Federation and into sovereign independence in 1965. The
task is not only to stay several jumps ahead of competitors within Asia but
to upgrade the economy to a point where it can claim a place among the
developed nations.
'We are like someone being chased by tigers with a cliff in front,' said Mr
Goh in a speech to trade unionists last October. 'The tigers are closing in
fast but the cliff is difficult to scale. The tigers are the dynamic
economies like Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and China. The cliff is the
formidable challenge posed by the developed countries.'
The prime minister's colourful warnings are exaggerated for effect. He and
Mr Lee, who as Senior Minister is still considered by many as the ultimate
authority despite having relinquished the premiership in late 1990, like to
give the impression of being engaged in a constant struggle to maintain the
values which helped propel Singapore out of poverty in a generation - its
legendary political discipline and the quiescence of the workforce in
pursuit of general prosperity.
Yet implausible as their scare stories may sound, there are legitimate
reasons for at least mild concern over Singapore's medium term prospects. In
the first place, the battle to stay commercially competitive is becoming
fiercer all the time.
Singapore is still attracting foreign investment at an enviable pace -
manufacturing investment in fixed assets reached a record SDollars 3.48bn
last year, 21 per cent up on the 1991 figure. But it has to work at it
against formidable constraints.
With less than 3 per cent unemployment and the population more or less
static, there is a chronic labour shortage, and for political reasons
Singapore does not want to import any more immigrant labour than it has to.
One result is that wages have been outpacing productivity growth in recent
years, in the process eroding Singapore's competitive edge. 'We've got to
worry all the time,' says Mr Goh. 'If we lose our competitive edge, I think
the whole house may collapse. To give an example, if we are not competitive,
say, with China, we'll find that China will suck in our investments very
quickly ...a hollowing out of the economy may take place ...This anxiety
element is something we've got to live with.'
The second broad area of concern is Singapore's place among the dynamic
economies of Asia as a whole. From mainland China in the north and India in
the west to south-east Asian countries next door, markets with vast
potential are opening up to outside investors.
But Mr Lee, in particular, has taken to issuing stern warnings that
Singapore is in danger of failing to capitalise on this rapid growth.
Singaporeans, he complains, are a staid and timid lot who prefer to stay at
home and work as middle managers rather than venturing abroad in search of
business opportunities. It is time for them to develop an entrepreurial
spirit, 'go regional' and build an external dimension to the country's
economy in the way that South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan have done.
There are delicious ironies in Mr Lee's new campaign, since the conservatism
and unimaginativeness he attributes to his subjects spring in no small
measure from the tightly controlled society that he has created. Since
Singaporeans are schooled from birth in Confucian virtues of obedience,
discipline and collective endeavour, since the government controls the main
levers of economic power, and since they have for years heard disapproving
lectures from their leaders about the corruption and maladministration of
other Asian countries, it is scarcely surprising that they show little
initiative in doing business abroad.
Fear of failure - kiasu in the Hokkien Chinese dialect - remains a powerful
feature of Singaporean society, reflected in everything from the
ultra-cautious way it regulates its financial centre to bankruptcy laws of a
severity unparalleled anywhere in the industrial world. Those Singaporeans
who have broken out into the wider region often did so in spite of the
system rather than because of it, and many of them show little inclination
to return home. Nevertheless, it is significant that the nation's patriarch
has seen fit to air this issue now.
Mr Lee's speeches betray an awareness that to stay abreast of breakneck
development in the region at large, Singapore itself will have to change.
Unwittingly perhaps, Mr Lee's concerns about Singapore's need to spread its
wings abroad also underline what is the biggest domestic political challenge
facing the ruling People's Action Party over the next few years: how to keep
fulfilling the ever-rising expectations of Singaporeans themselves.
Singapore may be to all intents a one-party state, but without doubt the PAP
owes its unbroken 34 years in government principally to the prosperity it
has engendered, and to its success in giving Singaporeans a stake in their
own society.
As one foreign diplomat put it: 'The PAP knows that whatever grip it now
exercises on the state machinery its political dominance stands or falls on
its record of creating and distributing wealth.'
And here, the omens have not been universally favourable for the government
of late. Mr Goh is still smarting from the blow the PAP received in the
elections of August 1991, when its share of the vote fell to 61 per cent - a
setback only partly redeemed by the PAP's 72 per cent score in a by-election
late last year.
Although the ruling party still enjoys support that governments in the west
can only dream of, there can be no disguising the decline in its share of
the vote through the last four general elections. Next time, or the time
after that, the PAP may have to reckon with a considerably larger presence
of the opposition parties in parliament.
This would scarcely be a disaster. But it does imply a period of adjustment
for an elite unaccustomed to challenges to its rule. And that process will
not be rendered any easier by the doubts that have unexpectedly arisen in
recent months surrounding the succession to Lee Kuan Yew.
Late last year, it was announced that both Mr Lee's eldest son, Lee Hsieng
Loon, and Mr Ong Teng Cheong, both deputy prime ministers, were being
treated for cancer. The news shocked Singaporeans since it had been widely
presumed that the former, a tough but not especially popular chip off the
old block known everywhere as 'BG Lee' in deference to his military rank,
was being groomed as Singapore's prime minister in the not too distant
future.
The government insists 'BG' Lee is responding well to treatment and will be
back at his desk soon.
But if the illness were to remove him permanently from the scene, the reins
of power would continue to be held by a group of men without an obviously
charismatic leader.
This is not an immediate problem. Mr Lee himself, now 70 but in apparently
robust health, looks like being around for a good while longer. Mr Goh is an
able administrator and is setting about trying to develop a more collegial -
if not much more consultative - style of government.
But it does seem that, as it grows richer and better educated, as the
generation that experienced the traumas of independence fades from the
stage, and as income disparities widen, Singapore is becoming a more complex
place to govern.
The fundamental questions are whether a society so regimented as Singapore's
still is will develop the capacity both to nurture the creativity of its
best and brightest and to channel the frustrations of the less privileged -
and whether it will continue to adapt and prosper in a way that outlasts the
man who founded and moulded it.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Latin American Finance (1): Top of investors'
agenda worldwide - One in every three new investment dollars now allocated
worldwide in equity is reported to be going into emerging markets. Latin
America is winning an important share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER

<TEXT>
IT could be one of the most important financial developments of the 1990s,
setting investment trends into the 21st century - or perhaps just another
financial fad. Megatrend or a flash in the pan, Latin America has in the
last three years pushed itself to the top of the agendas of investors -
individual, financial and corporate - worldwide.
The reasons are both internal and external to the region. Internally,
economic policies offering prospects for stability and a return to growth
are being pursued by governments no longer hostile to private capital. The
cloud of the 1980s foreign debt crisis has lifted in some countries, thanks
to low US interest rates and negotiated debt relief. Externally, low returns
in established markets have forced investors to look further afield to
improve performance.
Michael Howell, of Baring Securities global strategy unit in London,
reckons: 'One in every three new investment dollars now allocated worldwide
in equity is going into emerging markets.'
Of this, Latin America is getting an important share.
Mr Howell often describes to investors an ideal investment portfolio for the
turn of the century. The portfolio is only 54 per cent invested in the staid
markets of the industrialised world: the rest is in the emerging markets of
developing countries. One-fifth is concentrated in Latin America. Yet this
is no portfolio of the future, but a typical British investment spread in
1913. Mr Howell argues that, after years in which emerging markets were
ignored, history is turning a full circle.
Richard Watt was recently appointed head of Latin American investments for
Gartmore Investment Management, which manages around Pounds 12.8bn (Dollars
19bn) of funds. Gartmore has recommended to clients that they put up to 1
1/2 -2 per cent of their portfolios in newer emerging markets. Around 70 per
cent of that will go to Latin America. Gartmore has already placed Pounds
40m of investment in the region since the start of the year.
Pension funds in Britain account for more than Pounds 300bn of investments.
Philippa Armitage of Fleming Investment Management believes UK institutions
will approach Latin America as they did Asia's emerging markets some years
ago, initially committing perhaps 1-2 per cent before building up to higher
levels.
UK institutions are lagging Dutch and, in particular, US investors. In the
US alone, institutions hold some Dollars 6,000bn. There, some consultants
are recommending significantly larger exposure to Latin America. They see
economies with good growth prospects, attractive share valuations and the
scope to increase return by diversifying portfolios and thereby reducing
risk.
EVEN if a fraction of this money makes its way into Latin America on a
sustainable basis, it can make a huge difference. Yet investors are still
cautious after the 1980s debt crisis, unsure about the durability of the
improved economic performance. There are questions about the ability of
markets to absorb a large influx of funds. Investors rarely complain about
inadequate settlement procedures - except in Venezuela - but the markets in
most shares are thin and prone to overshoot.
This volatility of Latin stock markets was forcefully underlined last year.
Stocks hit new highs in the first half of the year and then collapsed,
leaving investors with meagre returns and a large number of proposed
international equity offerings high and dry.
The market for Latin American bonds also had its share of troubles: the
latter part of the year saw a glut of over-priced bond issues which sold
poorly. Some underwriters only cleared their books of these issues with this
year's fortuitous drop in US interest rates: they may as a result be more
cautious in the future.
These problems, providing investors with their first real setbacks since
private capital began flowing back into Latin America at the start of the
1990s, contributed to a slowing of portfolio investment into the region last
year. That interest among portfolio investors in the region continues to
grow after such difficulties suggests the return of foreign capital to the
region may be more than a transitory phenomenon.
Despite this, an important proportion of the inflows - too high for comfort
 -has been of volatile short-term capital. This has been attracted by high
real interest rates in the region which are a consequence of tight monetary
policies aimed at curbing inflation.
Dependence on short-term capital to cover current account deficits - such
funding is estimated to make up between a third and a half of Mexico's
capital inflows - carries risks. It can flee as quickly as it arrived, with
harsh consequences on interest rates, growth and economic policy.
Over-dependence on volatile foreign capital has underlined the need for
reform to boost domestic savings, following the example of Chile where
private pension funds have stimulated growth of local capital markets.
Throughout the region, foreign banks are showing a growing interest in local
capital markets.
There has also been a significant influx of long-term capital, foreign
direct investment (FDI) with the potential to expand the region's productive
capacity. As portfolio flows slowed last year, foreign direct investment is
estimated to have continued growing. No longer viewing such investment with
the suspicion of the past, the region's governments are doing what they can
to attract it.
Some FDI has been spurred by privatisation, an unrepeatable phenomenon, but
much has also been driven by growth prospects and expected progress towards
regional economic integration, which translates into bigger domestic
markets.
CAPITAL inflows have opened in some countries the prospect of a future path
to sustainable growth. They do not guarantee it, however. Latin America is
in the early stages of an economic transformation that involves the
destruction of much old industrial capacity. Industries once protected by
high tariffs and import quotas are no longer viable.
This restructuring - together with the slimming down of government - implies
unemployment for important, and often powerful, sectors of society. Yet the
economic benefits of new investment, if indeed it continues, could take
years to become evident. Since elected governments now hold sway in most of
the region - and in the next two years almost every country faces a
presidential election - there is a risk of a reaction in economic policy.
Even if economic success is enjoyed by some countries, others may miss out.
The economic prospects for the largest economy - Brazil - are highly
uncertain. Governments face social problems - big income inequalities and
poverty that worsened throughout the 1980s.
In two big economies, Argentina and Mexico, inflation has been tackled in
part with policies that have encouraged an appreciation of the real exchange
rate. These countries and others have experienced widening current account
deficits, raising questions about whether they can be financed on a
sustainable basis. Absent Brazil's big trade surplus, the region's widening
current account deficit underlines that whatever investment so far has taken
place, it has yet to create an important base for exports.
The reform of the region's economies has given Latin America a heightened
dependence on foreign capital, external economic conditions and the world
trading system. The auguries are strong for continued flows of new finance
to Latin America. Yet most of the region's governments have placed their
bets on a system of free markets and free trade, a system now being
questioned in the US, the region's most important trading partner, and
elsewhere in the industrialised world.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Pessimism is a Euro-disease: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whenever I read a British newspaper, some politician seems to be trying to
explain away economic hardship by referring to the 'world recession'. Don't
believe it. Much of Europe admittedly is peculiarly depressed; lengthy dole
queues seem to be accompanied nearly everywhere by weak political leadership
and public apathy. There are few historical precedents for the continent's
combination of ailments, which includes civil war in the former Yugoslavia,
German xenophobia and a wave of corruption trials in Italy. Even France,
labouring to defend the franc, was recently described by the Washington Post
as 'rarely in a more disgruntled mood'.
In the 19th century, Europe could be forgiven for mistaking itself for the
world, most of which it either owned or governed. But today it is ludicrous
to pretend that the gloom and doom afflicting Europe is a global phenomenon.
In much of the rest of the world the economic outlook is promising and the
quality of political leadership as high - if not higher - than in recent
decades. Outside Europe, many people are eagerly awaiting the 21st century,
which they expect to mark a huge improvement on the past 100 war-torn years.
To put Euro-gloom in perspective, consider first the outlook for the US. The
economy has been growing steadily for nearly two years following a brief and
relatively mild contraction in the winter of 1990-91. Growth at an annual
rate of nearly 5 per cent at the end of last year will not be sustained; but
most forecasters are confidently predicting several years of growth of at
least 3 per cent. The unemployment rate peaked at 7.7 per cent (far below
the double-digits feared in Europe), is now 7 per cent and is expected to
fall to about 5.5 per cent - effectively 'full employment' - by the end of
President Bill Clinton's first term.
Unlike the cautious British electorate, Americans had the courage to vote
for change last November and are now benefiting from a revival of the
legendary Yankee 'can do' spirit. The Democratic Congress has moved swiftly
to endorse the White House's economic plan, meaning that excessive budget
deficits will be curbed, albeit slowly. Mr Clinton will shortly unveil his
strategy for reforming the nation's flawed healthcare system. This will be
followed, probably next year, by proposals to improve the quality of US
education and worker training.
If the outlook for the US is bright, it is positively dazzling in much of
east Asia. The region remains politically immature, but during the 1980s it
grew more than twice as fast as either Europe or the US. Most forecasters
expect continued dynamism, even allowing for Japan's serious (but surely
temporary) difficulties.
'Fuelled by China's economic boom,' argues Merrill Lynch, the Wall Street
brokerage, in a recent circular, 'Asia-Pacific growth should reach almost 8
per cent in 1993 following 7 per cent last year.' East Asia as a whole is
now a more important trading partner for the US than Europe - which is one
reason why the US media typically quotes the dollar in terms of yen rather
than D-marks.
Euro-pessimists must also contend with improved economic performance
throughout the developing world, which enjoyed economic growth of about 6
per cent last year and may grow nearly as fast this year. The world has not
been in, nor is heading for, a recession, let alone a depression. Even in
industrialised countries, annual growth has not yet dipped below 1 per cent
and will probably accelerate next year to more than 2 per cent.
Viewed from Washington, the gloom pervading Europe is puzzling. For four
decades, the continent was divided by an Iron Curtain and needed the
protection of a US military shield. Yet in the mid-1980s when the Kremlin
was still building its stockpile of SS20 missiles and Berlin was a lonely
outpost in communist east Germany, western Europe was far happier than
today. It enjoyed political stability and economic prosperity and seemed
prepared to make the modest sacrifices needed to secure the potentially huge
benefits of greater economic and monetary integration. The reduced burden of
military spending following communism's collapse and the enhanced
opportunities for trade with the new democracies of eastern Europe ought to
be creating still greater regional prosperity rather than a torrent of
mealy-mouthed complaints.
European politicians pretend that the world is facing intractable economic
problems comparable with those of the 1930s. Sky-high unemployment and lakes
of budgetary red ink are seen as all but inevitable. The success of east
Asia and the US shows that this is nonsense. If Europe is in secular
decline, it has only itself to blame; it has simply lost sight of the
virtues - thrift, hard work, flexibility and risk-taking entrepreneurship -
that underpinned its startling success in the 19th century.
With hindsight western Europe perhaps grew too comfortable in the cosy,
controlled world created after the second world war, when its destiny was
effectively in the hands of the US and the Soviet Union. On its own again
for the first time since the inter-war years it is again showing a singular
lack of political vision and will.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Monday Interview: First in the fight for fairness - Herman
Ouseley, new chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, talks to Alan
Pike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Commission for Racial Equality will next week gain its first black
chairman and, as a direct consequence, its first chairman to have suffered
insults, harassment and violence because of the colour of his skin.
Herman Ouseley goes to the commission from the equally demanding job of
chief executive of the London borough of Lambeth where, when appointed in
1988, he set another record as Britain's first black local authority chief
executive.
Reaching the top of powerful organisations, public or private, is still
relatively rare for members of Britain's ethnic minority communities. As
someone who was born in Guyana, came to Britain as a child in 1957 and grew
up as part of an immigrant family in south London, he shares a personal
history with many of Britain's black people.
'My experiences are ones that are mirrored by many black people living in
the inner cities, although I have been luckier than most in being able to
side-step the difficulties that a lot of people have not been able to escape
from,' he says.
'I have suffered having bricks and bottles thrown through our window and
other forms of racial harassment. I have been beaten up on my way home from
school by groups of white youths and called a black bastard. Things have
happened for no reason other than what I look like.
'I have failed interviews when I felt I should have been successful, but how
could I prove it was discrimination? The majority of people who are
discriminated against cannot prove it. I have been picked up by the police
for no reason. I have sued the police for wrongful imprisonment and won.'
Ouseley's origins give him an appreciation of the lives of ordinary black
people in Britain that none of his predecessors in the CRE chairman's office
 -however committed to its goals of eliminating racial discrimination and
promoting equality of opportunity - could totally share. This does not mean
that the new chairman will arrive determined simply to be a strident,
one-dimensional advocate of black rights. Ouseley has a strong sense of
balance, and it shows as he continues to review the influences that will
help determine his style in the post.
'At the other end of the spectrum, I have had the experience of being a
black person in a powerful position. Other black people have expected me to
be able to do things for them, while white people have thought I might
possibly discriminate against them or overlook them. I have had to be seen
to be fairer than fair to white people, while bending over backwards to help
black people and avoid being accused of having sold out.'
He takes over the commission at a difficult time. Unemployment, even when
the economy is flourishing, is disproportionately high among Britain's
ethnic minority communities; the recession is aggravating the problem and
worsening other social tensions. Ouseley's annual budget at the commission
will be limited to a modest Pounds 15m and the government plans no growth in
real terms at least up to 1995-96. With only about 200 staff and limited
funds, it must be selective in its activities, which include giving advice,
legal assistance and mounting investigations into allegations of racial
discrimination.
Under Sir Michael Day, its outgoing chairman, the CRE has demanded stronger
race relations legislation but ministers have not rushed to oblige. Ouseley
recognises the commission's limitations. 'It is a creature of statute and
the government controls its finances. People who think the CRE should be
challenging every institutional practice in the world should realise it is
impossible. But the commission none the less has a very important job to do
in helping to promote a society based on respect, fairness, tolerance and
justice.'
He supports the commission's call for stronger race relations laws, saying
that, while the present act had proved a powerful weapon, weaknesses have
been exposed. In some respects, says Ouseley, the legal position on race
relations was weakened during the 1980s by other legislation. He cites the
1988 Local Government Act, which he says gives local authorities
insufficient power to ensure that contractors pursue adequate equal
opportunities employment policies. The value of positive action programmes
in overcoming discrimination in employment has, he says, been proved in the
US. And he says black people find it 'painful' that the powers of the
Northern Ireland Fair Employment Commission to challenge discrimination on
religious grounds in the province are tougher that those available on the
mainland to attack racial discrimination.
A conversation about race relations with someone whose experience is in the
inner cities inevitably touches the fragile, fraught question of
relationships between the black community and the police. Mr Paul Condon,
the new Metropolitan Police commissioner, made racism the subject of his
first public speech, voicing determination to outlaw it in both the
community and the force. Ouseley, welcoming strides he believes the police
service has made in recognising that it has problems in its relationships
with black communities, again takes care to inject balance. 'Equally, the
minority communities have problems with regard to crime and attitudes. They
have to face up to these. The law has to be upheld fairly, and people have
got to recognise that if they are stepping outside it, they are likely to
fall foul of the police.'
How does the CRE's new chairman, a role model of black achievement, view the
status of ethnic minority communities in Britain today? In the 36 years
since Herman Ouseley and his family came to London alongside many other
Commonwealth citizens, predictions about how the arrivals would influence
their new society have varied widely. Prophets of doom foretold streets
alive with serious and repeated race riots; some optimists assumed that
there would be an almost magical and effortless assimilation leading to
equality of opportunity. Neither has happened. Ouseley compares individual
examples of success with the scale of the problem still to be addressed.
'You see many Asian names on lists of very wealthy people in Britain. There
are half a dozen black members of parliament compared with none five years
ago. There are now about five black local authority chief executives, while
I was the only one in 1988. But there are more racial attacks and there is
more racial violence. There is a high proportion of black people on the
unemployment register, in penal institutions and among the homeless. The
real problem in race relations is that the worst afflictions affect the
black community to a disproportionate level. Black people bear a greater
share of the misery and poverty in our society.'
These are big issues, but Ouseley believes they can be tackled through
specific, targeted action. He has a reputation as a strong and brave manager
 -his parting gift to Lambeth was a highly publicised report alleging fraud
and corruption in the council, now being studied by the government - and he
emphasises the scope for clearly thought-out management action as a tool for
improving race relations. In 1979, 6 per cent of Lambeth council's employees
were from ethnic minorities. Now the figure is 48 per cent, reflecting the
ethnic composition of the borough. He would like to see more employers in
both the public and private sectors following the example.
'This would not have happened unless people in the organisation had been
persuaded that it needed to happen. It required managerial will and
political will.
'Many examples of success by members of Britain's ethnic minority
communities - whether we regard them as token or significant - are as a
result of institutions saying: 'We cannot go on like this. We must make a
positive effort.' There must be more positive efforts to create a structure
where people who are being denied opportunities can play their full part in
society, unconstrained by race.'

FT  29 MAR 93 / Wreckage of old socialism: Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Opinions differ on the reasons for the wreckage of the Socialist party in
the French general elections last week. Some say they failed to hold down
unemployment; some say they betrayed socialism, both in their conservative
economic policies, and in their luxuriant corruption; and some blame the
party's founder, President Francois Mitterrand, for all of the above, for
over-playing his hand, and for out-staying his welcome.
Yet whatever the reasons, the result of the election is so extreme, that it
will have the effect of a political earthquake. The Socialists' colossal
defeat may yet mark a paradigm shift in the dialectic of French politics,
which in turn could have lessons for other democratic countries in Europe.
One thing the Socialists know for certain: they must start again from the
bottom and from the beginning. The party cannot pretend to carry on as
before, as if this were a little local difficulty; if it is to recover a
significant role in French politics, it will need a new leader, a new
message, and quite probably a new name as well.
Choosing a new leader has suddenly become urgent. President Mitterrand is
totally identified with the party's rise and fall, and at the age of 76 he
is in a poor position to help it recover; in any case, he may not want to
try. Recovery can only come from a new leader, and that probably means a
choice between Mr Michel Rocard, the party's 'virtual' candidate for the
presidency, and Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission.
A new leader will need a new message. In 1983 the Socialists tacitly
abandoned most of the paraphernalia of unreconstructed socialism; after the
election of 1988 they progressively abandoned the rest; but they have yet to
come up with a new programme.
Mr Rocard has moved to grapple with the problem, by his sensational call for
the creation of a centre-left movement, reaching from reformed Communists to
moderate centrists; but he has yet to define the platform it would have.
There are essentially two reasons why the Socialists had to abandon the
crude version of their creed. Old-fashioned class-based politics, the
proletariat against the bosses, has long ceased to hold an adequate mirror
to today's reality. What with mortgages and foreign travel, the decline of
smoke-stack industries and the rise of the service sector, modern society
has become more complex and less oppressive.
Second, no one believes in crude socialism any more. It was a disaster in
the Soviet empire; it has failed whenever it has been tried in the west.
Moreover, in 1983 the French Socialists had to choose between crude
socialism and Europe: they discovered to their dismay that they had no
choice but Europe.
Socialists would claim that there is more to their message than the
ideological excesses of nationalisation and the command economy. They remain
committed to a distinctive set of social-moral concerns: protection of the
under-privileged; social welfare, health, housing, and education; the
rejection of money and individual self-interest as dominant values. In
short, some verson of liberte, egalite, fraternite.
The problem is that these concerns may now be on the wrong side of the
historic and geo-strategic wave. The traditional socialist canon focused on
the fight against the unfair distribution of wealth; today's urgent need is
wealth creation, and today's scourge is again structural unemployment. The
socialist canon calls for social protection for the weak, the ill, the
retired, the unemployed; today's problem is knowing how to pay for these
things.
The first reason for the radical shift in today's priorities, is that the
socialists have won the moral argument, at least in most of western Europe:
Christian Democrats and Social Democrats both accept the general case for
social solidarity; France's conservative parties would not dare suggest
dismantling the welfare state. The unsolved problem is that demand for
welfare is by its nature unlimited.
The second reason is the development of global markets. In a national
economy, the exploited may be able to force a more favourable deal out of
the exploiters; that option is not available if the 'exploitation' comes
from other, more competitive, economies.
Last year, the Dutch Central Planning Bureau* produced a range of forecasts
for the next 25 years; one of the scenarios was for a trade crisis, with the
world breaking up into three main protectionist blocs. It may not happen;
but there is no denying that talk of protectionism is increasingly
widespread.
If western Europe remains committed to liberal global trade, it will have to
improve its competitiveness much faster than in the past. This means
channelling much larger resources into education and training; the
alternative strategy of driving down workers' wages might produce a Third
World work-force, but it would still not enable them to compete with an
advanced Asian economy.
Education and training will be slow to deliver. Meanwhile, competition will
force the European Community to review either the budgetary costs of its
welfare programmes, or the costly rigidities of its labour laws, or both.
Moreover, welfare costs will rise steeply with the ageing of the population:
in 1990 the over-64s represented 21 per cent of the population; by 2020 they
will be 31 per cent.
This is not a cheerful prospect. It is especially uncheerful for a political
leader who is trying to work out a new political message for the 1990s, and
who still wants to think of himself as a Socialist.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Eyes on French franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS will keep a close watch on the French franc this week, following the
second round of the National Assembly elections in France, writes James
Blitz.
In recent weeks, there has been a growing feeling that the accession to
power of a right-wing government in Paris will coincide with another
speculative attack on the French currency. A landslide victory for the
RPR/UDF coalition has long been discounted, but the new administration's
commitment to the franc fort policy is certain to be tested.
But dealers are uncertain over when exactly the pressure on the franc might
come, if it comes at all.
The franc's immediate future may depend on when the Bundesbank lowers
interest rates again. There was some disappointment last week that the
central bank continued to offer funds to commercial banks at an unchanged
repo rate of 8.25 per cent. There are expectations that this rate will be
cut this week, possibly when the Bundesbank council meets on Thursday.
But the pressure on the franc may not come until the summer.
Mr Christopher Potts of Banque Indosuez in Paris says: 'The danger point for
the franc is not the next two weeks, but two months down the road.
'It is difficult to suggest that the new French government could break with
the strong franc policy this week. They will have no choice but to maintain
the policy. However, the dangers will increase if French interest rates
can't be brought down sharply in the next two months.'
Mr Gerard Lyons of DKB International believes the most likely outcome to the
crisis is that the new government will maintain the commitment to franc
fort, patiently waiting for German interest rates to come down.
However, he believes there is a 30 per cent probability that the markets
will force a devaluation, possibly because tensions elsewhere in the
European exchange rate mechanism will spill over.

FT  29 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Eurobond issuance sets record in first
quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW issues in the international bond market reached a record high in the
first quarter of this year, reflecting a favourable environment of falling
interest rates and an increase in funding requirements, especially from
sovereign borrowers.
According to provisional figures from Euromoney Bondware, new Eurobond
issuance for the first quarter to March 26 stood at Dollars 115.2bn, well
above the previous record high of Dollars 84.5bn achieved in the same
quarter last year. New issuance in the first three months of this year
represented 42 per cent of the record Dollars 274.4bn raised in the whole of
1992.
Syndicate managers do not believe that new issuance will continue at the
same pace in the second quarter, unless there is another currency crisis in
Europe. That would prompt European central banks to borrow in foreign
currencies to fill up their reserves once again.
Many of the larger borrowers, especially the sovereign names, are believed
to have achieved between 40 per cent and 60 per cent of their 1993 funding
requirements already in the first quarter.
'The new issuance calendar is likely to be much more opportunistic in the
second quarter,' one syndicate manager said.
Syndicate managers said that the high volume in the first quarter is closely
linked to the rally seen in bond markets across the world, fuelled by
expectations of lower interest rates, especially in Europe.
These hopes have been fulfilled by the Bundesbank's decision in recent weeks
to lower its interest rates, which has in turn eased the tension between
member currencies of the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM).
Falling interest rates have coincided with a large rise in borrowing needs
among European countries, either to fund ever-growing public deficits or to
replenish foreign exchange reserves depleted by heavy intervention in the
currency market to shore up their respective currencies.
The Eurodollar sector of the international bond market continued to be the
most active in the first quarter, accounting for 33.8 per cent of the total
volume compared with 28.2 per cent in the first quarter of last year.
The volume figures partly reflect the growing popularity of global bond
issues, a concept pioneered by the World Bank in 1989.
The process of offering bonds simultaneously in the US, Europe and Asia
Pacific allows borrowers to raise larger sums and to place the paper at the
best possible price.
So far this year, dollar-denominated global bond issues amounting to Dollars
8.75bn have been launched by the World Bank, the Province of Ontario, the
Republic of Finland, Ford Motor Credit Company, and the Kingdom of Sweden.
Eurobond volume in D-Marks rose to second place or 20.2 per cent of total
issuance in the first quarter, from fourth place or 10.7 per cent in the
first quarter of 1992. This reflects the marked increase in demand for
D-Mark paper from investors seeking a safe haven during the period of ERM
currency volatility.
At the same time, the collapse of the Ecu market meant that the D-Mark
sector was one of the few areas of the Eurobond market which offered
sufficient liquidity to borrowers needing to raise large amounts.
The volume of new Ecu bonds remained low at the equivalent of just Dollars
1.9bn, compared with Dollars 14.6bn in the first quarter of 1992, in spite
of efforts by the French government and some of the European Community
agencies to revive investor interest in Ecu-denominated paper.
Favourable arbitrage opportunities, as borrowers moved to reduce their
funding costs by borrowing in one currency and swapping into another, were
the main reason for the big increase in Canadian dollar Eurobonds this
quarter.
Syndicate managers estimate that a large part of the equivalent of Dollars
12.9bn worth of Canadian dollar Eurobonds raised so far this year - up from
Dollars 4.4bn at the same stage last year - has been swapped into other
currencies.
The Eurosterling sector of the international bond market rose up the volume
table, as an increasing number of domestic and international borrowers
decided to lock into the lowest interest rates that the UK has seen since
the 1970s.
New issuance in sterling jumped to 10.9 per cent of the total volume in the
first three months of this year from 6.7 per cent in the same period last
year.
The sector saw a record for a single transaction, as Abbey National raised
Pounds 650m through an issue of 10-year Eurobonds, beating the previous
record of Pounds 600m held by the Kingdom of Sweden.
Apart from the Ecu sector, the other main loser in the first quarter has
been the Euroyen area of the international bond market, as issuers were
discouraged from borrowing in yen due to its appreciation against other
currencies.
New issuance in yen dropped to the equivalent of Dollars 10.9bn from Dollars
12.2bn in the year-ago period, while its share of the total volume fell to
9.5 per cent from 14.4 per cent.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Australian bonds: Budget deficit worries bolster yields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BOUT of nervousness struck the Australian government bond market last week
as it became clear that the re-elected Labor administration and the Reserve
Bank are heading for a disagreement about the growing federal budget
deficit.
The unease sparked a wave of selling on Friday which raised yields across
the board. The yield on the October 2002 Treasury bond rose 20 basis points
to 7.93 per cent, that on the September 1995 bond increased by 10 basis
points to 6.38 per cent, and 90-day bank bills finished two points higher at
5.34 per cent.
The sell-off interrupted a sustained rally which had cut the yield on the
10-year bond from around 9 per cent in mid-January to just over 7.5 per cent
on March 19.
The rally was triggered by a catalogue of factors, including a reduction in
inflation to an OECD low of 0.3 per cent; signs that economic growth is
beginning to pick up; receding prospects of a balance of payments crisis;
and a firmer Australian dollar following cuts in overseas interest rates.
The announcement of an early election, subsequently won by the incumbent
Labor Party, also helped by eliminating political uncertainty and increasing
the prospects of a cut in official rates, which eventually materialised last
Tuesday.
In the event, the Reserve Bank restricted the easing to half a percentage
point, disappointing the equities market, but in line with expectations in
the bond market which had marked down the yield on 90-day bills to 5.26 per
cent before the announcement.
The rosy outlook dimmed on Friday, after Mr John Dawkins, the finance
minister let it be known that he regarded the budget deficit as a less
important issue than the need for growth to reduce unemployment from its
near record level of 11.1 per cent.
Mr Dawkins' view was in stark contrast to a warning issued earlier in the
week by Mr Bernie Fraser, the Reserve Bank governor, that the deficit must
be reduced over the medium term to provide room for an increase in private
investment.
The finance minister was presumably aware of the impact his reported views
were likely to have on the bond market, since a similar outbreak of concern
about perceived fiscal laxity after his August 1992 budget pushed the
10-year bond yield from about 8.3 per cent to more than 9 per cent.
This time round, the market wanted rapid confirmation from the government
that it remains determined to reduce the deficit, which is forecast at
ADollars 15.9bn in the year to June.
'An explanation is needed,' said one trader. 'If this guy is serious, then
bonds should not be at current levels.'
However, Mr Dawkins failed to clarify his reported views, leaving the market
stewing over forecasts by business economists that the deficit could rise to
ADollars 20bn next year unless urgent action is taken.
Ms Ivana Bottini, an economist at Citibank in Sydney, says the market's main
fear is that an expansionary fiscal policy risks triggering a sharp rise in
domestic consumption, a current account crisis and a rebirth of inflation.
Ms Bottini believes these fears are exaggerated in view of the sluggishness
of Australia's recovery from the 1990-91 recession.
However, they raise the prospect that Mr Fraser might feel constrained to
raise interest rates to keep inflation low and head off overseas pressure on
the Australian dollar.
The optimistic view is that Mr Dawkins will take sufficient action in his
August budget to convince the markets that the government is serious about
restraining inflation and balancing the federal books. That would lay the
groundwork for a further rally across the board.
But the finance minister's lack of concern suggests that he intends to stand
by his view that the deficit will disappear as growth accelerates.
Friday's events suggest that the market does not believe him.

unprecedented in the last 40 years. . . And quite soon interest rates would
have to go back up again - to much higher levels than they are today.' - Mr
Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the exchequer, July 10 1992.
RECENT events in the gilts market have underlined the pitfalls of peering
into the future. Not only have short-term interest rates fallen since
Britain was forced to leave the ERM last September, but the same trend has
been apparent for long-dated gilts which are more important in determining
long-term borrowing conditions.
The events of the past six months illustrate that the economic theory behind
the chancellor's speech to the European Policy Forum last July was extremely
flimsy. They also indicate the degree to which the environment for
international bond markets has improved, due to slow growth and generally
weak inflationary pressures in many parts of the developed world.
Even though last week yields for most classes of gilts moved up ahead of
this week's biggest-ever gilt auction, the market has performed far better
in recent months than most people in the Treasury and the Bank of England
appear to have expected last autumn.
Mr Mervyn King, the Bank's economics director, spelt out in a speech last
week how official thinking has shifted. 'Departure from the ERM led to
sharply lower expected interest rates in the short run.
'By contrast, rates in the long run were expected to be higher than before,
suggesting that that there was some loss of counter-inflationary credibility
from our (ERM) exit. But this loss was small, and since then there appears
to have been some restoration of long-run credibility.'
Since the ERM exit, bank base rates have come down from 10 per cent to 6 per
cent. Ten-year gilt yields have dropped from 9.1 per cent to 7.7 per cent,
while yields for 25-year bonds have moved from 8.8 per cent to 8.5 per cent.
Over the same period, the difference between yields for 10-year gilts
compared with 10-year German government bonds has come down from about 1.5
percentage points to about 1.1. This indicates international investors have
reduced the extra 'risk premium' they demand for holding UK securities as
opposed to German ones.
The move to lower gilt yields has partly reflected the shift in this
direction for virtually all the main bond markets since the autumn. It also
underlines reduced worries about price pressures in the UK economy over the
next year or so, together with only muted concern about the level of gilt
issues needed to finance the growing public sector borrowing requirement.
Meanwhile, buying pressure for gilts has been helped by the more resilient
tone to sterling in recent weeks.
The pound gained 1 pfennig on Friday to close against the D-Mark at DM2.43,
some 10 pfennigs up from its DM2.335 level at the beginning of the month.
Over the next few months, many bond specialists expect gilt prices to fall
with a consequent rise in yields, as the implications of the expected Pounds
50bn PSBR in the financial year beginning next week sink in.
Such thinking was a factor behind the 15 basis point increase in yields at
the long end of the gilt market last week, with attention focusing on the
Pounds 3bn auction next Wednesday of a new class of 20-year stock - the 8
per cent bond due in 2013.
News of the amount of stock due to be auctioned by the Bank led to some
technical switching down the yield curve, leading to a price fall on the
week of about 2 points as measured by the June gilt future.
The reduction in prices probably augurs well for the success of the auction
 -the first in a series due roughly once a month over the coming year - as
it increases the probability that foreign and domestic buyers will want to
buy gilts.

FT  29 MAR 93 / US Money and Credit: Fears of inflation continue to haunt
bond investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST week was not a good one for the US Treasury bond market. Investor
sentiment continued to be increasingly bearish, the price of the benchmark
30-year Treasury bond fell by more than one and a half points on the week
and fears about inflation were still haunting the market.
Bond investors have in the last few weeks convinced themselves - albeit in a
rather artificial and perhaps even mistaken manner - that they were staring
at all the ingredients needed for a sell-off.
Since mid-March, when fears of inflation were rekindled by statistics that
in retrospect seem misleading, the market has been in a distinctly sour
mood.
Last week this worsened after professional dealers ended up holding the bulk
of more than Dollars 26bn worth of new two and five-year Treasury notes that
were auctioned.
The malcontents of the market prevailed so substantially that it turned out
to be of little consequence when, last Thursday, the Senate approved
President Clinton's deficit-reducing budget package faster than had been
expected.
Bond prices continued to slide on Friday and the only explanation is that
all the good news about the deficit reduction measures and prospects for
economic recovery had already been priced into the market back in January,
at the time of Mr Clinton's state of the union message.
Ms Kathleen Camilli, chief economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez, the bond
market advisory firm, reckons the perceptions of both faster growth and
higher inflation have been overdone.
She, like other economists, says the reason is that some of the recent
consumer price and producer price statistics overstate inflationary
pressures. 'In reality, inflation is still running at about 3 per cent
annually and it will continue to be held down by global competitive
pressures and moderate wage gains.'
Mr Philip Braverman, DKB Securities chief economist, takes a similar view:
'For the moment the market is responding to misleading suggestions that the
economy is strengthening, that inflation is mounting and that credit growth
is beginning to accelerate.' In fact, according to Mr Braverman, credit is
still constrained and inflation will dissipate with a renewed economic
slowdown.
Since the February employment report was released on March 5 the bond market
has been functioning in a trading range of yields between 6.75 per cent and
6.92 per cent on 30-year paper. On Friday, the price of the 30-year Treasury
bond was 102 9/32 to yield 6.94 per cent, compared to a price of 103 31/32
and a yield of 6.81 per cent a week before. The current yield is the highest
level since January.
It didn't help matters that last week's auction of Dollars 15.25bn of
two-year notes and Dollars 11bn of five-year notes put the paper mainly in
the hands of professionals. Retail buyers remained on the sidelines.
This week the market will focus on the new unemployment report that is due
to be released on Friday. Ms Camilli forecasts an unchanged unemployment
rate of 7 per cent and the addition of 137,000 payroll jobs for the month.
That compares to a February rise of 365,000 such jobs, but this number will
probably be revised downward by about a sixth.
Mr Braverman argues that Treasury bond investors should not only reverse
their sell-off mentality, but expect lower yields in the near term. However,
this will depend on other factors such as the first quarter GDP report, to
be released at the end of April, and the Treasury's plans for its May
refunding operation, to be announced in early May.

FT  29 MAR 93 / International Company News: Exceptional gains lift Belgian
retailer as sales growth slows

<TEXT>
UNDERLYING profits at Delhaize 'Le Lion', Belgium's largest retail group,
slipped in 1992, and sales growth slowed.
However, the group announced a 46 per cent rise in net consolidated profits,
because of exceptional gains on the disposal of Treasury stock and the sale
of its Pingo Doce supermarkets in Portugal.
The company, which forecast a sharp increase in profits in January, reported
net consolidated profits of BFr6.38bn (Dollars 189.3m), against BFr4.37bn in
1991. Stripping out the exceptional gains, net profits emerged at BFr3.86bn.
The directors are recommending a net dividend of BFr20 per share, against
BFr17.4 in 1991, and an additional BFr6.6 a share to celebrate the group's
125th anniversary.
Overall sales rose by 5.3 per cent to BFr327bn from BFr310bn, in spite of a
7 per cent fall in the value of the dollar. Turnover was dominated by the
Belgian stores which increased sales by 6.3 per cent to BFr91.1bn.
In the US, the group blamed a sluggish economy and last year's alleged
attempts to 'smear' the reputation of the Food Lion stores for a 13.2 per
cent fall in net profits after depreciation. Sales increased by 11.8 per
cent to Dollars 7.2bn, but net profits dropped to Dollars 178m from Dollars
205m. Despite the US difficulties, Food Lion increased its chain from 881
stores to 1,012 and intends to open up to 110 supermarkets this year.
Sales slowed at Super Discount Markets based in Atlanta, but it returned to
the black with net profits of Dollars 600,000. Delhaize said its Czech
subsidiary, which operates seven stores in Prague, earned a small profit,
while its Greek operation increased operating profit.

rights issue

<TEXT>
ADIA, the troubled Swiss employment agency which plunged into loss last
year, has passed its dividend for the second year running and proposed a
recapitalisation involving a SFr250m (Dollars 166m) rights issue.
The net loss, at SFr219m, was slightly larger than estimated in January, and
compares with a profit of SFr25m in 1991. The group faced heavy
restructuring costs following excessive diversification in the late 1980s
when it was controlled by Mr Werner Rey, the disgraced financier.
Revenues were flat at SFr3.2bn. Core businesses accounted for SFr128m,
non-core businesses SFr5m, with the remainder coming from write-offs. Net
debt at year end was SFr922m compared with SFr1.48bn a year earlier.
The directors proposed cutting nominal share capital to SFr22.6m from
SFr225.6m and nominal participation certificate capital to SFr2m from
SFr20m. A rights issue would be launched, on the basis of 11 bearer shares
at SFr100 for each nine held and 11 class B participation certificates at
SFr100 for each 45 held.
The rights issues would be underwritten to the extent of SFr200m by Mr Klaus
Jacobs and Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus, which between them hold 56.2 per cent of
the votes and 43.2 per cent of the capital.
Asko said it would consider selling its stake in 1994 or later once the
group had returned to profitability. Adia said it could have a small loss in
1993.

FFr148.9m

<TEXT>
PUBLICIS, one of France's largest marketing services groups, maintained net
profits at FFr148.9m (Dollars 26.7m) last year in the face of fierce
competition in the European advertising market.
Mr Maurice Levy, chairman, said that in spite of the difficult trading
climate Publicis had produced a 'satisfactory performance' during the year.
The group's turnover was static, at FFr19.9bn although Publicis said it
would have risen by 5 per cent if there had been constant exchange rates.
European advertising agencies had a tough time in 1992 because of the
economic slowdown and the long-term trend away from conventional media
advertising to other forms of 'below the line' marketing, which are often
less profitable. These problems were aggravated in France by concern about
the effect of le loi Sapin, the new regulations on media buying.
However, Publicis managed to compensate for the sluggish state of the market
by winning new business. Its new accounts include the advertising for
Perrier and Vittel mineral water, which it was awarded by Nestle, the Swiss
food group, following Mr Levy's role in co-ordinating Nestle's
communications strategy during its bid battle for Perrier.
Mr Levy said Publicis hoped to maintain sales in 1993, but warned that
profits could be affected by the impact of le loi Sapin and by continued
cuts in marketing budgets.

group up for sale

<TEXT>
WEDDEL New Zealand, the meat company owned by the Vestey family of the UK
though their Union International group, plans shareholding changes including
a search for a new large shareholder.
This follows a decision by the Vesteys to sell assets to restructure their
businesses.
Mr John Prendergast, Weddel managing director, said the family planned to
sell about 50 per cent of the company, which is the fourth largest in New
Zealand.
One option was to find an overseas investor to buy 30 per cent of the
company, and sell the remaining 20 per cent through a public flotation in
New Zealand.
Weddel has appointed Buttle Wilson, a New Zealand sharebroking firm, and SG
Warburg of the US to advise on a trade sale, and Cavill White Securities,
another New Zealand broker, to advise on a public flotation.
Mr Prendergast said the flotation would be scheduled for the last quarter of
this year with Cavill White as lead broker and manager.
Weddel operates five large processing plants in the North Island. In 1992,
it recorded sales of NZDollars 563m (Dollars 296.3m). It processes and
markets 11 per cent of the country's mutton and lamb, 17 per cent of its
beef, and 27 per cent of its veal.
Mr Prendergast said most of its products were sold internationally through
the Weddel brand, the world's largest and most recognised internationally
traded meat brand.
The company has shareholders' funds of NZDollars 70m, and has operated in
New Zealand since 1900. Mr Prendergast said the capital raised would enable
it to undertake a number of projects.
Mr Terry Robinson, Union International chief executive, said Weddel had
traded successfully and because it held an important part in the global meat
market, Union International was keen to retain a large strategic
shareholding.
Weddel's position would be enhanced by winning an appropriate partner and
from additional funding.
'This proposed restructuring would enable Weddel to optimise its trading
opportunities from the increasingly competitive position of the New Zealand
meat industry and from improving prospects of global trade arising from the
Uruguay round of Gatt negotiations,' Mr Robinson said.

CREDIT Lyonnais, the state-owned French bank that controls MGM, the
loss-making Hollywood studio, has taken the unusual step of hiring Creative
Artists Agency (CAA), the leading Hollywood talent agency, to advise on the
management and strategy of the bank's Dollars 3bn entertainment industry
loan portfolio.
The hiring of CAA, whose chairman Mr Michael Ovitz is considered the most
influential power broker in Hollywood, comes in the wake of controversy,
lawsuits and a flood of red ink from MGM.
Credit Lyonnais took control of the studio last year after a bitter court
battle with Mr Giancarlo Parretti, the controversial Italian financier who
received a Dollars 1bn loan from the bank to buy MGM in 1990.
For Mr Ovitz the deal with Credit Lyonnais marks another step towards his
goal of expanding from the handling of movie industry talent to investment
banking.
Mr Ovitz has worked on deals such as the Dollars 6bn acquisition of
MCA/Universal, the Hollywood studio, by Matsushita of Japan and the Dollars
3.4bn purchase of Columbia Pictures by Sony of Japan.
MGM is believed to have suffered a 1992 operating loss of about Dollars 80m,
or half the previous year's deficit.

GIROCREDIT, Austria's third largest bank, has reported an 18 per cent fall
in 1992 operating profits to Sch1.3bn (Dollars 113m) from Sch1.58bn.
The bank employed Sch2bn in hidden reserves to cover provisions for bad
loans last year - less than half the amount in 1991.
The dividend to its shareholders, who consist of various Austrian savings
banks, has been cut from 8 per cent to 3 per cent. Mr Hans Haumer, chairman,
forecast an increase in 1993 earnings after operating profits for the first
two months climbed 17 per cent from the year earlier level.
Assets of Girocredit climbed 3 per cent to Sch324bn from Sch315bn.
Girocredit, which acts as a clearing house for Austria's savings
institutions, is in talks with Erste, the Vienna-based savings bank, and
several leading provincial banks to combine most of the savings and loans
sector.

retailer, posted continuing losses for the six months to the end of January
due mainly to sluggish sales of women's wear.
Renown changed its accounting year-end to January 31 from December 31. It
reported non-consolidated pre-tax losses of Y6.41bn (Dollars 55.7m) for the
six months. This compares with losses of Y14.88bn for the seven months to
the end of July 1992.
Sales came to Y113.5bn, compared with Y109.2bn for the earlier seven months,
having been hit by falling consumer demand in Japan. Net losses emerged at
Y5.99bn against Y14.88bn and losses per share at Y21.61 against Y68.92.
The directors recommended a dividend of Y3.75 a share for the six months,
against the previous seven months' Y4.4.
For the 12 months to January 1994, the company hopes to return into the
black, expecting pre-tax profits of Y1bn on sales of Y102bn.
The company based its improved forecast on an increase in the number of
shops, expected strong demand for the Aquascutum and J. Crew brand clothes
and the introduction of the group's own brand, Next Eye. Renown introduced
Aquascutum brand clothes in Japan last autumn, and J. Crew in spring 1992.

INCHCAPE, the motor and business services group, is expected to report
substantially increased pre-tax profits, from Pounds 185m to about Pounds
248m, when its 1992 results are published on Monday.
Interest will focus on how the group has integrated Tozer Kemsley Millbourn,
the motors and retailing concern bought for Pounds 383m at the end of 1991
and which is thought to have enhanced earnings. Analysts will also want to
hear how Toyota and Mazda vehicles are faring now the car market is at last
showing signs of recovery.
Interims, also on Monday, from restructuring Lucas Industries, one of the
largest UK engineering groups, will provide few surprises. The group has
already made clear its 1992-93 first half will be little better than the
previous year when it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 200,000. But it is
expecting to earn enough over the full year to pay a maintained covered
dividend of 7p, pointing to total pre-tax profits of around Pounds 75m.
Pearson, the diversified group which includes the Financial Times in its
range of interests, is forecast to show a fall in 1992 profits when it
announces on Monday. Analysts are looking for around Pounds 140m to Pounds
146m, compared with Pounds 173.8m the year before. However, a maintained
dividend is expected. Low activity in the US oil industry will have hit
Camco, while recession will have taken its toll at Royal Doulton and the
entertainments divisions.
Construction company Taylor Woodrow is expected to reveal pre-tax losses for
last year of Pounds 65m to Pounds 70m when it announces results on Tuesday.
Analysts are expecting more than Pounds 60m of write downs to bring the
company's land bank and properties into line with current market levels.
After cutting its dividend at the interim stage, the final is also likely to
be cut, possibly to 0.5p compared to 7.64p last year.
Analysts following Burmah Castrol believe the lubricants, chemicals and
fuels group will on Thursday report annual profits ranging from Pounds 82m
to Pounds 86m, compared with Pounds 79m in 1991.
The uncertainty arises because concern over the group's exposure to the
faltering German economy, increased by its acquisition of the Foseco
metallurgical business, is balanced by prospects for synthetic oil products
in the US.

FT  27 MAR 93 / International Company News: Purchases boost Watts Blake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATTS Blake Bearne, the clay producer where three large shareholders are
looking to sell their 45 per cent stake, yesterday announced a 28 per cent
profits increase helped by acquisitions in the US and Europe.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 5.67m to Pounds 7.25m in 1992. At the
interim stage, profits were 7 per cent higher at Pounds 3.74m.
Mr John Pike, managing director, said the figures were 'very pleasing. With
a sale of our shares in the balance, its nice to produce results rather
against the trend in our industry,' he said.
The three shareholders - Ceramics Holdings, Sibelco and Quarzwerke - are all
private companies controlled by overseas interests. They said the shares
were for sale in January. Since then no further announcements have been
made.
Mr Pike said the situation was unsatisfactory since the sale did not involve
the company.
Turnover increased 14 per cent to Pounds 69.8m (Pounds 61.4m) with all
markets except the UK recording stronger sales. In the US turnover doubled
because of acquisitions.
Watts uses average exchange rates and sterling's fall in value compared to
the D-Mark led to exchange rate gains of about Pounds 200,000. Exchange
rates should continue to help the company this year, Mr Pike said.
Watts, which is the world's largest supplier of ball clay, revalued its
mineral reserves during the year with the result that a surplus of Pounds
15.9m over book value was added to reserves.
Earnings increased by 22 per cent to 23.1p (18.9p). A final dividend of 8p
gives a total of 10.7p (9.3p), a 15 per cent advance.
The shares were unchanged at 445p.
COMMENT
Results ahead of expectations and a timely asset revaluation should raise
the asking price for the three shareholders' stake - if a buyer can be
found. One has to assume the three went public with their sale plans only
after failing to induce any buyers to come forward privately. Further, the
fact no one appears to have expressed interest since the shares were put on
the market two months ago suggests either the asking price is too high or no
one wants effective control of the company. Either way, the situation is
unhelpful for management and employees who are very much out of the loop.
For shareholders, however, there is no harm holding on. Forecast profits for
this year of Pounds 8m put the shares on just over 17 times. That is not
demanding given Watts' hold over its markets and the outside chance a bid
will eventually come through.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Scots TUC urges peaceful demonstration at Timex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS WERE last night making urgent efforts to avoid a repetition of last
Monday's violent picketing outside the Timex factory in Dundee, where the
US-owned company last month sacked and re-placed its workforce after a
strike.
This came as the Court of Session in Edinburgh granted a new interdict
(injunction) to Timex limiting the number of pickets outside the plant to
six and requiring picketing to be peaceful. The AEEU had appealed against a
similar interdict granted to the company earlier in the month.
Mr Campbell Christie, general secretary of the Scottish Trade Union
Congress, urged people planning to take part in next Monday's demonstration
to stay within the law and keep to the rules set by the AEEU engineering and
electrical union, which is involved in the dispute. He said: 'We will not
welcome anyone coming to Timex who does not accept the discipline of the
AEEU. Anyone not prepared to do so should stay away.'
The appeal, made after talks with Tayside police, was aimed at leftwing
groups such as Scottish Militant Labour, which took part in last Monday's
picketing in which 16 people were arrested when 600 demonstrators battled
with police.
But Scottish Militant Labour said it again planned to bus in supporters from
other parts of Scotland to join the picket line on Monday and appealed to
other groups to follow suit.
Mr Tommy Sheridan, leader of Scottish Militant Labour, who was arrested in
last Monday's clashes, said he would be in Dundee but not at the picket
line. Last Tuesday he appeared in court accused of breach of the peace and
was ordered not to go within a mile of the plant.
At a news conference in Glasgow he quoted an appeal from Mr John Kydd, the
sacked Timex union convener, for trade unionists, political parties 'and any
individuals the length of breadth of Britain' to support the Monday picket.
The violent picketing last Monday is embarrassing to the unions which, while
backing the sacked workforce, see little chance of winning the dispute and
do not wish to be associated with either Militant or violence.
Last night Timex welcomed the STUC statement and said that if there was
compliance with it and with the new interdict 'there ought to be no
repetition of the violent and disorderly behaviour' to which its employees
had been subjected.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Probe continues as BP fraud case ends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE jailing of two oil industry 'information brokers' yesterday marks the
end of the first phase of a continuing Serious Fraud Office corruption
investigation involving some of the best-known companies in European
engineering.
Mr Paolo Sorelli and Mr Josef Szrajber were both found guilty of conspiring
to defraud British Petroleum. Sentencing was adjourned until April 23, and
both will remain in custody until then.
BP fell victim to fraud because staff members sold confidential details of
its contract tenders to middlemen supposedly denied access to such
information. This was then passed, for a price, to companies competing for
the highly lucrative engineering contracts associated with oil production in
the North Sea.
These companies included Thyssen, the German steel giant, Sulzer Pumps GB,
Borsig GmbH and a number of large Japanese concerns.
The corruption centred around the sealed-bid tender system operated by BP -
a system regarded throughout many industries as the best practice means of
achieving maximum value when putting work to tender. But by cultivating key
BP personnel within the oil company's procurement department at Harlow in
Essex, the two middlemen, Mr Sorelli and Mr Szrajber, subverted the system
and earned substantial commissions by selling information to tendering
companies.
Mr Sorelli made the contacts with BP staff, while Mr Szrajber sold the
information to bidding companies. A former BP employee named in court as one
source of the information sold by the men was Mr Alan Owen, a former chief
buyer with the company's procurement department.
The complex sealed-bid system was manipulated in a variety of ways. The
information could be used to either undercut a rival bidder or push up the
price BP was eventually charged.
On other occasions it enabled an advantage to be gained during negotiations,
supposed to clarify technical and other details, which took place between
BP's procurement staff and a bidding company after the bids were in.
The sums involved were considerable. The sample charges put before the jury
concerned 11 contracts awarded between 1988 and 1990 for pipes and pumping
equipment worth up to Pounds 50m each.
The commissions were usually worth 2 per cent or 3 per cent of the contract
values. Those paid to Mr Sorelli for the 11 contracts totalled more than
Pounds 890,000. Those paid to Mr Szrajber amounted to about Pounds 524,000.
Further sums totalling almost Pounds 300,000 were paid to others, including
BP and Thyssen staff.
One Thyssen employee, Mr Manfred Reuss, took regular commissions when his
company won a contract, the court was told.
The corruption first came to BP's attention early in 1990 when it was
alerted to irregularities within its procurement department and an inter-nal
investigation was launch-ed.
During the searches of Mr Szrajber's home police found records which
outlined his system of receiving and paying his commissions. This discovery
led the police to Mr Sorelli.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Exxon and Shell in Dollars 3bn gas venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL Dutch Shell and Exxon have agreed a joint venture with Japan's
Mitsubishi and Venezuela's national oil company for a Dollars 3bn (Pounds
2.1bn) gas project in eastern Venezuela.
The Christopher Columbus project, which has been under discussion for three
years, involves gas production from offshore fields near Venezuela's Paria
peninsula.
The joint venture partners also plan to build a gas processing plant onshore
with the aim of exporting around 700m cu ft per day of liquefied natural
gas, mainly to the US, by the end of the decade.
The project is one of the largest ever undertaken by Venezuela's national
oil company, PDVSA, and is the first time foreign companies will be allowed
to invest in Venezuela's natural gas sector since the industry was
nationalised in the 1970s.
The agreement signed in Caracas yesterday committed the joint venture
partners to invest about Dollars 200m over the next two years on preliminary
development work.
It also settled differences between the partners over access to Shell's
technology to be used in the liquefaction process, which had held up the
three-year-long negotiations.
Lagoven, one of the operating units of PDVSA, initially estimated that the
total cost of the project would run to Dollars 3bn, although the partners
have not revealed any official forecasts. Some observers expect it to cost
much more.
A Dollars 30m feasibility study and initial geological surveys indicated
that the area contained around 15bn cu ft of gas in four fields.
There are still some questions which must be resolved. The partners want
taxes applied to the project, to be set at the maximum corporate rate, not
at the rate used for most activities in the petroleum and natural gas
industries, which reaches over 65 per cent.
In addition, the Venezuelan Congress must approve the terms of partnership
and the commercial association to develop the gas fields.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Two guilty in BP fraud case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO businessmen who sold confidential details about tenders received by
British Petroleum to steel and engineering companies competing for North Sea
contracts were convicted of corruption yesterday in London.
The convictions at Southwark Crown Court mark a success for the Serious
Fraud Office which brought the prosecutions as part of a wide-ranging
inquiry into a number of alleged corruption cases.
Mr Josef Szrajber and Mr Paolo Sorelli were both found guilty on seven
counts of conspiring to defraud BP by their use of information relating to
tenders for pipes and pumping equipment. Sentencing was adjourned until
April 23. Both men were remanded in custody until then.
The court heard how Mr Sorelli, an Italian businessman based in Bayswater,
London, cultivated staff in BP's procurement department and paid them to
pass over details of tenders received through the company's sealed-bid
system. The information was passed to Mr Szrajber, a Polish businessman
based in Mayfair, who sold it on to companies competing for the business.
The companies benefiting from the fraud included Thyssen, the German
steelmaker, Sulzer Pumps GB and several large Japanese engineering concerns.
Both defendants had argued that their actions had not been dishonest and had
been normal commercial behaviour.
After returning their verdicts, the jury heard that Mr Szrajber had earlier
pleaded guilty on another corruption charge for which he had received a
nine-month suspended sentence.
The trial was the first in a series being brought by the SFO. Other separate
trials pending include those of four men accused of defrauding Shell UK and
two others arrested in connection with contracts awarded for the Channel
tunnel project.

Isosceles debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL BANK of Japan has sold Pounds 70m of Isosceles debt, thought to
represent all or nearly all of its exposure to the retail group in the
middle of a Pounds 1.4bn financial restructuring. The debt was bought at
auction by US investors.
Isosceles, parent of the Gateway supermarket chain, was not officially
informed of the sale, suggesting that it was done on a 'sub-participation'
basis meaning that IBJ would still be regarded as the lender.
The new owners would not have a voice in the restructuring talks.
IBJ said the buyers were supportive to the restructuring and the sale was
made to take advantage of its ability to offset the loss on the disposal
against profits for tax purposes.
Isosceles has a standstill agreement with its lenders which expires on May
28.
However, some trade creditors are beginning to be anxious that a deal is in
place some time before the standstill expires, because they supply the chain
on credit ranging mainly from 30 to 60 days.

Breedon, the limestone quarry operator and housebuilder, suffered a 34 per

ended January 31.
Group turnover fell by 8 per cent to Pounds 8.73m (Pounds 9.49m) but an
increase since October in turnover of the core quarrying business, gave the
Derbyshire-based group cause for cautious optimism.
The housing market was still in the doldrums, the directors said.
An unchanged final dividend of 2.85p is proposed making a maintained total
for the year of 4.6p.
Earnings per share were shown as 4.41p down from a previous 6.85p.

FT  27 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Holliday Chemical offer popular with
institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOLLIDAY Chemical Holdings yesterday said institutions had submitted bids
for 110m shares in its forthcoming placing and offering of 40.7m shares at
195p. The issue, which values the synthetic dyestuffs and speciality
chemicals company at Pounds 161m, will raise Pounds 79.4m, of which Pounds
35m will be for the company.
Mr Michael Peagram, founder, chairman and largest single shareholder, said
the company decided to increase the amount it will raise by Pounds 5m to
reduce debt. This followed City concern that gearing would be unnecessarily
high.
On a pro-forma basis the capital raising would leave gearing at the end of
1992 at about 34 per cent, and interest covered nine times by operating
profits. Net borrowings would be Pounds 15.5m.
The venture capitalists, including 3i and County NatWest, which backed the
buy-out of Holliday from Holliday Dyes and Chemicals in 1987, will be
selling about half of their overall holding. Mr Peagram's 29.1 per cent
stake will decline to 21 per cent.
Holliday's earnings per share have increased from 4.4p in 1988 to 10.9p last
year. In the same period sales rose by Pounds 26.2m to Pounds 97m and
operating profit by Pounds 5m to Pounds 14m.
The notional dividend would be 3.7p giving a yield on the issue price of 2.5
per cent.
Mr Peagram said the group was intent on growing organically and that in the
short term there would be no further cash calls to fund acquisitions.
He said: 'There is nothing on the stocks at the moment, when we do go for
something we will consult with shareholders to see how it should be
financed. We believe our next acquisition could be funded with debt, with no
need for a rights issue until well into 1994.'
COMMENT
Holliday has an impressive record of growth since its management buy-out in
1987. Earnings per share growth has averaged 22 per cent over the last five
years on a pro-forma basis. Organic growth has been augmented by a string of
acquisitions. Some City observers may compare Holliday with MTM. Holliday
says it does not have to find targets to grow and points out that its
acquisitions have reported increased profits every year instead of
contributing one-off benefits. James Capel is forecasting dividend growth in
line with increased earnings of about 20 per cent. Although the shares are
priced slightly higher than expectations they should still open at a
comfortable premium.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Mirror row with Paul Foot grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROW between Daily Mirror columnist Mr Paul Foot and the Mirror
management intensified yesterday after Mr David Banks, the paper's editor
issued a statement saying Mr Foot had been offered a period of sick leave to
rest.
The offer, which Mr Foot denied he had received, was the management's
response to the Mirror journalist's decision to stand outside the paper's
headquarters yesterday morning handing out copies of his unpublished regular
weekly column. Mr Banks had refused to print the column which was devoted
entirely to criticisms of Mirror Group Newspapers' management and directors.
The Mirror editor's statement said: 'Paul Foot has been offered sick leave
so he can have a period of rest. We sincerely hope he seeks professional
help during this time and MGN will continue to pay his Pounds 55,000 salary.
All of us at the Mirror are very sympathetic towards Paul's condition.'
Last night Mr Foot, a nephew of Mr Michael Foot the former Labour leader,
reacted angrily to the editor's statement. He said: 'I am not sick. I have
not been offered sick leave. I have had no contact, verbal or written, with
David Banks or anyone else from the Mirror management today.'
Instead of replying to factual criticisms in his unpublished column, Mr Foot
said that the management had resorted to 'the foulest possible personal
libel'.
Mr Foot has been campaigning against the removal of many long-standing
staff. He wrote in his unpublished column that after months 'exposing
callous sackings and victimisations across the country' it was time to
devote his column to the 'astonishing events' at the Mirror.
Mr Banks said last night that he had been depressed and saddened by Mr
Foot's behaviour but he was not going to sack him. He added that Mr Foot was
'stressed out' and a period of rest would be beneficial.
The Mirror editor said the offer of sick leave was not compulsory and that
Mr Foot could come into the office if he chose to do so.
While outside the Mirror building Mr Foot said he would present another
column next week on the same theme. 'It's up to them whether they print it,'
he said.
The unpublished article also says that Mr David Montgomery, the paper's
chief executive, has been given an option by the group's board to buy 1.475m
MGN shares at 61p - they closed at 104p yesterday.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Clarification on public-sector pay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR civil servants yesterday said that the chancellor had confirmed that
he had committed himself to public-sector pay restraint for one year only.
There has been widespread speculation over recent weeks that this year's 1.5
per cent pay ceiling for public-sector workers might be extended.
But Mr Norman Lamont, in a letter to the Association of First Division Civil
Servants, confirmed that the union's notes of a meeting with him last year
were fair and accurate. These recorded that Mr Lamont said that the 1.5 per
cent ceiling was for only one year and that he did not believe it would be
'practical' for the policy to continue.

FT  27 MAR 93 / MoD 'unable to provide' Iraq papers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT minister admitted last night that his department might have
destroyed some of the documents requested by Lord Justice Scott's inquiry
into the arms-for-Iraq affair.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, minister for defence procurement, acknowledged that the
Ministry of Defence had been 'unable' to provide certain documents requested
by Lord Justice Scott. In a parliamentary written answer, Mr Aitken said it
was MoD policy 'routinely to review and, where appropriate, destroy
documents, usually after five years.
'Following the announcement of Lord Justice Scott's inquiry, instructions
were issued prohibiting the destruction of any relevant papers. I am advised
there are very few documents requested by the inquiry which my department
has been unable to provide,' he said. The admission comes six weeks after it
emerged that Lord Justice Scott was increasing pressure on government
departments he believed were obstructing his inquiry, threatening to name
those that did not provide documents.
The inquiry team said last night that in cases where the MoD had been unable
to provide documents, it had 'generally been possible to obtain them from
other departments to which the work was copied.'
The team said: 'The work of the inquiry has continued without interruption.'
The inquiry team plans to set out next week details of how public hearings,
almost certainly involving current and former ministers, will be held. It
hopes to complete the hearings before parliament rises for the summer recess
in July or August.
Responding to questions from Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, Mr
Aitken also disclosed that the MoD had so far supplied more than 18,000
pages of papers to the inquiry.

FT  27 MAR 93 / The horror of dead children: Dominic Lawson asks why the
deaths of two boys have produced such outrage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'PUT THE IRA UP AGAINST A WALL THEN SHOOT THEM', was the message, in letters
two inches high, on Tuesday's front page of Britain's most popular
newspaper.
The Ulster Freedom Fighters are clearly diligent readers of The Sun. Within
12 hours of the order to kill from Wapping High Command, the Protestant
terrorists had murdered four Roman Catholics, in Castlerock, Co Londonderry.
The Sun was right in one respect at least. It prefaced 'Put the IRA up
against a wall then shoot them' with the slogan 'The Sun speaks out for
Britain.' While such sentiments were not expressed in the House of Commons,
or indeed in any other newspaper, we can be confident that in the pubs and
housing estates of Britain the 'put the bastards up against a wall' argument
outweighed all others. The Sun's extraordinary success is based on its
consistent ability to express what most British people feel, and in demotic
language.
The particular rage caused by the IRA's murders in Warrington is for this
reason: the two victims were children - one three, the other 12.
The murder of children still horrifies in an age sated with horrors. The
popular reaction to the murder last month of another three-year-old, James
Bulger, was a clear sign that we regard the murder of a child as
intrinsically different, and intrinsically more evil, than the murder of an
adult.
It is not more evil, and it is not necessarily worse. I cannot see that the
murders, by bomb blast, of Jonathan Ball and Timothy Parry were more
horrifying or more evil than the shooting down, in the coldest of cold
blood, of James McKenna, Robert Dalrymple, Noel O'Kane and Dee Walsh. All
these men were British citizens as entitled as any of us to the protection
of the law and the state.
The popular outrage at the murder of children is linked to the idea that
they are 'innocent' in a way that adults are not. Leaving aside the now
highly unfashionable Christian doctrine of original sin, such arguments
still seem tendentious, suggesting that the greater number of misdemeanours
that an adult will have committed somehow makes the sudden extinguishing of
his life by violence easier to balance in the scales of justice.
In many ways, the death of an adult is a far more damaging thing than the
death of a child. The death of a mother, for example, destroys a family
completely. The death of a father is scarcely less devastating. This truth,
horrible as it is, is one appreciated in the famine zones of Africa. Those
who have worked for aid teams there have reported that children are
generally left to starve before the adults. This is not because of lack of
love, still less callousness, on the part of the parents. It is just that
those parents know that they, and they alone, can create the family anew, by
producing more children. Without the parents, the whole family would soon be
scattered and extinguished.
One should not blame The Sun for not pointing all this out. Its job is not
to teach its readers philosophy or even biology. But one can perhaps lob a
few verbal bombs in the direction of the Irish government, which has reacted
to the murders of the two children in Warrington with unusual concern,
offering to send an envoy to their funerals.
Let their envoys stay at home. Let them instead remove from their
constitution the clause, so encouraging to the IRA, which demands the
annexation of Northern Ireland. Let them instead give support, not
obstruction, to British forces attempting to control the border movements of
the IRA. Otherwise they might find a British government following The Sun's
Northern Ireland policy.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Ten good ideas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW London-based think-tank named Demos opened for business this week. I
wish it well, for we are in need of fresh thinking and radical solutions if
we are to escape the malodorousness and apathy that now blanket the northern
hemisphere.
(Things are far more cheerful in the southern hemisphere. I was there a
short while ago - Bali, as it happens. They are all extremely well and happy
in the southern hemisphere, working like the clappers, reaching for
prosperity, sipping coconut and mango juice, doing a spot of wood-carving,
selling rubbish to the tourists, making babies by the billion and generally
canoodling and carrying on while we north of the equator slip deeper into
stupor and depression).
In particular, I hope that the mega-brains at Demos take a razor to the
tottery institutions that are still clinging to power in places such as
Britain, even as the millennium rushes towards us.
Some weeks ago there was an article in The Times in which some old dodderer,
some dangerously complacent relic, claimed that the only thing wrong with
Britain was the recession; that it would be a blunder to tinker with the
institutions - Parliament, the law, the monarchy, what have you - that had
served us so well for hundreds of years.
He couldn't have been more wrong, for what this interminable recession has
done - I suppose we should be grateful - is expose the decaying hulk of poor
old Britain to phosphorescent scrutiny. And what have we discovered? We have
discovered that our institutions are riddled with the pox. That our ruling
class has rabies. That our industry has evaporated. That Europe can't stand
us and that the US now distrusts us.
We need big ideas fast. Here are 10 improvements that the mega-brains at
Demos may care to toy with:
1) Despatch the whole of John Major's cabinet, and most of the shadow
cabinet, to one of the world's quiet places. If the electorate in all its
thickness won't turf the government out, firm steps must be taken. Bhutan
springs to mind. There is a shop in Bhutan called Dolly Tshongkhang Shop No
15 which (I have spoken to the proprietor) would happily employ most of
these displacees, except John Smith. Bhutan will not touch him, so he can go
to Paraguay. As the late Nicholas Ridley said shortly before his death, any
half-way competent leader of the opposition should have winkled John Major
out of Downing Street long before now. The only minister we will keep is
Norman 'Hercules' Lamont, the one man in the cabinet who - by taking the
flak for John Major's policies - deserves some respect.
2) Sack the House of Lords and abolish all titles.
3) Reduce the House of Commons to 250 MPs, none of them older than 40, and
treble their salaries.
4) Introduce proportional representation and hold regular referenda,
starting with Maastricht. The fiasco of Britain's attempt to ratify the
Maastricht treaty shows how debauched our system and our politics have
become.
5) Withdraw the vote from 80 per cent of the electorate. In future, the
right to vote will be determined by a sophisticated equation related to
property ownership, educational attainment and personableness. When I voted
in the UK election last April I was horrified at the people trooping in and
out of the polling station. They should never have been there. Just look at
the result.
6) Sack the judiciary and most of the police, and fine all lawyers two
years' salary. God, how we hate them. Ditto accountants.
7) Fine Queen Elizabeth II Pounds 10m every time one of her racehorses
finishes outside the first three. She is supposed to be an expert on
bloodlines, but her horses are famously dim and slow. This should prove a
far swifter method for dismantling the House of Windsor than siphoning off
dribs and drabs in income tax.
8) Slap a VAT of 700 per cent on all tabloid newspapers. That way, the
neanderthal working class will be encouraged to start reading a better class
of newspaper instead of wallowing in the smuttiness and jingoism that are
sapping their lifeforce. As a corollary, ban Rupert Murdoch from setting
foot in Britain and bust up his empire.
9) Sack Brian Clough as manager of Nottingham Forest. He has become a
wretchedly stupid man.
10) Burn the place down; we need to start again.

FT  27 MAR 93 / As they say in Europe: The art of dismal non-politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LE MONDE told me that the French election causedthe departure of a man who
had been a member of the National Assembly since 1936. He was Edouard
Frederic-Dupont, aged 91 and unknown to the general public.
That was the most interesting thing on the outcome I read in that or any of
the other 28 French commentaries I glanced at. But only Le Figaro produced a
view that I had expected to be universal. The Socialists had lost, said
Alain Peyrefitte, because of their 'passivity in the face of the brutal
Common Agricultural Policy imposed by Brussels and Anglo-Saxon pressure in
the Gatt.' Many cling to that geopolitical solipsism that masqueraded as a
foreign policy until the Gulf affair of 1991.
Apart from that, everybody agreed that voters were fed up with the ageing
and scandal-prone socialists. Nobody explained why that was a reason for
giving a colossal majority to a coalition led by Jacques Chirac and Valery
Giscard d'Estaing.
But, as France's leading television political analyst, Christine Ockrent,
said a day or two before the vote: 'Politics are very old fashioned.' And
she is right: the idea of two parties raving at each other about how much
better they can do than the other lot seems, to say the least, a little
passe.
There is a new 'non-politics' based on a shortage of topics for
disagreement. It has made inroads even in France. Compare the lack of debate
today with the situation of a decade ago when the Socialists nationalised
the banks - a process which is now being reversed. Anyone who suggested bank
nationalisation today would be regarded as a lunatic. Yet the case for
nationalising banks in 1993 is no less strong than it was in 1981 when they
had succeeded in wrecking the economies of only the developing world.
The main constituent of 'politics' is that you promise the moon and either
ruin the economy trying to achieve it or say you have achieved it come what
may. 'Non-politics' means saying you cannot do anything very much and that
there are no alternatives to what you are doing. Electorates have rejected
the old but they do not much like the new. As one Paris paper put it last
week: 'The French want no more broken promises or unrealisable dreams. They
ask those who will govern them from next week to open the prospect of a
solution tomorrow for their problems of today.'
In Germany there is a belief that what happened in the French election will
be repeated next year there. Germany is suffering scandal fatigue too. As
the Mannheimer Morgen put it, apologies and promises to do better will not
be accepted: 'Being in politics no longer means you can get away with saying
'sorry.''
The political scene is as dismal as in France: what passes for debate comes
down to tedious discussions about tax rates or something known as repo
fixing. All this reflects an almost Europe-wide phenomenon - the area of
legitimate discussion has become appallingly constricted. Except in Italy,
where the agenda is unlimited.
In Britain the Budget debate was between the government and the City of
London; local politics ended when Mrs Thatcher substituted what Friedrich
Engels saw as an essential constituent of a future communist state - 'the
replacement of the government of persons by the administration of things.'
The British cannot vote for higher local taxes any more because the
government has banned them.
Non-politics are reflected in an insight that provides another dimension to
Ms Ockrent's apercu. When he gave up his job as 'peace envoy' in the former
Yugoslavia last year, Lord Carrington was accused by a radio interviewer of
having pursued wrong policies. 'They were the right policies,' replied the
noble lord, 'It was just that they didn't work.' That was a truly
non-political answer and it provides a key to many riddles.
The idea that the right policies may not work is not absurd. Imagine a
television interview today about the 'failure' of the policies outlined in
the Sermon on the Mount. 'But excuse me, didn't you give a pledge to the
meek that they would inherit the earth?' The right reply would be, more or
less, the same as that of Lord Carrington, with, perhaps, the addition of
the words 'But only time will tell.'
This is much better than the political answer - 'You have to realise that at
the time we had no idea that unrighteousness would continue so long; it is
today a universal problem. And let me say that in the last 2,000 years we
have done far more for the meek than the other parties managed in the 3,000
years before that.'
It was a sign of the times that an electoral earthquake took place last week
and it hardly mattered. The papers wrote about the end of an era. No-one,
not even the victors, spoke of a new one opening.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Private View: A tussle with the sphinx of City Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPHINX of City Hall was living up to his reputation. Tall,
powerfully-built and belying his 75 years, Tom Bradley, mayor of Los
Angeles, sat stiffly upright in the ersatz luxury of a hotel suite and
impassively rebutted all criticism of his megalopolis.
What else could he do? Bradley was in London this week at the start of a
European tour, taking in Frankfurt, Paris and Milan, to promote his city as
a tourist and investment haven barely a year after its reputation - and
large parts of its fabric - were shattered by riots described as the worst
in American history.
Mayor Bradley has other compelling reasons for his taciturnity.
Chief of them is that the four white police officers accused of beating a
black driver, Rodney King, are back on trial in a federal court. It was
their unexpected acquittal in a state hearing last April that touched off
the inner city mayhem.
Also, Bradley has discovered the political danger of talking out of school.
On a similar trip to Tokyo a few years ago he was reported as saying that
'drive-by' shootings occurred in a limited area of the city and involved
mainly black or Hispanic gangs. A remark obviously designed to reassure
potential tourists was unfairly translated by a political rival back home to
mean Bradley was indifferent to bereavements in black and Latino families.
But, more than this, Bradley's identification with the city he has led for a
record five terms - he is standing down at the end of June after 20 years -
means that every wound it suffers leaves a scar on his own reputation. For,
despite the gloom cast over his final year by riot, recession and deficit,
Bradley believes his mayoralty - the inward investment, the Pacific links,
the 1984 Olympic Games, the new metro system, the after-school education
scheme - has been a great success.
Even the most sober visitors to Los Angeles, however, are now asking whether
the sprawling city of 4m people in a county of 9m is too big to govern.
Is it? I asked him.
'No, not by any means,' he said. 'It's a big city, second largest in
America. It has many problems, but I think that the richness of the
diversity of the city is what makes it special. We are the most ethnically
diverse city in the whole world. That offers both a challenge and an
opportunity . . . a challenge for people to live together, work together,
side by side in peace and harmony. That's been one of our great achievements
over the last 20 years I have been mayor.'
He might have been quoting a City Hall hand-out.
Los Angeles does not fit the common European perception of American cities
as moribund ghettoes surrounded by affluent suburbs, he said. It is more
diverse than that. Nor does he accept that 'ethnic diversity' can turn out
to be a euphemism for warring ghettos and no-go areas.
'The ethnic communities may be separated in part,' he said, 'but you find
people of different racial backgrounds in every section of the city, not in
conflict, not in disharmony.'
What about the sheer pressure of immigrant numbers? Is that something you
can cope with?
The mayor laughed indulgently. 'From the beginning of our country, we have
had large numbers of immigrants who have come in. Immigrants are not the
problem.'
But unemployment, budget cuts and poor housing had combined to leave people
feeling angry, not at other racial or religious groups, but at society as a
whole,
Most accounts support Bradley's view that last year's explosion was not
racial in character, unlike the Watts riots of 1965. The mayor described it
as the work of people 'striking out' in an opportunist fashion against any
convenient target. The fact that immigrant Korean storekeepers took the
brunt of the destruction had 'no special rationale.'
So does Los Angeles have a race problem? I asked.
'Not just because of the size of the city. There are people in parts of the
city who, because of poor education or lack of jobs, do suffer economically.
'I came from conditions of severe poverty and the city offered an
opportunity to me. Based upon the quality of the education I received, I was
able to advance, I was able to achieve, I was able to take advantage of the
opportunities offered.'
Although Bradley has been criticised for being too close to the white
business community - and four years ago repaid some private earnings after
admitting to unwise financial dealings - his own background gives him every
reason to sympathise with the struggling poor and to extol the American
Dream.
'The thing that made a difference in my life was good education,' he said,
'a spirit of determination, the confidence and belief in myself and my
abilities . . . an uncompromising determination to achieve according to my
capabilities.'
The second of five children born to sharecroppers in Calvert, Texas (just 20
miles from Waco, where a siege of armed religious zealots continues), Thomas
Bradley was taken to Los Angeles by his parents at the age of seven. He
graduated from the University of California, then Southwestern University
law school and joined the Los Angeles Police Department, where he rose to
the rank of lieutenant. His promotion blocked, he resigned in 1961 and
practised law until entering politics as one of the city's 15 powerful
councillors.
It was in the police force that his feud began with Daryl Gates, the former
police chief whose maverick rule of the LAPD - a force glamourised in
countless films and TV programmes - was exposed after the Rodney King affair
by a Bradley-appointed commission. This was led by another local lawyer,
Warren Christopher, now President Clinton's secretary of state.
But when I suggested that if there was one thing wrong with Los Angeles, it
was the police - that they were too few for the job and had acted (according
to some residents) like gangsters themselves, Bradley was angry.
'Absolutely untrue. The overwhelming majority of the police officers are
professional in their conduct, their training and their performance. Some -
and I would say a very small number of them - are engaged in excessive use
of force, in discourtesy toward people. But to call them gangsters is an
insult. Anybody who says that simply doesn't have the foggiest notion what
the city is like or what the police are like.'
Until that moment, I had felt rather like Brer Rabbit swiping at the
tar-baby and succeeding only in getting his paws stuck. Mayor Bradley, like
a confident but cautious boxer in the middle of the ring, would not take a
single step back - but nor would he come forward.
Except on the subject of education. Perhaps seeing his own career as an
example, Bradley returned time and again to the need for education to give
inner-city youths some prospect of work, some sense of belonging.
He turned down flat my suggestion that the city's own constitution (a weak
mayor and strong council) might need reform; but he was prepared to
criticise the educational system in the US generally for failing the young,
and the Reagan and Bush administrations for withdrawing federal support from
cities over the past 12 years.
Californians are still the richest people in the US, despite suffering more
than most from recession and defence industry cuts. But they have also been
reducing their own taxes for years through a series of state referenda. When
I suggested that the better-off citizenry did not pay nearly enough tax,
Bradley was short: 'I'm not going to get into that argument. What is
enough?'
I persisted. Are we talking about two societies, the rich on their
surfboards having a great time and the wretched people in the inner city
who, once in a while, break loose and burn the place down?
'You're trying to get an answer in 15 minutes that takes sociologists a
lifetime of study. I'm not going to try to give you some simplistic answer
to very detailed and complex problems.'
He resisted, likewise, my invitation to identify the chief task of the
successor who will be elected mayor next month.
'Every candidate has lived there for years. They know, or should know, the
problems and the opportunities. It's not my responsibility to try to help
them to find what their programme should be.'
Still, I said, after 20 years you might be entitled to express a view,
however tactfully you put it.
'Except that I don't do that. I don't engage in advice to candidates.'
You have managed a big city for as long as anyone on earth, I said.
'And very successfully,' Bradley put in.
So you must have some wisdom to purvey to the rest of us - the millions of
us - who live in cities.
'I don't think you can compare one city like London with Los Angeles and try
to find a simplistic slogan that would be the answer to the problems of all
the cities of the world,' he replied.
When he steps down, Tom Bradley is to join a Los Angeles law firm. I asked
him what he would be doing for them. 'Soliciting clients.'
At 75, I said, don't you want to sit down and put your feet up? 'No,' he
smiled, but without enthusiasm. 'I wouldn't think of that.'

FT  27 MAR 93 / Arts: A Hammer of sorts - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By B A YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERE IS a novelty. Jonathan Holloway's The Hammer, Radio 3's Sunday play,
was adapted by the author from Red Shift Theatre's stage play and at Radio
3's commission, produced independently by Essential Productions under the
author/director. Red Shift has never before been in broadcasting, but
Essential has done one earlier independent production for Radio 3.
Broadly speaking, Holloway's story concerns the search for St Quentin's
reliquaries in the priest-holes of an old house where they were hidden in
the 16th century. An interesting story it is, where events overlap from
century to century, the characters re-created as needed; but I confess I
found the tale hard to follow.
Scenes are dotted about in a pointilliste way over the years, and I found
inadequate interest in character and insufficient forward movement. The
playing was competent but the parts gave little chance for excitement.
Perhaps none of these qualities would be seen in a live performance, but
radio drama has rules of its own.
File On Four is Radio 4's answer to Panorama. This week, The Whole Truth
dealt with an increasingly important phenomenon, prosecution witnesses at
trials threatened until they decide not to give their evidence. One girl
agreed to appear and, after she did, was attacked by three other women. She
was found a place in a hostel under an alias, but sure enough came phone
calls asking for her by her real name. In the end, she withdrew.
Some judges will allow witnesses like this to appear under false names, or
behind screens, and the police will protect unwilling participants - not,
however, for the rest of their lives, and many cases are lost by the
withdrawal of promised evidence. I found this feature vital and alarming.
Less urgently, Radio 4's The Making Of Christine on Thursday related the
feelings of a man who had always felt himself to be a woman, and in his
fifties had the courage to get surgeons to make him one. One would have
liked some surgical detail, especially as he claimed to have a functional
vagina; but we only had the reactions of his family (wife and two children),
friends and of course himself. There were difficulties in choosing clothes
and using public toilets, but most people were helpful. I reckon this too
superficial a way to treat such a case.
Gilbert and Sullivan are both interesting in their several ways, and I was
happy that Radio 2's Sullivan Returns To Earth last Saturday was mostly
D'Oyly Carte music with just enough biography, played as drama by Richard
Baker (composer) and John Ayldon (librettist) to separate the numbers. I
suppose the title celebrates Sullivan's devotion to light music rather than
to rubbish like 'the long day closes'. And while we are on Radio 2 music,
best thanks for Eddie Lang on Tuesday, memories of the great guitar-player
we heard with bands such as Red Nickels's Five Pennies, the guitar still
played as a musical instrument.
Wilfred Owen, who had a double tribute on this page last week, was still
with us from Monday to Friday when Kenneth Branagh read poems and letters on
Radio 3. He read splendidly, but he read as an actor. Poems like 'The
Century' should surely suggest the feelings of a young officer or NCO
actually confronted by the appalling horror recorded. As Owen wrote, the
poetry is in the pity.
I must note two other good Owen programmes from last week, the World
Service's Meridian and Radio 3's Strange Meeting on Friday with John Wain -
both centred on the poet rather than the poetry.
Too soon to enthuse over John Hurt's reading of Anatoly Pristavkin's The
Inseparable Twins as Radio 4's Book At Bedtime. I have only heard three of
the ten instalments so far.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Arts: Pale new light on Britten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1898, when Henry James's The Turn of the Screw was first published, one
reviewer described it as 'the most hopelessly evil story that we have ever
read'. The subject of the corruption of children was an inflammatory one
even then, long before the days of the video nasty.
If it had been scheduled just a couple of days earlier, this production of
Britten's operatic version of the story by the London Royal Schools' Vocal
Faculty could have been included as part of the extensive Festival of
Britten. Instead it was a near miss - a verdict that might equally be
pronounced on the performance, in spite of the impact this opera always
makes in a venue of the right size.
In the Royal College of Music's Britten theatre the music sounded stronger
than it has for years at the London Coliseum. Michael Rosewell conducted and
a respectable student orchestra put the score across with vivid colours and
urgency.
This was in contrast to the paler impression made by events on stage, where
Julia Hollander's production only intermittently set up enough tension
between the characters to make the spine tingle.
From this academic year the Royal College and the Royal Academy of Music
have been pooling their resources so as to give their operatic productions a
wider choice of singers. This Britten opera was convincingly cast, if not
notably well sung. As the Governess, on whom the story's moral axis turns,
Marianne Hellgren was properly strict, outwardly cool, though the vocal part
invites the unleashing of resources as yet beyond her means.
Denise Mulholland's darker and a touch wilder soprano was well suited to the
infernal Miss Jessel. Walter Dixon portrayed an unusually corporeal Quint,
who was at times tempted away from singing the notes. Janet Fairlie played
Flora as a bossy big sister to Samuel Burkey's Miles, marvellously
impressionable and involving, as he had been at ENO. It cannot be often that
little Miles is the most experienced member of the cast.
The closing scene of Act 1, when the boy, half frightened and half intrigued
by the approach of danger, is being seduced by the ghost of the evil Quint,
was by far the most chilling of the performance. Watching it again in the
knowledge of the recent revelations about Britten's private life really does
shine a different light on the whole opera.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Arts: Grade E for Mr C . . . - Clement Crisp despairs of a
'Bejart-vu phenomenon'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER AN absence of more than a decade, Maurice Bejart has brought his
forces back to London's Sadler's Wells. Not the former cohorts of
bare-chested men and stabbing-point women. Not, the apologists would have us
believe, the old spectaculars that could fill the Boboli Gardens and the
Grand Palais with physical hyperbole and enough gassy philosophising to
launch a hot-air balloon.
This is the new, slimmed-down Rudra Bejart company from Lausanne, leaner in
forces and concentrated in effects, and more personal. After seeing Mr C . .
., which opened a Sadler's Wells season on Thursday night, I can but report
that the difference is imperceptible. This is what it always was, a
Bejart-vu phenomenon, more flatulent and more heart-sinkingly awful than any
I have seen from this choreographer in the past 30 years.
Mr C . . . is allegedly 'about' Charlie Chaplin. I start with the
disadvantage of finding Chaplin marginally less entertaining than war,
pestilence and famine, and I am damned if I will subscribe to Bejart's
comment that 'He is love, and no-one can resist loving him', nor his belief
that he was a 'sacred cow who invented cinema' and 'the greatest dancer
ever'.
These quotes may give some indication of Bejart's concerns during this
90-minute exercise in mega-tedium. They do not, though, prepare us for the
appearances of Chaplin's daughter, Annie, who acts as mistress of these
desperate ceremonies and is Very Vivacious Indeed; nor of Chaplin's
grandson, Charlie Bubbles, who has the air of a man lost in a maze - for
which no-one can blame him in these surroundings.
The sequence of events during this hour and a half - was that all? I know
that empires fell, and dinosaurs came and went on the Earth - defeats
rational comment. The curtain rises to reveal the heaving posteriors of
Bejart's chaps - a motley crew, and still bare-chested - and thereafter
various sideways-on glances are cast at Hollywood and Chaplin's films. (They
are obligingly catalogued by Miss Chaplin and Mr Bubbles, laundry-list
fashion). We see Sennet bathing beauties; an audition by various grotesques;
a baying performance by Martyn Fleming as the bearded bully of those early
Chaplin silents. Gems from Romeo and Juliet are spoken into telephones by
Miss Chaplin and Mr Bubbles (whose calls were not to the RSC, I am certain).
There is also a cat, performed with unseemly roguishness by Juishi
Kobayashi, and a fat girl in a pink dress playing a trombone. No further
warnings should be necessary. Chaplin is impersonated with some discretion
by Gil Roman, and I wondered what that fine dancer Koen Onzia was doing in
this galere.
It remains for me to note that much of the accompanying score is confected
from Chaplin's own saccharine little tunes, and that design is minimal and
dull. Of dramatic purpose, structure, dance merit, or even good
old-fashioned entertainment, I could discern no trace. I do not think even
Charlie Chaplin deserves this sort of treatment, though the subtle moment
when Chaplin boxes with his daughter, and is knocked out by her, seems to me
to be not without significance.
After Mr C .., the Iron Maid of Nuremberg would be welcome. The programming
plays a clever card by presenting Sylvie Guillem in Bejart's newest creation
for her. He has shown her in other successful pieces - Mouvement, Rhythme,
Etude at the Paris Opera was a first dazzling study of her gifts - and Sissi
is no less apt. It is concerned with the Empress Elizabeth - or rather, with
a madwoman who thinks she is the Empress.
At curtain-rise Mlle Guillem is found en beaute in a white crinoline by
Gianni Versace, looking like a Winterhalter. Two attendants are there to
dress her, and Olivier Chanut serves as both courtier and doctor in an
asylum. But this is essentially a bravura solo, whose action shifts between
the Empress's longings and her final assassination, and the woman's
fantasies and her agonised mental state. It is intriguingly constructed, so
we believe in both personae.
Regal manners and hallucinatory suffering alternate. Mlle Guillem speaks
Kennst du das land with a simplicity and poetic grace that mark her
portrayal of Elizabeth; then (in a vestigial shift) probes the woman's
anguish with flashing technique. The piece is a vehicle, and richly decked
with emotional and physical cliches. Without Mlle Guillem, it would be
insufferable. With her, it is fascinating. Her performance has a relaxed
assurance, a command of feeling, that shows a new maturity in her abilities.
She is everywhere touching, dance and expression fine-tuned. The
accompaniment is a mish-mash of scores; the design simple. Nothing detracts
from the authority of Mlle Guillem's grand impersonation.
Rudra Bejart Lausanne is at Sadler's Wells, with mixed programmes, until
April 3.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Arts: Royal Shakespeare Company's touring production of
Richard III
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard of Gloucester: 'Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes.' Simon Russell
Beale, back from injury, plays Richard in the Royal Shakespeare Company's
touring production of Richard III, newly returned to Stratford at the Swan
Theatre. His superb Richard has verve and wit enough to make villainy
enthralling; he is by turns vicious, icy, and funny. Other highlights are
Stephen Boxer's limber Buckingham, Kate Duchene's Queen Elizabeth and
Christopher Hunter's vexed Hastings. The simple plain set and monochrome
lighting leave space for the play to bustle in. The plot unfolds at great
pace from the moment Richard opens the action under a bare light bulb.
Intelligent detail fills out the evening, with a fine end in the Malmsey
butt for 'false perjur'd Clarence' and the terrifying dreams at Bosworth as
Richard is cursed by his victims' ghosts. Sam Mendes directs. In Repertory
until May 1 (Box Office 0789-295623).

FT  27 MAR 93 / Arts: Brave stab at Glinka
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR ITS latest venture the ever-enterprising University College Opera has
staged Glinka's Ruslan and Lyudmila - the full five-act opera, uncut it
seemed. 'The Tsar of operas', Tchaikovsky called it; Alexander Serov,
Russian critic and composer, countered by deeming it 'not a drama, not a
play, hence not an opera, but a randomly assembled gallery of musical
scenes'. This work divided critical opinion from the start - and continues
to do so - but its seminal importance in the history of Russian music is
indisputable: it became a veritable source-book for Russian opera composers
even into the 20th century.
Ruslan (1842), Glinka's second opera, earned him the title 'father of
Russian music', a label fitting for a composer who mixed Italian convention
with bold new form, 'fantastic' harmonies, vivid oriental colours and
magical subjects. It was also the first of countless operas derived from
Pushkin - though the poet's untimely death scotched the possibility of his
collaboration with Glinka, who then began writing music for the opera before
he had a libretto. Hence the dramatic muddle that has ensured the work's
neglect.
This production at London's Bloomsbury Theatre was a brave, welcome gesture
by University College Opera, but the odds were stacked against the students
even before they began - Ruslan makes virtuoso demands, on the orchestra
especially. Tuesday's performance got off to an inauspicious start, dogged
by the non-arrival of programmes, a scrappy overture and wayward choral
singing. Throughout the evening the chorus was consistently under-projected
 -a problem compounded by the strange decision to give this unknown work in
Russian, or rather (to borrow Andrew Porter's phrase), partly in Russian and
partly in gibberish. At least one English translation exists: it was used by
University of Reading Opera in 1976.
The students deserved stronger guidance than they got. The music (under
David Drummond) was played in a generalised mezzo forte, and the production
matched it. Mike Ashman - often an admirable producer - staged the opera
aimlessly on a featureless raked stage, in designs (by Bernard Culshaw) that
lacked magic; an understandable shortcoming, given the shoestring budget.
From the large cast three singers stood out. Elizabeth Hetherington was a
touching Ludmila, and Michael Preston-Roberts was well cast as Bayan and
Finn - his tenor has the right tone for these plaintive Russian character
roles. Most impressive was the soprano Helen Kucharek as Gorislava. Her
performance suggested Slavonic glint, and was sung in well-projected
Russian.
At least UCO hinted at the many merits of Ruslan and Lyudmila, making its
neglect by major companies hard to understand. If The Golden Cockerel and
Christmas Eve are worth doing, then why not this important Russian opera?
Bloomsbury Theatre, London, WC1. Final performance tonight.

<TEXT>
AMERICAN GHOSTS AND OLD WORLD WONDERS by Angela Carter Chatto &amp; Windus
Pounds 13.99, 146 pages
OPERATION SHYLOCK by Philip Roth Cape Pounds 14.99, 398 pages
AMONG the few writers of English Gothica Angela Carter must rank high. She
made the difficult transition from the impecunious life of the experimental
novelist to that of a writer who received enormous respect and acclaim from
her colleagues while also commanding decent sales, before her life was cut
short last year by cancer at the age of 52.
A line from Freud quoted in one of these pieces could well serve as her
motto: 'Reason becomes the enemy which withholds from us so many
possibilities of pleasure.'
Highly intelligent and erudite, she fought hard to reconcile her intellect
and her imagination. It is the struggle between these two faculties that
characterises her work. She is perhaps best known for The Bloody Chamber,
her wild Freudian versions of traditional fairy tales, one of which was
filmed as The Silence of the Wolves.
The nine pieces assembled here represent various aspects of a quirky talent,
but they are not among her best work. Compared to the exuberance of her
accomplished 1985 collection Black Venus, these are rather thin and
tentative. a 'Lizzie's Tiger', one of the few conventional 'stories', is a
prelude in a minor key to 'The Fall River Axe Murders'. Carter's
unforgettable account of the day that 'Lizzie Borden with an axe/gave her
father forty whacks' which appeared in Black Venus. Sometimes in this first
section there is an odd feeling that one is reading a pastiche of Angela
Carter rather than the real thing.
The five 'Old World Wonders' are more interesting, and typically
unclassifiable. A lightly humorous piece,'The Ghostships', describes the
unforeseen problems when the early Puritan settlers of Massachusetts attempt
to ban Christmas. 'Ashputtle or The Mother's Ghost' offers three versions of
the Cinderella story, each more beguiling than the last. 'Alice in Prague'
is a baffling tribute to a Czech film animator, verging on the
incomprehensible, but still able to delight in its inventiveness.
The latest novel by Philip Roth (of Portnoy's Complaint fame), Operation
Shylock, is like a long and very bad Woody Allen movie, a simile which would
not amuse the illustrious author. Besides sharing an American Jewish
background, Allen and PR are both neurotically self-obsessed and given to
manic behaviour, long-winded arguments and feeble jokes.
Roth's joke is to state in the Preface that this book is 'as accurate an
account as I am able to give of actual occurrences ..that culminated, early
in 1988, in my agreeing to undertake an intelligence gathering operation for
Israel's foreign intelligence service, the Mossad' The punchline comes at
the end: a Note to the Reader beginning 'This book is a work of fiction . .
.'
If the 398 pages between these two claims had been either credible or
faintly amusing it would have made a better joke. As it stands it is no
laughing matter. We are asked to believe that a Philip Roth doppelganger
turns up in Jerusalem campaigning for 'Diasporism' - the return of Ashkenazi
Jews to their European countries of origin, which would lead to the
liberation of occupied territory by reducing Israel's population. Roth fears
that the existence of his double is a recurrence of old depressive symptoms.
However, when a job for the New York Times takes him to Jerusalem he comes
face to face with his 'other'. The complications caused by the two being in
the same city are of course mighty, and given the state of Arab-Israeli
relations in 1988 also potentially dangerous.
'Existence is surely a debate . . .' goes the epigraph from gloomy
Kierkegaard and so is this novel. Arguments about Jewish identity, Israeli
aggression, the rights of the Palestinians, anti-semitism, and so on, are
expounded relentlessly at full volume.
The effect is exhausting: like being buttonholed by a bore. This is a pity
because on those rare occasions when Roth is not arguing, he manages some
crackling descriptive prose which reminds one of how good he can be.

<TEXT>
SONGS OF ENCHANTMENT by Ben Okri Cape Pounds 14.99, 297 pages
TALLER WOMEN by Lawrence Naumoff Flamingo Pounds 5.99, 289 pages
FUCKING MARTIN by Dale Peck Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 9.99, 228 pages
ST PATRICK'S DAUGHTER by Margaret Mulvihill Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 14.99,
252 pages
THE BOOKER PRIZE casts a long shadow, although whether for good or evil is
open to debate. Some authors never write another book after winning
Britain's top literary award; others write the same one again and again, in
the hope of reliving past glories. Some achieve only fleeting fame, others
become so notorious that the mere mention of their name can start a riot.
And always there is that nagging feeling: after the Booker, what next?
For Ben Okri, who won it two years ago with The Famished Road, the answer is
a sequel, Songs of Enchantment, which takes up more or less where the
earlier book left off. Azaro the spirit child is older now, growing up in a
world as crazy as ever, living with his parents in dire poverty while all
around him an unnamed African country slides inexorably into chaos.
This is a land where foreheads catch fire, eyes fall from sockets, babies
impregnate themselves and the sky splits open and fish swim in the cracks.
There are also Jackal-headed Masquerades, tree stumps that scream in the
night, a Party of the Rich and a troupe of malignant spirits which roams the
forests, entering people's thoughts at will.
Got the picture? It helps to have read the first book, because questions of
when, where, why, how and who are not addressed at the beginning of the
second. The author launches into a lot of stuff about the seven mountains of
our secret destiny and the song of a circling spirit, a song for those of us
who never see that beyond the chaos there can always be a new sunlight.
Well, yes, but what one was hoping to see was a novel, with a beginning, a
middle and an end, some characters on the way and perhaps some sort of
plot-induced crisis that could all be resolved satisfactorily in the final
act. It is what fiction used to be about, after all. And will be again, once
the current fad for Satanic Verses-style fantasy has run its course.
In fact Okri can tell a perfectly good tale when he sets out to, as he has
already shown in two volumes of short stories. Fans of The Famished Road
will doubtless enjoy the sequel as well, but those who prefer a more
realistic edge to their fiction might opt instead for Lawrence Naumoff's
Taller Women, a droll and sharply funny look at the sex war, as seen through
the eyes of a group of deeply conventional American suburbanites.
Chief among them is Lydia, a hospital administrator, who lives with her
doctor boyfriend but spends much of the time analysing his defects to her
friend Martha. The two of them are the epitome of American womanhood, who
look and think the way American women have been trained to look and think,
and know without a doubt that they are at the cutting edge of all that a
modern woman ought to be.
Actually of course they are prisoners of the American Way, pre-programmed to
talk non-stop nonsense about everything, and to be deeply satisfied with
themselves for doing so. Naumoff sends them up rotten, with plenty of
whip-smart dialogue and some hilarious insights into the absurdities of
human nature. His biography reveals no background of TV sit-com writing, but
that is the kind of writing he does, and very good it is too.
Dale Peck's first novel Fucking Martin was called Martin and John in
America, but we British have stronger stomachs and are not offended by rude
words. Fucking Martin is about the size of it too, because there are several
characters called Martin in the book, and several called John as well. The
author is telling several stories within a story, each with a different set
of characters with the same name, and it is not always easy to distinguish
between them.
That said however, it is a remarkably mature work for a young writer, albeit
one still a little obsessed with his parents. There's an awful lot of 'My
mother . . . my father . . . ' in the book, which reads very much like the
autobiography of a young homosexual brought up in Kansas and now living in
New York. His theme is the fashionable one of being gay in the time of AIDS
and he handles it well enough, without the stomach-turning sexual detail
that you find in the work of Alan Hollinghurst, Aldo Busi or even Edmund
White.
St Patrick's Daughter, by Margaret Mulvihill, is set in London, Dublin and
Paris, but mostly London. It tells the story of a handsome but feckless
Irishman who flees wife and daughter in his native land and sets up in
Camden Town, where he ekes out a living as an assistant in a second-hand
clothes shop.
He is joined by his daughter, who thinks of herself as St Patrick's child
because her father once played the title role in a minor film about the
saint. She finds her father not quite as saintly as she had expected, but
plenty of fun all the same. Mulvihill's humour is sly and gentle, her
observation acute. The story has no great plot, but this is meant to be
'slice of life' writing rather than a rattling good yarn.

'Oh Lord, rebuke me not in thy indignation . . . ', begin the Penitential
Psalms written, according to medieval opinion, by King David.
AROUND 1500, Jean Bourdichon, versatile court painter to the French king,
produced an astonishing image of the sort of thing guaranteed to excite the
Almighty's wrath: King David peering from a bow-window at a sizzling
Bathsheba. It is just one of many lovely things to be seen in The Bernard J.
Breslauer Collection of Manuscript Illuminations, now at New York's
Pierpoint Morgan Library on 39 East 36th Street (closed Mondays).
Sadly, this exhibition of 104 single illuminated leaves, publicly exhibited
for the first time, finishes on April 4. (The scholarly catalogue costing
Dollars 49.95 (Pounds 35.10) can be bought mail-order; 212-685-0008.)
Breslauer is a distinguished rare book-dealer who has built up his
remarkable collection over 25 years. It consists of illuminations dating
from the 11th to the 17th centuries, roughly half of them by Italian
Renaissance artists. Not to be overlooked is an early 20th century
contribution by the execrable Spanish Forger whose additions to two
14th-century Italian leaves have a certain piquancy: it was a director of
the Pierpoint Morgan Library who in the 1930s, debunked this now
sought-after faker.
Bathsheba, one the other hand, is very much the real thing, down to her
anatomically correct genitalia. Even the elder Cranach did not dare as much
with his goddesses and nymphs. His dumpy Bathsheba washing her feet is fully
dressed. Whereas minor 16th century German masters went further in their
erotic prints, the memorable thing about Bourdichon's Bathsheba is that she
should feature in a devotional book.
The four splendid Bourdichon leaves in the Breslauer collection once
belonged to the so-called Book of Hours of Henry VII, now in the British
Library in London. However, it is more than likely that this book was
painted not for Henry Tudor, but for the louche eye of a French king.
Traditionally, the Psalms were illustrated by the Penitence of King David,
expiating in the wilderness his sin of first committing adultery and then
sending Bathsheba's husband to his death in the front line. Penitent David
features in a Book of Hours made by a French painter for that much-sinning
monarch, Henry VIII.
It was quite another thing to show Bathsheba, the seductive little baggage
who caused all the trouble. Yet it appears that this became a speciality of
French illuminators. Bourdichon's bathing beauty suggests that there were
ways of cheering up the time a king was expected to spend on his knees.
No one now dismembers medieval manuscripts for their illuminations, as
collectors did so shamelessly in earlier generations. However, one benefit
of the practice is that a single leaf is a lot easier to display and view
than a bound book. An illustration for the month of October shows a party of
noblemen going hawking in delightful sun-hats. It was made for the sumptuous
Bona Sforza Hours, also in the British Library but minus 16 leaves stolen
when thieves broke into the workshop of the famous Milanese illustrator,
Giovanni Pietro Birago.
Birago valued his loss at a staggering 500 ducats - five times the value
that his contemporary, Leonardo da Vinci, put on his 'Madonna of the Rocks'.
Today, that might seem sufficiently unlikely to make us wonder if perhaps
the artist was trying it on. Because most of us rarely see medieval or
Renaissance books, there is a tendency for the type of paintings we do see
to skew our understanding of the range of skills which connoisseurs in the
Renaissance demanded of artists.
The special value of the Breslauer Collection is that its dozens of
dazzlingly virtuoso images challenge the supremacy of wood and canvas. None
does so more eloquently than Simon Bening's 'Rest on the Flight into Egypt',
one of six leaves in the exhibition by this great Bruges master. This scene
of St Joseph bringing his bonnet full of apples to the seated Virgin,
measures only 4 in by 3 in and yet, unquestionably, it is a tour-de-force.
A harmonious balance of blues and greens beckons the viewer into a landscape
which seems to stretch for miles. Tiny figures, Herod's soldiery, search
unavailingly through the immensity of crags, forests, and meadows although
the spectator feels that there can be no place for evil in this ethereal
country. What a fortunate man Breslauer must be. Might he now be persuaded
to extend his generosity to this side of the Atlantic?

FT  27 MAR 93 / Arts: Life beyond pots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE FRANKEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S first comprehensive exhibition of 20th century ceramics was staged
as recently as 1980, at the Christopher Wood Gallery in London's Motcomb
Street. In the catalogue foreword, historian Ian Bennett claimed that studio
ceramics constituted England's only major contribution to 20th century art.
While some would consider Bennett's assessment unfair, it is indisputable
that ceramics is an art medium no longer to be disparaged as 'crafts'. In
the mid-19th century, ceramics was seen as an integral part of the total art
scene, but in this century fine art has been elevated on to a pedestal all
its own.
'Ceramic Contemporaries', new works by young ceramicists at the Victoria &amp;
Albert Museum, London, (until Wednesday) may remove some of that imposed
distance. Organised by the National Association for Ceramics in Higher
Education (NACHE), an open competition for students and recent graduates
brought in more than 606 applications across the country - a reflection of
the expansion of studio pottery in the last decade. Each applicant could
submit six slides and over 3000 came in. The jury whittled these down to 220
slides from 170 individuals. The Pounds 10 submission fee footed most of the
bill.
The exhibition is exciting, as much for its diversity and energy as for its
technical facility. The spectrum is wide, ranging from the attitudes
expressed by Michael Cardew, who said that pottery is about making pots to
eat from, and Hans Coper, who did not really like working in clay but said
he could not do what he wanted in anything else.
This 'first' (there are rumblings of hope that the show will be repeated
every three years) exhibition is not very much much about pots. The vessel
takes a back seat to the surprisingly high proportion of figurative work.
Ian Ramsey's 'Posse' would get my vote for the most expressive work. Placed
on the floor are 14 nude men on horseback, each man and each horse in a
different posture. These amazing Don Quixotes, with all their circular
wheel-thrown markings, give us every mood and movement, from boredom to
exuberance.
I enjoyed the realism and humour of Catrin Howell's long-nailed 'Balancing
Dogs' poised so emphatically, teeth bared, on all fours, and the flakey cow
of Clare McGuinness, maintaining its one-eared dignity. Humour abounded. A
three-spout jug dares you to get one single flow. R. Dawson's 'Fat Cups',
the lips as wide as a doughnut, represent the ultimate demi-tasse.
Of course there were mugs and teapots, too, and a handsome green/tan coffee
service. Sadly, the tableware was just tableware. The British disease of
worshipping the 18th century does not encourage interesting industrial
production or young talent. All the more shocking, then, to see Dinah Body's
elegant bone china, which looks good enough to be Italian.
The 1980s were the years of greatest expansion at the V&amp;A for studio
pottery; 250 pieces bought, of which 185 cost Pounds 42,672.45, or 85 per
cent of the total money spent in that area over seven previous decades, but
still less than half of 1 per cent of the Museum purchase budget for the
decade.
The largest number of pieces (22) are, not surprisingly, those of Dame Lucie
Rie. Rie is the living master of 20th century ceramics in Britain, perhaps
the world. Along with Bernard Leach and her friend and mentor Hans Coper,
these great names still command high prices at auction.
On March 25, Bonhams held an auction of these greats, and others. The
company has dominated the market ever since Cyril Frankel (no relation to
the writer) moved there from Christie's. Recession or no recession, their
six-figure profit, according to Frankel, has remained much the same as in
the glorious 1980s, leaning heavily on the big names.
Last Thursday evening, Bonhams held an auction of these greats and others.
Only 3 per cent remained unsold and Frankel says it was his best sale there,
a 'confirmation that prices have held up'. Including the 10 per cent buyer's
premium, the sale netted Pounds 257,834. An elegant white Bernard Leach pot
reached its world record price of Pounds 10,000; a pink porcelain conical
bowl by Dame Lucy Rie sold for Pounds 6,500, a Pounds 500 increase over a
similar and superior one sold in 1989. A large unglazed red and orange dish
by the internationally acclaimed potter Kitaoji Rosanjin sold for Pounds
11,000 to a Japanese buyer in the audience. The monumental stoneware pot by
Hans Coper sold to a telephone buyer for Pounds 29,000.
Two more current exhibitions command attention. Contemporary Applied Arts
(43 Earlham Street, London WC2) is showing the ceramic pieces of Gordon
Baldwin until April 17. His work, in particular the blue 'vessels from the
place of stone' is extraordinary.
'Visions of Craft 1972-1993' at the Crafts Council (44a Pentonville Road,
London N1) until May 9 presents, among the 200 outstanding objects, potters
who have put Britain on the world ceramic map: Leach, Rie, Coper, Cardew,
Britton, Poncelet, Henderson, Crowley and others.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Arts: A nude man within reach - Screen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY MARCH, a group of famous women compete for the chance to hold a nude
man in their hands while the world's TV audiences look on. The women are
called film stars; the nude man is called Oscar; and leading the field for
this year's Best Actress contest, on Monday, are the America's Susan
Sarandon and Britain's Emma Thompson.
Let me declare a conflict of interest. Although the Briton in me wants
Thompson to win the statuette for giving the cinema of EM Forster a full
eight-pint blood transfusion, the internationalist in me says something
else: that Susan Sarandon, nominated for Lorenzo's Oil, has spent 20 years
giving even more blood to even more critical stretcher-cases and is overdue
for accolade.
Sarandon's down-home passion as an actress - the low elastic voice, the
pretty-plain features, the hooded eyes that range from half-mast slyness to
full Bette Davis pop-open effect - has raised a dozen films from the dead:
King Of The Gypsies, The Other Side Of Midnight, The Hunger, Uncompromising
Positions . . .
As a reward, Hollywood occasionally throws her a major movie. Atlantic City,
Pretty Baby, Bull Durham or Thelma And Louise which earned Sarandon her last
year's Best Actress Oscar nomination. If she wins this year's, for a film in
which she power-acts everyone off the screen including co-star Nick Nolte,
Sarandon will no doubt get up on the stage and play the appropriate role:
the speechifying, gushing, jewel-bedecked Movie Star. 'I would like to thank
. . .'
But when I met her, filming on location in New York, I discovered something
rarer than the Roc bird. A film actress who tells you what she actually
thinks about the film industry. About the roles it provides for women (and
men); about stage versus screen acting; about how films are born in the age
of high-concept marketing; and about the difficulty - impossibility? - of
being both an actress and a movie star.
Sarandon On Casting And Typecasting. In my career I've been 'discovered'
about four times. 'She's good at playing waitresses,' they say after Thelma
And Louise, so I get offered a row of waitresses] 'She's good at
prostitutes' after Pretty Baby, so every script I'm sent is set in a
brothel. I don't know what they consider a Susan Sarandon role to be. (Wry
laughter).
Sarandon On Anti-Agents And Asking-Fees. When it comes to my choosing roles,
my agents are kind of anti-agents. They never advise me along the company
line. For films like Bull Durham or Light Sleeper I'll take half my asking
price. Because you know that as soon as you get an offer for Dollars 2 1/2 m
with a script that it's going to be horrible. If you don't do the parts you
want to do, you're a prisoner of your own celebrity. We still get paid
obscene amounts of money (laugh and emotive grimace) to do a pretty
ridiculous job. So you keep your living standard lower to get a higher range
of interesting work.
Sarandon On Roles For Women. Thelma And Louise was a breakthrough, but I
don't think it resulted in any consciousness-raising about female roles in
Hollywood. I don't believe there are that many good parts for men either.
It's just that even with bad parts in uninteresting films the focus is on
the man's problems. The women are there in a shallow or caricatured role as
the emotional support. I still don't see that changing.
Sarandon On Film-Making In And Outside Hollywood. Most big-studio projects
today are put together from the poster working backwards. The advertising
concept takes over the movie and the director, scriptwriter, actors all have
to fit in. If you film in LA itself, it can feel very regimented, like a 9
to 5 job. The studios have their rules, the unions too. That's why I love
working on location. Everybody scrambles and helps each other out, the job
definitions are less so strict. Hollywood has become a factory town with all
that follows from that, and I think that's why you don't hear people talking
about pictures there, it's always 'product.'
Sarandon On Acting For Screen And Stage. The difference between theatre and
film, I've always thought, is like that between making love and
masturbation. In theatre you know you're reaching someone - the audience;
and what they give back is taken and changed by you into something that fits
the context of the play. Film acting is very much a self-centred, detached
form of concentration. You have to make individual moments work and hope
whoever puts it together has the same idea you do as to how it fits.
But it's like doing a jigsaw in the dark. In the last scene in Bull Durham,
when Kevin (Costner) comes back to me and we're sitting on the swing and
it's kind of emotional, for that scene we had to keep stopping all day for
the sun, and then go off to shoot bits of a totally different scene in the
rain, then come back to the swing again .. So the director suggested
something that I think was inspired. We played music, so we could find our
way back each time to the same song that had a kind of emotional fertility
for both of us.
It can be maddening to keep stopping and starting all the time. You can
never know if the scene is working as a flow. But I guess that's what's
addictive about movie acting. You're never sure if you're getting it right,
so you keep going back to try again.

THINK OF AN EEL by Karen Wallace, illustrated by Mike Bostock Walker Books
Pounds 6.99, 32 pages
PUBLISHERS of information books for children seldom overcome a problem
inherent in the very idea of communicating information. The information
bearer is, by his very nature, a passionless creature who exists to draw
attention to his message. He must not stand in the way of what he lives to
communicate; he must not make an independent spectacle of himself. He must
be a superlative technician, and not an author in his own right.
Proof of the fact that publishers of this kind of book approve of this
approach and, indeed, consider it necessary for economic and other reasons,
is to be found in umpteen series of books - because information books are,
generally speaking, published in multiples.
Consider, for example, the new Kingfisher 'Little Library' series, the first
eight titles of which are published this month. The format, pagination and
price (at Pounds 1.99 each they represent extraordinarily good value for
money), are all uniform and the first eight titles cover the following
subjects: jungle animals, ballet, castles, space, dinosaurs, jet airliners,
horses and helicopters. Text, illustrations and artwork are crisply and
competently executed, and no young reader is likely to come away
dissatisfied.
And yet there is a problem, and it centres on that question of authorship.
All these books are written by the same person, Christopher Maynard, who has
done an excellent job throughout within the limits imposed by the idea of
the series itself. But how can Christopher Maynard hope to bring an
individual, let alone a quirkish, approach to such a vast range of subjects?
That is the problem: he is not so much an author as a jobbing technician who
is hired for his general level of expertise in a remarkable variety of
subject areas; next month, such a person might well be at work upon a
four-volume history of the Crusades of 128 pages each for ten-year-olds.
Another matter is the question of re-use of material from other books.
According to a note that appears on the copyright pages, some of the
material used in the 'Little Library' series is not original - it was first
seen in the 'Kingfisher Dippers' series of 1989. Publishers of non-fiction -
especially of cookery books - have in the past made a habit of re-using
artwork, and the practice itself underscores the argument that the desirable
end in view from the point of view of the publisher is not so much a book
that is particular to one author (Christopher Maynard's name does not even
appear on the covers of his books; you have to look at the title pages to
discover who has written them) as an appealing amalgam of words and visuals
at an irresistible price; not so much a book as a commodity.
This month Walker Books have done something a little different from the rest
of the pack by introducing an element of real authorship - and therefore a
degree of passion and pleasing quirkishness - into the business of
publishing information books. You can tell that something interestingly odd
and unpredictable is afoot by the very titles of the first six books in the
'Read and Wonder' series: I Like Monkeys, Caterpillar Caterpillar, Think Of
An Eel, All Pigs Are Beautiful, A Piece Of String Is A Wonderful Thing and
Think Of A Beaver.
Here we are already worlds away from the instincts of a marketing department
whose aim is to provide 'books at competitive prices on subjects that
children have a perennial interest in', namely dinosaurs, space, horses, et
cetera. The texts are as various as their subject matters: one is written in
a kind of rhythmical prose, often close to a chant; another is told as a
story. Other useful items of information are strewn about the pages at
random, not neatly boxed, as is usually the case. Nor are the illustrations
closely guarded inside uniform grids and they differ in approach from book
to book - oil pastels for one; black ink and water colour washes for
another. There is everywhere a feeling of space, and a refreshing degree of
inventiveness.
But, above all, the authors have managed to give a sense of real
individuality to the texts: there is both feeling and curiosity, and a wish
to share particular enthusiasms. The well-known childrens' novelist Dick
King-Smith, author of Sophie's Snail and The Whistling Piglet among many
other titles, has written All Pigs Are Beautiful - and that seems entirely
appropriate, because he spent 20 years of his life working as a dairy
farmer.
And which one is the best of this first batch? The most original in subject
matter is undoubtedly Judy Hindley's unravelling of the mysterious history
of string; but first prize must surely go to the collaboration between Karen
Wallace and the illustrator Mike Bostock in Think Of An Eel. Why does this
book succeed so well? The illustrations - watercolours, painstakingly built
up in layers - capture the sinuous movements of eels to a quite uncanny
degree; and the text itself is so bare and so simple that it enables the
extraordinary facts of an eel's life - that strange progress from the
Sargasso Sea and back again to the spawning ground - to speak for
themselves.
The world is a sublime and mysterious place, and children, whether infants
or juniors, will get more than a taste of it - and for it - in this book.

SELF-MADE MAN AND HIS UNDOING by Jonathan Kingdon Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds
20, 369 pages
JONATHAN KINGDON was born and brought up in East Africa where, according to
current theory, humankind's evolutionary roots lie. He went to school in
Oxford, returning to Tanganyika by flying boat for his holidays. On one such
occasion he was presented with an immigration form demanding to know his
race; so he wrote 'human'. An irate official told him to describe himself as
'Caucasian'. Kingdon replied that he was neither a cork nor an Asian.
This early sense of the oneness of the human family anticipates Kingdon's
enquiry into human origins and diversity, the themes of this highly readable
book. Kingdon argues that human evolution has been influenced by technology;
human form, racial differences, the variety of languages and human relations
with nature, are all, he says, in important part the result of human beings'
unique status as 'artefacts of their own artefacts'.
The premiss is simple. Two key tenets of evolutionary biology are that
living things adapt to circumstance, and that circumstances change. If one
applies these thoughts to humanity, one sees that the development of tools
and technologies must have feedback effects on their inventors' own nature.
Food processing technologies obviate the need for powerful jaws and teeth,
and make more diverse food sources available. The Promethean control of fire
makes it possible to occupy cooler regions of the world, as does the ability
to manufacture protective clothing and to build shelters. It also makes
possible the production of more elaborate tools.
The spread of our ancestors, thus facilitated, into territories and climates
very different from humanity's Eden on East Africa's savannahs, is the
source of human diversity. A visible example of this is skin colour. When
humans migrated north into regions where the sun shines less strongly, their
skins responded by losing pigment, so preserving the ability to synthesise
vitamin D from sunlight. Mastery of fire, clothes-making and weapons
technology made the northern migration possible; the 'self-made climate
ordeal' which followed produced 'white' people - 'depigmented ex-Africans'.
On this view technology is the interface between humans and nature, and
plays a major part in influencing mankind's evolutionary direction in the
same way as do climate, food supplies and other recognised factors. It is in
this sense, Kingdon says, that man is 'self-made'.
His book makes a strong case for this claim. The case brings with it other
commitments which Kingdon himself acknowledges as speculative. They include
the idea that Africans have had coastal connections with oceanic Asia from
the earliest times, and that some differences now observable among the
different human races are of very recent origin, perhaps dating back as
little as 15,000 years.
Kingdon sifts the evidence of fossils, paleology and geology to piece
together a story of the spread of early man within and out of Africa. He
applies concepts used by ecologists and zoologists to reflect on food and
water in the evolutionary story, not just its availability as a determinant
of migration but its influence on the development of agriculture and society
generally. Knowledge of sources of water and food, of techniques in the
culture of crops, and of other complex information, necessitated recording
and transmitting information; this combined with other pressures to
emphasise the importance of group cohesion and cooperation.
It is astonishing how various the human need for tools has always been. Our
ancestors used them for hunting, butchering, skinning, making clothes,
building camps and hearths, digging mines, planting, tending and harvesting
crops, and much besides. To make hunting equipment sharp, light and strong
required skill. An excavation near Lake Malawi gives evidence of what was
involved when a band of hunters killed and butchered an elephant. The animal
was cut in three and handled by separate groups. Its tough hide quickly
blunted their blades, so they had to make new tools as they proceeded. The
amount of stone required for butchering an elephant is large, so the hunters
had to carry tool-making kits with them. And they had to work swiftly,
because meat decays in the heat. Kingdon gives a vivid picture of the
ingenuity with which our ancestors faced such challenges.
Kingdon draws a stark conclusion from his account of man as self-making
tool-user: that today we have more powerful tools but less knowledge of
nature and less sense of responsibility for it. That is why we present such
a profound threat to our future. We have directed our own evolution through
our use of technology; now we are in danger of ending the story by the same
means. This is by now a familiar enough point, though it always merits
reiteration. The value of Kingdon's book is that it sharpens the point in a
powerful and fascinating new way.

UTOPIA AND OTHER PLACES by Richard Eyre Bloomsbury Pounds 16.99,
SOME OF Richard Eyre's ancestors were explorers. His maternal grandfather
went with Scott on his first expedition to the Antarctic and had a
crustacean named after him: roydiss formosa. On his father's side of the
family, Edward John Eyre was one of the first white men to visit the centre
of Australia around 1840, and also one of the first to speak up for the
Aborigines. As a boy at school in the 1950s Eyre would read epics about
mountain-climbing. Nowadays, he writes, 'our horizons have contracted and
and the only unexplored territory is the territory of the human soul'.
There are other odd facts about the director of the Royal National Theatre.
His father did not want him to go to university, but he pressed on
regardless and entered Cambridge via physics and chemistry. He switched to
English and claims to have learned far more from Kingsley Amis than from FR
Leavis. He believes he saw a ghost in Cambodia. He idolised Marlon Brando.
For a man whose political persuasions are plainly on the left, his book
contains a remarkable number of favourable references to Winston Churchill -
and not only because it was on the day of Churchill's funeral that he
decided to give up acting and become a director.
This is a tantalising semi-autobiography, far too short to be the real
thing. The family history is selective, almost always detached, as if, in
his own phrase, he is wary of being seen 'standing too close to the canvas'.
As a book about theatre it is selective, too, sometimes simply anecdotal,
but, as in all good direction, it is the details that are telling.
When he was still an actor, Eyre had a virtually one-line part in Macbeth:
'The Queen my Lord is dead.' He rushed onto the stage and spoke it as if
were one long word. 'No, Richard, no,' said Trevor Nunn, the director. 'Milk
it'. He notes advice from the actress Peggy Ramsay about how to tell whether
an actor is in character: 'Look at the feet, dear.'
Then he picks up guidance from the American writer, David Mamet: 'Choice of
actions and adverbs constitute the craft of directing'. 'Get up from that
chair,' Eyre goes on, 'and walk across the room. Slowly.' In other words,
don't just say it; do it. One of the reasons he admired Brando is that he
had the 'ability to appear to think slowly, so that the audience feels it's
being admitted to the intimacy of the thought processes, and embraced as
conspirator in the emotions.' How it all shows in Eyre's best productions
such as The Night of the Iguana]
'Utopia,' which as distinct from the 'Other Places' is never to be found,
pays proper tribute to Harley Granville-Barker, one of the greatest English
language playwrights of this century and the real founder of the National
Theatre. Eyre also lauds, and has clearly learned from, Granville-Barker's
now sometimes neglected Prefaces to Shakespeare. If Amis was his best
teacher, he notes, Granville-Barker was a kind of surrogate father.
At other times, however, Eyre can be remarkably silly. One always thought
that he read too much into Richard III as a role model for Hitler's Germany
and Pinochet's Chile, yet here he is sitting down during rehearsals and
seriously discussing what would happen should Britain become a fascist
country. The Irish designer, Bob Crowley, would be in a concentration camp
for a start, but assuming Eyre was still director 'at what point would I
stand up and say 'No'?'
That is not quite the only departure into fantasy. I suspect from a random
reference that Eyre does not much understand France. Nevertheless, as a
director, Eyre will always make sure that the feet are in the right place.
Firmly.

THE PEOPLE IN THE PLAYGROUND by Iona Opie Oxford Pounds 15.95, 240 pages
IF YOU ever wonder what actually happens to your child on the other side of
the school gates, here is the answer. Children, like everyone else, are
obsessed by food and sex. In the playground, potato crisps are a currency,
doled out as rewards and to win favours. Stories about sex, and sexual and
scatological jokes, are relentless. A real whiff of danger means that 'Kiss
Chase' or 'Snoggers' is being played. And yes, even at seven the male of the
species is 'more egoistical, enterprising, competitive, aggressive and
daring' than the female; he is also more likely to be the exhibitionist or
clown that makes the playground an irresistible place.
Since the 1950s, Iona and Peter Opie have collected the songs and games of
childhood and explored the diversity and longevity of children's customs in
bestsellers such as The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren (1959), still
the classic on the subject. The Opies were the first to suggest the English
playground as an anthropological paradise; now, in The People in the
Playground, Iona Opie charts the fieldwork of weekly visits to a local
junior school over 14 years. Written as diary extracts, this new work at
once sparkles with a sense of being there, of what it is like to be a child
in the alert, fast-moving school yard, and allows Mrs Opie to pull together
a lifetime's observations through particular, vivid details, from seasonal
variations in marbles to the way a story evolves in the telling or a game is
suddenly devised and forgotten.
'I still feel the excitement of the hunter when I hear children coming out
to play,' she writes. The playground as jungle is the overwhelming
impression of her book. Survival is all, which means that friendship works
like a contract; that a powerful girl of eight whose febrile energy can
motivate large groups of children controls playground dynamics as if by
right; and that the need to fight, among boys, or to perform, among, say,
cartwheeling girls, is ever-present.
Judgments against outsiders are speedy, ruthless, matter-of-fact: 'the boys
have been calling her Poofy, 'cos she smells, and they say she's got fleas'
some girls explain, 'as if they were reporting a leaking tap'. Attraction
across the sexes is instantly public and has ten-year-olds earnestly
reciting poems about their peers - such as 'Down in the meadow where the
green grass grows/There stands Linda without any clothes./ Along comes
Andrew clipperty-clop/Down with 'is trousers, out with 'is cock.'
Jokes, as among adults, come from fears - coffins and castration are
favourite subjects - or out of a wish to feel superior, as in the
long-running Irish jokes. Mrs Opie jotted it all down as it was told,
watched by the children - 'A kindly little boy by my side said 'If you can't
spell starkers just put in the nude'' - who emerge sympathetically as a
range of playground types: the raconteur, the defensive loner, the 'mouse
boy'.
Most people will remember them; it is hard to read this bubbling account
without bursts of nostalgia, for the continuity of children's lore, from
'knock knock' jokes to singing games, is astonishing. No one can match Mrs
Opie's breadth of reference here, or the immediacy with which she evokes,
through a single rhyme, an entire mood and culture.
When at Christmas 1978, for example, her pupils sing 'We three kings of
Leicester Square/Trying to sell ladies' underwear/How fantastic, no elastic
. . .', she recalls the 1952 version - 'We are three spivs of Trafalgar
Square/ Flogging nylons tuppence a pair/All fully fashioned, all off the
ration . . .' Such details, VS Pritchett wrote of the Opies' early work,
take you deeply into British life; it is a verdict which holds true for this
fascinating addition to the Opie opus.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Books: Two old pros let their hair down - Anthony Curtis
greatly enjoys the correspondence between authors Flaubert and Sands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS

<TEXT>
FLAUBERT-SAND: THE CORRESPONDENCE translated by Francis Steegmuller and
Barbara Bray Harvill Pounds 20, 428 pages
SOMERSET Maugham said, 'I cannot believe that any English author would
submit himself to the excruciating boredom of sitting for hours while a
fellow novelist read him his latest work. In France it seem to be an
understood thing that he should . . . '
Nowhere do we find the truth of that observation revealed more fully than in
the correspondence between Flaubert and George Sand, spanning the decade
from 1866 to 1876. Their letters have been well translated by Francis
Steegmuller and Barbara Bray - he tackling Flaubert's, she those of George
Sand, a division of labour that works perfectly. Brief notes link each
letter, elucidating references and the travel movements of the two writers.
Throughout Flaubert lived at Croisset near Rouen, his residence for his
entire working life. He had his elderly mother to look after, with a niece
and her husband to help him. He was always reluctant to leave his study at
Croisset but did venture abroad from time to time, to go to Paris to see his
publisher or attend one of the fortnightly dinners at the Magny Restaurant
in the Latin Quarter with the Goncourts, Sainte-Beuve, Renan, Turgenev,
Taine, Gautier and a few other regulars.
At the start of the correspondence Flaubert, in his mid-forties, was already
famous - or notorious - as the author of Madame Bovary and Salammbo;
currently he was in the throes of writing L'Education Sentimentale. George
Sand, 17 years older, was an equally well-established literary landmark,
having long since passed her romantic youth and liaisons with Chopin and
Musset. She lived 175 miles south of Paris, in rural seclusion at Nohant
with her son Maurice and his wife and her two small grand-daughters whom she
adored and helped to educate.
But though she was a doting grand-mere, her career, her literary work,
remained the top priority. Her annual output usually consisted of a novel,
one or two plays and frequent journalism. The contrast between her amazing
facility and Flaubert's hyper-perfectionism - long periods when he published
nothing while he undertook interminable research and re-writes - could not
be sharper.
Yet they had immense respect and affection for each other, two old pros who
were prepared to let their hair down in each other's company, giving us
today a wonderful series of insights into French literary life. He calls her
Chere Maitre - the feminine adjective with the masculine noun says it all.
She refers to him, with a nice sense of irony, as her troubadour. There are
many letters in which one party urges the other to come to stay for a few
days or sends an invitation to a rendezvous in Paris.
Occasional meetings did occur and it was then that the readings from work in
progress that Maugham finds so bizarre took place. In 1868 Sand stayed at
Croisset when Sentimental Education was nearing completion, and she recorded
in her Diary: 'We went upstairs at nine o' clock. Flaubert read me three
hundred excellent pages, which I think delightful. I went to bed at two.
Coughed a lot. The tulip tree is covered with flowers'. Flaubert commented
on the visit to another friend: 'Such character] Such strength] And at the
same time there is no one whose company is more soothing. Her serenity is
courageous'.
As the correspondence develops Sand takes on the role of the counsellor and
Flaubert the one in need of continual counselling. He complains to her of
the obtuseness of reviewers, the rascality of his publisher, the stupidity
of people in general. Apart from smoothing his ruffled feathers over such
constant sources of rage, she consoles him on the death of his great friend
Louis Bouilhet, the poet-librarian at Rouen; and she is there again to
steady him when his mother dies and when his niece's husband's timber
business suffers a serious financial reverse threatening Flaubert with
penury.
Even with two such dedicated writers operating from within their respective
artistic fortresses, politics and contemporary history do break in on them
from time to time. We read of the impact of the Franco-Prussian war and the
Commune. When the invasion began Flaubert was deeply into work on the final
draft of his fictional treatment of The Temptation of St Anthony and -
horror of horrors] - he had Prussian soldiers billeted on him at Croisset.
At least - 'My study they respected', he tells Sand choking with fury. She
commented: 'We've all suffered in spirit more than ever before in our lives,
and shall never cease to feel the wound'. Then, practical as always, adds:
'I wrote down my thoughts and impressions every day during the crisis and
the Revue des Deux Mondes is publishing them in the form of a journal'.
The correspondence ends with her death in 1876 aged 71. Flaubert's tribute
to her indomitable devotion to her work and to humanity was the story he
published - Un Coeur Simple - describing the uncomplaining goodness of a
peasant woman whose huge capacity for love becomes fixated on her parrot.
Before she died Sand, in a particularly explicit letter, defined their
attitudes to their profession: 'My ambition has never flown as high as
yours', she tells him: 'You want to write for all time: I think I shall be
completely forgotten, perhaps severely denigrated, in fifty years' time'.
She was right about him but wrong about herself. These two great writers'
letters to each other make a deeply rewarding book.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Sport: A question of value for Lineker the logo - Soccer /
The rules of the game played on a sales pitch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS MATYSZCZYK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAS Gary Lineker read Francis Fukuyama? In The End of History and the Last
Man, Fukuyama celebrated the victory of liberal democracy over other forms
of government. He added, though: 'The decline of community life suggests
that, in the future, we risk becoming secure and self-absorbed last men;
devoid of thymotic striving for higher goals in our pursuit of private
comforts.' (Thymos is Fukuyama's word for the spirited part of the soul).
This, then, is the question for England's nicest last man. Has he given up
the pursuit of higher goals in favour of a feather-bed of yen?
If the visit to Singapore last week of Lineker's Nagoya Grampus Eight team
is anything to go by, the problem is not that Lineker has sold out for a
less demanding soccer life. Of course, he has. What is more worrying is that
he does not appear primarily to be a footballer at all. He is an advertising
logo: a Ronald McDonald for Toyota.
No one should be surprised that all the media attention in Singapore was on
Lineker's tanned, if tired, looks. He handles the microphone and the
notebook effortlessly. He is patient, courteous, pleasant. But so is Ronald
McDonald. And when Ronald has to shoot a commercial, he has plenty of takes
to get it right, plenty of breaks in filming, plenty of opportunity to fix
his lipstick.
What Lineker learnt in Singapore was that the commercial in which he is
appearing is on the field of play.
He might have thought he had done his bit for Toyota with his media
performance. But to maximise its investment (officially to guide and
protect), the company has assigned Lineker a minder who refuses to leave his
side. In Singapore, Lineker begged a local journalist: 'I can't get this
bloke off my back. Is there anywhere we can slip out after the game for a
quiet drink?'
There was. Tentative arrangements were made. The game destroyed them.
Lineker struggled. Within 20 minutes, he was limping. He had warned that he
had a thigh injury. By half-time, he had touched the ball perhaps half a
dozen times (although, of course, he got a cheer every time he did).
Twenty minutes into the second half, he had managed to score from a penalty
but was in distress, signalling to the bench for a substitution. The bench,
consisting of an extremely corporate-looking manager and a young, timid
coach, ignored him. You cannot remove the logo from a commercial. And there
were more than 35,000 potential Toyota buyers out there.
Lineker then removed himself to the touch-line nearest the bench. That did
not work. In the end, he stood for fully three minutes ignoring his
supporting cast, glaring at the coach, remonstrating, pointing to his thigh
and stretching out his arms in unbelieving supplication. The management
relented with 10 minutes to go.
'I was injured and I could hardly breathe. But they wouldn't take me off,'
said Lineker, angrily. He even ignored supporters' requests for autographs.
Very un-Gary.
Before the game, which Nagoya lost 4-3, I asked him if he thought
footballers would become like golfers and tennis players - rarely needing
actually to win but making a fat living by artfully dodging money from
corporate coffers.
'Not at all,' he said. 'I think 98 per cent of players are not paid a lot of
money. In no way are they in a position to be secure when they retire.'
What is a lot of money?
'Well, that depends on your life style . . . my house in St John's Wood
(London) cost a lot of money. But then, I've won a few games.'
Lineker's experience is part of the latest attempt by business to take over
soccer. But Bernard Tapie and Silvio Berlusconi bought Marseilles and AC
Milan to fuel their egos rather than to sell cars. Toyota, not its chairman,
owns the largest share-holding in Grampus Eight. It is paying Lineker
Dollars 6m (Pounds 4.2m) over two years. But company officials refuse to be
drawn on whether Lineker's success will be measured in terms of goals,
crowds - or sales.
Lineker believes, with great sincerity, that he is having a new adventure,
in a new league, in a country that will one day be a soccer power. But Pele
said similar things about a team called the New York Cosmos. Will Lineker
look back in two years' time and discover that, in 1993, he retired from
soccer and became a car salesman?

FT  27 MAR 93 / Sport: Cambridge fight to turn the Dark Blue tide - Boat
Race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HALLIDAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY a brave person would predict victory for Cambridge in today's varsity
boat race on the Thames for the Beefeater Trophy. Oxford have won the past
six and have lost only once since 1976. It seems that no matter what the
Light Blues do, they cannot break their losing sequence.
Last year, for example, should have been Cambridge's year. Oxford's training
had been affected by the death of John Hebbes, a squad member, and the crew
looked vulnerable. But they excelled, held Cambridge on the outside of the
long Surrey bend and won by 4 1/4 lengths.
This year, Oxford have suffered some pre-race wobbles. A week beforehand
they dropped Gordon Buxton, the cox, and replaced him with Samantha Bentham.
Dropping the pilot this close to the big event smacks of panic. But the
coaching team, led by Steve Royle, said Buxton had found the pressure hard
to handle and was no longer bringing the best out of the crew. Buxton
disagreed and claimed he had been made the scapegoat for one or two poor
performances by the Oxford eight.
Not too much should be read into the late change. Oxford have one of their
strongest crews. It includes two gold medallists at the Barcelona Olympics -
Matthew Pinsent, who won the coxless pair with Steve Redgrave, and Bruce
Robertson, who rowed in the Canadian eight - and a host of other
international oarsmen.
The Dark Blues also have a strong coaching team. Royle has been part of it
for every race but one since 1976, and has been director of Oxford rowing
since 1987. The other coaches include Mike Spracklen, who coached the
Canadian men's eight in Barcelona; Pat Sweeney, who coxed and coached
Redgrave and Andy Holmes to Olympic gold in Seoul; and Jurgen Grobler, the
former East German national coach now in charge of the British team.
Cambridge also have their Olympians. Malcolm Baker and Richard Phelps rowed
in the Barcelona eights final; Baker for the US, Phelps for Britain. The
rest of the crew are all world championship or Henley medal-winners.
The Light Blue coaching team centres on John Wilson, a former Oxford coach,
and Sean Bowden (both based at Nottingham, an area noted for the strength of
its lightweight rowing); and Vladimar Bachev. Cambridge are using a Harry
Mahon, a New Zealander who is Swiss national coach, as finishing coach -
someone who takes over for the last two weeks to bring crews to their peak.
The phlegmatic Spracklen is Oxford's finishing coach. He is considered the
best men's eights coach in the world and takes control of the US national
squad next month. He has a reputation for adding missing ingredients and has
smoothed out the often rough but powerful Oxford crews.
In the past week, he has improved Oxford's timing. On Thursday, when both
boats practised their starts, Oxford were quicker. This is important,
because the lighter Cambridge crew need to steal an edge before the Oxford
engine room develops momentum.
Mahon has monitored Cambridge closely through the winter and, unlike
Spracklen, did not come cold to his task. His first act was to break with
tradition and take Cambridge away from the Thames tideway to train in
Nottingham for the penultimate week. This was seen by some as running from
the enemy. On the other hand, it shielded Cambridge from the media (which
Cambridge suspect is biased towards Oxford) and from exposure to the Oxford
camp, which has sometimes unnerved Cambridge.
Both crews have raced well recently. Cambridge defeated a strong Molesey
crew by 28 seconds over the boat race course to Harrods at the end of
February. On the same day Oxford won the Reading University head race,
beating last year's winner, Imperial College.
On Monday, Oxford defeated Isis, their reserve eight, in two three-minute
races with Bentham stealing half a length with some aggressive steering. The
pressure will be on her today as the coxes fight for the best water over the
first mile.
The shape of the oars will add spice to the race. Cambridge are dedicated to
the new hatchet-shaped blades and will use them whatever the conditions.
Some oarsmen say these blades are rowing's holy grail, making boats move
considerably faster. Others have discarded them. Oxford have been training
with the traditional macon blades but have tried the hatchet in the past
couple of days and will wait to see conditions today before deciding -
critics say the blades are poor in rough weather. Bowden says the hatchets
can make crews faster if used consistently in training, but adds: 'If Oxford
think they can just use hatchets on the day, they are making a big mistake.'

FT  27 MAR 93 / Sport: Shots in the dark on night of the long drives - Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT WERE you doing just before midnight on Tuesday, March 9? Perhaps you
have no idea; or perhaps you have and would rather I had not asked. So,
instead, I will tell you what I was doing. As the witching hour approached,
I was concluding a tryst with La Dama de Nocha in Marbella, Spain. Purely in
the cause of research, you understand.
You do not need to be fluent in Spanish to work out that La Dama de Nocha
means Lady of the Night. This particular Lady of the Night is a nine-hole
floodlit golf course - the first of its type in Europe.
The idea for floodlit golf came to Herman Sauer, a Dane who owns the nearby
Los Naranjos course, about five years ago. In short order, he leased land
from the town hall, laid out the course, erected the massive lights and
opened the pay-as-you-play layout last year.
Obvious questions arise:
No, you do not use luminous balls. Yellow are all right but white are
better.
Yes, you can hit the ball out of sight - but then, many golfers, Jack
Nicklaus included, cannot see the flight of their ball in broad daylight.
You do lose more balls at night - at least, I did, perhaps because I did not
know the course.
Yes, it is odd playing under artificial light. Make no mistake: La Dama de
Nocha is not a pitch and putt course, nor a crazy golf course at a seaside
resort. It is 2,728 metres (2,978 yards) long from the back tees and has two
par threes, two par fives - one of 500 metres (546 yards) - and five par
fours.
This dame, even by night and lit skilfully, is no oil painting. She is
narrow, bisected by the dry bed of the Rio Verde, and has an odd parcel of
land at the far end, accessible only by walking under a road. But just as
the shrub from which the course gets its name opens its flowers at night and
sends out perfume, so the course is at its best when darkness falls. Then,
its nine holes and rather sweet hexagonal clubhouse are bathed in a sort of
eerie, incandescent glow.
I teed-off at 9.45. To my left, the frogs were croaking furiously in a large
pond. Figures moved mysteriously through the semi-darkness ahead and water
sprinklers spun dizzily on adjoining holes, sending out hissing plumes of
spray.
From the first tee shot, it became clear that visibility was limited. You
could see the ball easily for the first 50 yards or so - it soared away from
the club looking like tracer fire. Then, it disappeared.
On the first green, I was looking directly at a set of floodlights as I
lined up the putt and was dazzled, much as I might be by the sun during the
day. Leaves which lay on the greens and fairways glistened in the false
light and, from a distance, looked like balls.
The shadows on the green made it surprisingly difficult to spot the ball. On
the short fourth, it worked in my favour, though. I hit a skinny six-iron
across the water and listened carefully for a telltale plop. Silence. I was
on dry land; that much I knew.
I looked in the bunker and stood at the water's edge, peering into the murk.
Nothing. I walked to the right of the green and to the left. Still nothing.
Better check the flagstick, I thought; and there was my ball - close to the
flag yet hidden among the shadows.
Distances were hard to judge in the artificial light and, because the grass
was so wet, there was no run on the ball, which made the course quite long.
I managed to cope with these peculiarities. What was more difficult was
playing a ball that lay in partial shadow. Because I could not see it
clearly, my brain sent nervous messages to my arms. I did not swing
confidently and the result was often a half-hit stroke.
The only serious mistake I made was on the eighth. I played to the wrong
green. But since this was the only hole on the course with two greens (you
play the 17th on your second circuit), my mistake was understandable; the
17th was directly ahead of me whereas the eighth was at 90 degrees to the
fairway.
At 11.40, accompanied by a frog chorus, I holed out on the ninth green
beneath the gleam of a full moon. As I walked to the clubhouse, a party of
28 cheerful Swedes, their dalliance with the Dame over, were tucking in to
their dinner.
No one has yet played through the night, although the possibilities for
endless rounds of golf are obvious. The latest finishing time recorded is 3
am.
Was it worth it? While it bore little comparison to nine holes at any of the
famous courses nearby, such as Las Brisas and Aloha, it had been an unusual
test of golf - and much more fun than doing the washing-up. I drove home
beneath a starlit, velvet sky, singing.

Woodsworth drops out of the 20th century on a supremely somnolent island in
Lake Victoria

<TEXT>
AS A RULE, tax assessors are calm, collected men who keep their emotions,
when they have any, well buttoned. So when I met three of them waving their
arms and hopping up and down on the little stone jetty at Luku, wild to get
away in the leaky fishing canoe I had just arrived on, I imagined the worst.
They were dishevelled. They had twigs in their hair. There was a desperate
look to their eyes. What in God's name, I wondered, could this island be, to
turn hard-nosed tax men into these pathetic, anxious creatures? They were
falling over each other to get into the fishy-smelling canoe. Were there
hostile tax-payers hot on their heels? Swarms of African killer bees?
Cannibals? No, it was none of these things. It was boredom.
'We have been stranded at this jetty for three days', said Innocent, the
senior taxman. 'We have slept in mud huts, and sat in the grass, and waited
and waited for a boat to get us out of here.' His black, heavy-framed
glasses, usually a successful prop in the presentation of fiscal gravitas,
sat skewed to one side of his nose. I wished my own tax assessor amused me
as much.
'This is a horrible island. There is no electricity, no plumbing, no
transport, no news, no civilisation. There is nothing here - just forest,
and primitive villagers, and monkeys who steal crops. Nothing]' Innocent was
venting 72 hours' worth of indignation. 'How can we do our job? This place
has been cut off from the world for 20 years. It is hard to get on the
island, hard to get off, and nobody has any money anyway. We are going
home.'
The small Yamaha motor on the canoe buzzed into life. 'If I were you I would
return with us', Innocent shouted as the little boat turned from the jetty
and pointed its bows to the distant mainland. I thought about it for a
moment. Life on Buggala Island in Lake Victoria may be disagreeable to the
modern, bureaucratic frame of mind, but to me it sounded just the ticket.
There are not many places left these days, even in Africa, where you can
escape it all. I decided to stay.
Innocent was right. Luku is a tough place to get out of. On the other side
of the island, across 24 miles of thick tropical forest, was Kalangala, the
island's main village, and the Malaanga Ssese Lodge, my destination. But
there appeared to be no way to get there. Like Innocent and his colleagues,
I sat in the grass, watched the birds of late afternoon being replaced by
the bats of early evening, and wondered what to do.
Rescue came in the form of a red Honda motorcycle with an empty tank. 'I
have transport but no petrol money', said Andrew, a young man who eventually
ambled out of one of Luku's mud huts. 'You have petrol money but no
transport. We shall help each other.'
In no time a jerry-can was produced, and for an exorbitant sum I purchased
two litres of petrol. There was change due but a shortage of coins. I was
given a large bunch of bananas instead. With me, my rucksack and my bananas
perched precariously on the back of the Honda, Andrew roared off into the
forest. Such is the waywardness of travel off the beaten path in Africa.
The Ssese Islands are as spectacular as they are whimsical and out of the
way. The road, a track of rich red tropical dirt, meandered up into hills
covered with virgin forest. Smooth-barked tropical hardwoods vaulted upwards
into the dusk. Occasionally we would stop in a grassy clearing so I could
adjust my bananas and look out over the hills.
Below, beyond the reed-lined edges of Buggala, scores of other green islands
seemed to float on the windless and glassy water of Lake Victoria. Nearby,
the last of the day's butterflies flitted over feathery heads of grass. With
the motor off, I could hear the sounds of the forest - birds hooting, the
cheeching of monkeys high in the trees. There was a new coolness in the
humid air. Beside the road, the bright reds and yellows of tropical flowers
jumped out from the twilight. It may not have pleased Innocent, but it
pleased me.
By the time we arrived at the lodge, Kalangala, high in a hillside forest,
was in pitch dark. The tax men had been right again: there was not a hint of
electricity anywhere. From the open doors and windows of houses by the
roadside came the flickering warm light of kerosene lamps; from the trees
and vegetable plots and clearings around them came the colder, steadier,
phosphorescent glow of a thousand fireflies. It was like motorbiking through
a constellation of stars.
After days of hard overland travel through central Africa, I was grimy,
bug-bitten and weary. I had eaten too many boiled yams. I had stood too
often under dribbling showers of cold rust-red water. I had slept in too
many unchanged bedsheets. I had had African hotels. There was no reason why
things should be any different here. But I had not reckoned with PT
Andronico, hotel proprietor extraordinaire.
'Welcome, brother]' Andronico stood on the steps of his tin-roofed,
flower-festooned house with open arms. A great laugh resonated from his
slight frame. Within seconds I was installed in a small, simple and
immaculately-kept room. Within minutes, a tub of clear rain water had been
drawn and heated and in a little cubicle lit by wavering lamp flame and open
to the night sky and stars, I was sloshing my travel fatigue away.
Half-an-hour later I was sipping banana wine and feasting on roast pork and
pineapple.
Sated and sighing, I took the time to look around. PT Andronico is proud of
himself, and proud of his lodge. It was all rather dotty, like finding
oneself in the middle of a vigorous and colour-mad naif painting.
Scattered about the porch, amid a dozen burning lamps, were plants and
flowers in paint pots and tubs, each container labelled 'plant', or
'flower'. On window sills and walls and doors, in large letters, were other
inscriptions: 'Truth and Justice', 'Love', 'Honesty'. There is no conscious
colour scheme to Andronico's lodge; its blues, yellows, greens and pinks are
as unruly and wildly put together as the profusion of tropical flowers that
grows around it.
What, I asked Andronico, was the meaning of the letters 'P T A' painted on
every surface?
The dark face under the silvering hair lit up, the smile widened. ''A' is
for Andronico. We all have Christian names on the Ssese Islands. I was
educated here by Catholic missionaries, the White Fathers. 'T', my good
brother, is for teacher; for 33 years I was headmaster of the island primary
school. And 'P' is the best of all. Oh, yes. It stands for pilgrim. In 1975
my brother Afridisio and I flew to Rome with the Ugandan Church. We drank
red wine, we looked at the city from the top of St Peter's, we met the Pope.
I kissed his hand. It was a wonderful time.' The smile became wider and
prouder. The P T A inscriptions Andronico has placed all over his lodge are
not marks of ownership, but robust, joyful statements of existence.
Existence is a precious thing in Uganda these days, and Ssese islanders,
16,000 of them scattered over 84 islands, enjoy a more reassuring measure of
it than most. Twenty years ago Idi Amin came to power and embarked on a rule
of terror. Normal life came to a halt, and the Ssese Islands, far out in the
waters of the world's second biggest lake, were simply forgotten.
Other tyrants followed Amin, a succession of armies ravaged and destroyed
the country, and year after year nobody moved on or off the islands. It was
too dangerous. But if islanders had to make do without the conveniences of
modern life, they were grateful to be spared its murderous inconveniences as
well.
Today peace has returned to Uganda, and with it the first trickles of
tourism, but the country is bankrupt and there is no money to modernize the
Sseses. There are just six cars on Buggala, all belonging to government
agencies. There are telephones, too, but not many: the lodge's number is 26.
Andronico has a television, but every time the car battery that powers it
runs down it has to be lugged to the mainland. Cut adrift from the 20th
century, the Sseses have slipped through civilisation's net. They now drift
serenely on the warm, equatorial waters of Lake Victoria, oblivious of time,
place or the changing world outside.
The days went by. Innocent may have been bored on the Sseses, but I found
plenty of things to do. I went fishing in dug-out canoes for the monstrous
Nile perch that inhabit the lake. I walked, feeling much reduced in size, on
trails across the forest floor 150 feet below a dark green canopy of
branches. With Andronico energetically cycling ahead, showing few of his 66
years, I pedalled around the island on an ancient bicycle, visiting his
aunt, his children, his countless friends. Everyone knows Andronico, he has
taught them all.
Most of all, though, I enjoyed simply sitting on the front porch, a glass of
banana wine close at hand, watching peaceful Ssese life go by: bright yellow
weaver birds hopping in and out of their globe-shaped, hanging nests;
barefoot school-children skipping home to neat little thatched houses
fronted by mango trees and coffee bushes; red tethered cows grazing by the
roadside; old men walking from a shop with a sack of salt or a bag of
vegetables balanced on their heads.
I enjoyed it all the more because I know it will not last for ever. Sooner
or later, civilisation will come to the Bali of Africa. There will be
electricity, modern hotels, more people like me, less people like Andronico.
One day, Innocent and his minions will be happy to return to Ssese.
Nicholas Woodsworth travelled to Uganda c/o British Airways, which flies to
Kampala twice a week and offers an Apex return fare of Pounds 788 and full
economy fare of Pounds 1,990. Fuel, spare parts and personnel permitting,
there are three nine-hour long ferry sailings from Kampala to Buggala island
each week.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Travel: Charmed by Australia's sweet dreamtime - Michael J
Woods joins the swagmen in the wild and mystical Flinders Ranges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
    By MICHAEL J WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SOUTHERN Cross hung between two gum trees just above my feet and
appeared so close that it looked more like part of a seafront illumination
than a distant constellation of stars. The feathery tops of the gums waved
darkly against the lighter sky but the skin-like bark of their trunks
gleamed silvery in the moonlight.
Bats fluttered overhead but there was no other sound along the dry bed of
Arkaba creek bed where I was swagging - sleeping under the stars in my swag,
a sleeping bag, pillow and mattress on a sheet of thick canvas. Rolled up,
the swag is the bushman's suitcase, indeed his home, and all his possessions
are packed inside and tightly strapped to keep out the dust.
Creek beds can be dangerous places. A flash flood will bring a wall of water
several feet high and carrying great logs and other debris thundering down
the water course. In January and February, though, the Flinders are very hot
and dry, so the danger comes from fire, not water. At this, the quiet time
of year, cooking fires are forbidden. Although a camp without a fire is a
featureless place the lack of other visitors more than made up for it, for
even in the national parks we hardly saw a soul.
The Flinders Ranges, a series of parallel rocky mountain ridges, lie to the
north of Adelaide, in South Australia, starting just below Wilmington and
running up to Arkaroola, becoming drier and more rugged as they go. About
halfway up is Wilpena Pound, South Australia's equivalent - for stunning
scenery - to Ayers Rock, in the Northern Territory, and located in the
200,000-acre Flinders Ranges National Park.
The Pound is remarkable - an enormous oval bowl surrounded by a high
sandstone ridge, precipitous on the outside but sloping gently down to a
level floor on the inside. The wall of rock is pierced in only one place, by
Wilpena Creek. When rainfall is high, the pound acts as a funnel. The amount
of water that hurtles down the creek is enormous, as the tumbled heaps of
great tree trunks confirmed.
We walked into the bowl and climbed the side past a deserted settlement
where a farmer once struggled to survive by growing wheat and raising stock.
He was forced to abandon the attempt. Part way up the rocky path, at Wangara
Lookout, we stopped. With the magnificent expanse of Wilpena Pound spread
below us, Cliff Coulthard, our Aboriginal guide, whose tribal lands cover
this area, shared with us the dreaming of his people, which explains the
formation of the northern ranges and the pound.
In a nutshell, two giant serpents, male and female, trapped and ate 600 of
his people who were gathered to carry out initiation rites. In surrounding
them, the snakes' bodies shifted the Earth's surface to form the walls of
the pound, which finally came to rest with the female's head raised as the
highest point, St Mary's Peak, and the male's head lowered, creating Arkaroo
Rock.
Sitting in the evening sunshine, with the emptiness of the bush around us,
it was not difficult to imagine the two huge snakes slithering round the
pound and looking over the rim at their captives.
These were not the only victims claimed by the pound. In more recent years a
local child was lost here and, in spite of intensive searches, only
discovered two years later after fire had cleared part of the area. His
bones, and the pathetic remains of his shirt tied vainly to a stick, were
all that were left. Fred Teague, a man of many parts and the coroner at the
time, told us the story when we stopped for a 'yack' (natter) at his Mobil
garage in Hawker.
In his adjoining shop Fred keeps a small but worthwhile collection of rocks,
illustrating the geology of the area, and of Aboriginal artefacts and those
of the white settlers who followed. At 80 Fred is a mine of information and
has done much to preserve the local Aboriginal rock art, which is
particularly rich.
The most dramatic is in a small cave at Arkaroo Rock to which we climbed in
the cool of an early morning. Cliff explained the symbols drawn by ancient
fingers in charcoal and red, yellow and white ochre mixed with emu fat to
preserve them.
The whole of the Flinders area has a distinctively harsh beauty, dry and
rocky with pale yellow grass and scattered trees, native pines and eucalypts
in various shades of green. The outcropping rocks give frowns to the rounded
buff hillocks while the outer ramparts of the pound appear towering and
precipitous. Occasional gorges, such as Bunyeroo, contain gently running
streams which are a welcome contrast to the aridity of the surrounding land.
The sparkling water and the thriving gums which grow there make these gorges
attractive places in which to linger.
During the uncomfortably hot time of the day the wildlife sensibly remains
in the shade of trees and rocks. Grey kangaroos sit in the semi-gloom and
emus flounce off at a reluctant long-limbed trot if disturbed from water,
their beaks partly open for the heat, the delicate feathers on their backs
bouncing airily at every step.
Morning and evening brought more activity - a pair of kangaroos boxing in
silhouette against the falling sun; a wedge-tailed eagle perched at the top
of Sliding Rock; bats hunting insects in the company of swallows as the
night shift took over from the day. A fox crossed the road in front of us.
Although the same size as British foxes, it looked much too small and
vulnerable to survive in this uncompromising land.
Cultural tours, such as Mick Irwin's Beyond Tours (1 Pony Ridge Road,
Belair, South Australia 5052, tel: 08-278-1264), with whom Michael Woods
travelled to the Flinders Ranges, are comparatively new and enable clients
to experience Outback life and obtain a much clearer appreciation of
Aboriginal lifestyles than was formerly possible.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Travel: In Buddha's footsteps - James Henderson wanders amid
the ruins of a magnificent history in Sri Lanka's myriad religious and royal
temples
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HENDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ANIMALS of lore and legend have a fond place in a nation: unicorns,
dragons and heraldic hounds, even a bear chained to a staff or a black
charger. Their medieval heritage may be lost, but as symbols they are
immortalised somehow.
In Sri Lanka the feeling is the same, but the animals are different -
elephants, guardian cobras and magical demon monkeys. As we have put working
beasts on to heraldic shields, so in Sri Lanka they are honoured on
moonstones. Instead of the British bulldog, Sri Lanka has lions and tigers.
The Tamils are well known as Tigers, but less widely known is that the
majority of the country, the Singhalese, consider themselves the descendants
of a lion.
These animals roam a riotously fertile tropical land: well-watered and
immensely lush, parts of it seemingly primordial forest. But nature has been
stamped with a human print that goes back thousands of years. Kings with
unpronounceable names built magnificently, and their decaying memorials are
visible everywhere. They glorified themselves with ancient cities and
anchored their prosperity in vast irrigation tanks. As much as 3,000 acres
in size, these vast lakes are an engineering wonder even now.
Many of the sights have a religious significance, for Buddhism has been the
religion of Sri Lanka for more than 2,000 years. Most are ruins now, but
there is still a reverential air about them. You walk barefoot, and place
lotus flowers on the altars. The island is covered with rounded dagobas
(like stupas), the vast white shrines of Buddhism, which stand like massive
bell-jars in the jungle.
On my tour I was guided through the intricacies of the ruins and the names
(first stop Anuradhapura) by Deepthi, a stout Singhal man. Later he
sheepishly confided that Deepthi was in fact a girl's name, meaning
'bright.'
Anuradhapura dates from about 250 BC, and you will see dagobas, moonstones
and statues of Buddha built by kings Dutugemunu and Devanampiya Tissa. The
city is a spiritual centre and once was home to 5,000 monks. Somehow I was
expecting the ancient sights to be surrounded by the teeming humanity of an
eastern city, but in fact they stand in sparse, open land, just silence and
ruins.
It is difficult, mentally, to envisage much human activity, but the
adornments give life to the place. Three hundred elephants stand shoulder to
shoulder around the Ruvanvelisaya dagoba, and among the stone carvings at
the Isurumuniya temple are bas reliefs of elephants playing in a pond.
One of the island's most sacred Buddhist temples is here, built around a
2,000-year-old tree (supposedly grown from a cutting from the tree under
which Buddha attained enlightenment).
Moonstones are semi-circular doorway stones, carved meticulously, depicting
human progression through life - a sort of philosophical doormat. Elephants
link trunks and tails to symbolise birth; horses, lions and bulls chase one
another in old age, sickness and death. Geese, unopened lotus flowers in
their beaks, stride the semi-circle of time, unenlightened.
I found that I kept seeing the same faces as I progressed around the sights
 -a bumptious French trio kept breaking the calm: she, her boyfriend and
brother, I guessed. The two of them were teasing her mercilessly.
Driving through the Sri Lankan jungle, huge deep-red rocks loomed out of the
canopy. Fancifully, Deepthi compared them to reclining horses and lions
waiting to pounce.
Legend has it that one rock, almost a mountain, was brought from Nepal by a
demon monkey. He was sent to collect a medicinal plant, but forgot which
one, so he brought the whole mountainside to be sure.
We came to Sigiriya, the Lion Rock, which stands vast and alone. The name
makes it sound a bit like a stomach complaint, but it is an impressive 600ft
lump of granite, developed 1,500 years ago as a defensive bastion and
penthouse.
At one time it was entirely covered in sky-blue plaster. Only a tiny patch
remains, painted with cloud maidens. Close by a wall, plastered with a mix
of egg 1,000 years ago, is inscribed with 2,000 poems - commissioned
graffiti complementing the beauty of the local girls.
The climb to the top is worth the effort. Through smaller attendant rocks,
the size of three-storey buildings, you climb to a platform, where a curious
iron cage is a refuge point against a swarm of attack wasps that
occasionally puts in an appearance.
The final ascent is made between sculpted lion's paws and into its throat,
and then by way of a rickety iron stairway as steep as the stairs to a
fifth-floor London flat. On the four-acre summit, the throne room, dance
chamber and baths can be traced by their brick foundations. Around me a
strange French version of hide-and-seek was unfolding, with screams and
shouts.
Standing on the summit, snatches of clouds move slowly past you, rolling
gently as they ride the late afternoon wind and occasionally snagging on the
clifftop.
Beneath, amid the jungle, you can trace the outlines of Asia's oldest
pleasure gardens - promenades, lakes and fountains that still work after
1,500 years. The gardens were protected by a 60ft moat of crocodiles and
then a rampart of scorpions.
Two hours away, another large and ruined Sri Lankan city is Pollonoruwa,
royal seat of Parakramabahu and Vijayabahu, which dates from 1,000 AD. Set
on the shore of a massive tank are ruined palaces, lotus-shaped baths,
statues of Buddha and ancient temples defended by sculpted dragons and
cobras with open hoods. At the council chamber, swans were symbolic of
purity.
Wandering through what was once a seven-storey, 1,000-room palace, large
enough for a suite for each of 300 wives, I noticed two figures lurking in
alcoves. A few yards behind me was a French girl, oblivious, about to be
ambushed.
It is forbidden to feed the macague monkeys which roam around Pollonoruwa.
Scientists are trying to isolate something in their diet which seems to stop
them developing cancer. Perhaps, remarked Deepthi absently, as he chased one
away from his car, there is something anti-carcinogenic about rubber
windscreen seals.
In the declining sun we came to the finest statues of Buddha, at Gal Vihara.
He appears in four positions: meditating, preaching, satisfaction and then
dying (about to gain Nirvana). I stared, weary after a long day of
sight-seeing, but it is serene and absorbing. Suddenly the calm was
interrupted by a commotion of mock-hysterical shrieks. The French lads had
run off with her shoes.
Driving south to Kandy we left the jungle and climbed into the hills. Across
the road snakes slithered, heads held high, and squirrels scampered, their
tails involuntarily vertical. On the power cables hung the odd fruit bat,
frazzled after mistaking them for telephone wires. Cattle, which are sacred
to the Hindu Tamils, seem to be immune to trouble. They keep warm on the
tarmac or wander willy-nilly through the traffic.
Kandy is a relatively recent Sri Lankan capital, a stronghold until it was
finally tamed by the British in 1815. The Temple of the Tooth is supposed to
contain a tooth of Buddha and is one of the most sacred places in the
country.
Suddenly, after the mute ruins, here was living Buddhism. Inside I could
hear deafening drumming, wailing pipe music and crowds shuffling by the
altars, leaving vast stacks of lotus leaves. Monks in orange robes walked
by, shaded with palm fronds by their acolytes.
Most Sri Lankan dagobas are solid (one, supposedly, has enough bricks to
build a 3ft wall from London to Edinburgh), but in Kalutara, south of
Colombo, you will find one that is hollow, built over another smaller
shrine.
Inside, it is a vast whispering gallery. Every slap of a bare foot and
quietly-spoken prayer is echoed and re-echoed in a never-ending stream of
shuffling and whispers. Like any great religious building, it is an
awe-inspiring experience. Only when I left did I notice that there were no
French shrieks to break the calm.
Outside I came across the only animal I saw being treated sternly in 10
days: a cow caught helping herself to mouthfuls of lotus flowers at an
unattended stall.
James Henderson flew to Sri Lanka with Air Lanka as a guest of travel
operator Hayes and Jarvis (tel: 081-748-5050). H&amp;J prices for 14 days in Sri
Lanka (seven days staying put, plus seven touring) start at Pounds 599.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Food and Drink: Tried and trusted - An hotel that cares for
staff and guests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COFFEE was poured professionally. Upstairs, the bedrooms were being
cleaned and, in the kitchen, the chef and her assistants were preparing
lunch.
A typical day in a small British hotel, you might think. But this one is
very different, for the Mariners guest house in Rye, East Sussex, is run by
the mentally handicapped.
It belongs to the Canterbury Oast Trust, a charity established in 1985 to
care for those with autism, Down's syndrome or meningitis contracted in
childhood. Today, it provides a home and professional care for more than 100
patients aged from 19-60, and has created work for 35 of those in two
free-market industries - catering and tourism - which have generated over
Pounds 350,000 inincome.
But the money is secondary to the aims set out by the trust's original
executive director, Joe Graham. One is creating the sort of jobs that make
the disabled feel they are doing something worthwhile. The other is offering
a service that involves the public, so giving people the chance to
re-evaluate their attitudes to the mentally handicapped.
In 1988, Graham saw the Mariners was for sale and realised it might provide
the opportunity he was seeking. The site was right: the main street of a
picturesque tourist town with commercial competition to give the venture an
extra element of challenge.
Despite political opposition from local restaurateurs, he won over his
trustees and bought the three-bedroom guesthouse for Pounds 285,000. It had
been sold twice in the previous three years because it could not be made to
pay.
Graham and the disabled staff made it an immediate success. On the third
Saturday, the day's takings topped Pounds 200. Today, they are more than
Pounds 500 each Saturday.
The Mariners is open seven days a week, 360 days a year, and the patients
work two shifts: from 8.30am-2.30pm and noon-6pm. They get free board and
lodging and about Pounds 50 a month spending money.
The length of the shifts is the biggest problem. Keeping the interest and
enthusiasm of patients can be difficult and, because their attention span is
so short, training takes place almost daily. But there has been enormous
progress: several will soon be taking the first stage of the National
Vocational Qualification examinations in catering studies.
In 1990, the trust decided to launch a much larger commercial venture and
spent Pounds 565,000 on a nearby 90-acre farm which it converted into a
centre for rare animal breeds as well as a residential home. The farm,
including a 120-seat self-service restaurant and conference centre, created
an extra 50 jobs for the disabled, secure homes for 26, and employment for
30 able-bodied staff in an area of high unemployment.
During the first six months, it attracted 62,000 visitors who spent Pounds
245,000. The farm won three championship medals at the 1992 Royal Show,
which the patients attended, and eight of their prize-winning Berkshire pigs
have been exported to Japan.
By last autumn, however, the trust had run into severe cash-flow
difficulties. Income was declining with the onset of winter and donations
were proving hard to get because of the recession. Several local firms,
which had agreed to underwrite the conference centre in return for their
names on the wall, had to withdraw.
The trust responded with a review which tightened financial and management
controls. Graham left and was replaced by a new general manager and
fund-raiser. But the housing will be finished by mid-April, with
accommodation for 26 residents.
Like so many others in the British tourism industry, the trust is hoping for
an end to the recession and a long, hot summer. This would ease its
financial concerns and allow an increasing number of visitors to experience
one of the most impressive examples of British catering.
The Mariners hotel and tearooms, 15 High Street, Rye, East Sussex (tel:
0797-223 480) is owned by Canterbury Oast Trust, Highlands Farm, Woodchurch,
Ashford, Kent (tel: 0233-861 493, fax 0233-861-457).

FT  27 MAR 93 / Cookery: Cheat's roast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BACHELOR friend told me recently that, when asked to dine in someone
else's house, he always hoped to be served roast meat. The reason was that a
roast is not something lone householders usually cook for themselves. Doing
so smacks of extravagance and self-indulgence.
There is also the matter of leftovers. Even half a leg of lamb or a small
chicken can mean days of repetitive cold meat meals, or having to devise
palatable ways to re-hash the remains.
The recipe which follows is a compromise solution. It is not, strictly
speaking, a roast: it is a grill. But it offers many of the appealing
features of a roast without the disadvantages. It is quick to cook; easy to
carve into thick, neat slices (no awkward bones to frighten those
inexperienced with a carving knife); and just the right size to provide two
meals for one person (or one meal if you invite a friend).
The cut I have used is known variously as neck or neck fillet of lamb, which
is the piece of meat that runs alongside the bones of the middle neck and
scrag end. It is lean, juicy and flavoursome.
I have teamed the lamb here with aubergine, a well-known partnership in
Mediterranean cooking. To make full use of the heat of the grill - which is
needed for cooking the lamb - the aubergine also is grilled (rather than
fried, the more usual practice). Grilling means the aubergine absorbs
relatively little fat. It also means less washing up - just one pan instead
of two.
The other short cut I suggest is omitting to salt the aubergine before
cooking. Salting might be a tablet stone of culinary tradition
 - something put down to the fact that aubergines contain bitter juices  -
but, in this recipe at least, the results are every bit as good without
salt.
SIZZLED LAMB WITH AUBERGINE &amp; HERBS (serves 2)
Ingredients:  3/4 lb neck fillet of lamb; 1 aubergine weighing about 9 oz; a
few sprigs each of thyme (preferably lemon thyme) and oregano; a little
lemon juice and a little extra virgin olive oil.
Method: Marinate the lamb for several hours or overnight in a generous
tablespoon of lemon juice mixed with a scant tablespoon of olive oil, a good
grinding of black pepper, and an aromatic scattering of chopped fresh herbs.
Turn the meat once or twice so the flavourings penetrate it evenly.
When ready to cook, cut the aubergine into slices one-third to half an inch
thick. Brush them lightly with olive oil and lay them on the grid of a grill
pan round the lamb.
Pour the marinade over the meat and cook under a thoroughly pre-heated grill
for 6-7 minutes, depending on the thickness of the lamb. Turn the meat and
vegetables and grill for a further 6 minutes until the aubergine is hot,
tender and gilded, and the meat is well-crusted and brown without and
juicily pink within.
Let the lamb rest for 5 minutes before cutting it across into thick slices
for serving. Spinach steamed until wilted goes well with this. So does
basmati rice cooked in light stock with thyme and bay, and enriched with the
meat juices.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Food and Drink: Made strictly to order - Wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

YOU want a Spanish Sauvignon that tastes like a New Zealand one? A white
wine made from claret grapes? A Muscadet from the south of France? A
Moldovan Chardonnay? No problem.
New product development is not an activity commonly associated with wine.
Until now, wine retailers have had to sell what comes out of the world's
wineries, traditionally dictated by viticultural history, appellation laws,
indigenous winemaking skills and the weather.
But in the only sector of the wine market where there is real activity at
the moment, the Pounds 1.99 to Pounds 5.99 a bottle bracket, this has been
changing rapidly. A handful of middlemen have been creating new lines
expressly for Britain's supermarkets and dominant off-licence chains. The
key is to take expertise to the winery, and dictate rather than await what
is produced there.
This running up of special little wine numbers to order sounds
quintessentially entrepreneurial, but no less a force than Allied Lyons took
a serious interest two years ago, through its wine sourcing subsidiary
International Wine Services. In a small office in Beaconsfield in the
English Home Counties, the IWS staff regularly meets to pool observations
from around the globe on what the wine buyer wants, and what specific
wineries might be cajoled by an outside winemaker into producing (all of the
above, for a start).
The formula works only in certain areas, ideally those with a good supply of
relatively inexpensive grapes whose technical potential is yet to be
realised. That cuts out all of the classic wine regions, as well as most of
the New World, but it leaves vast tracts of southern France, Iberia, Italy,
South Africa, South America and eastern Europe, all of which are currently
being combed for suitable wineries by IWS and its competitors.
The obvious competitor is Hugh Ryman, son of former stationer Ryman, trained
in Australia and now based in Bordeaux. He was not the first to harness the
under-utilised skills of southern hemisphere winemakers for the European
grape harvest, but he commercialised the Flying Winemaker concept into
plaudits and vast orders from the likes of Whitbread's Thresher group and
Majestic wine warehouses. New World winemaking techniques are applied to
fruit grown in the south of France and eastern Europe to turn it into
something the market, or at least Thresher's buying team, wants. He sells
Britain a host of labels from Duras, Bergerac et al, and now he is making
wines in Moldova for Australian wine company Penfolds.
The targeted wineries have to be of a certain sort too. They should ideally
be technically well-equipped - installing a winemaker for two to four months
costs very much less than installing plant - and willing to let a stranger,
typically a young Australian stranger, tell their staff what to do.
This is probably the most significant limiting factor. As Guy Anderson,
IWS's 30-year-old roving French specialist, admits: 'Some of these wineries
are run by people who have been making wine since before I was born'. And
IWS's latest recruit Kym Milne (ex-New Zealand via a stint for Hugh Ryman)
found himself, prior to joining IWS, in the uncomfortable position of being
installed in a winery where the management desperately wanted him but the
staff were obstructive.
Indeed it is only the winery ownership which stands to gain directly from
increased quality, and increased saleability, of itswines (which is why the
formula works particularly well in co-operatives). But once an outside team
is installed in a winery, the proportion of wine made by the outsider tends
to increase with each vintage as the winery owners see the truckloads being
shipped out to the likes of Waitrose and Safeway.
Perhaps the most obvious application of this new philosophy of shipping
braincells rather than grapes is IWS's International Winemaker range for
Tesco, all made by their most peripatetic oenologist Jacques Lurton but in
places as dissimilar as Mendoza in Argentina, Rueda in Spain and Languedoc
in France. It comes complete with his signature. So personalised is it that
Tesco must be worried about him falling under a bus.
The number of air miles this unmarried 34-year-old product of Bordeaux via
Australia has to notch up each year suggests it would have to be an airport
transfer bus, but Tesco is surely right to worry. Lurton has made so many
wines for IWS, let alone those he makes with his brother for European
customers under the JFL label, he must be heading for burnout soon.
Scouting a new wine region from scratch can take months, but IWS is able to
harness Allied's own tentacular international distribution network to save
winery inspection time. All eyes east for 1993, but they know that, for
volume, they depend more on refining the quality of familiar names than on
constantly dishing up something new.
I tasted some of the new IWS lines that will appear in British stores next
week and can recommend those in the box. They may taste more of Roseworthy,
Australia's oenology school, than of peasants and passion but they are,
presumably, just what we want.
SAUVIGNON RUEDA 1992. Pounds 3.99 Oddbins and Sainsbury. Pure gooseberry
reek. You would never pick this aromatic dry white as Spanish.
VIOGNIER 1992. Pounds 5.49. Tesco. A particularly successful Vin de Pays
d'Oc supplying the Condrieu experience at two-thirds the price.
DOMAINE DE BACHELLERY 1992. Pounds 3.69. Oddbins. A red Vin de Pays d'Oc
made from Syrah and Merlot grapes given zip, life and a Drink Me ticket.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Food and Drink: Bordeaux's record - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL, NICHOLAS LANDER, JANCIS ROBINSON and LUCINDA
DE LA RUE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE official figures for the 1992 Bordeaux vintage show that the red wine
crop was 5.03m hectolitres - a record and twice the size of the
frost-stricken 1991. The white wine harvest at 1.23m hl - was three times
larger than the previous and the biggest since 1973. The quality of the
superior appellation wines will be better known when the representative
Union des Grands Crus tasting take place at the end of this month and the
beginning of April. Early indications are that the reds are at least a fair
average to good; and some dry whites were made. If the reds are to be sold
in such large volume, opening prices must come down, but there will be
little en primeur sale. Nevertheless, although many superior chateaux owners
are short of cash, they may defer offering their wines on the market until
they are in bottle and prices improve.
Three new restaurants have different approaches to publicity. The Nosh
Brothers, Mick and Nick, originally caterers to the rock and roll world, now
have a bar and restaurant at 773 Fulham Road, SW6 5HA (071-736-7311, open
Tuesday-Saturday night and Sunday lunch). A tough, mean approach to food
with smokers encouraged and vegetarians just tolerated.
In spite of an off-putting press release, the arrival of Richard Corrigan,
formerly head chef at Mulligans of Cork Street, should breathe new life into
Bentley's, 11-15 Swallow Street, London W1R 7HD (071-734-4756).
And finally to Mark Broadbent, a talented chef now at Twelve Sloane Square,
SW1 8EG (071-730-1499) part of the Royal Court Hotel, reduced to writing his
own press releases but a chef to be applauded for his initiative and his
cooking. Set lunch Pounds 9.50, dinner Pounds 15.50 (two courses).
On a more disappointing note for restaurant goers, the Government has
announced that it will not be introducing legislation to regulate the
inclusion of the service charge on restaurant bills because it believes the
industry should do the job itself.
Sadly, restaurateurs show little sign of wanting to do so. Corners are
fought fiercely between those who believe that the price on the menu should
be the price paid, as in most retail businesses, and those who believe that
the words 'discretionary' or 'optional' alongside the service charge
stimulates a waiter's performance.
But, as anyone who pays their own restaurant bills knows only too well, the
imposition of a 15 per cent service charge on every item of a bill - from
each vegetable dish to mineral water, coffee and wine - can leave a nasty
taste in spite of all the kitchen's best efforts.
WHAT HOPE for the undoubted skills of the independent wine merchant now that
the supermarkets are diving into mail order? Marks and Spencer has been
dabbling for a while. Sainsbury has been trying it out in north-west
England. And now Waitrose has bought Findlater, Mackie Todd, a
long-established wine merchant whose chief asset was once the Dry Fly sherry
label but is nowadays its mailing list. It will be some time before Waitrose
will be delivering wine to doorsteps throughout the land. In the meantime,
their Blaye Blanc at Pounds 2.99 is a particularly good buy for lovers of
well-made dry white bordeaux.
Chocaholics will be interested in Godiva's big egg, some 4 ft high, with a
34-inch 'waist' and weighing 6 kilos. The egg is made of finest Belgian
chocolate - with an outer dark crust, a thick filling of nougatine and an
inner layer of milk chocolate. Generously filled, it costs Pounds 264. Will
anyone buy it?
The company, has also launched two chocolate spreads and a range of jams and
jellies. Spreads are a crunchy praline with hazelnuts or dark chocolate. It
is nice served melted with a little butter and cream, over chocolate
marquise.
Godiva's jams, jellies and marmalades are less sweet than most commercial
varieties and packed full of whole fruits. Flavours include rose petal,
bitter orange marmalade and passion fruit or redcurrant with raspberry gelee
 -delicious served with roast duck or baked ham.
Prices are from Pounds 2.95 to Pounds 3.95 for a 400g jar with an additional
Pounds 1.75 for postage and packing. They are available from the two Godiva
shops at 247 Regent Street, London W1 and 150 Fenchurch Street, London EC3
and other stockists.

<TEXT>
who would have thought it? Here we have a brand-new home furnishing
catalogue from Marks and Spencer which is bold, colourful - and in tune with
the times.
It is also slimmer and leaner than its predecessors and is all the better
for it: no longer is it puffed out with dinky ornaments and dreadful
pictures, or with the sort of superfluous accessories that few of us want
and which add to nothing but the dusting-load.
You will not be surprised to learn that it offers no radical new direction.
There is little that is innovative or challenging; no new aesthetic
frontiers are being opened up. Trendy or avant-garde are not the words that
the catalogue brings to mind.
But then, that never was what the famed UK retail chain set out to do. What
it does offer is a pared down, edited selection of basics - what I once
called 'the furnishing equivalent of the polo shirt, the navy-blue sweater
or the blazer' - in other words the sort of thing that most houses actually
need.
There is a big selection of well-shaped sofas that could be covered in the
currently ubiquitous checks - blue and white or beige and cream, in plain
linen-like fabrics, or, if you really must, in Dralon. There is also the
splendidly capacious Hampton Chair (photographed left covered in Boston
check).
There are 100 per cent cotton sheets and duvets in pretty stripes with
matching plains. If you prefer your bedlinen in an 'easy-care' cotton and
polyester mix you get a bigger ranges of colours and patterns - from an
exceedingly smart rich tartan to bold geometric prints.
There are pure cotton towels in a good range of colours and a series of
pleated lampshades and uplighters in colours that tone with the linens and
fabrics. Look out for the simple, clean-lined range of children's furniture
 -everything from a white-painted wardrobe and four-drawer chest to bunk
beds and bookcases.
Look, too, for the range of furniture in cherrywood - the plainest and
simplest of the designs seem to me the best. The sideboard which can be used
on its own or topped with a glass-glazed cupboard is splendidly simple and
sturdy, but at Pounds 1,998 for the two pieces (or Pounds 999 each) they
cannot be said to be cheap.
All in all the new M and S catalogue seems to me a vast improvement on the
earlier efforts. There still seems to be a taste gap between the innovative
and sophisticated nature of its food and the furnishing products it sells
but the dreadful air of decorous daintiness has mostly gone, although a
little lingers on in some of the china and some of the floral fabrics and
bedlinens, presumably to keep faith with those customers who have already
embarked on that decorative road.
Abandoned, too, is the attempt to offer a total 'concept' - in its place is
a collection of basics which, though certainly not cheap, are well-made in
sound materials, are unobtrusive and round which the customer can build a
life-style of his or her own.
The catalogue costs Pounds 1 and everything in it can either be seen in the
Home Furnishings sections of Marks and Spencer stores or ordered by
telephoning 0925-851100. Delivery is free.
If you want to see what a really first-class designer can do with the basic
Marks and Spencer range, hurry along to The Ideal Home Show, at London's
Earls Court until April 12, where David Davies uses the bold blue and yellow
theme with great panache.
If you are in the mood to give your house a face-lift and are looking for a
floor-covering in the mood of the times, take a look at the flat woven
woollen carpeting by Roger Oates Design Associates.
In sober plains, stripes or herringbones they provide a chic and subdued
background to any furnishing scheme and would fit in wonderfully with the
new mood for Shaker-style simplicity.
Though simple, the Roger Oates range is made from the finest wools so they
are not as inexpensive as one might hope. The Venetian quality works out at
Pounds 60 per linear metre (it comes as runners or as rugs).
If that is more than you can afford you should perhaps consider the
latex-backed seagrass which is just Pounds 10.36 a square metre. It comes in
a greeny-yellow colourway, has a roughish surface (so possibly not ideal
where there are crawling babies or young children) and is a splendidly
neutral background to almost any scheme.
For colour leaflets write to Roger Oates Design Associates, The Long Barn,
Eastnor, Ledbury, Herefordshire HR8 1EL. If you want to visit the warehouse
telephone 0531-632718 first.

<TEXT>
IT IS NO secret that Britain has some of the liveliest, most original, most
inventive crafts people in the world. A trawl round a good crafts fair
reveals a mass of talent and a horde of infinitely desirable products. The
problem is that most of them are produced in small workshops scattered all
over the country and tracking them down is no easy matter.
Those who would rather buy a one-off hand-made piece than a mass-produced
machine-made number might like to know about Handmade in Britain. Although
it is primarily a mail-order business aimed at the wedding present market it
is also a good source of original presents for any time.
It is the brainchild of Stephanie Latham and Rachel Pryor, whose main aim is
to encourage present-givers to give some of the many beautiful and original
objects that are made by hand instead of the more predictable and mundane
products that are found in most shops up and down the country.
They currently have some 300 different suppliers on their lists and they can
offer anything from a range of luggage to hand-thrown terracotta pots,
hand-blown glass, hand-made ceramics and hand-turned wood. Photographed
below are James Marston's beautifully turned vegetable or fruit bowls. Made
in ash they cost Pounds 28.95 each. The rack is Pounds 12.
Because they hope to provide a real service to brides and bridegrooms
putting together a wedding present list Latham and Pryor feel obliged to
offer a limited selection of some of the more traditional and predictable
objects that newly-weds might need (Prestige saucepans, for instance) as
well as the sparkier, more original craft-made pieces.
Handmade in Britain is run from 14 Conlan Street, London W10 5AR which is
not a shop but a showroom where samples of all the products can be seen.
Because the company is not paying for an acre of Sloane Street they are able
to include wrapping and delivery (within the inner confines of the M25) in
the usual retail price. Outside the M25 delivery is charged at cost.
A brochure listing the products and the prices is being published this week
and is available free on request.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Fashion: Designers take refuge in Spiderwoman clothing -
After weeks of observation, Avril Groom is still trying to make sense of the
autumn collections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER THREE weeks of Europe's autumn collections, the only clear message is
that fashion is changing radically. Even some of the world's top designers
are uncertain how to make the change from short, sharp tailoring to long,
soft fluidity.
As usual in confused times they resort to fancy dress and historic costume.
The cast of thousands includes swashbuckling dandies, Victorian tarts,
medieval damsels, low-life waifs, urban warriors, orthodox Jews, Spiderwoman
and the brides of Dracula. Buyers have the tough job of turning characters
into clothes which, once the dust has settled, will mean something in your
wardrobe come the autumn.
They may sit through outlandish catwalk shows to catch the mood, but the
serious business is done in the designers' showrooms where, stripped of
exotic accessories and the most outrageous items, collections can be pieced
together as real women wear them.
Buyers are spending more time in showrooms because increasingly that is
where fashion excitement lies, with young designers, followers of the
avant-garde, who feel that their understated 1990s style does not benefit
from the broad canvas of the catwalk and who cannot afford glitzy locations
and supermodels.
London led the way with, for the first time, a Pounds 30,000 Department of
Trade and Industry grant, by staging a smaller exhibition where hotel rooms
doubled as showrooms and with notably smaller-scale catwalk shows.
In Paris, Martin Margiela, most influential of the Belgian and Nordic
designers whose severe style, often made from recycled fabrics, is now
becoming almost mainstream has, until now, held anarchic shows in derelict
locations and felt unhappy about them.
This season in his showroom he talks visitors through his collection with
the help of a video and speaks for many others when he says the 'human
element' of conversing with his customers is important. 'That way I learn
what people want from my clothes, and they learn to understand them. It is
easy to become remote from reality as a designer.'
Buyers agreed that 1990s fashion is a soft and delicately-detailed flower,
better viewed on an intimate scale, and that the narrow-shouldered,
wide-hemmed, gracefully-fluted longline silhouette promoted by Margiela and
his peers since 1988 is the basis for current change and should be at the
root of anything you buy for autumn or even for this spring.
It is, broadly-speaking, a 1970s shape, but the current rash of styles and
accessories directly inspired by that decade will be but a summer's passion,
in spite of the tight-bottomed black flares being sported by women of all
ages in Paris's spring sunshine last week, far more to French taste than the
long, droopy skirt.
By the autumn, according to Amanda Verdan, buying director for London's
Harvey Nichols department store, wide, soft trousers will have taken over.
'They go with the softer but tailored jacket that no working woman will
abandon', she says.
'Skirts are harder to wear - they should be slightly A-line or bias-cut. But
the real story is soft layers. Fine knit is easiest but the bold way is with
mixed textures - rugged knit with tweed and chiffon, velvet with crochet,
lace and pinstripe. Pinafores and white shirts with long cuffs are
important, plus a velvet jacket and a greatcoat to go over everything.
Colours are black, other rich deeps and brown. The designers doing it best
are Montana, Ozbek, Dolce and Gabbana, Callaghan, Moschino, Betty Jackson,
Jasper Conran and British knitwear firms.'
Her American counterpart at Saks, fashion director Nicole Fischelis, is in
broad agreement. 'This is a romantic, rich season for fabrics like velvet,
lace, brocade and tapestry. And black cobwebby crochet - the Spiderwoman
look. Everything is soft - even Armani has ruffles. Soft knits will be huge
 -Missoni has its best collection in ages.' She is also very struck by
Lagerfeld's 'use of sheers and sophisticated Edwardiana' at Chloe, Dolce and
Gabbana's 'retro but freshly modern' dandies and Lacroix's 'wearable print
and knit mixes in wonderful, unexpected colours'.
Like her, Joan Burstein who owns Browns, one of London's best-known
boutiques, is committed to knits. 'Length and fluidity are essential, even
for the working woman,' she says. 'Jackets will continue but very softly,
perhaps as a cardigan. The long, knitted gilet is the newest shape. Missoni
and Sonia Rykiel, who always do knitted layers, look exactly right now, as
do Romeo Gigli's muted layers.'
She is excited by the so-called avant-garde - Comme des Garcons, Ann
Demeulemeester and Martin Margiela. 'No-one need be afraid of these clothes.
They don't have to look 1970s or raw-edged low-life but this will be a
season when wise shoppers will get personal help so it looks individual, not
fashion-victim. These designers are pushing fashion to its edge but,
carefully edited, the clothes are beautiful'.
Rita Britton, of Pollyanna in Barnsley, one of Northern England's most
adventurous shops, has had a long love affair with the avant-garde and finds
this autumn 'the most exciting season ever for buying. Glitz is dead; now
it's about the simple, dark, cleverly tailored layers that I and my
customers love'.
She is shortly to open a shop devoted to the original Japanese avant-garde
triumvirate of Yohji Yamamoto, Comme des Garcons and Issey Miyake, and has
bought Margiela for the first time.
'I filter creative collections and buy quite safely,' she says, 'and I try
everything on because most of my customers are like me - middle-aged. I love
wide trousers, especially Yamamoto's, Comme's mixes of chiffon and knit,
Margiela's soft cable knit with net overlay and Gigli's soft cashmeres with
ankle-boots. For evening, medieval velvet or bias-cut chiffon and satin
looks right'.
Lucille Lewin, whose Whistles shops are known for promoting young designers,
loves the new narrow-shouldered silhouette. 'It's easy to wear because it
concentrates on the shoulders, which are often pretty, and camouflages
difficult areas like hips and thighs.'
Her choices are minimal and understated - Margiela, Demeulemeester, Marcel
Marongiu's Nordic severity, Koji Tatsuno's 'wonderful experiments with
fabric,' and Ghost's bias-cut layers in antique-looking fabrics. She is also
clever at finding unknowns who get the look right at lower prices.
And what of the fashion journalist's view of next autumn? My own accolades
would go to the recycled low-life look, flatteringly cut and made believable
by Margiela, to Lacroix for taking a ragbag of old silk prints, heavy lace
and tweed and making it look stunningly sexy and to Chanel and Montana for
showing us new ways to wear old favourites, breathing new life into bright
tweed jackets by way of a loose white shirt and longjohns, and into leggings
with cavalier boots and a riding jacket. Even such established names have
discovered that recycling is good for you.

MEDICINE IS a middle brow profession, too serious for its head to be turned
by the vagaries of fashion, too disinterested to notice that fashions
change. Most doctors think the correct dress code should be a boring and
worthy one - 'neat and unostentatious.'
This is certainly the impression one gets surveying the dining-room in the
Royal Society of Medicine at the bottom of London's Wimpole Street, an
agreeable gossip parlour for the hundreds of doctors who have their rooms
nearby. No evidence here of made-to-measure suits or shoes from Lobbs, no
power dressing Joan Collins-style. Rather, there is a vista of nondescript
blues and greys, plain shirts and sober ties interspersed with the sensible
shoes and tweed skirts of women doctors.
There are two exceptions. Heart surgeons dress more expensively because, as
Dr Tom Stuttaford says: 'This gives off a hidden signal that they are rich
and successful, which is bound to boost a patient's confidence.'
Paediatricians, believing that being jokey and cheerful helps break the ice
with their young patients, favour brightly coloured shirts and bow ties.
Still, within the 'neat and unostentatious' range there is room for subtle
variations which reflect the personality types that are attracted to the
different specialities: surgeons, as practical men of a conservative bent,
favour pinstripes; male obstetricians are not averse to flashy ties and
fashionable footwear; geriatricians - the idealists in medicine - wear cheap
shiny suits.
It was not always thus. When a doctor's income was dependent on private
patients, there was a conscious attempt to follow the advice of the 16th
century physician of Salerno that 'a doctor who dresses poorly will attract
poor patients'. Those who could afford to drove a Rolls-Royce and dressed in
a morning suit, top hat and even spats.
But medicine in those days was more theatrical because the best hope of
success was to convince patients they would indeed get better. So Sir Ralph
Bloomfield-Bonington, in Shaw's The Doctor's Dilemma, 'radiated an enormous
self-satisfaction, healing by the mere incompatibility of disease or anxiety
with his welcome presence. Even broken bones, it is said, have been known to
unite at the sound of his voice.'
In the more anonymous setting of the hospital, medical dress changes. When
hospital doctors slip into white coats at the start of the day, they cease
to be private citizens and assume the persona of their profession: clinical,
conscientious and authoritative. The white coat legitimises requests to
perfect strangers to remove their clothes and let themselves be bullied; it
reinforces the reliability of diagnoses and the efficacy of remedies.
The white coat is more than hospital doctors' uniform. It is intrinsic to
the successful practice of their skills.
Among doctors it is a subtle signifier of position in the hierarchy. Medical
students' lowly status is advertised by their coats being truncated just
below the waist. The overworked housemen are identified by pockets bulging
with the notebooks in which they record the many investigations to be
performed on their patients. The registrar is not so encumbered, but as the
hospital management has decreed that junior staff may only change their
coats once a week, it is usually dirtier than the outfit worn by senior
registrars who are allowed to change every day. At the top, consultants
distinguish themselves by not wearing a white coat at all. When doctors at
London St Mary's Hospital were asked in a questionnaire their reasons for
wearing a white coat, 'easy recognition by colleagues' was the dominant
response.
The white coat also has the symbolic meaning of purity. It represents
innocence of purpose and the absence of malice as well as superhuman power
and goodness - the saints who have triumphed over death are robed in white.
White coats are also what scientists wear. It is no coincidence that they
first became popular in hospitals in the 1930s at the time of the
introduction of the first antibiotics, when it became clear that the future
of medicine would lie in discoveries made in laboratories.
Dr Joseph Kriss, of Stanford Medical Centre, says: 'It is symbolic of an
attitude which conveys to even the most anxious patients, a sense of
seriousness of purpose,' - although recently the white coat has come under
attack for 'inhibiting the doctor-patient relationship.'
Similar sentiments have led to the adoption of a casual style of dress in
general practice. Dr Jenny Law, from an inner city practice in Vauxhall,
south London, finds formal clothes 'uncomfortable for myself and off-putting
particularly for children. I know my patients well and they know me and
frankly I think they could not care less what I wear.'
This too was the opinion of Dr Brian McKinstry, a GP in West Lothian, until
he investigated patients' attitudes by showing them five photographs of
differently attired male and female doctors.
'I expected they would favour the smart, casual look of cardigan and sports
shirt - but I was wrong,' he says. The doctor in the smart suit proved much
the most popular followed by one wearing a tweed jacket. The female doctor
in slacks scored lowest of all.
'It is hard to be sure how important this is when compared to a doctor's
kindness or willingness to listen,' he says, 'but if patients do have more
confidence in a well-dressed doctor, then it would seem logical for doctors
to dress in that way.'

FT  27 MAR 93 / Gardening: The Cherry Choo-Choo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNDER THESE amazingly blue skies, garden-watchers are having the spring of a
lifetime. Magnolias are standing out like batteries of white candles; trees
are exhaling blossom everywhere and primroses have never looked happier. It
makes us all want to travel and see it; but where there is travel, there are
customs. I think our wise men are missing a chance. With a slight
encouragement of our national habits, the season could be turned to the
national advantage: it might help with everyone's problem, however, to sell
British Rail.
In the Far East, they have already made the connection. In Japan and Korea,
this week and next are the season of blossom-viewing, when crowds shuffle to
and fro on public transport to gaze at cherry trees, admire their
evanescence, drink too much and take the memory home. In Korea on Thursday,
huge crowds will be converging on the south-eastern town of Chin Hae. There,
40,000 cherry trees are expected to be flowering in the suburbs in the
yearly festival which brings viewers on long train journeys.
Where the Far East is today, should not Britain be tomorrow? We are supposed
to love gardens; our blossom is fantastic; why not pilot a cherry-viewing
festival, shepherd the crowds on to trains for a special Blossom Break and
pack them off to get mildly drunk before clouds of Prunus pissardii of late
March and April? With the year's notice, British Rail could probably cope
with the surge. The design concept would need BR's usual flair but might I
suggest the Cherry Blossom Choo-Choo, fanning southwards into Kent, the
Garden of Britain?
There is what British Rail might call a 'hazzard' in this copycat scheme for
Korea. It involves real trees, whereas the management feels much safer with
artificial substitutes, as you can still see on their London stations. It
also involves unpredictability.
Near Chin Hae, the unpredictable elements are the cherries, which are
sometimes too late for the festival, although tradition has fixed it on
April 1. In Britain, I will explain how we can be more flexible about our
prunus: the problems, rather, are the trains. Here, some of our cherry
blossom is remarkably short-lived, often looking its best for no more than
five days. Setting out on the blossom run, would British Rail arrive in
time? I wish we could be confident.
Knowledge, however, helps to circumvent problems and this year we have been
shown the way forward. Gardeners who avoid prunus trees usually give three
reasons: their season is much too short; after flowering, the leaves are
boring; and too many of their colours are a vile sugar-pink. Each complaint
is narrow-minded and no season has done more to expose them than 1993.
Since January, cherry blossom has been continuous, hopping from one variety
to the next and promising to stretch to the end of May. It makes me keen to
plant a selected cherry calendar and to tie up with Blossom Network
South-East.
As ever, my top Number One tree in Britain is the winter cherry, prunus
subhirtella autumnalis, which has been in flower from November until now and
is just going out in a haze of pale pink-white as the pretty young leaves
emerge. In February, I would suspend briefly the ban on deep, brash pink and
follow up with one of two British selections, based on Japanese blood;
prunus Okame or, even better, Kursar.
After Kursar, I would avoid all varieties of prunus with purple leaves.
Admittedly, the pale clouds of blossom on the popular little pissardii have
looked marvellous in our garden suburbs, where Richmond's side streets are
surpassed only by Oxford's Woodstock Road. In a garden, though, this tall
variety is second rate because the leaves are so drab after flowering.
Instead, I would choose Umeniko; its large, white flowers are short-lived
but the leaves are fresh green on a manageable upright tree.
In April, I have a soft spot for the Sour Cherry, prunus cerasus Rhexii; its
double white flowers are large and showy at a time when the family is
swamped with pink. Our native Geans then take over: first the single prunus
avium and then, a week or so later, its double-flowered sister. As May
begins, it is then time for Tai Haku, the broad-spreading beauty which is
the queen of all the large-flowered whites. Be warned, however, that her
eventual width is very large: she is not a tree for a small garden.
Across five months, therefore, we could surely cope with problems of
time-tabling. Individual cherries are here and gone but, with a seasonal
Blossom Basic, you could be confident of seeing something in this versatile
family. Where there is pilgrimage, there is always a profit: add in a
Blossom Blessing Sunday and the train-loads of pilgrims might raise the
attendance figures of two declining institutions, all for the price of a
single ticket.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Letterboxes for loners: An obscure Dartmoor pastime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMORROW, around 2,000 members of one of Britain's most eccentric clubs will
hold one of their twice yearly 'meets' at the Prison Officers' Social Club
at Princetown, Dartmoor.
There will be no agenda and no formal structure to the meeting, for the
'organisation' behind the Dartmoor Letterboxers has no officers and no
constitution.
Nevertheless devotees of this west country cult will travel to the event
from Scotland, the north of England and Wales to swap information and
reminisce.
All share a passion - hunting plastic ice cream boxes, biscuit tins and
metal ammunition boxes hidden in boggy hollows and under piles of stones on
remote tors.
Each 'letterbox' contains a rubber stamp, a book in which to record his or
her name, and the address and telephone number of the person who put out the
box.
All letterboxers travel armed with a rubber stamp pad and many carry their
own personalised stamp which they insert in the record book in the box.
It is not so very different from the summer day in 1854 when a Dartmoor
guide named James Perrott stuck a bottle in a remote part of the moor called
Cranmere Pool and left his card in it.
The challenge was for people to walk to the pool and leave a calling card or
self-addressed postcard to show they had been there. A custom emerged of
signing a visitor's book and leaving a self- addressed postcard which the
next visitor would carry to a real post box off the moor.
Today, the callers' book remains in every letterbox, but the main challenge
is to log 100 letterboxes and to collect 100 stamps and so become a member
of the Dartmoor Letterboxers 100 Club.
'Although there are now 9,000 recorded members of the 100 club, letterboxing
itself is an extremely informal business,' said veteran plodder Godfrey
Swinscow, 73. He is the genial retired brewer who has acted as a focal point
for the Dartmoor letterboxers since 1978, a year before he founded the 100
club.
Some enthusiasts have beaten the figure of 100 letterboxes many times over.
Michael Perry, a student from Plymouth has discovered nearly all the boxes
and claims to have walked 6,000 miles over the moor in search of them since
the age of 10.
He has sought out letterboxes as a cub, a scout and with his family, and
still spends every second weekend and much of his holiday time letterboxing.
'It's a compulsive pastime. It's challenging, there's an air of mystery to
it, and you meet lots of people,' he said.
'A lot of my friends think I'm a bit weird but, when they try letterboxing
themselves, most of them get hooked. You've got to be a bit crazy to enjoy
it, but my parents still love letterboxing and so do thousands of others.'
What is to stop ordinary members of the public discovering, and possibly
removing or vandalising, letterboxes they might find when out on the moor?
'Nothing,' says Swinscow, 'except that they would have to be very observant,
or very lucky, to find one on foot in a remote area.
'Experience shows that most visitors to Dartmoor rarely walk more than 100
yards from their car. And, of course, if that person is keen enough to walk
that far, he or she will probably be an enthusiastic type who is so
fascinated by the discovery of a letterbox that we gain another recruit to
our ranks.'
At this time of year Swinscow is out on the moor most days, checking,
cataloguing and plotting the locations of letterboxes, which are constantly
arriving and being removed by their 'minders.'
If you do find a letterbox by chance while out on the moor, how do you get
started as a letterboxer? And how, for that matter, did seasoned
letterboxers get going, discover boxes, and go on to 'plant' their own?
'People have to rely a great deal on their initiative, powers of inquiry and
on what they learn from other walkers on the moor - often letterboxers
themselves,' Swinscow said.
He is happy to help aspiring letterboxers get off the mark, but he is also
keen that the pastime should retain an air of mystery.
Swinscow produces a six-monthly printout of all the known letterboxes on the
365 square miles of the moor. It is available only to enthusiasts and is
also the only means of keeping keen letterboxers up to date.
This is because boxes come and go, put out by a wide range of people for a
variety of reasons. The person who puts out the letterbox is also
responsible for its maintenance and, ultimately, for removing it. Swinscow
makes it his business to check this process - inevitably on foot.
'Letterboxing brings pleasure to thousands. It is a very good way of making
friends, poses a challenge, and provides an added interest for young and
possibly slightly reluctant walkers,' he said.
'Above all, it introduces thousands of people to the wonders and mysteries
of a marvellous tract of countryside.'

and 100 Club details write to Godfrey Swinscow, Cross Farm, Diptford,

FT  27 MAR 93 / Ethnic cleansing: the phrase means death: The tactics of
terror used by the Serbians to get rid of unwanted peoples
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MELANIE MCDONAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK, Serbian soldiers fired deliberately on UN helicopters carrying
wounded Moslems from the eastern Bosnian town of Srebrenica. There has been
nothing like this before, according to Elizabeth Baldwin, the spokeswoman
for the UN operation. But the brutality was in keeping with the character of
the war in Bosnia. It was an element of the larger attempt by the Serbs to
drive Moslems from territory they want. In that revolting euphemism used to
dignify expulsion and massacre, it was part of the process of ethnic
cleansing.
There is more than one way of achieving this end, though. If you visit what
is left of Yugoslavia, Serbia itself and Montenegro, you can see the other
means that can be used to get rid of unwanted peoples. You can kill them or
you can make them so frightened that they leave, anyway.
You can see all the conditions for cleansing in place in Pljevlja, a small
town in Montenegro. The Moslems here have two insurmountable problems: they
are in a minority of 40 per cent and the town is only a short drive away
from Bosnia and the war.
It is strange, talking to the men in the bars. They are too frightened to be
seen with westerners on the street or in their homes. 'Even here, I am
afraid,' admitted one. They were all ordinary men: a young science teacher,
a tradesman who had come back from Germany just a few years before, a
chemist shop-owner. Every so often, they would call over someone who had
dropped in. 'We were normal before,' said the shopkeeper. 'Now, we talk
about nothing but politics.'
It is precisely their ordinariness that makes you believe them. They are
prosaic men, constitutionally indisposed to hyperbole. 'After the war in
Bosnia started, all at once relations between Serbs and Moslems became
cold,' said one man. 'Since then, the Serbs have been training with weapons.
Not just Serbs from outside - the town is full of Serbs from Bosnia - but
from here, too. They have the idea of Greater Serbia. Last year, many
Moslems were sent away. There were fire bombs, over 40 attacks on Moslem
businesses.'
I had heard about this already: a paramilitary called Ceko Dasevic was
responsible and had been imprisoned a month ago - because, it was rumoured,
he had fallen out with the federal army commanders. But the psychosis the
bombings brought about still exists. One man had two perfume shops that were
attacked. 'Everything was burned; I don't have the money to start again,' he
said. 'I have a wife and two children, but I don't work. I've got to go - my
life is in danger. If they do that to my business, tomorrow they will do it
to my house.'
Another said: 'I'm a businessman, and for a year I have not been able to
work. For 80 per cent of Moslems, it's like that. It's a psychic condition,
a sickness here. I never thought I would be without work. I'm at home all
day. After eight o'clock, I can't go out. This is a land without law.'
The children put up with a different type of pressure. 'My son is in a class
of 30 children,' said the grocer. 'Ten of them are Moslems. The other day,
he came home to say that the teacher had written all their names on the
board, then crossed them out and written Serbian names beside. My son is
called Riza; the teacher wrote 'Sergen' beside his name.'
But the most concretely ominous development has been the arming of the
Serbs. (Most Moslems, incidentally, insist that their problems are with
Serbs rather than ethnic Montenegrins.) 'The Serbs all have weapons and they
can do what they like,' said one man. 'Recently, I was walking with some
friends and I heard shots in the forest. They were training. On Mondays and
Fridays, on market day, there's most to see here. People come down from the
villages with automatics, in Chetnik uniform. We are closed in here. The
villages on the mountains are all Serb. We have no choice here. We know
exactly how it will happen.'
'It'll be like everywhere else, from Slovenia to Bosnia,' said his friend.
'Serbian propaganda says the Moslems have many weapons. We've got weapons?
Where from - tell me that? Pistols, maybe, but nothing more. But they will
come into town from the hills and say 'Moslems will have to give up their
weapons.' We won't be able to, because we haven't got any. Then they'll say,
'the Moslems have not given up their arms,' and the bombardment will start.'
Another man joined us. He was quiet and undemonstrative, with deep lines
down his face. His town of Bisegrad in Bosnia had been 'cleansed.' He could
not talk about it properly because he was unable to concentrate for long on
those terrible events.
The federal army had occupied Bisegrad for a month. On leaving, it turned
over all its arms to the paramilitaries - the White Eagles and Arkan's
Tigers. The man hid with others in his cellar. The paramilitaries came,
calling for Moslems by name. He saw many things: the women and girls taken
to a hall in the town to be raped; and four men ordered to stand on the
town's bridge, then shot, one by one, with pistols. He had escaped to here,
where relatives had taken him in. He shrugged when I asked him what he
thought about Pljevlja. 'It's exactly the same as where I've come from,' he
said.
After Pljevlja, I returned to neighbouring Kosovo. Here, in the capital of
Prishtine, you can still see election posters from last December. Zeljko
Raznjatovic - better known as 'Commander Arkan,' paramilitary leader and war
criminal - is now the Serbs' elected representative. His poster is on the
walls and inside a few shops: dandling a blond-haired little boy on his
knee, or dapper in military dress.
In this region, which used to be autonomous, there are nearly 2m Albanians:
Serbs make up about 7 per cent of the population. In 1989, Slobodan
Milosevic came here and promised Serbs that Kosovo would always be Serbian.
After that, Kosovo's autonomy was taken away. When Albanian workers went on
strike to protest, 105,000 were sacked - everyone in state employment, from
road sweepers to magistrates.
The Albanian curriculum in schools and university was prohibited; Albanian
education was driven underground. At the same time, the police arrived in
force from Serbia - to protect, they said, the Serbs from Albanian
aggression. Unemployment and police problems might seem to pale besides the
threat of being killed. But the effect - to make people leave, and want to
leave - is the same.
It is in small ways that you notice the increasing demoralisation of the
Albanians. If you walk home at midnight - after the informal curfew - in
Prishtine with an Albanian, you have to tread carefully. You advance slowly
towards a crossing, then glance down the street, searching for the
silhouette of armed police. If the street is clear, you walk ahead rapidly.
Actually, I stayed a few paces behind my companion. When it was safe, I was
beckoned forward. It was not a game - when I last visited the Grand Hotel
here two months ago, an Albanian was shot dead outside the JNA barracks next
door just a couple of hours afterwards. 'You don't understand what it's
like,' my companion said, afterwards. 'The police here aren't normal. All
they want to know is whether you're Serb or Albanian. If you are an
Albanian, they beat you.'
Unemployment, harassment, poverty: the result of the campaign against the
Albanians is predictable. Shortly after I arrived, I met a man who was going
to Turkey the next day with his wife and baby daughter. 'I do not want to
go,' he said, 'but there is no future here.' It does not sound like ethnic
cleansing. But it amounts to the same thing.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Motoring: Ouch] Take that, Rolls-Royce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HANDFUL of rich men who run Rolls-Royces on their businesses are going
to be clobbered by the new company car tax rules.
It is hard for ordinary mortals to feel too badly about the fact that they
are going to have to pay anything from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 15,000 a year
in extra income tax. Most of them will still have an awful lot of spending
money left.
But the effect on Rolls-Royce Motors and the shrinking band of craftsmen it
employs is potentially dire. Unless, that is, changes can be made to the
Finance Bill which will give effect to the chancellor's Budget proposals
while it goes through the House of Commons.
Rolls-Royce Motors is not in the best of financial health. Last year, it
sold 1,378 Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars - 380 of them, nearly all to
companies, in Britain - compared with the 3,000-plus world-wide in the
loadsamoney days of the mid to late 1980s. And it is reckoned to have made a
loss of about Pounds 25,000 on each car sold in 1992.
Having shed nearly 1,000 workers earlier this year in a bid to be slim
enough to be profitable while making only 1,378 cars a year, the thought of
the Budget denying it even a single home market sale is unappealing. So, the
lobbying has started.
In badgering MPs to support a better tax deal for megabuck motorists,
Rolls-Royce will, at least, have the moral support of Mercedes-Benz UK. The
man who runs a Mercedes-Benz 600SEL (list price Pounds 88,600) on his
company will see the taxman's take go up from Pounds 3,720 now to Pounds
4,018 next year, and then more than double to Pounds 8,272 in tax year
1994-5.
That apart, Mercedes-Benz and all the other purveyors of full ranges of
luxury and executive cars, such as Jaguar, Daimler and BMW, have greeted the
Budget with relief. Even, in the case of Jaguar, with enthusiasm.
It calculates that the vast majority of its customers will do rather well
out of it - which, of course, means it will, too. This is all because the
formula based on both engine capacity and price is to be replaced by one
based on list price only.
Here is how the sums add up. A 40 per cent taxpayer who drives a
Mercedes-Benz 190E 2.6 (list price Pounds 25,700) between 2,000 and 18,000
business miles a year now pays Pounds 2,300 tax on the benefit. Under the
new rules, this goes up to Pounds 2,484 next year and then drops to Pounds
2,399 in 1994-95.
The user-chooser with a Mercedes-Benz 190D 2.5 will do better still. From
the present Pounds 2,300, the tax charge rises to Pounds 2,481 from the
fifth of next month and then falls by Pounds 467 to Pounds 2,017 in 1994.
One can see why Rolls-Royce - and, to a lesser extent, Mercedes-Benz UK -
are crying for a cap to be put on taxable car values at, say, Pounds 60,000.
Rolls-Royce feels the loss of revenue would be insignificant but implies
that the loss to the United Kingdom if tax sounded the marque's death knell
would be enormous.
All Jaguars, except for the Pounds 46,600 XJ12, will attract 1994-95 tax
penalties lower than those for 1993-94 by between Pounds 39 (the XJ6 3.2)
and Pounds 880 (XJS 4.0 coupe). A Jaguar XJ12 user will have to pay another
Pounds 333.
But a jubilant Roger Putnam, Jaguar's sales and marketing director, says
this is substantially less than a similar imported V12 (he means a BMW 750i
or 850i or a Mercedes-Benz 600SE or 600SL) would cost the customer.
The chancellor's decision to increase company car tax scale charges by 8 per
cent has gone down less well. It means the driver of a just under two-litre
Rover 800 will pay an additional Pounds 88 a year.
On the other hand, drivers of fuel-saving and environmentally friendly
diesel cars like the Pounds 17,995 Peugeot 605SLDT, Pounds 18,435 Citroen XM
Turbo or Pounds 18,595 Rover 825D will gain substantially.
They have been hard hit by having to pay roughly double the tax of their
petrol-powered counterparts simply because the engines of their vehicles
broke the two-litre cylinder capacity band by a few measly cubic
centimetres. Now, they will pay the same.
Full marks, they will say, to the chancellor for ending a flagrant
injustice; but only two cheers for not increasing the price differential
between unleaded petrol and diesel fuel. They find this hard to square with
his declared aim of using higher fuel prices to reduce energy consumption
and air pollution.
Modern diesel cars use up to 30 per cent less fuel and put less muck into
the atmosphere even than petrol cars with exhaust catalysers. Yet, diesel
prices at the pump, in spite of a marginally lower rate of duty, remain
obstinately about the same as those of unleaded petrol.
Barring Switzerland, where diesel is actually 1.5p a litre dearer than
unleaded petrol, every other European country encourages diesel cars with
cheaper fuel - by as much as 19p a litre in France and 18p in Holland.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the car-makers' mouthpiece
in Britain, thought it really had got the diesel car message across to
government this year. But it believes one expert adviser who has the
chancellor's ear does not like diesel cars and is more inclined to put in
the boot than a good word.
Perhaps next year . . .

are sold

HAS SPRING come to the property market? Not quite, but it looks as if it is
on the way. After a disastrous autumn for UK sales, estate agents are
quietly optimistic that the worst is over. The winter brought many more
viewings and - more significantly - exchanges of contract than in 1992,
especially in London, where lower prices and a lower pound have lured
foreign buyers.
CLEA, the co-operative of Central London Estate Agents, reports that
contracts for sale rose by 30 per cent in January and February compared with
October and November. In the country it has been more quiet but new buyers
are appearing, sometimes with enough money in hand to move quickly.
New to the market are two superb Grade I houses in Hertfordshire, both of
the late 1720s. Much Hadham Hall is probably the work of Nicholas Hawksmoor
(or possibly John James, Wren's master carpenter). The Rev William Stanley,
the rector and a Canon of St Paul's, who was involved in rebuilding the
cathedral after the Great Fire of London in 1666, decided to give himself
this village palace when he failed to become Bishop of London - he knew it
would irritate bishops who used the village as their country seat.
Much Hadham Hall is unusually intact for a house of this period. Built of
brick with a tiled roof, it has large, light rooms around a black and white
stone central hall. In the Georgian coach house a stack of Victorian striped
awnings lurks in a loose box. It also has 6 1/2 acres and an old-fashioned
prep school-type swimming pool. Mullucks Wells (0279-755400) and The London
Office (071-439-3900) offer this gem at around Pounds 950,000.
William Kent did the panelling and decoration in the other jewel, Odsey
House, in Baldock. It is an extraordinary place to find in the country, as
it is a red brick box with a handsome sash-windowed front but plain sides.
It ought really to be part of a terrace in Richmond, Surrey, rather than
deepest Hertfordshire.
The second Duke of Devonshire built this piece of urban sophistication. He
copied his town house in Manchester Square as a racing lodge for use when he
went to Odsey Racecourse. It is a warm, attractive, manageable house, hardly
known until the relisting in the 1980s took it from nowhere to Grade I.
The Devonshires sold it in 1793 to the Fordhams, who kept the house until
1978 when they sold it to the present vendor. Redmayne Arnold &amp; Harris in
Cambridge (0223-323130) and The London Office offers it with three acres at
around Pounds 500,000.
To rent a Regency villa by John Nash (complete with a 'pepperpot' tower)
without paying Regents Park prices, ring the National Trust at Attingham
Park in Shropshire (074-377343), where a house called Cronkhill is on the
estate. Nash grafted it on to a brick and timber farmhouse. Proposed terms
are a six months assured shorthold, giving trust and tenant a chance to see
if they get on, followed by a seven years assured shorthold. The rent is
Pounds 1,200 a month.
At a guide price of Pounds 395,000 Savills (0491-579990) is selling the
Wharfe Boathouse, at Henley-on-Thames, built in the 1890s in chalet style,
with a balcony overlooking the regatta course and the finishing line. You
live upstairs and keep your boats below in an enclosed dock. If you are
entitled to wear the famous pink of Leander Club, this could be your dream
home.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Property: How to be a landlady - Renting your house or flat
can be very profitable, but there are pitfalls. Judi Bevan offers a
trouble-free guide to letting your home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDI BEVAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVITY may be picking up in the housing market, but many homeowners still
have an unsaleable house or flat on their hands. When personal circumstances
change, and the need to move becomes imperative, one solution is to let the
property on a furnished basis. With lower mortgage rates and stable rents,
it can even be profitable.
But there are pitfalls. Agents can go bankrupt, tenants can disappear, cause
damage or run up huge telephone bills. Here is a guide to trouble free
letting:
AGENTS. Most established estate agents have letting divisions. Smaller
agents may give a more personal service, but as one month's deposit is
normally held by them, it is important that they are solvent. Visit them in
their own office for an idea of the size and permanence of the business.
Check out at least two agents and compare rates.
Read the terms thoroughly. For 10 per cent most agents will find tenants,
obtain references, show tenants round the property, take an inventory, and
draw up six months' assured tenancy agreements. For a fuller service, such
as the cleaning and maintenance of the property, servicing of the appliances
and rent collection the fee is likely to be 12.5 per cent or 15 per cent.
TENANTS. Usually portrayed as the victims, bad ones can make a landlord's
life hell. They should be employed, or registered students attending a
recognised academic institution. Obtain written references from employers or
university or college and insist on meeting them.
Make it clear that only those who sign the contract are entitled to live
there. Tenants have a way of inviting their friends to stay permanently.
Tenants and landlord should sign a six-month assured tenancy agreement
approved by a lawyer. Incorporate a clause in the agreement, stipulating the
number of people who may live in the property.
MOVING IN. Have the gas and electricity meters read, or read them yourself
with the agent.
Make sure the new tenants register their names with the gas, telephone and
electricity companies.
Take time to show the tenants round and explain how various appliances work.
Your washing machine may be simplicity itself, but if they do not know how
to clean the filter, there could be problems. If you are not available,
leave clear written instructions stuck on to the appliance.
Remember, it is the landlord's responsibility to pay for repair bills and it
is often difficult to prove negligence.
MOVING OUT. Two weeks before tenants are due to move out, arrange to have
the meters read and the telephone disconnected.
Ask them NOT to have the gas or electricity cut off. (It can be a nightmare
to try and be reconnected at short notice.) Inspect the property with your
agent immediately they move out and before the deposit has been returned.
Check the heating and test all the appliances. Do NOT rely on the tenant's
word that everything is working. Check the inventory with the agent and
assess any damage and cleaning. Tenants should leave the property as they
found it.
Return the deposit to them, minus any expenses.
Make sure you have all the keys back.
FINANCE. In order for the property to pay for itself, the rent - minus tax -
should meet the mortgage repayments. One factor in the equation is that once
you are letting, the property ceases to be your main residence and you will
lose your Miras tax relief. Tax on the rental income is payable at your top
marginal rate and is assessed in advance.
Legally, you must inform your building society of your intention to let the
property. They will tell the Inland Revenue. Some building societies charge
an additional half percentage point in interest when properties are let.
Often, the threat of moving your mortgage will deter them.
Rent is paid in advance. Outgoings include the mortgage repayments, tax less
10 per cent wear and tear plus any decoration.
For example a house or flat worth Pounds 100,000 will fetch around Pounds
800 a month. At a mortgage rate of 8 per cent that will finance a Pounds
55,000 loan assuming tax at 40 per cent minus 10 per cent of the rent on
wear and tear. On a tax rate of 25 per cent the loan financed would be
Pounds 65,000.
If you plan to rent for more than a year or so, it may be worth getting a
fixed rate mortgage.
Adjust your insurance which should now be for the building only.
Tenants are responsible for any damage and may take out their own contents
insurance.
HOUSE. The better maintained, the higher the rent you can ask. Do not expect
tenants to take care of the property, no matter how nice they seem.
Do not leave valuable ornaments, pictures and furniture in the property. Do
not leave non-essential electrical appliances such as televisions or sound
systems.
Impress on tennants the need to telephone you or the agent immediately there
are problems. Be a good landlord or landlady and they are more likely to be
good tenants.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Minding Your Own Business: After the ball: designer deals
with sudden fame - Nikki Tait meets the woman who made Hillary Clinton's
ball gown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW DOES a budding entrepreneur cope with a rush of publicity?
Ask Sarah Phillips, the Manhattan-born designer who created the blue-violet
ballgown which Hillary Clinton wore on the evening of Inauguration Day. The
dress, with its lace bodice, heavy beading and wafting mousseline overskirt,
twinkled across 30m television screens as the newly-installed first lady
waltzed round Washington dance-floors.
Designing the gown would have been a plum commission for any fashion
business. The garment, after all, goes on show at the Smithsonian
Institution and coverage of the inaugural balls is watched worldwide. But
for a 37-year-old designer, who started her business only two years ago, the
assignment would seem to represent the ultimate break.
Five minutes with Phillips dispels such illusions. For a start, she is
talking from a loft, situated on a grafitti-ridden stretch of Manhattan's
Lower East Side. This is where she lives and works, swatches of material
nestling behind her sculptor husband's metalwork.
Not only is the apartment unpretentious, it is also frenetic. No sooner has
Phillips finished haggling down the telephone with a supplier, than her
husband begins a laborious conversation with the White House. He is
struggling to secure pictures of the Inauguration evening on behalf a
Japanese magazine interviewer. Forget secretaries, PR advisors, or flunkies.
This is a one-woman, husband-assisted show - and taking advantage of the
avalanche of interest which has followed the ballgown design is proving an
uphill task.
Phillips's basic problem is lack of capital. She started the business with
about Dollars 65,000 (Pounds 45,000) of family money, after training at New
York's Parsons School of Design and working for the likes of Ralph Lauren
and Christian Dior. She has never received a cent of outside funding, not
even a commercial bank loan.
As a result, her scant working capital is tied up in a treadmill of sample
lines and production costs. With no assets besides her talent, she is not
the sort of proposition which has lenders salivating. Yet, to take advantage
of her sudden fame - via a showroom or stepped-up orders - she badly needs
financing.
Phillips, who aims to produce a spring and an autumn line, explains how the
numbers work: 'It usually costs Dollars 25,000-Dollars 30,000 to do a sample
line of about 30 pieces,' she says. (Her 'normal' focus is on
highly-tailored day and evening wear, ranging from a full-length coat which
retails at Dollars 5,000, to evening pieces in the Dollars 1,000-Dollars
4,000 range).
'Basically, you need to have all this money upfront. Then you take your
orders and produce. Again, you have to have the money to buy all the fabric,
meet all the production costs.' Production expenses, she estimates, are
about 40 per cent of sales.
'Next, you ship the goods, and then the stores don't pay until 30-120 days
after you've delivered. By that time, you've had to start your second sample
line.'
Phillips's orders have grown nicely, as a handful of upmarket boutiques and
store chains, including Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, have taken her
merchandise. Orders, which totalled Dollars 60,000 in the autumn 1991
season, topped Dollars 300,000 for the 1993 spring season. However, to fund
the twice-yearly process and with limited funds to hand Phillips has been
forced to raise cash by selling her purchase orders to factors.
The factoring businesses buy the orders at a discount of 1 per cent a week.
'That means I'm paying them Dollars 3,000 a week to buy my fabrics and
produce the line for me,' says Phillips.
'We gave the factors Dollars 50,000 last season. The season before that we
spent Dollars 25,000. Plus they get a fee. And this is all because banks
will not lend to people who are starting out in business.'
Phillips admits that the small scale of her operation increases the problem:
'The whole idea is that you want to ship every month, so your cashflow is
better.'
She also acknowledges that her search for more substantial capital resources
should have been given higher priority.
'We had some investors who were interested, but they weren't familiar with
the industry and didn't understand the deadlines. We had to get the fall
line out for this season, and a month went by. We really trusted them, which
was probably our fault, when we should have been pursuing other avenues.'
In the end, the investors dropped out, and Phillips says she does not know
what will happen next.
But if capital problem was rumbling before the ballgown fame, it became
doubly vexatious afterwards. 'We never expected the assignment,' says
Phillips, who was asked to submit evening gown suggestions after Hillary
Clinton bought a Phillips-designed suit in a Little Rock boutique and wore
it at the Democratic Convention.
'We just weren't prepared. There were a lot of orders we couldn't fill
because we didn't have the capital to go out and buy more fabric. Besides,
it was getting so late at that point. We were starting all of our production
patternwork, and that was the end of January. We were due to ship at the end
of February and it was just too tight (to take on extra work). If we were
larger firm, we could have handled it.'
A few lesser problems have also emerged. First, Phillips is now firmly
associated in the public mind with ballgowns - or, in the case of some
customers, bridalwear.
'I don't do ballgowns,' she wails, sounding like an actress who is terrified
of being typecast. 'I did one particular ballgown for the first lady, and
that's the only ballgown I've ever done. I really don't want to make a
business of ballgowns. You don't make money.'
Secondly, she is uncertain how the fashion business generally is responding
to her sudden fame.
'A lot of popular designers got their nose bent out of shape on Seventh
Avenue . . . they wanted the job and were calling the Governors' Mansion in
Little Rock on a daily basis. I understand. Who wouldn't want it? Still,
when a relative unknown gets it . . . some established designers who happy
about it, although others were great.'
Phillips says she would not have missed the sudden glory. She knows that she
has acquired wider name-recognition as a result. Her husband shows a set of
'behind-the-scenes' snaps he took of the Inauguration Day evening, which
will probably become family heirlooms. They hope that the search for backing
will prove fruitful.
'But,' says Sarah Phillips, a little wistfully. 'I would have prefered all
this to have happened later in my career.'

FT  27 MAR 93 / Minding Your Own Business: A rare package: cheap and simple
 -Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CARTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the healthiest developments in software is the increasing interest
vendors are taking in the Soho ('Small Office, Home Office') market. All the
big companies - Lotus, WordPerfect, Microsoft - are active here.
The most common Soho product is the integrated package, combining the three
base applications of word processor, spreadsheet and database into one. So,
for example, you can use the word processor to write your letters, the
spreadsheet to keep track of sales and purchases, and the database to store
names and addresses of contacts.
Integrated packages are the Ford Sierras of the software market. Although
attention invariably focusses on the Rolls Royce products, for most of us an
integrated package will more than fit the bill, and at a bargain price too.
Why pay Pounds 300-Pounds 400 apiece for Microsoft's Word and Excel when
Works for Windows gives you the essentials of both packages plus a very
decent personal database, all for Pounds 145 the lot? So it is worth notice
that this month's edition of PC Magazine evaluates eight of the leading
integrated packages on the market.
Anyone who has tried reading product reviews in computer magazines will know
that many are incomprehensible, written by experts who are difficult for the
layman to understand. PC Magazine is written for the corporate power user
and its reviews run true to form, with tests to find out which package is
the fastest in handling documents 15,000 words long or spreadsheets 100,000
characters in size. In real life few will buy an integrated package for this
sort of heavyweight application.
PC Magazine also conducts 'useability tests'. A group of office employees
with experience of word processors and spreadsheets were given a set of
tasks to perform on each package. Their progress and their responses were
monitored. In contrast to the reviews, which can be safely ignored, PC
Magazine's useability reports deserve close study, since they give the best
approximation to how a new user is likely to get on with a package.
The overall winner of the eight tested and 'editor's choice' was Microsoft
Works (so it should have been, since it was virtually identical to what many
of the testers were used to already). Works is a classic package and superb
value for money. I use it myself. However, it is a sophisticated piece of
software which presumes considerable prior knowledge of computer concepts.
The manual and on-line tutorial contain reference material only and help the
experienced user, rather than the beginner.
Most Soho users are working on their own and cannot call upon outside help.
Nor can they afford to call in training consultants or to go off on courses
at Pounds 350 per day like the corporate user. So Microsoft Works may not be
ideal for novices unless they are the sort who relish a challenge and have
bags of time to puzzle everything out.
If the main reason for buying a computer is to improve productivity, it
becomes self-defeating if the buyer then has to drop everything else for a
fortnight in order to learn how to use it. I would guess that some
intelligent layman learning by trial and error, might take between three to
12 months to master all of Microsoft Works, with a lot of wasted time and
false starts.
Software packages grow ever more complex, packed with more and more
features. There are few on the market about which one can say to an
intelligent novice who does not need sophisticated features: 'This is the
package you want; it is simple and straightforward and all the help you need
is in the manual' and be confident that they can start being productive
right away.
The only such integrated package I can think of is PFS First Choice from
Spinaker Corporation, included in the PC Magazine review and praised by the
testers for its simplicity as 'a good choice for novices and home users.' If
you just want to do the basics and are willing to forgo the fancy fonts and
graphics in order to become productive quickly, PFS-First Choice is the
package to get.
The normal price is Pounds 159, but PC World stores (part of Dixons) are
offering both PFS-First Choice and its companion PFS-First Publisher, a
desk-top publishing package, for Pounds 79. The manuals of both contain
really excellent tutorials which will get you off to a flying start. Also on
offer are Windows versions of both packages. These are more 'modern' and
sophisticated, but if it is productivity you want you've got to keep it
simple. Stick to the older DOS versions.
PC World stores are at Croydon (081-649-9000), Lakeside (0708-869869),
Brentford (081-560-0000) and Staples Corner (081-450-0909). Alternatively,
contact Spinnaker on 081-742-7222.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Take care of that pension - How to
make the best use of benefits and avoid the vultures / Redundancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENSION choices for the redundant are similar to those facing job changers,
but with one major difference - the newly-redundant usually have not lined
up the next career move. Experts recommend strongly that you leave your
benefits where they are and avoid the pension transfer vultures.
Stephen Walmesley-Cotham, a senior financial consultant with actuary William
M. Mercer, says: 'If you talk to an adviser about investing redundancy
money, you may be persuaded to look at transferring your pension benefits at
the same time. Don't do so unless you are clear about the future or there is
some other over-riding reason for taking an immediate decision.'
Nigel Taylor, a partner with actuary Clay &amp; Partners, reports disturbing
news about those just made redundant. 'We have had first--hand experience of
situations where insurance company salesmen were waiting outside the office
door within two hours of a redundancy announcement,' he says. 'We have also
seen insurance companies attempt to recruit newly-redundant individuals to
sell policies to their colleagues.'
Options
When you have sorted out your future employment, there are three main
options: to leave your pension where it is; to transfer it to a new
employer's scheme; or to transfer to an insurance-based product.
A fourth option - taking a cash refund of contributions - is available only
to employees with less than two years' pensionable service. The refund,
which might be compulsory, does not include the employer's contributions.
Refunds are subject to two deductions: first, to account for the tax relief
that applied to contributions and, second, to cover back payments into the
state earnings-related pension scheme if the pension plan was
contracted-out.
Deferred pension
For those with more than two years' service, the simplest (and often the
most sensible) option is to leave your benefits with the former company
scheme. This is known as a deferred pension because the scheme retains your
benefits until you retire. But employees with under five years' service can
be forced to transfer out.
Deferred pensions can offer several advantages, but much depends on the
generosity of the scheme in making payments above the legal minimum. For
employees leaving service after 1985, the law requires all deferred pensions
to be increased annually in line with retail price inflation (RPI) up to a
maximum of 5 per cent. This is known as limited price indexation (LPI).
Some schemes make more generous increases, while full RPI is standard in the
public sector. Clearly, this is an important point in favour of the deferred
option. Other plus points are generous benefits for spouses and dependants.
At present, there is no legal requirement to increase pensions apart from
the guaranteed minimum pension (gmp) element, which replaces the State
Earnings-related Pension Scheme benefit in a company scheme that is
contracted-out.
Pending legislation will require schemes to increase pensions in payment by
LPI from when the regulations are introduced.
Transfer to new scheme
If your new employer runs a pension scheme, you can take an inter-company
transfer. But transfers between company pension schemes are notoriously
complex.
In a typical 'final salary' scheme, pension benefits build up at
one-sixtieth of your final salary for each year of service up to a maximum
of 40/60ths, or two-thirds, final salary. (The pensions of some high earners
may be restricted further).
In an inter-company transfer, the ceding scheme actuary takes the number of
'years' you have built up and calculates the cash equivalent. The receiving
scheme actuary then calculates how many 'years' that sum will buy in the new
scheme.
Often, there is a discrepancy between the number of years in the old and new
schemes. This is partly because of the relatively low assumptions used to
calculate the cash equivalent, but also because you might be buying better
benefits in the new scheme or your pension could be based on a higher
salary. If you are concerned about the apparent discrepancy, you could ask
an independent actuary to check the figures.
Bear in mind that if your transfer leaves you with a gap in provision, it is
possible to top-up a company pension with additional voluntary contributions
(AVCs) available through the employer's scheme, or with free-standing AVCs
available mainly from the life offices.
Transfers to insurance products
Only when you have assessed the merits of a deferred pension or
inter-company transfer should you consider a switch to a buy-out bond or
personal pension, both of which are available from the life offices (and, in
the case of personal pensions, from a handful of unit trust groups and
friendly societies as well).
These products operate on a money purchase basis, which means that the
contributions or lump sum transfers are invested to build up a fund at
maturity. This fund is used to buy an annuity to provide the retirement
income.
In switching from a final salary to a money purchase pension, you lose
important guarantees. In particular, the pension - which, in the case of
most company schemes, would have been a guaranteed proportion of your final
salary - will now depend on a combination of the investment returns, the
insurance company's charges, and the prevailing annuity rates.
If you opt for an insurance product, you need expert advice on the type and
provider. Buy-out bonds retain the guaranteed minimum pension. Personal
pensions offer no minimum guarantees.
Under both products, a proportion of the fund can be taken as tax-free cash.
The maximum proportion under a personal pension is 25 per cent, whereas up
to a third of the buy-out bond can be taken as cash. Walmesley-Cotham says:
'As a general rule, people with a shorter period to run to retirement, and a
reasonably long period of pensionable service, may do better with a buy-out
bond. Those who are further from retirement, with a shorter period of
pensionable service, may do better with a personal pension.'
Early retirement
Companies that embark on a major redundancy programme may offer a special
pension deal for volunteers. The most common perk is early retirement
without actuarial reduction of the pension. This can boost the value of the
benefits by as much as 20-30 per cent.
Care should be taken with the golden handshake. Any excess over Pounds
30,000 will be taxed at the individual's highest rate, so you should ask to
have this re-directed into the pension benefit - particularly where this
will be taxed only at the basic rate.
Clearly, the whole transfer process requires expert advice. If you think a
mistake has been made by the company scheme, you should put your complaint
in writing to the trustees. If you are still not satisfied, contact the
Occupational Pensions Advisory Service (tel. 071-233 8080), preferably
through the local Citizens Advice Bureau.
If the problem lies with an adviser or provider, you should contact the
regulatory authority. This will normally be either Fimbra (tel. 071-538
8860) or Lautro (tel. 071-379 0444).

FT  27 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Bonus payouts are cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOWNWARD trend in pay-outs on with-profits policies has continued in the
past two weeks. Prudential, the largest life insurer in the UK, has cut both
terminal and reversionary bonuses. Assuming policies had been taken out by a
29-year-old man paying monthly premiums of Pounds 30, 10-year endowments
would have paid Pounds 6,350 (7 per cent down on last year's Pounds 6,828),
and 25-year policies Pounds 58,032 (3.4 per cent down on last year's Pounds
60,075).
In addition, the Pru is cutting back on sales of its with-profits,
single-premium bond, the Prudence Bond, which also invests in the company's
main life fund. Minimum investment has been increased from Pounds 10,000 to
Pounds 15,000 while early-surrender penalties have been added. If you
discontinue in the first year there is a penalty of 5 per cent, reducing to
3 per cent in the second and 1 per cent in the third.
Legal &amp; General has also cut bonuses across the board. As a result, using
the same assumptions, pay-outs fall 7.9 per cent (from Pounds 6,704 to
Pounds 6,173) over 10 years, and 2.4 per cent (from Pounds 61,586 to Pounds
60,113) over 25. Over 10 years, this is equivalent to an annual return of
10.4 per cent, while the return was 13 per cent over 25 years.
Britannic Assurance also announced reversionary bonus cuts, which brought
10-year pay-outs down by 6.1 per cent since the same time last year (from
Pounds 6,796 to Pounds 6,385). But Britannic bucked the trend over 25 years,
increasing pay-outs by 3.6 per cent (from Pounds 51,336 to Pounds 53,160) -
although this leaves it as one of the lowest-paying companies.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Transferring shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM RETIRED with both state and employment pensions, sufficient for me to
pay income tax. As I have a number of shares in my name, I would like to
know the procedure for transferring these into my wife's name so that she
will be able to reclaim the tax paid on dividends. Do I complete a stock
transfer form to make this change? Yes, you should complete a stock transfer
form for each shareholding (not forgetting to complete the stamp-duty
exemption certificate on the back); your wife should then send the forms and
share certificates to the registrars. Very few registrars make any charge
for registering transfers.
To prevent an attack under the anti-avoidance provisions, aimed at husbands
who try to use their wives as mere puppets to obtain tax relief for their
own benefit, we recommend that your wife have the dividends paid into an
account in her sole name (to which you have no access).
The basic principle is that your wife clearly must be free to spend the
whole of the income and capital as she pleases without being in any way
answerable to you as to where it has gone.
Your wife might like to ask the local tax inspector's office for the free
pamphlet IR110 (a guide for people with savings).

FT  27 MAR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: When a gift is a sale
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I OWN THREE light industrial units which I bought in 1981 and 1982 and set
wholly against income tax as then allowed. They are now worth more than the
original price. If I sold them, I understand that I would be taxed on the
income tax relief previously claimed, and then face a CGT bill on any excess
of the price realised over the original price. If I gave them away to my
adult son, what would be the position?
By virtue of section 21(6) of the Capital Allowances Act 1990, any transfer
of the relevant interest in an industrial building otherwise than by sale in
the open market has the same consequences as a sale at the price which it
would have fetched on a sale in the open market. Ask your tax office for the
free pamphlets CA2 (Capital allowances on industrial buildings) and CGT16
(Capital gains tax: indexation allowance: disposals after April 5 1988).

FT  27 MAR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Avoiding an IHT bill
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT IS the inheritance tax position if a mother and a daughter have joint
holdings in a property and the mother dies? I am referring here to joint
holdings, not tenants-in-common. What, also, is the position of the
daughter's future children?
The transfer of the property interest by the mother to the daughter would
attract IHT subject to an available nil rate band of up to Pounds 150,000.
For property law, the property would pass to the other joint owner; but for
IHT purposes, this would still be a chargeable transfer. It would be
sensible to 'skip' a generation by ensuring that the property passes to the
children of the daughter so that no IHT is payable on her death. Obviously,
the other commercial ramifications would need to be considered for such an
action.
This answer was provided by Barry Stillerman of Stoy Hayward.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Entitled to benefit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVING BOUGHT Treasury 8 per cent 2009 on the National Savings register, I
was charged Pounds 309.10 for 138 days' accrued interest (gross). Can I
offset this against the first payment of gross interest, and account to the
Inland Revenue only for tax on the difference?
Also, having bought some Inchcape 12 1/2 per cent ULS and Bristol &amp; West
Pibs, I was charged a total of Pounds 354.40 as accrued interest. When I
receive payment of the first interests, they will be paid net - which, of
course, covers the accrued periods. Have I a claim for recovery of tax on
the Pounds 354.40?
Although you forgot to tell us the nominal amount of each holding, it is
clear that the total nominal amount exceeds Pounds 5,000. That being so, you
are entitled to the benefit of the accrued-income scheme (AIS), and can
claim the appropriate relief in your next tax return. Meanwhile, ask your
tax office for the free pamphlet on the AIS: IR68.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Covenant payments cannot be stopped
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NINE YEARS ago, I made covenants in favour of two grandchildren and arranged
that the deeds would carry on until my death. This was accepted by the
Inland Revenue. Two more grandchildren arrived in 1987 and 1988. I then made
further deeds of covenant.
I am approaching 85 and realise it is unlikely that the covenants will run
until the youngest child is 18. This means that the older two will have a
distinct advantage at my death. I am now considering ceasing the first two
covenants and then terminating the others when the younger boys have
received the same amount as the older ones.
You cannot cease the payments made under such a covenant. The deeds create
binding legal obligations which can be enforced against you, and the parents
of the minor children have a duty to enforce them.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Govett fights back from disaster -
New managers are helping an ailing fund to rebound sharply / Investment
Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS UNUSUAL for an investment trust to be viewed as a recovery stock, but
that is probably the best way of looking at Govett Strategic. After a
disastrous period late in the 1980s, it is now being re-shaped by two new
managers. The question is: have they done enough to restore its reputation?
The trust was founded in 1923 as Border and Southern, and changed its name
to Govett Strategic, adopting a new aggressive philosophy, in 1985. The
strategy was for the trust to take very large stakes in small companies and
to use them, on occasion, to provoke bid situations.
Early in 1987, this philosophy was extraordinarily successful. Smaller
companies were outperforming and the trust's gearing (via three debentures)
was enhancing returns. Net assets per share rose nearly 71 per cent in the
year to September 30 1987.
But, as the graphs show, Govett Strategic fell off a cliff late in 1987. The
gearing worked against it, small stocks suffered dramatically and, with
large stakes, it was difficult for the trust to liquidate its holdings. In
the year to September 30 1988, net assets fell by 44 per cent.
There was more bad news in 1990 as the recession and the Gulf crisis hit the
UK stock market - and small company shares, in particular. Net assets fell
by 44 per cent again in 1990 and, at 206.9p, were lower than their 1985
level.
This was not a situation which a board could be expected to endure. In April
1991, Govett Strategic brought in two new, young managers from NM
Rothschild: Marc Gordon and Nigel Savage. It also promised shareholders the
right to a vote in the winter of 1993 on whether to continue the trust.
This helped to narrow the discount, which had risen to over 25 per cent but
has traded recently in the 10-15 per cent range.
Gordon and Savage found a trust which, they say, was unfocussed and
structured poorly - 50 per cent of the portfolio was in stocks with market
capitalisations of less than Pounds 100m. There were 11 companies where the
trust had stakes of more than 10 per cent.
The weeding process took time but is now largely complete. The 10 largest
stocks in the revamped portfolio are: Blenheim Exhibition, Tilbury Douglas,
Farnell Electronics, Microfilm Reprographics, Takare, Cookson Group, Shell,
Medeva, Kalon and Davis Service.
How successful has the change been? As the graph shows, the trust's
September year-end did not help. At that time, the market had not yet
responded to the benefits of Britain's exit from the exchange rate
mechanism.
Net assets per share were 198.8p, below their 1985 level. Since then,
though, the trust has rebounded with a vengeance.
Net assets per share are up nearly 30 per cent and investors enjoyed a 50.1
per cent return in the six months to March 1, according to Micropal
(mid-market to mid-market, with net income re-invested). Over the past year,
the trust is second in the UK general sector, with a rise of 27.1 per cent.
Lewis Aaron, analyst at SG Warburg Securities, does not think Gordon and
Savage have done enough, however. He points out that 45 per cent of the
trust is owned by five institutions (including Robert Fleming, with 15.4 per
cent), which might well look for a wind-up. But he feels there is the
possibility of a smaller, successor trust.
Hamish Buchan, of NatWest Securities, says the 'jury is still out' on
Govett's revamp. He points out that there is a 'poison pill' in the Pounds
95m of debentures which the trust has outstanding. These are trading above
par value so would cost extra to redeem - this would knock off another
8p-10p in the event of a wind-up.
So, there is likely to be some vigorous debate about the trust's future when
the wind-up vote comes due towards the end of this year.
Key facts. The trust has gross assets of Pounds 362m and net assets of
Pounds 266m. As of March 24 the net asset value was 272p, putting the
shares, at 237p, on a discount of 13 per cent. The yield was 3.8 per cent.
The management fee is 0.375 per cent of assets, with a further 0.125 per
cent if the trust outperforms the All-Share index by 1 per cent.
Board. The chairman is Alan McLintock, the chairman of Woolwich building
society. Other directors include Bryan Himes, a former general manager of
ICI; John Kay, professor of economics at the London Business School; George
Nissen, an adviser to Morgan Grenfell; and Michael Orr, chairman of Molins.
Directors with Govett connections are Martin Beaver, Mark Cornwall-Jones and
William Govett.
Savings scheme and Pep details. The minimum monthly investment in the
savings scheme is Pounds 25, and the lump sum Pounds 250. There is a charge
of 1 per cent on all shares purchased, with a minimum of Pounds 1. Stamp
duty also is payable. On sales, the administration charge is also 1 per
cent, with a minimum of Pounds 10. Dealing commission is 0.25 per cent.
Although the trust is Pepable, Govett has no specific plan related to it.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Barclays sets a trap for fraudsters
 -The latest deterrent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS Bank will be using a new computer system from April 1 to trap
fraudsters who try to use stolen credit cards.
The system, known as Fraud 2000, will monitor 100,000 daily purchases on
cards issued by Barclays. The bank is the largest issuer of credit cards in
the UK with between 35 and 40 per cent of the market.
Last year, it suffered worldwide losses from credit card fraud of Pounds
31.1m, down from the peak of Pounds 33m in 1991. Total plastic card fraud in
the UK last year amounted to Pounds 165m.
Fraud 2000 will compare the purchase with a range of common indicators of
card fraud, such as the number of transactions made in one day or the amount
being spent. If it becomes suspicious - something which Barclays expects to
happen in 20 per cent of cases - the computer will then look at the
customer's account in detail and compare the purchase to their normal
pattern of spending.
Barclays says this checking process will take only one fifth of a second. If
the computer logs anything suspicious, it will alert Barclaycard's 24-hour
fraud referral unit; Barclays expects this to happen in 250 cases a day.
A member of the unit will then speak to the customer over the telephone to
check that the card owner is genuine. Details of the credit card account
will be sought as well as personal information.
In cases where Barclays suspects fraud is involved, the unit will contact
the police.
The main difference with the existing Fraudwatch computer system is that
data will be analysed 'live' instead of days later when the vouchers reach
Barclays. 'Given that around a third of our customers fail to report their
card as being lost or stolen within 48 hours, Fraud 2000 will eliminate the
head start fraudsters have had in the past,' says Barclays.
However, the new system can only be used for those transactions where the
retailer authorises the card directly with Barclays, either electronically
or by telephone.
Authorisation operates in only 20 per cent of transactions but Barclays says
it aims to increase the number of authorised transactions to one in four
this year and to half by 1996.
The Consumers' Association welcomed the initiative but said it was concerned
at the potential for embarrassment to genuine cardholders called to the
telephone in front of other customers.
Barclays says it does not wish to lose customer goodwill. Its existing fraud
control systems led to 3,500 arrests last year.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Why overdrafts will cost more - Bank
charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVERDRAFT charges on interest-bearing current bank accounts are being
increased, mostly at the expense of those who overdraw without permission.
National Westminster, Midland, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and
Yorkshire have all either increased or announced a rise in charges recently.
Some are also restructuring charges. To avoid paying more than you should,
it is important to know your bank's charging policy.
Free overdraft
Some banks are still reasonably generous. Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland and
Bank of Scotland offer their interest-bearing current account-holders a free
overdraft facility of Pounds 100. Girobank's Keyway (an interest-bearing
current account) has a Pounds 20 free overdraft, while you can be overdrawn
by up to Pounds 250 for three days without incurring interest or fees with
the Co-Op Bank's Ultra interest-bearing account.
Overdraft fees
Many people overlook the 'handling' fees charged by banks, concentrating
instead on the annual interest rate.
Banks have moved away gradually from transaction fees - a charge made for
each cheque or cash withdrawal during a quarter - in favour of flat fees.
Those still retaining the former on their non-interest bearing current
accounts are Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland and Yorkshire. But the flat fees
now are mostly charged monthly instead of quarterly and NatWest has
announced daily charges as well.
While the change favours those who are overdrawn briefly within a quarter,
it is more expensive for those who overdraw every month.
From June 1, NatWest is to drop the Pounds 23 quarterly fee on its current
account for an authorised overdraft and replace it with a monthly charge of
Pounds 9. But it also has introduced daily charges of Pounds 3.50 for those
who stray above their agreed overdraft limit by more then Pounds 50. This
makes it the most expensive high street bank for those who have an
unauthorised overdraft for a lengthy period.
Barclays Bank has increased its unauthorised monthly fee from Pounds 25 to
Pounds 30 while Midland customers holding an Orchard account - the
interest-bearing current account - will from May 10 be charged Pounds 17 a
month instead of Pounds 15. The monthly fee for those with a prior agreement
remains Pounds 7.
Midland is also substituting monthly charges for quarterly fees on its
non-interest bearing current account. From June 5, the quarterly fee of
Pounds 15 for an authorised overdraft will be replaced by a monthly charge
of Pounds 7 - a 40 per cent increase for those overdrawn for a few days each
month. Those who become overdrawn without agreement will be charged Pounds
17 a month instead of Pounds 39 a quarter - a 31 per cent increase.
Yorkshire Bank and Girobank are unusual in charging a flat fee regardless of
whether you have an agreed overdraft. The fee is Pounds 8.50 a month (up
from Pounds 8 a month since March 15) for Yorkshire and Pounds 11 a month at
Girobank. Yorkshire says it regards the difference in its interest rates on
the two types of overdraft as sufficient penalty (see table).
Interest rates on overdrafts.
The table shows the annual percentage rates charged now on interest-bearing
current accounts. The APR calculation includes the overdraft fee, but some
banks quote only an equivalent annual rate which excludes it.
Co-op and Bank of Scotland charge a single interest rate. Co-op says this is
because considers all overdrafts above its Pounds 250 overdraft facility as
unauthorised. Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland leave the
authorised interest rate on their non-interest bearing current accounts to
the manager's discretion.
Other charges.
Banks also will charge for sending out an overdraft letter and for rejecting
bounced cheques when a customer is overdrawn without authorisation, although
NatWest is removing the charge on such letters after June 1 and Barclays
also does not charge. TSB does not send out overdraft letters; it notifies
customers of charges at least 14 days before making them.

IN THE WEEK of the Budget, directors continued to take profits on their own
shareholdings, a trend which has not altered much since the start of the
year.
With shares in Serco Group outperforming the market by 21 per cent over the
last month David Perkins, the finance director, continued to take profits
from his holding, selling 50,000 shares at 925p. This follows on from his
sale earlier this month of 20,000 at 825p.
Earlier this year three directors of First Leisure, the holiday and leisure
centres group, sold shares at 325p. Most recently, a fourth director Richard
Mills sold 25,000 - about a third of his holding - at 358p.
Following the announcement last week of results for 1992, which were broadly
in line with market expectations, Brian Hawkins, managing director of Hall
Engineering, bought 10,000 shares at 165p.
Louis Goodman, managing director of Citysite Estates, the property
development company, bought 295,000 7 per cent CULS at 25p adding to the
significant purchases he made in February.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: BAT's scrip deal looks a winner -
Small shareholders will benefit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT INDUSTRIES announced this week that it wants to offer a scrip dividend
worth 50 per cent more than the 22.6p final cash dividend which the tobacco
and financial services group had already announced on March 10.
RTZ Corporation, the mining group, also plans to offer a scrip dividend 50
per cent higher than its recently announced cash dividend of 13.5p. Other
companies are considering enhancing their scrip, but only a few are likely
to find this an appropriate way of rewarding shareholders.
BAT has taken this course partly because its large overseas earnings give it
a problem with unrelieved advance corporation tax. ACT is not payable on
scrip issues, and this scheme - depending on the level of take-up - could
save the company Pounds 100m in ACT and Pounds 330m in dividends.
BAT shareholders who still want cash can sell their scrip, worth 33.9p a
share, for 32.2p. Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities, BAT's joint broker,
will not charge dealing costs: the 5 per cent discount is to cover BZW's
market risk in underwriting the deal.
Although institutions such as pension funds traditionally are wary of scrip
issues, the best advice for small shareholders is clear: vote for and then
take the enhanced scrip, assuming the scheme is approved by the necessary 75
per cent majority at BAT's annual general meeting in May. Those wanting cash
should also take advantage of BZW's dealing offer.
The accompanying graph shows that all small shareholders will benefit from
taking the scrip. The biggest gainers will be basic-rate taxpayers who have
not used their annual capital gains tax allowance, while the smallest will
be higher-rate taxpayers who pay CGT. The bottom of each column shows the
value of the cash dividend; the top shows the value of the scrip for those
who pay just tax and those who pay both tax and CGT.
Gross funds - institutions such as pension funds which pay no tax - dislike
scrip dividends because they are unable to reclaim an ACT credit on them.
Normally, however, scrip issues are set at the same level as the cash
dividend.
BAT believes it can afford to tempt institutions by enhancing the scrip
because its lucrative tobacco business is hungry for cash, and the group is
confident it can get a sufficiently high return on the cash saved. Scrip
issues normally are dilutive, by expanding the share base, but BAT estimates
this scheme will end up enhancing both net asset value and earnings per
share.
The group is confident it will achieve the necessary majority from its
institutional investors, partly because it promised it will not repeat the
exercise.
BZW worked for 18 months on this scheme and said it had nothing to do with
last week's Budget changes in ACT. Indeed, by promising to address the
problem of unrelieved ACT next year, the chancellor limited the period in
which this novel manoeuvre can be promoted.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Pensions that damage your wealth -
Why a top firm of actuaries is recommending a five-year ban on with-profits
policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTING in with-profits pension plans can damage your financial health,
according to a leading firm of actuaries and consultants. Following
extensive research, Bacon &amp; Woodrow has issued a report for private
investors recommending an embargo on such policies.
The ban, which B&amp;W expects to last at least five years, affects individuals
who want to make single premium investments in personal pensions and other
individual pension arrangements. The firm's advice might not, therefore, be
appropriate for people holding long-term, regular premium contracts which
could incur significant penalties if the premiums are stopped.
In the report - examined in detail in April's issue of the FT's sister
publication, Pensions Management - B&amp;W explains how it tracked the impact on
underlying with-profits funds of excessive bonus payments from the mid-1980s
to 1992. The report says a five-year period of drastic bonus cuts will
follow so that funds can re-balance. Only when providers have put their
houses in order will it be safe to consider the with-profits route again.
B&amp;W warns, however, that even when this rationalisation is complete, the
bulk of with-profits funds will fail to offer a real alternative to
equity-based, managed, unit-linked funds. To support this argument, it cites
the fundamental switch in the risk profile of with-profits contracts over
the past 10-15 years.
In fact, the two problems - the mis-match of bonus payments to investment
returns, and the switch in risk profile - are linked directly. The original
concept of the with-profits fund - which is invested mainly in equities,
property and fixed interest - is to smooth investment returns by holding
back some of the return during years of plenty in order to maintain a
reasonable bonus rate in lean times.
Premiums invested secure a modest but guaranteed maturity payment (the 'sum
assured'), while profits are distributed through the bonus system. Annual
(or 'reversionary') bonuses, once allocated, are guaranteed. For many years,
the combination of sum assured and accrued annual bonuses formed the greater
part of the final pay-out.
An extra bonus was added at maturity. This final (or 'terminal') bonus was
completely discretionary. The amount reflected the long-term capital
appreciation of the fund not passed on previously through annual bonuses.
Terminal bonuses are thus closer to the unit-linked concept, with a direct
link between the performance of the underlying fund and the investor's
return. On most policies nowadays, the final bonus can account for more than
50 per cent of the total payout, so narrowing the risk gap between
with-profits and unit-linked contracts.
The trend towards higher-risk, with-profits policies gathered pace during
the period of exceptional investment returns in the 1980s, when market
conditions and competitive pressures forced up bonus rates. But insurance
company actuaries chose to achieve this via the non-guaranteed, terminal
bonus while reducing the guaranteed annual declarations. Final payouts often
remained unaffected or even improved.
But while this structural change in the with-profits bonus system went
virtually unnoticed during the bull markets, the chickens came home to roost
when returns dropped sharply. And this is when the great cover-up began. Up
to 1992, providers continued to declare unrealistically high bonus rates
while actual returns fell sharply and, in one year at least, were probably
negative.
The B&amp;W report was produced by the firm's partnership pensions section. Its
head, Andrew Warwick-Thompson, said this week: 'The smoothing process has
been used to mask the reality over this period, but no smoothing process can
continue to do this indefinitely if average returns are much lower than are
necessary to maintain bonus rates.'
In fact, cuts in the bonus rates are just one aspect of rationalisation.
Individuals who leave early - either to transfer to another pension
arrangement or take early retirement - receive an extra blow in the form of
the 'market level adjuster.' This gives pension providers a free hand to
reduce the value of funds when the contract is terminated early. Moreover,
many providers have closed their traditional with-profits funds to new
clients and offer a unitised version instead. But unitised with-profits
funds do not offer a basic sum assured with a guaranteed minimum return to
maturity. Instead, they offer a guaranteed return which can be varied from
year to year, so watering down the long-term security of the contract.
Following its analysis of these developments, B&amp;W recommends to private
clients investing in individual pension arrangements that: No further
single-premium contributions should be invested in with-profits funds for
the moment. Contributions should be made to competitive, unit-linked managed
funds (or in cash and fixed interest for those near retirement).
Regular payments to with-profits funds should be maintained pending a review
of the terms offered by the provider if contributions are stopped.
People within five years of retirement should discuss with their financial
adviser the possibility of crystallising existing bonuses by a transfer, or
by taking the benefits early. (This will make sense only where the provider
offers a good transfer value and does not impose early termination
penalties.)
Existing with-profits holdings should be reviewed in the light of likely
cutbacks in bonus rates and the lower guarantees now offered by most
contracts. Expert advice should be sought.
But if with-profits personal pensions are excluded, where should you be
investing your money? B&amp;W analysed managed unit-linked contracts and
assessed pension providers on consistency of performance of their managed
funds, good administration, and sound financial strength.
Equally important, B&amp;W recommends only those providers that operate a low
charging structure, incorporating nil-commission terms, and where the
contract is free of hidden early termination penalties. As Warwick-Thompson
explained: 'We felt it was vital that our clients should be able to take a
transfer at any time or retire early without penalty.'
From the firm's preliminary 'long list' of 14 providers, only four were
awarded top marks on all criteria: Rothschild Asset Management, Standard
Life, National Mutual and Scottish Widows.
Warwick-Thompson stressed that people who have started a long-term, regular
premium, with-profits contract should not act hastily. He added: 'In the
long term, with-profits funds may still play an important role in the
individual pensions market. However, even after the period of severe bonus
cuts is over, it is important to understand the fundamental change in the
risk profile of these contracts brought about by the greater dependence on
terminal bonuses.
'If you need a high degree of security, you should consider a mixture of
with-profits, cash and fixed-interest pension funds, particularly in the
run-up to retirement. Younger investors looking for good long-term growth
are likely to do better with a competitive, equity-based, managed
unit-linked or unit trust fund.'

FT  27 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Your last chance of the tax year to
make savings - John Authers explains how you can take advantage of the next
few days to choose the right investments and tax options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TAX clock is ticking. Next week is your last chance to take advantage of
several tax allowances for 1992-93.
Tax-planning is a bedrock of long-term financial planning, but it is less
important than choosing investments with the right risk profile, and the
right flexibility, to suit you. There is no point in losing money, or tying
it up when you need it, just for tax-efficiency.
This may not chime with what you hear from sales representatives. A large
proportion of the financial services industry describes the end of the tax
year as its 'harvest season', and the need for urgency provides them with a
great selling opportunity. As John Cole, of Berry, Birch &amp; Noble, says:
'There's nothing this industry likes more than a deadline.'
So two questions need to be asked: would the investment make some kind of
sense without the tax advantages, and do the tax savings outweigh any extra
charges?
These tax-saving opportunities are still open to you:
Personal Pensions
These offer the most tax-efficient form of retirement saving, as all
contributions paid into a personal pension are grossed up at your top
marginal rate. The fund then builds up free of income and capital gains tax.
The snag is that the money has to stay in the pension fund until you retire.
Then you can take 25 per cent of it as tax-free cash, but the rest must go
towards buying an annuity, which will be taxed as income.
The amount you can contribute in one tax year is expressed as a proportion
of your earnings, and varies according to your age at the beginning of the
tax year.
The scales are as follows:
up to 35: 17.5 per cent
36 to 45: 20 per cent
46 to 50: 25 per cent
51 to 55: 30 per cent
56 to 60: 35 per cent
61 to 74: 40 per cent.
If you did not use your personal pension allowance in the last tax year
(1991-92), then you can top it up this year. To qualify for this carryback
relief you must pay the contribution by April 5, and then make the election
to the Inland Revenue by May 5, according to Cole.
Topping up a personal pension is sensible if you genuinely do not need
excess income. As ever, try to choose a company with low charges.
Additional Voluntary Contributions
If you contribute to a company pension scheme, you are not allowed to have a
personal pension on top. However, if your company scheme contributions are
less than 15 per cent of your salary, you can make up the difference in
Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs). Your total contributions must not
be more than 15 per cent.
AVCs are virtually identical to personal pensions, but differ in one
important respect - all of the fund from an AVC when it matures must be used
to buy an annuity, and there is no tax-free cash. The annuity is not
tax-efficient, and you may prefer to retain the flexibility.
Personal Equity Plans
Peps, which allow investments in shares, investment trusts and unit trusts,
are increasingly considered as an alternative to AVCs. You pay net income
into them, so there is no tax relief on entry, but then the funds, like
pension funds, can grow free of income and capital gains tax. Those wanting
income can draw gross dividends. Then the big advantage over pensions and
AVCs is that the plans can be exited at any time, tax-free.
If that sounds rosy, however, remember that Peps are only as strong as the
equity investments they hold, and it may not be wise for those with small
portfolios to enter the stock market at present. Peter Smith, of Hill
Martin, says: 'I find it amusing that the stock market, as usual, is high
just as the Pep deadline is approaching.'
He does not bother with Peps for basic-rate taxpayers, as the extra charges
needed to administer the plans can out-balance the tax advantages. For those
who do not pay CGT (see below) gross dividends are the only advantage, and
this has been reduced by the budget's changes to Advance Corporation Tax.
Top-rate taxpayers wanting to invest in equities are still best advised to
do so through a Pep, but basic rate payers should be very careful.
Investments in Peps should normally be made on March 29, as most Peps offer
a cooling-off period. By using an execution-only broker, however, some
providers, such as Mercury, will allow you to invest until Monday, April 5.
Married Couples Allowance
Thanks to a provision of the 1992 budget, married couples have until April 5
to elect to have the married couples' tax allowance of Pounds 1720
transferred from the husband, to whom it is paid automatically, to the wife.
They must do this using Inland Revenue Form 18. There is little point in
doing this if both pay the same rate of tax, or if the husband pays top-rate
tax. However, if the wife pays top-rate tax, the relief will be more
valuable with her - a saving of Pounds 258 according to accountants Westbury
Schotness. For non-taxpayers, it can increase their tax-free income.
Mortgage Interest Relief
Lower mortgage rates could carry with them a nasty tax sting in the tail,
according to accountants Touche Ross. Those who want to avoid it will need
to act now to have their tax codes changed.
Falling interest rates mean a reduction in the amount of relief due on them.
Most people get their relief via MIRAS, which adjusts automatically to
changing interest rates, but those with unusual types of mortgages, such as
those which allow the borrower to vary repayments, receive the relief
through their PAYE code. This will reflect the interest paid in 1991-92, and
so too much relief will have been given. The Inland Revenue could then send
a bill for payment, in a lump sum. According to Maurice Parry-Wingfield of
Touche Ross, some 'will be caught unawares by the unexpected bill, which may
come to Pounds 375, or thereabouts'.
Inheritance Tax Planning
Some gifts made while you are alive can be exempt from inheritance tax
irrespective of when the donor finally dies.
First, there is an allowance of Pounds 3,000 per year which can be given
away tax-free. All of this can go to one person, or it can be shared among
several. The relief can be carried forward one year, so if you did not use
this allowance in 1991-92 you can give a maximum of Pounds 6,000.
In addition to this, you can make limitless small gifts of up to Pounds 250,
without affecting the main Pounds 3,000 exemption.
Gift Aid
Philanthropists who have to pay top-rate tax for this tax year might make a
donation via Gift Aid. Provided you give at least Pounds 250 to a charity
this will be treated as net of basic rate tax. That allows the charity to
reclaim 25 per cent from the Revenue, so they will receive Pounds 333.
Top-rate taxpayers can reclaim the difference between the top and basic
rate, which will be 15 per cent of the amount received by the charity
(Pounds 50). So the charity would have received Pounds 333 for a total
outlay of Pounds 200.
Capital Gains Tax
This most labyrinthine of taxes allows you to realise a maximum capital gain
in any tax year of Pounds 5,800, without paying any tax. On gains greater
than this, you must pay tax at your highest marginal rate of income tax. A
top-rate income taxpayer will pay 40 per cent CGT.
This gain is calculated once indexation, to reflect the rise in the retail
prices index, has been taken into account. If you have realised a gain which
has done no more than keep pace with inflation, then for CGT purposes you
have made no gain at all. It is possible to make a loss in CGT terms, even
though you have made a profit, if your investment failed to keep up with
inflation.
The accompanying table, updated monthly by the Inland Revenue, helps you
calculate your indexation allowance. Multiplying the original investment by
the indexation figure for the month in question shows the amount you can
gain free of tax liability. For example, if you invested Pounds 10,000 in
March 1982, CGT liability is calculated on the indexed cost of Pounds
17,470. Only if you sell it for more than Pounds 23,270 (the indexation
allowance plus the Pounds 5,800 annual allowance) will any CGT be payable.
'Bed and breakfasting' - selling the shares one afternoon and buying them
back the following morning - can limit the bill further by establishing
gains or losses for the tax year.
You can also realise gains this year to reduce the potential liability in
future years, but this requires quite ambitious projections about the
future.
Business Expansion Schemes
The BES is as tax-efficient as they come - the problem is whether the
underlying investment stacks up. Investors in BES companies, most of which
own housing and rent it under assured tenancy legislation, receive income
tax relief at their top marginal rate. This means that those investing
Pounds 1,000 will receive tax relief of Pounds 400. Maximum total BES
investment for one tax year is Pounds 40,000, and shares must have been
issued by the end of the year to qualify.
The drawbacks are that you must hold on to the shares for five years to
avoid forfeiting the relief, and that the underlying investment, residential
property, might not make sense without the tax relief.
Anyone in any doubt as to the danger of deadlines need only look at the BES
 -tax relief on loans was disallowed in the Budget, catching several BES
sponsors unawares, while schemes put together in a hurry last year ahead of
the general election may also forfeit their tax relief.
But the advantages for top-rate tax-payers are strong. Schemes with
cash-backing from third-party banks can covenant to convert an effective
investment of 60p into 115p after only five years, so top-rate taxpayers who
are prudent could benefit greatly.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Guaranteeing rises in the Footsie -
At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Save &amp; Prosper has launched a third issue of its Guaranteed Equity Bond,
which offers the bulk of the rise of the FT-SE 100 Index over five years, or
return of the original capital. Investors can choose between 98 per cent of
the rise of the index, or 90 per cent of the rise, with lock-in facilities
when the market rises 20 and 40 per cent. As with most products, the
investor does not benefit from the yield on the market.
Northern Rock's guaranteed product is open until April 8. This offers the
rise in the FT-SE over five years, or 15 per cent gross (11.25 per cent
net). If the market rises 50 per cent, that increase is locked in. However,
after tax, the basic rate taxpayer will only receive 75 per cent of the
index's rise, and will not benefit from the dividend yield.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Markets: Investors find silver cloud's dark lining - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOW INTEREST rates and a recovering economy are what every stock market
likes best. Wall Street has both at present, in fairly ample measure.
But even the sunniest situation will have its share of shadows, and this
week the political upheavals in Russia cast a prolonged cloud across US
stock markets. For the first three days of the week, share prices generally
moved lower, causing the Dow Jones Industrial Average to fall to around the
3,445-mark on Wednesday night. That was some 26 points below the previous
Friday's close.
There was a certain amount of logic behind the concerns. If President Boris
Yeltsin was replaced by hardliners, ran the reasoning, cutbacks in US
military expenditure would probably be postponed and the Clinton
Administration's economic package would be jeopardy. But the reasoning ran a
little thin in places, and the overall impression was of a market reacting
more to the threat of uncertainty, than to specific, delineated dangers.
It is also worth noting that the market was standing at near-record levels
going into the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached its all-time
closing high on March 10, when it peaked at 3,478.34, and when the week's
trading began on Monday morning, it was still standing at 3,471.58. In a
market that has enjoyed a good rally, the scope for little nervousness is
that much greater.
Still, by the end of the week, Boris Yeltsin was still walking his
tightrope, and Wall Street responded at first enthusiastically and then with
a little more care. As moves to impeach Yeltsin looked increasingly unlikely
on Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 15.94 points, recouping
much the losses seen earlier in the week, while the more broadly-based
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index showed a 2.82-point advance to 450.88.
But at the opening on Friday, the advance was a modest five points and
traders were warning that a sagging bond market, fearful that interest rates
may edge higher, plus continued volatility in the international arena, could
curtail the market's upward momentum.
The main corporate story of the week - the move of Louis Gerstner from the
chairmanship of RJR Nabisco, the food and tobacco group, to International
Business Machines, the computer behemoth - had muted stock market
implications. RJR Nabisco, which is in the throes of a complex 'targeted
stock scheme' and a Dollars 1.5bn capital raising exercise, acted quickly to
realign its management structure, filling Gerstner's shoes without
introducing new blood. Its shares, clouded by all the difficulties currently
surrounding tobacco stocks, remained at the Dollars 8 level.
IBM shares showed a little more reaction. They fell early in the week, but
this was attributed as much to pricing pressures on the group's mainframe
business and the spill-over effect from the profits warning by Amdahl,
another US computer systems company. On news that the intensely-watch
management issue had been finally resolved, IBM shares gained Dollars 5/8 at
Dollars 51 5/8.
The situation in the pharmaceuticals sector was a lot less happy. Shares of
many mainline drug makers - already under pressure for months - tumbled
again, when Merck announced its first-ever job reduction programme.
Cutbacks in the automotive, defence and aerospace industry have been on a
much larger scale than Merck's decision to cut 1,000 jobs. The New
Jersey-based drug company blamed the situation on the increasingly
competitive environment in the US, and the worldwide effort to contain
healthcare costs. It also said that the impact of this deteriorating
environment would tell on its first quarter results, and analysts scaled
back their expectations.
Merck's shares fell sharply, down Dollars 2 1/4 to a 52-week low of Dollars
34 3/4 on Wednesday, but the damage was more widespread than this. Pfizer
lost Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 57 5/8, Schering-Plough tumbled Dollars 3 1/8
to Dollars Dollars 56 1/2, Glaxo slumped Dollars  3/8 to a year-low of
Dollars 17 5/8, Bristol-Myers Squibb eased Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 57 7/8,
and so on.
The drug manufacturers have had more than their fair share of worries but
another ailing industry - the US airline sector - saw a rare gleam of light
in mid-week. Airline stocks rallied across the board, and helped account for
a gain of over 20 points in the Dow Jones transportation average on Tuesday.
The reasons were various: the national commission set up to examine the
industry's problems was formally approved by the House of Representatives,
domestic traffic looks more healthy, and the savage price-wars which
devastated the industry's fortunes last year have abated.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Markets: Equities: approach with caution . . . - Serious
Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHATEVER else you might say about the UK equity market, it cannot be
described as looking particularly cheap. The price-earnings ratio is over 20
and the dividend yield is 4.19 per cent. If you allow for the Budget tax
change, the yield is under 4 per cent.
So, should the small investor be buying UK shares now? M&amp;G figures, which I
quoted two weeks ago, show that when the market yields below 4 per cent, it
is normally a bad time to buy shares. But M&amp;G's Richard Hughes argues that
there is a large comfort factor in the rate of inflation - now 1.8 per cent.
It is rare for the stock market to yield more than inflation and, when it
does, it is usually a sign that shares are good value.
Nevertheless, in my view, it is not the ideal time to be placing a large
lump sum in the UK market. Nor do the US and Japanese markets look massively
attractive on present ratings. Europe should benefit from falling interest
rates but could well be headed for deep recession. That is a more convincing
case for European bonds, than it is for equities.
There are, however, some very good arguments for the so-called emerging
markets. Higher rates of economic growth and more liberal regulatory regimes
offer the prospect that areas such as south-east Asia or Latin America might
provide exceptional long-term returns.
Although Fund Research has produced one of its excellent studies of
single-country emerging market funds this week, the best vehicle for the
private investor is a broadly-spread fund. Diversification protects
investors from the enormous volatility of individual emerging markets.
This week, Templeton Emerging Markets launched a savings scheme with a
minimum of Pounds 30 a month or Pounds 250 for a lump sum. Although the
trust has more than doubled investors' money over the past three years, new
investors should not expect such a heady rate of growth; despite its spread,
it is very much a long term investment.
While on the subject of equities, I want to return to the vexed issue of Pep
charges. The Budget change reduced the dividend income on a Pep by
restricting the tax credit from 25 to 20 per cent. Many people have said
complacently that the change is only marginal and does not matter.
Of course, the change is marginal. But the benefits of a Pep to a basic-rate
taxpayer are marginal; on many plans, the tax change can tip the balance.
Take TR City of London, a trust with an excellent record which many private
investors might wish to select. It makes an additional annual charge of 1
per cent plus VAT (1.175 per cent in total) on Peps.
Let us assume that a basic-rate taxpayer wants to invest Pounds 3,000 in TR
City. Until April 5, with the trust yielding 4.8 per cent, he can look
forward to a tax saving of Pounds 36 a year. This is marginally more than
the annual charge which, on Pounds 3,000, works out at Pounds 35.25.
After April 5, though, the advance corporation tax (ACT) change will reduce
this yield to 4.5 per cent. The investor's tax saving will fall to Pounds
27, Pounds 8.25 less than it costs to hold the Pep. He will be losing money;
and even if the dividends grow, so will the annual charge.
Now, the Pep investor also benefits from the capital gains tax exemption.
But very few people actually pay CGT in the UK - fewer than 100,000 this
year. If the investor's holding grew at 10 per cent, and inflation was 5 per
cent, it would take 15 years before the indexed gain exceeded the present
Pounds 5,800 CGT threshold. Even then, the problem could be easily avoided
by selling the holding in two tax years.
So, it might well be that, if you are a small investor and a basic
rate-payer, you are better off in the TR City savings scheme than in the
Pep. TR City is trying to remedy that problem by lowering to 0.5 per cent
the charge on those Peps worth more than Pounds 6,000 (the reduction applies
only to that element of the plan above that level). But since it would take
eight years for a Pounds 3,000 investment to grow to Pounds 6,000 (assuming
a 10 per cent growth rate), this is of limited benefit to our hypothetical
small investor.
Thus, I repeat my advice to basic rate-payers: analyse the charges of a Pep
very carefully. There might even be a case for saying that, for small sums,
an investment trust savings scheme, with low charges, is better than a
conventional unit trust Pep.
I analysed two hypothetical trusts with identical portfolio yields of 4.4
per cent. After management charges of 0.4 per cent and 1 per cent
respectively, and allowing for the ACT change, the yield to the basic
rate-payer is 3 per cent on the investment trust and 3.1875 per cent on the
unit trust Pep.
But that marginal advantage in yield must be set against initial costs;
probably 6 per cent for the unit trust against 1.5 per cent on the
investment trust savings scheme. Growing a sum of Pounds 1,200 (to reflect
someone saving Pounds 100 a month) by 5 per cent a year, the investment
trust savings scheme is still ahead after 10 years.
Higher rate-payers should still find Peps attractive after the change but it
is difficult to see how it can be claimed that the advantages of Peps have
been enhanced for higher-rate taxpayers. Top rate-payers saved 40 per cent
in tax in a Pep before the Budget; they save 40 per cent after it. Their
income inside and outside a Pep has dropped 6.25 per cent. That is not an
enhancement.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Markets: Learn to live with recovery - London Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK market is coming to terms with Life After Recession. The immediate
consequences of an end to the economic downturn - the likely survival of
previously threatened companies, the coming upturn in the earnings of
cyclical industries, a healthier performance by smaller businesses - have
already been reflected in share prices, leading to markedly different
performances by different types of company, as the chart shows.
That was the easy part, reinforced this week by the CBI's report that
manufacturing industry's order books have recovered to their best levels
since mid-1990.
Puzzling out what happens next requires more thought, and also offers more
scope for differences of opinion. The bumpy ride of stock prices over the
past couple of weeks, with quite large intra-day movements of prices on
relatively low volumes, indicates the degree of uncertainty. This week, for
example, the FT-SE 100 index closed down 47.2 points at 2852.9.
Of the factors at work, two are worth examining in more detail, since
together they exercise considerable influence over the outlook.
The first of these factors is the poor state of government finances. The
market has seen this coming ever since the pre-election autumn statement in
1991, when the government's expenditure was clearly set on a higher course
than its likely revenues warranted.
Still, knowing about the chickens is one thing; watching them arriving home
to roost is quite another. The Budget offered the first clucks from the
hen-house, in the form of rises in the tax burden on oil companies and
corporate pension funds.
As a sector, oil company shares dropped sharply, relative to the market as a
whole, in the days immediately after the Budget. They have since recovered
their lost ground and closed on Friday a fraction higher than the level
before the Budget.
This performance owes something to the fact that BP, the sector's
second-biggest stock, is likely to be a big gainer from the new Petroleum
Revenue Tax regime. It probably owes rather more to the belief that the PRT
measures may be susceptible to last-minute lobbying, to lessen their impact
on the worst-affected companies.
But one man's lessened burden is another's broken back: if oil companies are
not to pay a higher tax rate, someone else will have to, assuming unchanged
government spending. Oil shares have recovered but others have slid away as
the market has come to terms with the thought that closing the deficit will
eat away at consumers' disposable income in the years ahead.
The most obvious potential casualties of any tightening of consumers' grip
on their wallets are retailing shares. These have in any case done poorly in
the first quarter of the year, against the trend that has seen cyclical
stocks do much better than the average. Since the Budget, stores have
dropped just over 2 per cent; other consumer sectors have also done poorly.
The spectre of a steadily rising tax burden for consumers is likely to haunt
these shares for some time to come.
The second factor that investors have had to weigh up, the likely growth
rate for corporate dividends, has been given fresh topicality by the Budget
tax changes. All this week, companies have been rushing to save money for
those shareholders who stand to lose from the change to dividend tax
credits, pension funds and individuals who pay income tax at the 40 per cent
rate.
PowerGen and Boots brought forward the announcement of their end of year
dividends by two months to beat the April 5 introduction of the changes.
Reed, Reuters Holdings, Capital Radio and Laird announced 'second interim
dividends' - in effect, final dividends declared early. Others will follow
over the next ten days.
This excitement is a once-off event; a more lingering question will be the
extent to which companies choose to increase their dividends to offset the
impact on those shareholders affected by the tax change. So far, Unilever
and SmithKline Beecham have been the only blue-chips to promise such an
increase.
In both cases, dividend policy is governed by the need for equal treatment
of shareholders on both sides of these dual-nationality operations; they
cannot therefore be counted as setting a precedent.
The announcement this week by BAT and RTZ of tax-efficient scrip dividends,
examined in more detail elsewhere on this page, is another example of the
thought that is going into the issue of payments to shareholders. The market
will be looking closely for signs of how companies intend to cope with the
competing pressures on their dividend policies: whether to resume the growth
in payouts once earnings recover, in part to compensate shareholders for the
tax changes, or to strengthen balance sheets.
This is where the two factors start to come together, because the balance
between gilts and equities, on some calculations, is already a fine one: UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew estimates that the dividend tax changes have removed almost
all the likely extra return that equities offered over conventional gilts.
Equities have not been helped, in this calculus, by the upward drift in gilt
yields: the yield on the ten-year benchmark issue rose from 7.61 per cent to
7.76 per cent over the week. The market has been dropping back since the
Bank of England's announcement on Tuesday of the details of next week's gilt
auction, to take place on March 31. Dealers, expecting a Pounds 2 1/2 bn
auction, were taken by surprise at the promise of Pounds 3bn of a new
20-year benchmark issue, 8 per cent Treasury stock due 2013.
This is a vivid illustration of the way that the government, like the
corporate sector, must cope with the effects of binge-borrowing. Companies
(and consumers) ran up their debt in the late 1980s; the public sector is
doing so now. With companies' scope to raise dividends more restricted than
investors would like, the government's present surge of borrowing will keep
investors guessing about the relative attractions of the securities each
side has to offer.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Markets: Wellcome shares catch a cold - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THURSDAY was a bad day for John Robb, Wellcome's chief executive.
Admittedly, it started well enough as he revealed pre-tax profits for the
first six months up 33 per cent - a figure at the top of expectations.
Yet the impressive earnings rise was followed by a collapse in his company's
shares which fell 72p to 818p. Yesterday, they tumbled a further 25p.
Robb confessed he was mystified by the fall. 'I think the figures are pretty
damned good given the environment has changed considerably over the last 12
months,' he complained
The problem with the results was their composition. Wellcome was touted
during its share sale last year as one of the world's fastest growing drugs
companies. Analysts were predicting annual growth of 20 per cent.
Yet the underlying sales growth in the figures revealed this week was 11 per
cent. The rest of the group's 22 per cent sales increase was generated by
currency benefits. Analysts were also concerned that the group's margin
improvement programme - pushing margins up 3.8 percentage points to 30.5 per
cent - had run its course.
Robb blamed the slowing growth rate on both the changing healthcare
environment and problems in the over-the-counter non-prescription drugs
market.
Clearly, Wellcome has not proved immune to the slowdown in the world
pharmaceuticals market caused by more aggressive government price controls.
The annual growth of the global market could slow from 16 per cent during
the 1980s to as low as 7 per cent during the 1990s, according to Duncan
Moore, drugs analyst at Morgan Stanley in London.
Wellcome's underlying growth for prescription medicines fell from 18 per
cent for the first half last year to 13 per cent for the same period this
year.
The group's OTC business - 13 per cent of sales - suffered from a poor cough
and cold season and increased competition in the US. Underlying OTC sales
fell 7 per cent in the first six months.
However, some analysts believe the market's reaction overdone. Wellcome's
underlying prescription volume growth may be slowing, but it is not
decelerating as much as most other drugs groups, particularly in the US.
In the past, the difference in the performance of US drugs stocks was
minimal. Those without products to drive volume growth compensated by
raising prices.
However price rises in the US are now a thing of the past and prices in
Europe are tumbling. The industry is splitting into those with volume growth
and those without.
Wellcome's volume growth remains strong - far above the industry average.
Moreover it is unlikely to face discounting pressure in the US.
Wellcome enjoys the advantage of not being in highly competitive areas such
as antibiotics, cholesterol-lowering treatments and ace-inhibitors (heart
drugs).
The group generates almost all its prescription business from anti-viral
treatments, a therapeutic area which it dominates with 80 per cent of the
world market.
Robb has set out a strategy for his troubled OTC operations. He believes the
business is too small to gain effective access to the supermarket sector or
negotiate reasonable advertising rates. Sales are also too dependent on
coughs and colds.
The group has no intention of spending large sums to buy OTC businesses.
'Acquiring OTC products is unaffordable, unless you're Swiss,' says Robb, a
jibe against Roche and Ciba-Geigy which recently bought most of Fisons' OTC
businesses.
Instead, Robb is negotiating a joint-venture, in which Wellcome may be a
junior partner. The deal, which he hopes to conclude before the end of the
year, should give the group access to the US, European and Japanese OTC
markets.
Robb and his company's share price, both already bruised, are likely to
suffer a further battering in coming weeks. There is little in Wellcome's
performance or prospects to justify such treatment, but sentiment is
unlikely to improve before May when the Clinton administration reveals its
healthcare reforms.

FT  27 MAR 93 / The time bomb under planet Earth: Global change threatens to
plunge the human race into crisis. But what to do? Paul Kennedy examines the
options . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL KENNEDY

<TEXT>
NO OBSERVER of contemporary trends can doubt that, as we pass from this
century to the next, we are all going to be affected by broad forces for
global change. The internationalisation of manufacturing, services and
investment flow, with their impacts upon companies, towns and entire
regions, is intensifying. New technologies, bright with promise for their
inventors and investors, threaten to undermine traditional ways of making,
growing and trading things. National currencies are dwarfed by the sheer
volume of daily foreign-exchange dealings.
As Earth adds to its total population by nearly 95m people each year, the
pressure upon environments and resources grows greater, the pace of illegal
migration quickens, and entire societies in the developing world collapse
under the strain. While each of us has to grapple with our own needs, we are
also beginning to look anxiously towards the future.
Given the complexity of these forces for global change, it is not surprising
that interpretations abound of what they may imply. To the
'techno-triumphalists' in the United States - such as economist George
Gilder and Ben Wattenberg, of the American Enterprise Institute - capitalist
enterprise and scientific breakthrough are transforming our lives in
profound though beneficial ways that only left-wing doomsters will deny. To
Kenichi Ohmae, chairman of the Japanese arm of management consultant
McKinsey, a 'borderless world,' in which the rules of the global market
prevail over traditional state-centred concerns and governments become
increasingly invisible, is at last in sight.
By contrast, Lester Thurow, dean of the Alfred P. Sloan school of management
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, detects the emergence of three
giant trading blocs - north American, Europe and east Asia - engaged in a
bitter, head-to-head struggle for global economic advantage. The most recent
world economic forum in Davos, Switzerland - that annual barometer of the
prevailing economic mood - was full of talk about protectionism, containing
the surging Japanese trade surpluses, paralysis in the Gatt process, the
sagging German economy, saving Russia, and quarrels over aerospace
subsidies. Not everyone, it seems, finds capitalism's 'creative gales' as
stimulating as Gilder.
But to focus on issues such as US-Japan trade relations or the plight of
French farmers, important as they are, betrays a very 'north-ocentric' bias
that could, in turn, obscure understanding of the truly global changes
affecting Earth and its 5.4bn inhabitants. With the benefit of hindsight,
our children and grandchildren will presumably recognise, far more clearly
than we, the relative insignificance of John Major's present difficulties or
of Italian political scandals.
Upon which trends, however, should our gaze be focused were we to attempt to
answer the question: 'What are the really big forces for change bearing down
upon our planet between now and 2025?'
The first change, surely, is that there are likely to be many more of us -
perhaps as many as 8.5bn or 9bn people - and that around 95 per cent of
those additional people will be born in the poorer regions of the globe. By
contrast, the populations of the world's richer societies are forecast to
grow slowly or even (as in Japan, Italy and France) to decline in absolute
terms - unless, of course, they admit many millions of immigrants eager to
flee their own lands, a point to which I will return.
Europe, north America and Japan may indeed slug it out head-to-head
commercially over the next few decades but, as they do so, their collective
demographic power will be falling steadily. When our present century began,
Europe was at the height of its international influence and, perhaps not
coincidentally, enjoyed its brightest-ever share of world population; during
the next century, that share will shrivel to a mere 7 per cent or less.
These demographic forecasts suggest that the 21st century could bring
neither a 'new world order' nor a 'borderless world' but, instead, a deeply
troubled and fractured planet. China's population, which already (at 1.1bn)
outstrips its land and water resources, is projected to rise to 1.5bn,
exceeded only by India, heading towards 2bn. Africa, buckling under its
existing 680m inhabitants, has perhaps only the growing pandemic of Aids to
curb its forecast rise to 1.6bn by 2025; and large rises are also expected
in the populations of Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Brazil, Mexico and
Iran. From all of these places, a gigantic internal migration will take
place as peasants seeking jobs stream into shanty-cities of 20-25m
inhabitants with totally inadequate infrastructure and utilities. Finally,
these will be demographically adolescent societies, with perhaps half of
their populations under the age of 20 (or even, as in Kenya's case, under
16) - an ideal prescription for social turbulence.
But why should a Piedmont farmer or a Tokyo housewife, beset already by
problems of their own, concern themselves with the plight of Bangladesh?
Hasn't our planet always contained a rich minority and a poor majority? Will
we not have enough of a challenge to prepare our own societies for the
technology-driven changes of the next century without being distracted by
the fate of badly-run developing countries? What, in any case, have the
poverty-stricken peoples of Africa in common with well-heeled bankers and
brokers engaged in creating a 'borderless world' in the north?
Apart from humanitarian grounds, there are three powerful reasons why we
should take seriously these disturbing demographic trends and seek to lessen
their impact. The first is the possibility that the collective economic
activities of 5bn-8bn people may indeed be creating a 'greenhouse effect' of
global warming as ever more trace gases pour into our atmosphere. It is no
longer an issue of local environmental damage, serious though it is to
witness the gross pollution of the Mediterranean and the disappearance of
the Aral sea; the destruction of plant species and wildlife habitats in
Brazil; and the steady denuding of India (where the forest cover has shrunk
from one-half to one-seventh in this century alone). The eco-system itself
could be at stake.
While the developed countries probably possess the capital and scientific
resources to become environmentally 'clean' by early next century, the
atmosphere effects of such virtue are likely to be eclipsed by the continued
increase in pollutants from China, India, Mexico, and other
fast-industrialising countries now unable to afford sophisticated emission
controls. If we are concerned about the varied consequences of global
warming, rises in sea levels, increased heat stress and greater weather
instabilities, we need to devise technologies to assist poorer nations to
reduce emissions in the first place.
Equally serious could be the prospect of further surges in large-scale
illegal migration from stress-ridden, over-populated societies to richer,
demographically-stagnant regions in the north. Already, millions and
millions are being held in camps or are en route from central America,
Africa, south Asia and the Middle East to the US, Germany, Australia and
other favoured destinations - this movement being stimulated (ironically) by
a communications revolution which displays, globally, television programmes
like Dallas and Brideshead Revisited.
Already, the Spanish and Italian navies are on daily patrol to check the
flow of illegal immigrants; but as Africa's population threatens to treble
while Europe's stagnates, ought we not to expect much more of this in the
future? And how far will the robotics revolution coming out of Japan - where
automated factories are assembling products more efficiently and cheaply
than plants employing low-cost labour in south-east Asia - steadily
undermine the task of creating 40-50m new jobs world-wide each year to
ensure employment for fast-growing youth?
If the latter cannot get jobs in the developing world, or if the rich
countries' slide towards protectionism undercuts poorer nations' chances of
paying their way in the world through exports, should we really be surprised
if masses of people head north to find employment? Are European nations,
already showing signs of xenophobia at the relatively small percentage of
immigrants in their midst, capable of becoming real multi-cultural
societies? If not, will the racial tensions worsen?
Finally, there is the consideration that not all of these troubled states
are like Ethiopia: weak, and unlikely to threaten us in the future. The same
explosive combination of fast-growing populations, frustrated youth,
depletion of land and water resources and so on occurs also in parts of the
world - Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, the Euphrates valley, south-west Asia -
where fundamentalist, anti-western movements or ambitious regimes exist;
where territorial disputes are long-standing; and towards which vast numbers
of sophisticated, mass-destruction weapons continue to be exported.
If we prefer to see the secular, pro-western regimes remain in power in
Cairo and Algiers, is it not in our own best interest to seek to improve
their countrymen's conditions? And must we wait until Rome or Frankfurt are
in range of north African-based missile systems before we really get serious
about arms' proliferation?
This brings us to the fundamental question: granted the above arguments,
what, if anything, can be done during the next years to ameliorate and slow
down (better still, reverse) these potentially dangerous trends?
Clearly, a great deal depends upon the peoples and leaders of developing
nations themselves. European and American assistance can hardly be expected
to produce improvements in countries where corrupt and obstructive regimes
prevail; ethnic and religious rivalries dominate politics; deeply-held
animist or fundamentalist religions impair any changes in the status and
education of women (and thus also impair the prospects of reducing average
family size); and faulty economic policies smother growth. On the other
hand, we ought to be ready to offer a package of policies to reform-minded,
developing countries which plead for our co-operation and aid.
These should include increasing the amount of development monies to at least
the internationally agreed-upon target of 0.7 per cent of GDP annually;
ensuring that such aid goes to environmentally-sound and sustainable
projects in co-operation with local communities, and not to the clumsy
'giganticist' schemes of the 1960s (steel mills, huge dams, etc); supporting
the tens of thousands of engineers and scientists now released from cold
war-related research to use their talents to produce low-level solutions to
these global problems - small 'solar ovens' to cook a village's daily meals,
and solar energy projects in general are a good example here; transferring
the fruits of breakthroughs in bio-tech agriculture (disease-resistant and
head-resistant crops) without requiring large patent and user fees from poor
nations; responding to the requests from tens of millions of married women
in developing countries for safe and inexpensive contraceptives to permit
them to stabilise family size; and, in general, aiding access to eduction
for as many girls and women in those societies as possible.
None of these programmes guarantees that we will head off global disasters.
Taken together, however, they offer the best prospect of repairing at least
part of our planet's troubled condition.
One further ingredient is necessary. Concerned intellectuals, editors,
businessmen and members of the public cannot by themselves ensure that such
reform policies will be implemented. This requires the whole-hearted
co-operation of political leaders, especially those in today's richer,
democratic societies. And therein, alas, lies the final problem.
We now have, in the Clinton-Gore administration, an American government
that, for the first time in a decade, is concerned deeply about global
demographic and environmental issues as well as domestic renewal - a
significant change from the era of Reagan/Bush neglect that was so manifest
at last June's Earth Summit in Rio. Ironically, this time around, we could
see Washington more willing to assist poorer countries while many of the
other OECD nations drag their feet.
With the ruling parties of Japan and Italy in a state of collapse and the
governments of Germany, France, Britain, Canada and many others experiencing
record levels of unpopularity, they are probably incapable at present of
implementing generous, far-sighted policies to aid our global ills. But if
little or nothing is done soon, won't we and our children all pay a far
larger price for that neglect in the future?

FT  27 MAR 93 / The Long View: Equities beat the gun
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE HAVE been some good days but, overall, the UK stock market has found
the going quite tough in the first quarter of 1993. You will have come off
worst in the leaders because by yesterday the FT-SE (Footsie) index of the
hundred biggest stocks had slipped back to just about where it was at the
end of December.
Yet, the economic background generally has been favourable. Short-term
interest rates have come down a point while retail sales are showing an
up-trend and the Confederation of British Industry is confident of a rise in
manufacturing output. Company profits are set to jump healthily in 1993
because the misery in the labour market is, to a large extent, the mirror
image of rejuvenation in the corporate sector.
As it happens, with the focus switching from growth to recovery, Footsie has
been restrained by the setbacks of over-priced stars of the recession such
as Glaxo and Sainsbury. The stock market picture is the more pleasing, the
further down the size spectrum you look. The market as a whole is up 3 per
cent, as measured by the All-Share index. Within that, the mid-range stocks
have climbed by 9 per cent and the minnows, according to the SmallCap index,
are up by about 14 per cent.
Increasingly, the big stocks are driven by global capital market trends. A
key international influence is the US Treasury long bond yield, which hit a
long-term low point on precisely the same day - March 8 - as the prices of
the Footsie 100 stocks hit their all-time high. Britain's own long gilt
yield has bounced up from 8.23 per cent on March 10 to nearer 8.5 per cent
now, which is a good measure of the recent shift in sentiment. It has the
effect of raising the yield ratio between gilts and equities, a measure
which professional investors watch closely. From a tolerable 2.0 ahead of
the Budget, the ratio has jumped to a less comfortable 2.2 if you allow for
the damaging effect of the advance corporation tax (ACT) changes on
dividends.
Fortunately, the prospects for dividend growth are looking a little brighter
but, like Wall Street, where the stock market has risen about 4 per cent in
the quarter, London has been salivating eagerly over the economic upturn for
a long time. The All-Share index has climbed almost 20 per cent over the
past year; yet, during that 12 months, the average increase in dividends has
been just about zero and reported earnings per share growth around 5 per
cent (almost all of it in financials).
It is interesting to recall that, late in 1991, many brokers were predicting
earnings growth of 15-20 per cent for 1992. This time, projections of 20 per
cent growth in 1993 look much better-founded. But a lot of it is in the
price. The market could continue to move sideways, or perhaps gently
downwards, if the volume of new issues becomes uncomfortable.
The Bank of England, after all, is planning monthly auctions of gilt-edged -
of between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 4bn - and, in the wake of the Budget's
Pounds 50bn borrowing forecast, it will kick off the 1993-94 season next
Wednesday with a Pounds 3bn offer of 20-year bonds. As for company share
issues, we have already seen about Pounds 2.5bn worth so far in 1993. ICI
has promised a Pounds 1.3bn blockbuster for June, while the first instalment
of the sale of the government's remaining stake in British Telecom could
absorb Pounds 2bn, perhaps in July.
Meanwhile, British institutions are pulling in less than Pounds 40bn a year
for investment. The sums may add up only if fund managers repatriate some of
the Pounds 100bn-plus they have placed in foreign equities and bonds, and if
overseas investors come back into gilts on a substantial scale. For these
cross-border flows to happen, UK securities must come to look relatively
cheap.
Even when the stock market is trading sideways, however, it need not be
dull. Look at how the performance of individual sectors has changed this
year, with food retailing collapsing from near the top of the league table
in 1992 to the relegation zone this quarter, but property doing the reverse.
Generally speaking, the manufacturing sectors have done well while the cosy
domestic monopolies and oligopolies in brewing, retailing and household
utilities have lagged behind. This is a healthy sign when the balance of
payments needs to be turned around, a feat achieved best by a prosperous
manufacturing sector.
While profits in general have fallen only slightly over the past two years,
they have collapsed by some 60 per cent in the capital goods sectors,
according to broker UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. In 1993, they could more than
double although, in many cases, that would only represent the elimination of
losses.
From a slimmed-down base, the potential for profits recovery can be potent.
This year, labour costs will not be a worry - per unit of manufacturing
output, they are down slightly. The only small concern is that, so far,
manufacturers have not been able to pass on their devaluation-boosted input
costs (up 6.9 per cent year-on-year in February). Overseas profits are
looking healthy in sterling terms, although the weakness of demand in
continental Europe is a threat; and sterling has been looking significantly
stronger in the recent past, having recovered 10 pfennigs against the DM in
four weeks, for example.
Given a couple of years of good profits growth, the average price-earnings
ratio on UK equities could be down from its present rather intimidating 20
or so to about 14 on the basis of 1994 earnings. For the leaders this is a
supportable, but scarcely bomb-proof, rating. Hence the scramble for better
value in the smaller companies sector, where the surge of investment funds
into narrow markets is creating its own immediate payoff and where (let us
hope, if fingers are not to be burned) those companies which survived
through the recession will now earn substantial rewards.

FT  27 MAR 93 / IBM appoints RJR Nabisco's chief to top post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines yesterday gave the challenge of reviving its
fortunes to Mr Louis Gerstner, the chairman of food and tobacco group RJR
Nabisco, by naming him as its new chief executive.
Mr Gerstner is one of America's most highly regarded managers but has no
direct experience of the computer industry.
The announcement ended a high-profile, two-month search by IBM's board for a
successor to Mr John Akers, the chairman and chief executive, who is
retiring early because of the group's financial problems. Mr Gerstner, 51,
will also become chairman.
Mr Gerstner, a former president of the American Express financial services
group, was brought in as chairman and chief executive of RJR four years ago
by its owners, the buy-out specialists Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts, who had
just acquired the business in a ferocious Dollars 25bn (Pounds 17.60bn)
takeover battle.
RJR acted quickly yesterday to dispel uncertainty about its own management,
appointing Mr Karl von der Heyden, finance director, and Mr Lawrence
Ricciardi, general counsel, as co-chairmen and chief executives. The two are
part of the small corporate office team put together by Mr Gerstner after
the buy-out, and will retain their existing financial and legal
responsibilities.
Earlier in the week, there had been speculation that Mr Gerstner would take
Mr von der Heyden with him to IBM. Analysts were concerned that this might
trigger an internal battle between the heads of RJR Nabisco's operating
units, for the chairman's job.
Analysts yesterday hailed Mr Gerstner as a tough, effective manager and good
strategic thinker who could do much to slash IBM's bloated cost structure
and rid the company of its slow-moving bureaucratic style.
However, some expressed concern about his lack of knowledge of computer
science at a time when IBM needs to make important choices about its future
technology.
Mr Gerstner, who was closely involved in the development of computer systems
at American Express, said: 'I don't pretend to understand all of the science
underlying information technology - and you know what? - I don't think I
have to.'
Mr James Burke, the IBM director who led search for a new chief executive,
agreed, saying that high-technology knowledge was only one of 11
characteristics pinpointed by the board as desirable. The others all related
to general management skills.
Several leading high-technology industry executives had been on IBM's
short-list and well-placed industry officials said yesterday that some had
been approached about the job before Mr Gerstner.
However, Mr Burke dismissed suggestions that Mr Gerstner had been low down
the candidates' list and added: 'We made one specific offer for this job,
and only one, and that was to Louis Gerstner.'
Mr Gerstner, who takes over as chief executive next Thursday, would not be
drawn on his plans for the company, saying his first priority was to 'listen
and learn' about the business.
He saw 'no quick fix' for IBM, but said the company had 'the greatest
reservoirs of management talent in the world'.
IBM shares, which have plunged from over Dollars 100 last year to a recent
low of under Dollars 50, rose Dollars  7/8 to a Dollars 51 3/8 close in New
York as the market weighed the positive news of the appointment against a
decision on Thursday by Moody's, the credit information agency, to cut IBM's
rating.

FT  27 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Daimler-Benz
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two conclusions can be drawn from Daimler-Benz's plan to seek a New York
listing. The first is that unification has created a long-term need for
capital which is driving German companies to court overseas investors. That
would imply a significant change towards an equity culture and a loosening
of the banks' stranglehold on Germany's economy. Better treatment of
shareholders would, over time, close the rating gap between German and US
equity markets. The other possibility is that the US has compromised on its
strict listing standards because of the NYSE's need to drum up extra
business.
Both elements have probably influenced Daimler's move but their relative
weighting will only become clear after full details of the listing deal are
unveiled next week. Daimler's 'disclosure' of DM4bn in reserves is less of a
concession than it looks. It relates to the treatment of pension fund
surpluses in subsidiaries but is unlikely to affect group figures. More
important is whether Daimler is prepared to give quarterly segmental and
geographical details of its business and, if so, what exemption from US
accounting standards it has won in return.
For the US to relax disclosure requirements simply to win new business for
the NYSE could be counter-productive for all concerned. Daimler arguably
needs capital after the acquisitions of recent years, and to finance its
expansion into leasing. But its ability to expand its shareholder base
depends on its level of disclosure not just on the listing. If Daimler
grasps this nettle, then it is to be applauded. But German companies may not
rush to follow suit. Giving up one's right to smooth profits is especially
hard at the onset of a recession.

FT  27 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Hepworth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hepworth is a classic recovery stock whose shares have seemingly sprinted
too far ahead of recovery. Its share price has risen 48 per cent since
October's low; the market seems uncertain where it should head next. Ratings
across the building materials sector look heavy on this year's numbers.
Longer term, though, they may prove meagre. Just as shareholders were caught
out by the steepness of the downturn, they may well be surprised by the
recovery. The market value of the entire building materials sector is
equivalent to that of British Gas. It requires an extremely dim view of the
UK economy to believe the sector's shares will not outperform on a
three-year basis.
There are special factors at play at Hepworth. Its big presence in
deteriorating continental European markets is the most significant. These
activities, which account for 48 per cent of trading profits, are a lasting
strength. They could, however, prove a short term embarrassment. Patient
shareholders should nevertheless be rewarded. Hepworth's shares currently
stand on a multiple of just nine times peak historic earnings. No one
pretends its markets will recover their former buoyancy for many years, if
ever, but Hepworth's severe cost-cutting should ensure far higher
profitability on incremental sales increases.

FT  27 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: UK accounting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Tweedie, head of the Accounting Standards Board, is canny enough
not to fight more than one revolution at a time. The market is still coming
to grips with the new shape of the profit and loss account under FRS3, so
this week's discussion document on the balance sheet is modest by
comparison. The proposal that companies should undertake regular
revaluations of properties, marketable securities and long-term stocks is
little more than an overdue rationalisation of the current hodge-podge of
current cost and historical cost valuations.
Even so, companies will no longer be able to hold properties on the balance
sheet at depressed historical values with an eye to realising a windfall
profit on disposal. Regular asset valuations may also mean higher
depreciation charges and, therefore, lower profits. That might sound like a
field-day for surveyors and other professional valuers. The eventual
standard must strike a balance between the need for accurate financial
statements and the cost of preparing them.
But the market should expect a more radical reshaping of the balance sheet
in coming years. Revaluing property and securities while leaving plant,
machinery, liabilities - and, controversially, acquired goodwill - at
historical cost is inconsistent. By turning its back on a US-style system of
pure historical cost, the ASB may have signalled its intent. Next week's
proposals on acquisition accounting will go one step further by asking
companies to revalue acquired liabilities. With the ASB due to tackle the
vexed topic of goodwill later this year, the market should be braced for
more upheaval.

FT  27 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Shares yield ground
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The FT-SE 100 index looks set to finish the first quarter of 1993 roughly
where it began. Given the mixed bag of company results, that seems a
reasonable outcome. Although the CBI struck an optimistic note this week,
any sharp improvement in earnings may be some time coming. The comfort is
that low interest rates are drawing cash into shares. Yesterday's figures
showed Pounds 590m flowing into unit trusts in February, the lion's share
ending up in UK equities.
With the yield on savings accounts so low, private investors are
understandably looking for income from alternative investments. Having seen
the tax credit on dividends shaved by the chancellor, pension funds are
equally more interested than usual in yield. The accountants have also done
their bit to sharpen the focus. Thanks to the new-style cash flow statement,
companies' ability to pay dividends is easier to pin down, even though
earnings figures are more volatile.
Yet investor concentration on yield may imply a cap on share prices. The
market has shied away from pushing the yield on the All-Share index below 4
per cent. Smaller stocks have continued to outpace big international shares.
But the cash flow of smaller companies might be expected to suffer most in
the early stages of recovery. That may limit their ability to raise
dividends. There is also the relative attraction of gilts to consider. With
Pounds 3bn long-dated bonds to be auctioned next Wednesday and yields
creeping up towards 8.5 per cent, competition for funds can only increase.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Balladur tries to ease tension with Mitterrand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR EDOUARD BALLADUR, the senior Gaullist politician who is front-runner to
become French prime minister next week, moved yesterday to ease tension
between the rightwing winners of the general election and Mr Francois
Mitterrand, the isolated Socialist president.
The future coalition government of Gaullist RPR and centre-right UDF, and
the president, must allow each other to carry out their responsibilities,
said Mr Balladur.
The right is expected to confirm its sweeping victory in tomorrow's second
round of voting, which could give the partners up to 480 seats in the
577-seat National Assembly, more than 80 per cent of the total.
Mr Balladur's remarks imply that, if Mr Mitterrand does choose him as prime
minister, he will encourage the government not to interfere with the
president's most cherished policies - European union and close links with
Germany.
It looked increasingly likely yesterday that Mr Mitterrand would find Mr
Balladur an acceptable choice as prime minister, after Mr Jacques Chirac,
RPR leader, toned down his earlier calls that the president should resign in
the light of the Socialists' low score in the elections.
Leading Socialists have warned that Mr Mitterrand is unlikely to choose a
prime minister from a party that seeks his downfall. Mr Mitterrand, who is
technically free to appoint whom he likes, has said he will only choose a
prime minister who supports closer European union.
Mr Chirac, prime minister in the previous cohabitation government from 1986
to 1988, does not want to repeat the uncomfortable experience of being prime
minister under Mr Mitterrand, but neither does he want to let the job go to
his more compliant coalition partner, the UDF.
'No one disputes the president's constitutional right to finish his term if
he wishes,' said Mr Chirac yesterday.
The staff of Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the outgoing prime minister, were already
packing their belongings to be ready to move out of the Matignon, his office
and residence, on Monday, when he is expected to announce the government's
resignation.
Mr Mitterrand will consult the winning party leaders before naming the new
prime minister, possibly by Monday night, say officials. New cabinet members
will be selected soon afterwards.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Ceasefire agreed in Bosnian war: Three sides to suspend
hostilities in 11-month-old conflict from tomorrow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LEADERS from Bosnia's three ethnic groups last night agreed to a ceasefire
in Bosnia's 11-month-old civil war, to take effect at noon tomorrow.
The agreement was being treated with caution because several ceasefire
accords have collapsed since the war erupted nearly a year ago. But it was
considered of more than usual significance because the negotiations had
taken place under the aegis of President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia.
Bosnian Serb commander General Ratko Mladic last night said he had agreed to
a general ceasefire and would today allow a relief convoy to enter
Srebrenica, the most vulnerable Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia.
The agreement was reached after a five-hour meeting in Belgrade with General
Lars Erik Wahlgren, the commander of UN forces in the former Yugoslavia, and
General Philippe Morillon, the commander of UN forces in Bosnia.
Gen Morillon said Bosnian Moslem vice-president Ejup Ganic and Croat leader
Mate Boban had also agreed to the ceasefire. 'They gave their agreement to
give the same directive to their own forces,' he said.
The decision to hold yesterday's talks was made at the urging of President
Milosevic in a meeting with Gen Morillon on Thursday.
Gen Wahlgren said that Gen Mladic had authorised the departure today of a
20-truck UN aid convoy to the besieged town of Srebrenica. The convoy,
currently blocked by Serb militiamen at the Serbian border town of Mali
Zvornik, will evacuate civilians from Srebrenica.
The announcement of the ceasefire was made as Mr Radovan Karadzic, the
Bosnian Serb leader, arrived in Belgrade from New York. He immediately
threatened to pull out of the peace talks on Bosnia, chaired by
international mediators Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen.
Mr Karadzic, who on Thursday refused to follow President Alijah Izetbegovic
of Bosnia in signing the map of the semi-autonomous provinces into which
Bosnia would be divided under the proposed settlement, was sceptical about
the ceasefire agreement concluded by his own army commander.
Mr Karadzic yesterday came under growing pressure from the international
community to sign the peace accord when President Bill Clinton said the US
would give Serbia a few days to sign before considering more stringent
actions to pressure Belgrade.
He said talks would be held with America's allies on the possible lifting of
an international arms embargo against the combatants in the former
Yugoslavia, a move that would aid embattled Moslems in Bosnia.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Blue Circle plans Pounds 500m Channel rail link station
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLUE CIRCLE Industries proposes to build a privately financed international
railway station for the planned Channel tunnel link near Dartford in
north-west Kent.
The station, which could cost up to Pounds 500m, would occupy about 250
acres of chalk quarries and waste ground, part of a 2,500-acre site owned by
Blue Circle, Britain's biggest cement producer.
The land is on the route of the Pounds 2.5bn rail link, to be financed
jointly by the private and public sectors, which was announced by the
government earlier this week.
Blue Circle's plans include hotels, a conference centre, offices and shops
as well as international and domestic passenger terminals.
The station could include an interchange with British Rail lines eastward to
the Medway towns and westward through south-east London to the centre of the
capital.
The proposals are to be submitted shortly to ministers and Union Railways,
the BR subsidiary responsible for developing the high-speed link, according
to Mr Mark Pennington, Kent development manager for Blue Circle Properties.
He will also seek meetings with banks and potential investment partners.
Blue Circle said the cost of the station would be met out of proceeds from
the commercial development. The company would provide the land as its
contribution to the investment. It believes the project could be completed
without any public finance.
Blue Circle said it would begin local consultation shortly. The proposals
were supported by Dartford District Council and by Mr Bob Dunn, MP for
Dartford and chairman of the Conservative backbench transport committee, it
said.
Mr Pennington said the construction of a station providing a direct link to
continental Europe could act as a catalyst for a much bigger development of
the entire 2,500 acres owned by Blue Circle. This includes the Eastern
Quarry which currently supplies the group's Northfleet cement works.
Plans could eventually involve the construction of a new town with up to
12,500 homes, offices, shops, a conference centre, business and industrial
parks, recreational and social amenities, creating some 34,000 jobs.
The site is just east of the Dartford bridge and tunnel which carry the M25
across the River Thames. The development would be in line with plans to
stimulate investment along the Thames.
Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, this week established a 'task
force' of civil servants to consider plans for redeveloping the corridor. He
has not so far offered any contribution from the public sector.

FT  27 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow dragged down by bond
market sell-off
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US equities drifted in a narrow range yesterday morning before
computer-driven programme selling and a bond market sell-off dragged stocks
lower, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 21.34 at 3,439.98. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 3.11 at 447.77, while the Amex
composite was up 0.35 at 419.47. But the Nasdaq composite bucked the
downward trend, adding 0.53 at 681.54. Trading volume on the NYSE exceeded
219m shares and declines outnumbered rises by 1,002 to 844.
Equities shrugged off the economic news of the morning, including a slight
downward revision of fourth-quarter GDP, which rose 4.7 per cent.
The increased revision of two inflation indicators put pressure on bond
prices, which were already shaky after the Wall Street Journal reported that
the Federal Reserve was concerned about inflation. Bond prices were also
weighed down by an abundance of supply after this week's two and five year
note auctions. In late trading, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was 1
1/16 lower at 102 5/16 , yielding 6.937 per cent.
Northern Telecom was one of the chief contributors to the market's decline
as its shares fell Dollars 5 to Dollars 37 7/8 after the company released
first-quarter earnings late on Thursday substantially lower than expected.
Merrill Lynch reduced its intermediate-term rating on the stock to 'neutral'
from 'above average', although its long-term investment rating remains
'above average'.
International Business Machines and RJR Nabisco Holdings were among the most
active stocks on the New York Stock Exchange after IBM ended speculation
about its new chief executive by naming RJR chairman Mr Louis Gertsner to
the post. Although the appointment was widely expected, it contributed to
heavy trading in the shares. IBM rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 51 1/4 and RJR
was unchanged at Dollars 8.
Bankers Life Holding was quoted at Dollars 24 1/2 . An initial offering of
17m shares was priced at Dollars 22 a share Thursday.
Ashland Oil slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 27 5/8 following the prediction
of a first-quarter loss of about Dollars 3m, or 5 cents a share, compared
with a deficit of Dollars 13m, or 23 cents, a year earlier.
Grim first-quarter predictions from Medic Computer Systems late on Thursday
sent shares in the company tumbling Dollars 5 1/8 to a 52-week low of
Dollars 6 3/4 in Nasdaq trading. Medic expects to earn about 7 or 8 cents a
share in the quarter.
In the technology sector, Dell Computer firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 36
5/8 , Apple Computer fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 53 1/4 , Microsoft lost
Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 86 5/8 and Lotus Development held steady at Dollars
27.
Canada
TORONTO ended the week mixed but lower, dragged down by a sharp drop in the
industrial products group.
The TSE-300 index fell 12.3 points to 3599.74 on volume of 60.09m shares.
There was a gain on the week of about 23 points.
The fall in industrial products was mostly due to a sharp drop in Northern
Telecom which said earnings for the first quarter of 1993 will be below
year-earlier results.

FT  27 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei stocks close at
high for the year

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVE buying by dealers and foreign investors initially supported share
prices, and the index fluctuated between buying and profit-taking, finally
closing at a new high for the year, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average gained 23.78 to 18,788.70 after a low of 18,676.67 and
a high of 18,897.61, for a week's gain of 1.35 per cent. Index-linked
selling and profit-taking in the afternoon cut some of the early gains.
Volume surged to 800m shares from 470m. Heavy buying by brokers on their own
accounts lifted activity, advances leading declines by 765 to 294 with 79
issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 14.18 to
1,428.20 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index closed up 3.72 at 1141.51.
Dealers bought large-capital issues, while foreign investors focused on
electronics and communications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange announced that
foreign investors were net buyers for the third consecutive week, purchasing
Y128.2bn worth of stocks. Individuals were also net buyers of Y10bn, while
banks sold a net Y42.6bn, investment trusts sold a net Y62bn, and insurance
companies liquidated a net Y8.8bn.
The National Land Agency reported an accelerated decline in land prices last
year, heightening hopes that the property market had bottomed out. The real
estate sector was the day's top performer, rising 7.27 per cent, as Mitsui
Fudosan gained Y70 to Y1,280 and Mitsubishi Estate put on Y52 to Y1,050.
Electronics firmed on foreign buying. NEC rose Y59 to Y894 and Sony advanced
Y130 to Y4,230. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y15,000 to Y843,000,
leading the way for other telecom related issues. Kyowa Exeo rose Y45 to
Y1,040 and Japan Radio Y110 to Y1,600. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 306.78
to 19,965.87, in volume 33.2m shares, on active buying by individuals and
dealers. Roundup
THE region was mixed, with most of the excitement on the upside.
HONG KONG's Hang Seng index ended 94.28 higher at 6,341.25, up 4.2 per cent
on the week, after a top Chinese official for Hong Kong, Lu Ping, said that
he hoped that the British colony's planned new airport could be built by
1997.
Turnover was HKDollars 3bn, down from HKDollars 3.7bn. Blue chips posted big
gains, airport-related construction companies were also strong and Jardine
Matheson, especially sensitive to political developments, jumped HKDollars
1.50 to HKDollars 48.75.
AUSTRALIA was led higher by resource stocks as the All Ordinaries index rose
15.2 to 1,675.9, fractionally lower on the week. Options-related trade
boosted turnover from ADollars 260.1m to ADollars 553.1m. Prices were also
helped by the government's confirmation that company tax rates will be cut
on July 1.
NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 index gained 15.08 to 1,575.09, 1 per cent lower on
the week, with most of the day's rise attributable to Telecom, Fletcher
Challenge and Lion Nathan. Telecom gained 8 cents to NZDollars 2.83 after a
strong overnight showing in New York, Fletcher Challenge 6 cents to
NZDollars 2.51 on strong lumber prices and Lion Nathan 4 cents to NZDollars
3.80, apparently on simple volatility.
SEOUL extended its creeping correction to a third straight session, the
composite stock index falling 3.67 to 659.02, still only 0.6 per cent down
on the week. Brokers said that investors shrugged off the announcement of
further interest rate cuts.
BANGKOK fell further in afternoon trade although the SET confirmed that it
would postpone implementing new, stricter margin requirements. The SET index
fell 8.64 to 867.44, 4.9 per cent lower on the week. BOMBAY reopened after a
two day holiday with a fall in the BSE index of 37.13 to 2,341.42, down 1.5
per cent on the week.

DOMESTIC and international issues continued to vie for investors attention,
writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS was supported by hopes of lower interest rates as the CAC-40 index
advanced a further 24.40 to 2,025.78, up 3.2 per cent on the week. Turnover
was strong at FFr4.5bn.
Among stocks liable to benefit from an easing in rates, SocGen rose FFr14 to
FFr639 while Credit Lyonnais CI's rose FFr15 to FFr600 in spite of bad
results expected on Monday. Candidates for early privatisation by the new
government, Elf Aquitaine and Total, improved respectively FFr5.10 to
FFr386.20 and FFr5.60 to FFr262.50.
Peugeot surprised many analysts with a rise of FFr23 to FFr592 with foreign
buying being noted.
FRANKFURT rose gently on day, the DAX index closing 4.14 higher at 1,661.29
in turnover up from DM6.9bn to DM7.2bn; but it lost 2.2 per cent on a week
subdued by the Russian political crisis.
Good results from Commerzbank took the shares upDM4 to DM293.
The automotive sector stayed active; while Daimler was virtually flat at
DM616.20, its Mercedes associate rose DM10.50 to DM485.50 on speculation
that shares in the latter, each representing one Daimler unit, will be
converted into Daimler shares eventually.
Continental ended DM6.60 higher at DM217.60, hoping that German investors
planning to buy Pirelli's 31 per cent stake will pay the DM230 a share that
Pirelli wants.
MADRID was lifted by falling deposit rates and futures arbitrage. The
general index closed up 3.00, or 1.27 per cent at 238.65, 1.1 per cent
higher on the week.
The Corporacion Banesto bid for its Urbis property associate moved shares in
the group. Urbis was suspended, but the parent bank advanced Pta50 to
Pta2,530 and Corporacion Banesto was up Pta190, or 10.8 per cent to
Pta1,950.
AMSTERDAM marked VNU up Fl 3 to Fl 104 after Thursday's results as the CBS
Tendency index improved 0.6 to 106.4, down 1.2 per cent on the week.
KLM put on 40 cents to Fl 28.20, cautious about press reports which
suggested that merger talks with three other European airlines were
continuing. Switching out of Wolters Kluwer, down Fl 1.10 at Fl 88.80, into
Elsevier was noted as the latter forecast earnings growth in 1993/94. Its
shares closed down Fl 1.70 at Fl 127.10.
MILAN saw a rally in banks, looking forward to privatisation rather than
back on this week's results. The Comit index was 0.59 easier at 486.92, and
1.9 per cent lower on the week. Credito Italiano fixed L65 ahead at L2,725
while Banca Commerciale Italiana closed L73 higher at L4,521.
Fiat slipped L55 to settle at L5,700 but picked up to L5,860 after hours as
it shrugged off reports that the company allegedly used a secret Swiss bank
account to make illicit payments to political parties.
Pirelli gained L50 to L1,421 on unconfirmed reports that a German consortium
would offer DM230 per share for its stake in Continental.
ZURICH found renewed demand from institutional buyers, particularly in the
recently neglected insurance sector, and the SMI index rose 22.5 to 2,160.0,
a 1 per cent decline on the week.
Foreign demand took Swissair SFr15 or 2.6 per cent higher to SFr595 on the
re-emergence of reports that it planned an international merger.
STOCKHOLM was again dominated by Ericsson, the B shares closing SKr5 higher
at SKr265, up 9.5 per cent on the week. The Affarsvarlden general index rose
10.8 to 997.1, down 1 per cent on the week.
DUBLIN extended its gains on the overnight cut in interest rates, the ISEQ
overall index closing 20.75 higher at 1,478.04 for a 1.1 per cent rise on an
up and down week.

FT  27 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Switzerland pauses after scaling new
peaks - Analysts divided on the outlook for one of Europe's best performing
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Has the upper limit been reached? That headline, on a recent research
circular on the Swiss stock market, is certainly the question on investors'
minds these days.
The Swiss market was one of the best performers in the world last year, with
the all-share Swiss Performance Index (SPI) advancing 17.6 per cent to
1,238.6 at the year-end. It has got off to a brisk start this year too, with
a 6.4 per cent rise up to this week. But in the past few days it has
stalled.
'In the short term, we are going to be in a correction phase,' Mr Beat
Philipp, head of research at Bank Vontobel in Zurich predicts, and many
others agree.
There is also a consensus that the market is unlikely to fall much, if at
all. 'As long as interest rates can go down, there will be no more than a 5
per cent decline,' says Mr Bernard Tschanz, head of research at Credit
Suisse.
Analysts differ, however, on whether the Swiss market is likely to
outperform others this year. 'The upward trend is still there, but we do not
expect the market to outperform other European markets again this year,'
says Mr Serge Ledermann, head of Swiss research at the Geneva private bank
Lombard, Odier.
Mr Philipp and others are more optimistic, citing the defensive quality of
many leading Swiss equities, the positive risk premium (stock market
earnings yield over bond yield) in the Swiss market and the expectation of
lower interest rates.
The market's strength so far this year has come mainly from the declining
trend in interest rates. Reflecting that trend, the SPI bank index has risen
by a handsome 11.6 per cent. Also, investors have been buying a wider range
of equities than they had bought for many years.
Some of the best performing shares have been in the second division of
quoted companies. The new MILO index of shares of the 50 companies ranking
after the 18 in the SMI blue chip index has gained 14.2 per cent.
Cyclical stocks, many of which figure in the MILO list, have had a
particularly good run. The SPI machinery and construction indices have both
jumped by more than a fifth, partly reflecting recognition of the big effort
many of the leading companies have made in the past couple of years to
improve efficiency.
Of course, investors were also hoping that these companies would soon be
benefiting from an end to recessionary conditions in European economies, but
that prospect seems to be receding into the future. Recent profit reports
from leading industrial companies have made clear that the outlook remains
bleak.
Mr Percy Barnevik, president of ABB Asea Brown Boveri, for example, said at
the group's press conference two weeks ago that he could only hope for 'some
improvement' in 1994 and a real upturn in 1995.
Brown Boveri bearer shares, which had run up from SFr3,590 at the beginning
of the year to SFr4,040 on March 11 when the results were published, have
since eased to SFr3,920.
A more substantial shock came from Georg Fischer, the foundries group which
has been carrying out major restructuring in the past year. The bearer
shares raced up from SFr655 on January 4 to over SFr800 in early February in
anticipation of an early profits recovery. But then the group, which is
highly dependent on the German motor industry, warned that its 1992 profits
would be 'significantly below' the 1991 level, and the shares have since
settled back to around SFr750.
'We think many of these companies are now overvalued,' says Mr Wolfgang
Strub of Swiss Volksbank. Others agree that the rush to cyclicals was
premature.
However, with the continuing downward trend in interest rates, liquidity
will continue to flow into the market. Most analysts think that bank and
insurance company shares are still attractive, even after their substantial
price rises in recent months.
Then the normal tendency would be to head for the defensive stocks. Nestle,
a favourite in this category, is likely to continue to attract interest
following the publication this week of increased profits and the
announcement of a simplified share structure to appeal to international
investors.
The prospects for shares of the other defensive favourites - the big
pharmaceutical companies, Ciba-Geigy, Roche and Sandoz - are less clear.
Like pharmaceutical companies everywhere, they are suffering from
uncertainty over what will emerge from the US government's health policy
review.
The SPI chemical and pharmaceutical index is off 3 per cent since the
beginning of the year, even though the companies themselves are doing well.
Mr Tschanz takes a fairly relaxed view of the potential political problems.
He thinks the shares of the big three are fully priced at the moment, 'but
if they fall further, investors should buy them'.
Others suspect that investors are discounting the worst possible outcome
from the US policy review and that once the uncertainty about it is removed
the cloud over the shares will clear.
Mr Ledermann, on the other hand, thinks that the heyday of the
pharmaceuticals is over. 'We think that Swiss companies are well
diversified, have big research budgets and make lifesaver products. That
should enable them to do better than many of their competitors, but the era
of super performance is finished,' he predicts.
As pharmaceuticals account for roughly 30 per cent of the capitalisation of
the Swiss market, the outcome of this issue is likely to be decisive in the
market's performance this year.

FT  27 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST day of the equity account saw stock index futures trade in a
volatile manner with little in the way of economic or political features to
boost trading, writes Joel Kibazo.
The June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened strongly at 2,888, and moved
forward on good buying. By 9.30am it was trading at 2,893. However, futures
dealers had their eyes on the equity market and the turnround there saw
futures buying begin to dry up, causing a mid-morning retreat.
The lunch-time period brought a rally in the contract which saw it return to
the day's opening level but this petered out with the tentative opening on
Wall Street once again leading to a fall in June.
It closed at 2,865, around 2 points above estimated fair value of about 9
points. Turnover was 10,015.
The traded options sector was dull with volume of only 21,855 lots. Some
6,243 lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option, and the Euro-FT-SE was
particularly busy, trading 5,264, after a big trade by James Capel.

FT  27 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Generators busy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THONPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scottish power generators, left behind by their English and Welsh
counterparts following Thursday's coal industry white paper, hit all-time
highs yesterday before settling marginally below their best levels. Scottish
Hydro touched 273p and closed a net 7 1/2 firmer at 271 1/2 p with 1.5m
shares traded, while Scottish Power ended a busy session a net 9 1/2 to the
good at 254p, after a record 255p. As from Monday both stocks will trade cum
the final 70p call.
PowerGen and National Power both rushed up to all-time highs before
attracting profit-taking. The latter were unchanged on balance at 336p,
having traded at 340p, while the former closed 3 better at 345p, after a
record 348p. Turnover in National Power was 5.3m shares and in 7.5m in
PowerGen.
Wellcome, given rough treatment by the market on Thursday after announcing
its interim figures, remained under heavy selling pressure as the market
continued to focus on the possibility of a slowing in earnings growth and
the recent spate of profits warnings from the leading US drug companies.
Wellcome shares dropped 24 more to 794p on heavy turnover of 3.9m.
Royal Bank of Scotland substantially outperformed the rest of a mixed
banking sector. The shares jumped 10 1/2 to 249p on much higher than usual
turnover of 4.3m, amid suggestions that some of the City's leading broking
houses may be preparing to upgrade their forecasts for the bank. Abbey
National were well supported and closed 6 1/2 higher at 373p, with dealers
adopting the view that the shares had been oversold.
HSBC, which goes ex-dividend on Monday, put on 13 to 621p helped by the
strong performance of the Hong Kong market.
Burmah Castrol delivered one of the best performances among the Footsie 100
stocks reflecting keen institutional support ahead of next Thursday's
preliminary statement of profit figures which most analysts expect to show
net income of about Pounds 85m and a net dividend of around 25p.
The shares jumped 14 to 714p, albeit in rather unspectacular turnover of
818,000 shares.
With the 'dash for gas' policy enshrined in the government's white paper on
coal, British Gas moved up 4 1/2 to 300p on heavy turnover of 9.6m shares.
The go-ahead given by Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade,
to the gas-powered Connah's Quay power station, which will be fed by the
Hamilton and Hamilton North gas fields in Liverpool Bay, triggered a further
burst of buying in Monument Oil &amp; Gas whose shares edged up 1 1/2 more to 45
1/2 p. Monument has a 25 per cent stake in the gas fields and the adjacent
Douglas oil field as well as a 25 per cent stake in the nearby Lennox field.
Several stocks in the retail sector were said to have been depressed by a
stock overhang following Thursday's programme trade by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
These included Boots, which gave up 13 to 486p, and WH Smith 'A', 8 lighter
at 402p. Sentiment in both stocks was further weakened by DIY competition
worries from Kingfisher, which hardened 5 to 558p, as investors continued to
appreciate the group's favourable results earlier in the week.
A profits warning from Fenner sent the shares tumbling. By the close the
shares had fallen 22 to 65p. Smiths Industries shed 3 to 331p, with both UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew and NatWest Securities said to have had large lines of
stock.
A stock overhang continued in Siebe which left the shares 3 lighter at 443p,
after trade of 1.9m.
Confirmation that French holding company CGIP was in negotiations as part of
a consortium to acquire a 25.3 per cent stake in Carnaud Metalbox, along
with reports of an insider dealing inquiry in Paris, saw Carnaud Metalbox
fall 225 to 2488p. The stake is currently held by building products group
MB-Caradon whose shares eased 5 to 311p.
Around 15 per cent of the company's stock changed hands in Atreus on its
first day of trading. By the close, volume had risen to 9.7m and having been
placed at 20p, the shares moved 1 1/2 forward to 21 1/2 p.
Shares in office equipment group Erskine House fell 7 to 34p after the
company said its final dividend for 1992 will, 'at most, be a nominal one'.
The company paid a 2.3p interim dividend and the move now means the total
dividend has fallen from last year's 6.35p. The company blamed the changes
in ACT regulations included in the UK Budget earlier this month, and said it
would instead use the money to reduce borrowings.
The blow to sentiment in Erskine was felt in several other stocks in the
sector. These included Gestetner which gave up 8 to 115p, and Danka Business
which relinquished 16 to 589p.
Property shares remained fairly active as investors continued to assess
prospects for recovery in the sector. Although expectations of another large
rights issue continued to unsettle share prices, there were few obvious
candidates.
At 188p, Slough Estates were only a few pence off, with the market evidently
satisfied with the details of this week's Pounds 147m rights issue.
Hammerson 'A' shares eased to 349p with talk of a bid still echoing in the
background.
Among the other leaders of the sector, turnover was moderate but share
prices moved within narrow bands. While the likelihood of a further cut in
UK base rates in the near future has clearly receded since the Budget,
investors still see property shares as the harbingers of a recovery across
the range of the UK economy.
BUDGET CHANGES
The Financial Times will implement with effect from April 5 the Budget
reduction in the income tax rate applied to dividends to 20 per cent from 25
per cent. This will affect gross dividend yields shown for individual
companies in the London Share Service, and those calculated for the FT-SE
Actuaries UK Share Indices and the FT-Actuaries World Indices.

FT  27 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: BP chased by US buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THONPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OIL sector, and particularly BP, was one of the few areas of the market
to attract any persistent buying interest. BP shares glided through their
1992/3 high-point and reached, 305p, their best level since November 1991,
as US investors continued to chase the stock.
By the close the stock price had come off its best and closed a net 5 1/2 up
at 304 1/2 p. Turnover in BP was a hefty 9.1m shares. Oil specialists said
the impetus for the sector came from the US where oil stocks outperformed
the rest of the market.
'The love affair between the US institutions and BP gets more intense by the
hour,' said one rather bemused oil analyst in the UK. He said he expected an
announcement soon that US investors now speak for well in excess of a
quarter of BP's issued capital.

FT  27 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities fail to hold on to early
gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POST-BUDGET confidence was beginning to wear thin on the UK securities
markets yesterday as government bonds faced a further sell-off while
equities found the FT-SE 2,950 mark under increasing pressure. An early
mark-up in share prices reflected optimistic comments on British
manufacturing output from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and
took the FT-SE Index to 2,873.7. However, there was little support at these
levels and by the close many shares had returned to overnight quotations.
The final reading for the two week equity trading account left the FT-SE
Index at 2,852.9, just 0.1 up on the day, with the London market showing
little sense of direction in late dealings when Wall Street was a shade off
as it opened its new trading session.
The Footsie 2,850 mark is significant as chart analysts see little further
support above 2,800. Mr Ian Harnett of Strauss Turnbull yesterday said again
that, without a rate cut, the index would head for 2,800 following the
Budget.
Prospects for a cut in base rates appeared to remain elusive yesterday as,
despite firmness in sterling, government bonds were sold off. Longer dates
closed around  11/32 off, but losses among Index-linked gilts were smaller.
Inflation concern in gilts was fuelled by the CBI's prediction that
manufacturing output will rise over the next quarter. Bonds are also
overshadowed by the prospective weight of government funding.
Over the two week Budget account which closed last night, the Footsie has
lost about 2.2 per cent, with most of the loss recorded this week as the
Budget implications for Advance Corporation Tax and for dividends on
overseas earnings have unsettled share prices. Also discouraging have been
trading statements from such blue chips as Wellcome and Redland, both of
which raised worries in the stock market over the near-term outlook.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index also ran into further selling pressure yesterday,
closing 14.6 down at 3,099, now around 1.7 per cent below the peak reached
just after Budget Day.
Some strategists expressed concern at present valuations of the stock
market, where the FT-SE 100 shares are now trading around 20 times earnings.
Retail issues weakened yesterday as investors looked for more convincing
signs of the recovery in consumer spending which is still seen as the only
genuine precursor of economic recovery. Market indices were dragged down by
renewed pressure on some drug stocks in the wake of Wellcome's trading
statement.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Call money down again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN call money continued to come down yesterday, following the
Bundesbank's decision on Thursday to cut the interest rate on its 3-day
Treasury Bills, writes James Blitz.
For the last two days, dealers have been divided over whether the 90 basis
point cut in the T-Bill rate to 8.40 per cent signified a more aggressive
attitude by the Bundesbabnk towards easing monetary policy. The rate cut
bears have argued that the reduction in the T-Bill rate was a foregone
conclusion following last week's cut in the discount rate to 7.5 per cent.
UK clearing bank base lending rate 6 per cent from January 26, 1993
But there was a strong feeling in the market yesterday that the T-Bill rate
had been holding up the floor for German call money.
Hence the fall in the overnight cost of lending D-Marks yesterday from 8.45
per cent to 8.31 per cent.
The June Euromark contract tracked the easing in rates, rising to a high of
the day of 93.00, before closing unchanged on the day at 92.94.
The easing in the T-Bill rate helped to dampen concerns which had arisen
earlier in the week that the Bundesbank had left the the rate at which it
offers short term funds to commercial banks - the repo rate - unchanged.
Indeed, some dealers were arguing yesterday that the T-Bill move would raise
speculation of a cut next week in the repo rate, currently at 8.25 per cent,
and in the Lombard rate, currently at 9.00 per cent.
There will be pressure to cut the repo rate, now that call money is
approaching the 8.25 per cent level. One of the main reasons for the
Bundesbank not to cut the Lombard rate has also disappeared - namely that
call money was so close to the Lombard level that an easing there would have
triggered 'round tripping' by commercial banks.
Both Denmark and Ireland took advantage of the comparative calm in the ERM
to ease official rates. Ireland cut its short-term facility rate by 50 basis
points to 10.25 per cent. Denmark lowered both its deposit rate and discount
rate to 9.5 per cent from 10 per cent.
Sterling markets were almost unmoved yesterday, at the end of a week which
has seen the futures market taking the view that 6 per cent base rates are
here to stay until the autumn of 1994.
Three-month money again closed almost unchanged at 6 1/8 per cent.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling boosted by economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING rose more than 2 pfennigs in early morning trading against the
D-Mark yesterday, boosted by more good economic indicators in the UK and
growing speculation that the Bundesbank might ease interest rates again next
week, writes James Blitz.
For most of this week, the pound has softened against the D-Mark in spite of
the German currency's weaker performance against other European currencies.
On Friday morning in Tokyo the pound won back a lot of the ground lost in
previous days although it later fell back in the afternoon in London.
Sterling closed in London at DM2.4300, a pfennig up on the day.
The pound was partly boosted after the Confederation of British Industry
reported on Thursday that British manufacturing industry expected to
increase output over the next four months following a recovery in order
books to their best levels since the summer of 1990.
Compounding the pound's rise may have been the perception that Germany may
ease interest rates next week. German call money fell yesterday close to the
level at which the Bundesbank lends cash to commercial banks, prompting
speculation that the crucial repo rate may be cut on Wednesday or Thursday.
This way of thinking did not help either the dollar or the French franc
against the German currency, however. The dollar again fell back after
failing to break through the 30-day moving average against the D-Mark of
DM1.6450. It closed at DM1.6305, down more than a pfennig on the day.
The French franc also weakened, falling to its ERM floor against the Irish
punt and falling nearly a centime against the D-Mark to close at FFr3.405.
Despite the fall, some dealers appear to have been surprised that the franc
did not come under more pressure in a week that saw the German repo rate
unchanged, the Belgian government falling and the onset of the second round
of the French National assembly elections.
Mr Mark Brett of Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London said: 'ERM tensions do
appear to be evaporating and forex traders are no longer taking short franc
positions for weeks at a time,' he said.
Mr Christopher Potts of Banque Indosuez in Paris, believes the new French
government may be able to hold the franc initially. 'But the danger,' he
says, 'is that interest rates can't be pushed down significantly in the next
two months.' He believes the new French administration will take advantage
of a wave of goodwill to instigate a cut in interest rates in the next two
weeks.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Northern Telecom shares fall sharply after warning
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NORTHERN Telecom's share price tumbled by about 10 per cent yesterday
morning after a surprise announcement by the Canadian telecommunications
equipment maker that first-quarter earnings will not match either last
year's levels or analysts' expectations.
In one of Mr Jean Monty's first statements since becoming chief executive,
he ascribed the shortfall to heavier spending on research and development,
lower software product sales, higher overseas marketing costs and
price-cutting in the north American central-office switching market.
The company declined to estimate the likely shortfall in first-quarter
earnings, which are due to be published on April 27. Earnings for the first
three months of 1992 were USDollars 104.2m and for the year as a whole
Dollars 548.3m. Northern's share price dropped Dollars 5 to close at Dollars
37 7/8 on the New York stock exchange yesterday. It reached a peak of
USDollars 48 last year. Northern's parent company, BCE, also lost ground.
The biggest contributor to the fall in earnings is understood to have been
the fall in software sales. Although revenues are only modestly lower,
earnings have been more severely dented by the high margins on these
products.
The jump in R&amp;D spending partly reflects work on a cellular phone system in
Australia being developed between Northern and Matra, the French company in
which Northern bought a stake last year. Higher marketing costs were
ascribed mainly to a venture with Bosch, the German electrical group, to
develop the German market, and to extra spending in Latin America and
Pacific rim countries.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Finmeccanica at L186bn despite defence downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FINMECCANICA, the group controlling the bulk of engineering and high
technology interests of IRI, Italy's state holding company, recorded net
profits of L186.4bn (Dollars 117m) in 1992.
Comparisons with the previous year have been distorted by the need in the
1991 accounts to write in L615bn plus interest repaid to IRI.
This followed a ruling by the EC Commission that Finmeccanica had received
illegal subsidies for its car divisions prior to the sale of Alfa Romeo to
Fiat in 1986. As a result Finmeccanica posted a group loss of L525bn, but
with this payment excluded the 1992 profits rose 11 per cent.
The board is proposing a dividend of L140 for ordinary shares and L180 for
savings shares, with L51bn going to reserves. The share of the results net
of third party interests due to Finmeccanica is L126.3bn against L182.9bn in
1991. (Alenia, Ansaldo and Elsag-Bailey were incorporated after the close of
the 1992 accounts).
During the year turnover rose L112bn to L11,078bn, of which 40 per cent was
accounted for by exports.
This 1 per cent rise against inflation of 5 per cent reflected the downturn
in a number of sectors, most notably defence. New orders topped L12,000bn
compared to L10,318bn in 1991, and totalled L22,300bn.
Financial liabilities rose 9 per cent to L5,310bn, equivalent to 47 per cent
of turnover. Increased indebtedness was attributed to the difficulties of
the civil aerospace business and the defence sector, plus the cost of group
restructuring. Employment declined from 56,000 to 51,500.

FT  27 MAR 93 / IBM Japan chief steps down as profits fall

<TEXT>
IBM JAPAN, the Japanese arm of International Business Machines of the US,
yesterday announced that Mr Takeo Shiina is resigning as chief executive, to
be replaced by Mr Kakutaro Kitashiro, the president. The company also
unveiled a 90 per cent fall in taxable profits for 1992.
It said Mr Shiina's resignation was to make way for a younger generation of
executives. He will remain as chairman, but will resign from the executive
board, and will leave his post at IBM in the US.
The sudden change in top personnel at IBM Japan surprised the local
industry, as Mr Shiina has led the company for 15 years.
The company also announced a cut in board membership from 30 to 24, and an
average 50 per cent reduction in executive bonuses this summer. Head office
staff will be reduced to 300 this year by moving 100 employees to marketing
divisions. Last year, IBM Japan transferred 1,300 staff from its Tokyo
headquarters to marketing and engineering departments.
The company reported that pre-tax profits plunged 90 per cent to Y10.56bn
(Dollars 90m) for 1992 from Y103.52bn the year before, due to lower personal
computers prices, and a sharp fall in sales of its mainframe computers.
Operating profits fell 73 per cent to Y38.45bn from Y113.90bn on sales 1.4
per cent lower at Y1,254.5bn. Net profits fell 44.8 per cent to Y31.21bn
from Y56.48bn.
The fall in sales and profits mirrors depressed earnings at Japanese
computer makers, hit by a sharp decline in capital investment by Japanese
corporations. Computer hardware sales fell 10 per cent. IBM Japan said it
was trying to shift its business focus to software and services, which grew
10 per cent last year.
The company was affected by restructuring expenses and the costs of merging
Computer Systems Leasing, which it bought last year.
IBM Deutschland, IBM's German subsidiary, yesterday announced it would cut
nearly 4,000 jobs this year, Reuter reports from Hanover.
Mr Bernhard Dorn, chief executive, said IBM planned initially to reduce
about 3,000 jobs. 'We need a cost efficient structure as soon as possible.'
Since 1988, the number of workers in production in Germany has already
dropped to 6,000 from 11,000.

FT  27 MAR 93 / SAS pushes on with four-airline merger talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCANDINAVIAN Airline System (SAS) confirmed yesterday that a merger of four
of Europe's medium-sized airlines - SAS, KLM, of the Netherlands, Swissair
and Austrian Airlines - is under consideration.
However, it denied that a decision has been taken and said a merger was one
of several forms of co-operation being studied by working groups set up by
the airlines.
SAS was responding to reports in the Danish media claiming that the
managements and boards of the four airlines had already agreed on the
principles of and a timetable for a merger.
The four airlines have 87,000 employees and carried 30.6m passengers in
1991, more than either British Airways or Lufthansa.
The four airlines are planning to transfer their assets to a jointly-owned
company in which SAS, KLM and Swissair will each hold 30 per cent and
Austrian Airlines 10 per cent, according to a press report. The board of the
new company will have 14 members, four each from the three larger airlines
and two from Austrian Airlines. The new company will own four operating
companies, which will fly under a common logo, with common colours and
flight schedules and a joint headquarters, the report added.
Starting date for the co-operation is next new year, said the paper, but
there would be a transitional phase before the merger was completed.
Mr Jan Carlzon, SAS chief executive, is a long-standing proponent of
transnational airline co-operation to enable European airlines to compete
with the large American and Asian carriers when the European air transport
market is liberalised in coming years.
The plans for extensive co-operation between the SAS, KLM, Swissair, and
Austrian Airlines, made known earlier this year, have met with scepticism in
Copenhagen, where the Danish capital's Kastrup International Airport is the
hub airport for SAS.

L'AIR Liquide, the French technical gases group, saw net profits rise by 3.9
per cent to FFr1.37bn (Dollars 249m) in 1992 from FFr1.32bn the year before,
writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
The group, which last year invested heavily in eastern Germany by commiting
DM267m in an air dispersion plant, also managed to increase turnover by 2
per cent to FFr29.26bn from FFr29.34bn.
L'Air Liquide benefited last year from a positive contribution from the
disposal of its Lipha business in 1991, which reduced its debt ratio to 20
per cent by the year end from 27 per cent.
The directors decided to maintain the dividend at FFr14 a share.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Gerstner delivers blow to RJR Nabisco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTURE of Mr Louis Gerstner to IBM, comes at a testing time for RJR
Nabisco, which he has chaired since the record Dollars 25bn buy-out of the
food and tobacco group in early-1989.
RJR Nabisco is in the throes of a complex 'targeted stock scheme'. This
should create a new class of shares pegged to the fortunes of its food
business. The existing shares will then be renamed, and largely track the
performance of the tobacco operations. In the process, RJR Nabisco - still
carrying a Dollars 14bn debt load - hopes to raise Dollars 1.5bn.
The scheme, with the Securities and Exchange Commission for review, must
then be marketed to the investment community, and the Dollars 1.5bn-worth of
new 'food' shares sold.
At the same time, investors have been increasingly twitchy about the
declining RJR Nabisco share price and lack of visible progress in the
company's large domestic tobacco business. The annual shareholders meeting
is set for April 2. 'The situation,' as one analyst put it, this week, 'is
delicate'.
So ever since Mr Gerstner started to emerge as front-runner for the IBM job,
the consumer products company has hinted privately that the chairman's shoes
would be filled internally. This would minimise upheaval and lessen
uncertainty. In fact, within an hour of the IBM news, RJR Nabisco made its
own management position clear. Mr Lawrence Ricciardi, the group's general
counsel, and Mr Karl von der Heyden, finance director, are to become joint
co-chairmen and chief executive officers, while retaining their legal and
financial responsibilities. Management of the operating divisions will be
unaffected.
This is, indeed, a simple solution. RJR Nabisco has been run, at corporate
level, by Mr Gerstner and three executive vice-presidents - Mr Ricciardi,
who followed Mr Gerstner from American Express, Mr von der Heyden, and Mr
Eugene Croisant, head of human resources and administration.
The speedy 'joint chairmanship' announcement also pre-empts internal
wrangling.
The question, however, is whether the two chairmen will produce the
long-term leadership and vision which a large consumer products company,
operating in some difficult and competitive markets, needs.
Mr von der Heyden, 56, has well-regarded track-record, having been finance
director of H. J. Heinz and vice-president of manufacturing at Pepsi-Cola
Bottling. Mr Ricciardi, 52, had 16 years experience with American Express.
But, in a tricky situation, everything has yet to be proved.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Distiller is reviving the spirit of Hungary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER more than 40 years in exile, Mr Peter Zwack is back in Hungary making
the liqueur which five generations of his family developed into the
country's most popular drink.
Zwack Unicum, a blend of more than 40 herbs and spices, was introduced in
1790. Known as 'the stomach fortifier,' it became a favourite tipple at the
court of the Habsburgs, and between the world wars won increasing
recognition in international markets.
Mr Zwack intends to restore the company to its pre-communist eminence in the
international spirits markets, with its liqueur, drunk as an aperitif or a
digestive, ranked alongside the Underberg and Fernet Branca brands.
Next month, Zwack plans a public offering of 25 per cent of its shares.
Negotiations are also well advanced for the sale of a further 25 per cent
stake to an unnamed international spirits group.
The Hungarian company, with a market capitalisation of about Dollars 50m,
will be listed on the Budapest and Vienna stock exchanges.
Mr Zwack, in London yesterday to meet potential investors, said the group
would increasingly concentrate on the production of high quality branded
products and developing its exports.
The public offering of 500,000 shares, which is being handled by
Creditanstalt Securities, should raise 1bn-1.25bn forints (Dollars
11.6m-Dollars 14.5m). Forty per cent of the shares are expected to go to
Hungarian investors, and the rest to international institutions.
Mr Zwack and Mr Emil Underberg, owner of a German spirits company and
partner in the purchase of Zwack from the state, will retain majority
control. Having waited since 1948 to regain his heritage, Mr Zwack has no
intention of losing it again.
When the communists seized the family's distilleries in 1948, Peter Zwack
fled the country with the secret recipe for the liqueur, settling first in
the US and later in Italy.
He was one of the first Hungarian businessmen to return home as the
communist regime crumbled in 1989.
Within a year, the partners restarted production of the liqueur, and in
1991, they bought the state-owned Budapest Liquor Company, the country's
largest spirits producer, which had been making its own version of Unicum.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SECURITIES trading helped total operating profits at Commerzbank, Germany's
third largest bank, climb by 10.2 per cent during the first two months of
the year, Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, the bank's chief executive said yesterday.
Partial operating profits - which do not include any contribution from
trading - were at the same level as last year.
Net interest income rose 8.6 per cent in January and February, while fee
income rose 14.8 per cent.
The growth in profits in the early part of the year shows that Commerzbank,
like other large German banks, is still maintaining some immunity to the
worsening economic environment in Germany. For last year as a whole,
Commerzbank posted operating profits up 20.7 per cent to DM2.2bn (Dollars
1.34bn), as disclosed in January when the bank announced a DM500m rights
issue.
Despite what Mr Kohlhaussen called an 'encouraging' start to 1993, he
refused to be drawn on the outlook for the bank during the rest of the year.
He confined himself to the remark that German banks as whole were concerned
about the future in the light of German economic downturn, and that there
had been a deterioration in the 'morale' of borrowers.
The bank's caution was shown by its decision not to increase its 1992
dividend beyond the DM10 per share paid in 1991, and in sharply increased
provisions against poor quality sovereign loans and bad and doubtful
commercial debts.
The bank has provided against its overseas exposure to the Olympia &amp; York
property group and Hafnia, the Danish insurer, which totals DM830m. Total
provisions against sovereign debt rose to more than 75 per cent of the total
DM5.9bn, whilst provisions were raised to cover more than 90 per cent of
ex-Soviet debt.
Total provisions, together with write-downs on securities, rose from
DM1.05bn in 1991 to DM2.09bn last year. As re-vealed last week, net earnings
for the year rose 53 per cent to DM838m, the surge reflecting the impact of
the consolidation of the bank's Berlin subsidiary into the parent bank.
The bank has seen its share price increase 20 per cent this year,
outperforming the market as a whole by 11 per cent.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Steel price drop behind LFr3bn loss at Arbed
</HEADLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARBED, the Luxembourg steel-maker, yesterday announced it lost LFr3.3bn
(Dollars 97.9m) last year, as the drop in EC steel prices took its toll on
profits. The company recorded a consolidated profit of LFr6bn in 1991.
Arbed's share of last year's loss excluding minorities was LFr2.9bn,
compared with a profit of LFr4.3bn in 1991. The company said the 1992 result
included provisions of LFr700m to cover the restructuring of non-steelmaking
activities.
Arbed, which will announce detailed figures at the end of next month, has
been hit hard by the decline in west European steel prices, under pressure
from cheap non-EC imports. In September, the group announced it had recorded
a profit of only LFr364m for the first half of the year, against LFr3.2bn in
the equivalent period.
A spokesman for the Luxembourg company said the group had already reduced
the number of daily shifts at its Differdange heavy beams plant from three
to two to cope with the slump in EC demand. Arbed's turnover slipped from
LFr198bn to LFr188.5bn in the year, and 7.1m tonnes of steel were produced,
down 12.8 per cent on the 1991 figure.

FT  27 MAR 93 / International Company News: Microvitec cuts loss to Pounds
2.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MICROVITEC, the Bradford-based computing services company, slipped back into
the red to Pounds 2.14m pre-tax for the whole of 1992 after an encouraging
first half, dragged down by operating losses of Pounds 1.6m in its Logitek
distribution business. The result, however, compared with pre-tax losses for
1991 of Pounds 3.85m.
Logitek was sold to its management in January this year for Pounds 2.5m in
cash, enabling gearing which had been running at about 80 per cent for the
past two years, to be reduced to betwen 40 per cent and 50 per cent.
Turnover increased by 35 per cent from Pounds 36.9m to Pounds 49.9m in 1992.
It was made up of Pounds 30.2m from continuing operations in the company's
core areas of computer displays, multimedia, services, software applications
and communications and Pounds 19.7m from the now discontinued distribution
business.
Mr James Bailey, chairman, said: 'It is my belief that the continuing
businesses will continue to perform well and be cash generative through
1993. We have survived this most damaging three year recession and can now,
with a strong business base, look forward to benefitting from any recovery
in economic activity'. Loss per share was given as 3.4p against 5.3p.
There were operating profits from continuing operations this time of Pounds
21m (Pounds 2.53m losses) while discontinued operations incurred much higher
losses of Pounds 2.51m compared with Pounds 634,000.

FT  27 MAR 93 / International Company News: First Spanish Trust in move to
reduce discount to net assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST Spanish Investment Trust has put forward proposals designed to
reduce the discount to net assets at which its shares trade.
The complex plan involves replacing four-fifths of the share capital with
convertible loan stock. Investors will then be entitled to tender their
convertible stock; the trust is likely to repurchase the stock at a price
which will probably be equal to 95 per cent of the fully diluted net asset
value.
This will enable some investors to realise their holdings for cash. At the
same time, the net asset value of the remaining shares will be enhanced.
Investors will be able to tender all their holdings in the initial offer. In
subsequent tenders, investors will be able to tender a proportion of their
holdings, based on the discount to net asset value at which the loan stock
is trading.
The wider the discount, the more stock investors will be able to tender. Any
convertible stock not tendered will be repaid in 1997.
The manager, Lloyds Bank Fund Management, is cutting its fee from 1.25 per
cent to 1 per cent of gross assets, but adding an incentive if it
outperforms the Spanish index.
First Spanish was trading at a 19 per cent discount to net assets in
November, when the trust announced it was considering restructuring
proposals. The discount has narrowed to 11 per cent.
The plan needs 75 per cent approval of shareholders and warrantholders at an
extraordinary general meeting. Investors holding 28.4 per cent of the equity
have already undertaken to vote in favour.

FT  27 MAR 93 / International Company News: Brown and Tawse plans will leave
Pounds 20m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FAR-REACHING management shake-up and a restructuring plan costing more
than Pounds 12m that will push losses in the year just ending to almost
Pounds 20m was announced yesterday by Brown and Tawse Group, the troubled
steel and pipes distributor.
Mr Gilbert Black, chairman for more than five years, is standing down, along
with Mr Edwin Hartley, managing director of Brown and Tawse Ltd, the core
company.
The new non-executive chairman is Mr Donald McFarlane, chairman of Senior
Engineering and James Dickie. Mr Richard Wilson, who joined as group chief
executive from GKN last year, is also to take over day-to-day charge of
Brown and Tawse Ltd and has brought in Mr Richard Hunt from Courage and Mr
Robin Gigsby from GKN to head the group's logistics and commercial
operations.
The company said it was expecting a pre-tax loss for the year to March 28,
1993, of around Pounds 19.8m, the third year in a row the group has shown a
loss. An Pounds 8.9m trading loss was expected, after charges for a business
review and nearly Pounds 2m in increased stock and debtor provisions.
Other exceptional charges will total Pounds 10.9m, including Pounds 5m to
cover writing off an information systems infrastructure installed at Brown
and Tawse Ltd only four years ago, but which is now deemed inappropriate. Mr
Wilson said the group would now focus on Brown and Tawse Ltd, which would be
heavily restructured.

FT  27 MAR 93 / International Company News: Advanced dividend payments
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Due to the tax changes announced in the Budget the following companies have
issued revised dividend information:
Anglia Television paying a second interim of 6.4p in lieu of the already
reported final.
Blick is paying an increased interim of 3.3p (3p) earlier than the usual
June announcement and September payment.
Brake Brothers is making its dividend announcement for 1992 early, paying an
second interim of 4.35p in lieu of a final for a total of 6.2p (5.75p).
SR Gent has brought forward the payment of its already reported interim
dividend of 0.75p.
Grampian Holdings is announcing its 1992 dividend early with a second
interim of 3.8p making an unchanged total of 5.5p.
John Haggas has brought forward the payment of its interim dividend of 1p.
Town Centre Securities has replaced its announced interim dividend of 1.1p
with a special payment of 1.1p with an earlier pay date.
Meanwhile Erskine House is expecting to pay only a nominal final in addition
to the interim of 2.3p already paid. Maintaining the payment would have
resulted in further unrelieved ACT and the board has decided to conserve
cash to reduce borrowings.

FT  27 MAR 93 / International Company News: Campaign against Clark sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CAMPAIGN against the sale of C&amp;J Clark is being organised by members of
the family which has controlled Britain's largest shoe manufacturer for 167
years.
Many members of the family and the company's employees are believed to
object strongly to the recommendation by a majority of the board that
Berisford, the property and agribusiness group, be allowed to bid for the
company.
Meanwhile, the four directors who have opposed the tender process yesterday
presented a series of alternatives to allow Clark's to remain independent,
yet provide an exit for those shareholders seeking to sell their stakes.
Berisford beat rivals Fii, the UK shoe manufacturer which was offering
Pounds 156m, and a consortium of existing shareholders, backed by Electra
Investment Trust, to win the recommendation with its estimated Pounds 160m
bid.
The bid from Berisford has sparked fears among employees of widespread
redundancies, while many members of the family feel an obligation to the
company's Quaker inheritance and its UK manufacturing operations.
Berisford, for its part, has said it remains committed to shoe manufacturing
in the UK, although Clark's must operate in an internationally competitive
environment.

FT  27 MAR 93 / International Company News: Closure provisions put Lec in
Pounds 2.9m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEC Refrigeration, the Bognor Regis-based refrigerator manufacturer, is to
close its compressor factory at the end of May, with the loss of 360 jobs,
in response to continued weak demand and low margins in the UK market.
Lec made the announcement as it reported a Pounds 2.86m before-tax loss in
the year to December 31 compared with a Pounds 1.2m profit.
The figure was struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 2.46m to cover
the cost of the redundancies and restructuring resulting from the closure of
the compressor plant, which produced 30,000 units a year. Lec will instead
be supplied by Danfoss.
Mr Don Durrant, finance director, said EC directives on energy efficiency
were 'the last straw' in forcing the closure. The cost of upgrading its
compressors to meet EC standards was too great to allow profitable
production on the scale of the Bognor plant, he said.
The results also suffered from a fall in demand, hit particularly by
continued recession in the housing market.
Turnover was pushed down by 15 per cent from Pounds 48.4m to Pounds 41.1m.
What the company called extreme pressure on margins led to an operating loss
of Pounds 397,000, compared to a Pounds 1.2m operating profit.
Mr Durrant said Lec saw little sign of a sustained upturn. 'Until people
start moving house, the cream will not come back into the appliance market,'
he said.
The company added that there had been a small increase in sales and some
signs of a pick up in the housing market.
Earnings per share plunged from 13.28p to losses of 31.94p. A reduced final
dividend of 5p is recommended for a full year dividend of 9p, compared with
14.5p.

FT  27 MAR 93 / International Company News: National Express beats float
forecast with Pounds 6.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN ITS FIRST results since flotation in December last year National Express,
the coach service operator, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.82m for
1992 on turnover of Pounds 120.6m. When it came to the market profits of
Pounds 6.5m were forecast.
The profit compared with a proforma loss of Pounds 1.2m loss in 1991 after
exceptional costs of Pounds 5.5m. Earnings per share for 1992 came out at
16.8p, compared to a flotation forecast of 16.1p.
Turnover on continuing activities increased by 3 per cent to Pounds 117.1m
(Pounds 113.8m).
Mr Ray McEnhill, chief executive, said the improvement in profitability came
despite very difficult economic conditions, which affected most parts of the
business.
The core NEL inter-city scheduled coach business was hardest hit by the
recession which has adversely affected many of the company's traditional
customers. Passenger journeys fell by 11 per cent from 11.8m to 10.5m.
The passenger decline also reflected the company's policy of eliminating
unprofitable parts of the route network and the 'increasingly aggressive
competition from British Rail'.
However NEL's operating profits were almost unchanged at Pounds 4.5m (Pounds
4.6m) helped by a 6 per cent fare price increase in April and a cost cutting
programme which in turn led to a 10 per cent reduction in the workforce
early this year.
The company is in the middle of a Pounds 5m improvement programme including
renovations of the Birmingham and Liverpool coach stations, introducing a
computerised reservation system and installing coach-to-base communications
systems.
Eurolines (UK), the UK member of a pan-European grouping of coach operators,
managed a strong performance with turnover up by 13 per cent to Pounds 15.1m
(Pounds 13.2m) and operating profits increasing to Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 1m).
Airport Coach Services, acquired in October 1991, reported an operating
profit of Pounds 700,000 (Pounds 100,000 proforma loss) on turnover of
Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 6.1m).
COMMENT
National Express is wisely investing in upgrading its coach station and
reservation system infrastructure, both necessary if it is to squeeze more
margin out of its low budget passengers. Investing in technology and
replacing the antiquated paper system should produce early savings since NEL
will no longer have to pay agents 50p per passenger reservation. However
margins in the UK long-distance coach market are thin and passenger numbers
are unlikely to rise much in 1993. Pre-tax profits this year could rise to
about Pounds 7.4m. In the meantime the group has up to Pounds 10m of spare
cash in its balance sheet, even after NEL's upgrading programme, and
acquisition(s) in related areas look very likely this year.

<TEXT>
SHARES in CRP Leisure, the USM-quoted public house refurbishment company
formerly called PE Kemp, were suspended at 7 1/2 p yesterday at the
company's request, pending an announcement.
Yesterday's request for the suspension is understood to have followed the
acquisition by a small group of shareholders of the 78 per cent stake in the
company formerly held by Gatedene Developments.
The new shareholders are believed to be planning a refinancing, including a
rights issue, which is likely to be announced on Monday.
Last month, the group warned of financial difficulties at its CR Pursehouse
subsidiary acquired a year ago, compounded by a sizeable bad debt on a
building contract.

FT  27 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Fenner warns of attributable loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NATHALIE LEMOINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Fenner fell sharply from 87p to 65p yesterday, after the
Hull-based engineering group warned it would make an attributable loss for
the six months to February 28.
The group expects to break-even at the pre-tax level after charging
exceptional items due to professional charges related to aborted merger
talks held four months ago, and to further redundancy costs.
In spite of profit from disposals, a substantial charge for tax on overseas
earnings and minorities will result in an overall loss, the group warned. On
present trends, prospects for the full year are unlikely to produce a profit
for ordinary shareholders, the group said.
Despite cost cutting measures on the UK manufacturing side, trading has
continued to deteriorate in the distribution networks, particularly in
continental Europe where the group suffered a 20 per cent fall in demand
during the last three months.
The current uncertainty over the proposed UK pit closure programme also had
an adverse impact, said the group, which last year made less than 7 per cent
of its sales to British Coal.

FT  27 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Telegraph directors approve deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT directors of The Telegraph, the UK newspaper group 68 per cent
owned by Hollinger, Mr Conrad Black's Canadian company, have approved the
deal to take a stake in Southam, the Canadian newspaper group. The deal is
subject to a vote by the minority shareholders of The Telegraph.
A circular recommending the deal is being sent to shareholders shortly and a
special meeting will be held, probably on or about April 13.
Hollinger agreed to buy a 22.5 per cent stake in November at CDollars 18.10
a share and offered half to the Telegraph, at a the same price, costing
Pounds 72.3m. The deal was going to a vote of shareholders when Power
Corporation, another Canadian company, bought new shares in Southam at
CDollars 14 each representing 18.7 per cent of the company and diluting
Hollinger's holding to the same level. Hollinger and Power also came to a
shareholder arrangement.
Sir Frank Rogers, deputy chairman of The Telegraph said the directors
unanimously approved the deal.
Mr Tony Hughes, finance director of The Telegraph, said the deal would still
be slightly dilutive of The Telegraph's earnings as the benefit of the extra
money Southam was getting would offset the dilution of the Hollinger stake.
Sir Frank said that the combined Hollinger, The Telegraph and Power stake of
37 per cent and the right to nominate six directors to the Southam board,
would give them influence to 'improve Southam's newspaper assets and enhance
shareholder value'.

FT  27 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Helene makes recommended Pounds 5.5m paper
bid for Gabicci
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HELENE, the clothing distributor, yesterday launched a Pounds 5.5m
recommended bid for Gabicci, the USM-quoted casual clothing group.
The all-share bid, which offers 2.043 new Helene shares for every Gabicci
share held, was recommended by a majority of the Gabicci board. Helene has
also received undertakings to accept from some Gabicci directors and
institutional shareholders, who together hold 30.1 per cent of the company.
However, two Gabicci executive directors are opposing the offer and
criticised the absence of a cash alternative.
Last month Gabicci's share price rose from 33p to 47p following the two
groups' admission of merger talks. The offer values Gabicci shares at 48p, a
45 per cent premium to the price before merger speculation began. Gabicci
closed up 1.5p on the day at 42.5p and Helene stabilised at 23 1/2 p.
The dissident directors said that the two groups were not a good fit and
Helene's financial position was weak. They said Helene has net assets per
share of about 5p compared with Gabicci's 60p.
One analyst said Helene's Pounds 4.58m placing last June meant it was
unwilling to offer cash to Gabicci's shareholders and that Gabicci, which
has suffered in the recession, had been looking for an offer for more than a
year. The deal would strengthen Helene's weak balance sheet, the analyst
said.
Both companies released results yesterday. Gabicci announced pre-tax losses
of Pounds 476,000 (Pounds 538,000 profits) for the six months ended December
19.
The group made an exceptional charge of Pounds 537,000 which included the
costs of abortive merger talks and a provision for a bad debt. The charge
also covered a severance payment to Mr Michael Abrahams, former managing and
finance director.
Turnover fell to Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 11m). Losses per share were 3.3p (3.1p
earnings) and the interim dividend has been omitted (1.4p).
Helene reported pre-tax profits for 1992 of Pounds 3.01m (Pounds 2.61m) on
turnover of Pounds 76.8m (Pounds 73.5m). There was an extraordinary charge
of Pounds 412,000 (Pounds 737,000) relating to the liquidation of Major
Minor Childrenswear. The recommended final dividend is 1.36p (same) giving a
maintained total of 2.01p out of earnings of 2.39p (2.48p).

FT  27 MAR 93 / UK Company News: GPG acquires Brown Shipley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS Peat Group, the UK investment vehicle of New Zealand entrepreneur
Sir Ron Brierley, is taking over Brown Shipley Holdings, the investment and
broking business, in an agreed bid which values BSH at Pounds 5.6m.
GPG has reached agreement with Kredietbank Luxembourgeoise, previously BSH's
largest shareholder, to buy its 29.8 per cent stake for 35p a share. GPG has
already acquired 29.9 per cent of the equity.
It is also paying Pounds 1.8m to KBL to settle claims against BSH.
KBL was the original bidder for BSH in February. It offered 30p a share
after potential claims emerged against BSH amounting to Pounds 2.4m. These
arose from indemnities given to KBL when it bought Brown Shipley and Co,
BSH's banking arm, last year.
The claims threatened to reduce BSH's net assets to less than half the
Pounds 16m called up capital. Brown Shipley's share price slid from 51p
after the claims were revealed and KBL launched its offer.
KBL said: 'When someone was prepared to make a higher offer and settle the
claims, this was a more than acceptable solution.'
GPG regained its stock market listing in November after a suspension lasting
nearly two years. It has investments in about 25 companies, the largest
being Tyndall Australia, a life assurance company.
In the 15 months to December GPG made unaudited pre-tax profits of Pounds
7.8m and had shareholders' funds of about Pounds 49.5m.
BSH made a Pounds 27.1m pre-tax loss in 1991-92. In the six months to
September it made a loss before tax, exceptionals and non-banking interest
of Pounds 839,000.

Steady investment in modern and flexible production facilities helped
Portmeirion Potteries (Holdings) lift pre-tax profits by more than 40 per
cent, from Pounds 2.61m to a record Pounds 3.67m, in 1992. Sales grew 10 per
cent to Pounds 22.5m.
Earnings per share were 22.67p (16.68p) and the final dividend is 5.5p for a
total of 7.75p (7.35p).
Mr George Hesp, managing director, said 1993 had started encouragingly with
the value of first quarter orders above that for the same period in 1992.

FT  27 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Trimmer HTV seeks alliances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HTV, the independent tele-vision company for Wales and the west country, has
set itself the target of creating a number of strategic alliances with
international broadcasters.
Talks have already begun and the company, which yesterday announced a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.1m for 1992 after an exceptional Pounds 3.77m
charge, would like to attract both a US and a continental European minority
investor.
The aim would be partly defensive - ITV companies become liable for takeover
from the beginning of next year - and partly to expand programme production.
Mr Louis Sherman, chairman, said the year had been 'most difficult' both for
HTV and the commercial television industry.
The company's operating profit increased by 9 per cent to Pounds 5.4m on
turnover of Pounds 133m (Pounds 172m). The pre-tax loss compared with
profits of Pounds 441,000. When announcing the 1991 results Mr Sherwood had
said that he expected 'a significant recovery in 1992.'
The exceptional item related mainly to redundancy and restructuring costs.
Losses per share deepened to 2.7p (0.5p) and there is no dividend (3.75p).
The cost savings, which would continue, have included the merging of the
Wales and the west divisions, salary reductions and the casualisation of
most of the technical areas of the company.
In the broadcasting division there are 413 staff compared with 599 at the
end of 1991.
An extraordinary Pounds 8.7m was partly to reduce exposure to further losses
in the Fine Art division. HTV is trying to sell 10 non-television businesses
including those involved in fine art.
The shares fell 8 1/2 p to 29 1/2 p.

FT  27 MAR 93 / UK Company News: BM heads for Pounds 30m loss and sharply
higher debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BM GROUP, the construction equipment group that has lost nearly 90 per cent
of its market value since last June, is heading for a pre-tax loss of at
least Pounds 30m this year and much bigger-than-expected debts.
The bad news and a survival plan will be announced shortly, alongside
results for the six months to December 31.
The interims are expected to show a slide in pre-tax profit from Pounds 17m
to about Pounds 8m as sales have fallen 10 to 15 per cent below budget. The
interim dividend, 2.1p last time, is likely to be cut.
But the impact of a root-and-branch review being carried out under new
chairman Mr Moger Woolley will be felt in the full-year figures, which in
1991/92 showed a record pre-tax profit of Pounds 34.6m on sales of Pounds
519.5m.
By the June year-end, the group is expected to breach banking covenants on
interest cover - which is supposed to be three times - and on gearing.
The latest estimates are that interest costs of roughly Pounds 15m will
reduce profit to less than Pounds 10m before Pounds 40m of exceptional
charges. About Pounds 13m of these have already been announced following the
disposals of the lossmaking Blackwood Hodge UK and Spain.
Other costs include extensive restructuring and redundancies at Blackwood
Hodge Canada, at Benford, the Warwickshire-based manufacturer, and at
Wadkin, which makes woodworking machines.
Tax, dividends and further balance sheet reductions, including a write-down
in the value of the pension fund, are set to reduce shareholders' funds from
Pounds 171m to about Pounds 120m. Net debt is expected to be at least that,
compared with Pounds 61m last June, giving gearing of 100 per cent plus.
The survival plan includes slimming down the group to less than Pounds 400m
turnover. Among the planned disposals are a 75 per cent stake in British
Building and Engineering Appliances.
BM grew rapidly under its founding chairman Mr Roger Shute, who resigned
through ill health last June, precipitating the share price collapse. BM had
acquired two troubled companies in the previous two years, Blackwood Hodge
in November 1990 and Thomas Robinson in January 1992.
Market value peaked at nearly Pounds 460m early last year. At last night's
closing price of 47p it was about Pounds 52m.
Mr Woolley was appointed last October and brought in Robert Fleming as
financial advisers and Price Waterhouse as auditors to help conduct the
review.

FT  27 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Redundancy costs hit Hepworth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEPWORTH, the building materials and home products company, yesterday
announced a fall in profits triggered by redundancy costs and lower UK
sales.
But Mr John Carter, chief executive, said most of the company's UK markets
seemed to have stabilised. 'Since December we've stopped receiving bad news
in the UK. After four and a half years, that's a relief,' he said.
Pre-tax profits fell 36 per cent from Pounds 70m to Pounds 44.8m in the year
to December 31. At the interim stage, profits were 7 per cent lower at
Pounds 32.8m. Shareholders were warned then that full year figures would be
worse and yesterday's results were expected. The shares fell 2p to 320p.
About one third of the profits fall was due to exceptional costs of Pounds
9.2m to cover redundancies and related payments. About 500 staff in the UK
and 350 in France were made redundant, reducing group numbers to nearly
8,000.
Turnover fell 5.1 per cent to Pounds 627.5m. Sales to UK customers fell most
sharply, dropping some Pounds 40m to Pounds 303.7m. But sales to continental
European countries increased 11 per cent to Pounds 278.5m.
Saunier Duval, the group's French-based gas boiler maker, was the best
performer. Operating profits increased 14 per cent to Pounds 26.2m following
strong sales in France and Spain.
The building products division, which includes clay pipes and plastic
plumbing, continued to suffer from the UK recession and saw operating
profits fall Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 18.7m.
Hepworth Refractories, which makes heat resistant refractory products for
furnaces and kilns, reported operating profits sharply lower at Pounds 7.6m
(Pounds 18.2m). Mr Carter said the fall was due to a decline in sales
outside Europe and that orders improved in the final quarter.
Among other divisions, operating profits from home products fell from Pounds
16.8m to Pounds 10.6m while minerals and chemicals fell by Pounds 1.1m to
Pounds 9.5m.
Net borrowings continued to fall - from Pounds 57.5m to Pounds 29.8m -
because of strong cash flow and lower capital expenditure in some divisions.
Gearing fell from 33 per cent to 15 per cent or, treating a convertible
capital bond as debt, from 215 per cent to 135 per cent.
Earnings per share fell from 24.1p to 15.6p. Directors recommended a
maintained final dividend of 9.35p to make an unchanged total of 14.85p.
After paying the dividend, there was a retained profit for the year of
Pounds 500,000, against Pounds 17.8m.

FT  27 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Spring Ram finance director likely to come
under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPRING RAM, the kitchens and bathrooms group which surprised the market with
profits a third below expectations, is holding a crucial meeting on Monday
to review the board and the position of the auditors, Arthur Andersen.
Pressure is strongest on Mr Stuart Greenwood, who came to the group two
years ago as its first finance director.
Spring Ram has delivered two nasty surprises to shareholders in the past
five months.
False accounting was discovered at the Balterley Bathrooms subsidiary last
year and disclosed belatedly and 1992 profits were Pounds 26.2m when Pounds
39m was expected.
A profit warning came only four days before the results were due, after much
haggling with the auditors. Accounting methods were at the heart of the
shortfall.
Some observers, however, see Mr Greenwood as a scapegoat and point to the
ultimate responsibility of Mr Bill Rooney, chairman and in effect chief
executive.
Some shareholders have suggested that the roles should be split and are
urging the company to step up efforts to appoint two non-executive
directors.
Shareholder criticism of Mr Rooney is, however, tempered by a desire 'not to
throw the baby out with the bathwater'. He oversaw the growth of pre-tax
profits from Pounds 1m in 1982 to Pounds 36.2m in 1991.
Mr Rooney's explanation of the results disappointment included: 'We have
been trying to beat recession for four long years and perhaps we have been
stretching too far.' He said it was strange for the company to be 'so
prudent and so conservative'.
He told investors on Monday that the more rigorous accounting represented a
clearing of the decks,
Apart from the loyalty he commands in the company, there is a fear that, as
one shareholder put it, 'a new face at the top would lead to the inevitable
kitchen sinking next year'.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Russian crisis boosts
platinum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLATINUM PRICES were given two shots in the arm this week, first by concern
about supplies from crisis-ridden Russia, and then by news that the biggest
producer was cutting output.
Boris Yeltsin's troubles had already pushed the price up by nearly Dollars 4
a troy ounce when Rustenburg Platinum of South Africa announced on Tuesday
that it had decided to close the Boschfontein trackless mining shaft because
the low level of platinum and rhodium prices had made its operation
uneconomic. News of the cut, which analysts estimated would reduce
production by between 140,000 and 200,000 ounces, 3.6 to 5.1 per cent of
western world supply, helped the platinum price up to Dollars 357.30 an
ounce before it slipped back yesterday to Dollars 355.60 yesterday, up
Dollars 5.35 on the week.
With Impala Platinum, South Africa's second biggest producer, saying it was
not planning, at this stage, to follow Rustenburg's lead a London dealer
commented that the news was 'good for Dollars 2 or Dollars 4'. He added,
however, that there was 'some pretty stiff resistance at Dollars 358'.
At the London Metal Exchange nickel prices were also influenced by the
Russian crisis and the resulting uptrend was hardly dented by yesterday's
news that Falconbridge of Canada had decided to cut production this year by
much less than had previously been planned. The cash quotation closed at
Dollars 6,095 a tonne, up Dollars 40 on the day and Dollars 147.50 on the
week.
Falconbridge said it would shut its nickel mining and smelter operations at
Sudbury, Ontario, for only two weeks instead of the ten. 'The company has
reassessed its strategy of assisting to rebalance the markets through an
extended shutdown. It is now apparent that this goal cannot be achieved,' it
explained.
The company now plans to make the most of its advantage as a low-cost
producer to compete for business in the heavily oversupplied nickel market.
Stocks in LME registered warehouses, which have been swollen by metal
flooding out of the former Soviet Union, rose another 798 tonnes this week
to a record 86,538 tonnes.
The rest of the LME metals ended lower on the week, the biggest fall being
in three months delivery copper, which closed last night at Pounds 1,465 a
tonne, down Pounds 30.50 on the day and Pounds 18.50 on the week. The firmer
early tone had been bolstered by the Russian factor, but gains were lost as
concern about Chilean labour problems faded. A dispute over production
bonuses at Chile Copper Corporation's Chuquicamata, the world's largest
copper mine, ended yesterday when the company agreed to payment reviews,
union leaders said.
Surging shipments from the former eastern bloc countries have also been
weighing down lead prices at the LME, where the cash quotation fell in
mid-week to Pounds 266 a tonne, the lowest level for six and a half years.
The price recovered somewhat, closing yesterday at Pounds 2169.75 a tonne,
but that was still Pounds 2.25 down on the week.
At prices like that, suggested Mr Stephen Briggs of Minerals &amp; Metals
Research Services, not one lead producer in the world was making a profit.
He expected substantial production cuts to be made before long, but warned:
'There will be no substantial price rise until we see a solid, sustained
increase in demand'.
The London robusta coffee market put in a firmer performance, though it
failed in successive attempts to break back above Dollars 900 a tonne for
May futures, the support level that was breached last week. Yesterday the
price eased Dollars 8 to Dollars 890 a tonne, up Dollars 10 on the week.
Coffee investors were given little encouragement by the proceedings at the
International Coffee Organisation council meeting in London, where little
progress appeared to be being made towards agreeing a price-supporting
International Coffee Agreement based on a revived export quota system.
The sugar market spent the first half of the week carrying out the price
'correction' that many traders thought was overdue following the recent
sustained rise. The July futures position in New York, which ended last week
at a three-year peak of 12.54 cents a lb, slipped to 11.75 cents at one
point before recovering to 12.13 cents in late trading yesterday. Traders
said the market was still supported by supply tightness and bullish chart
patterns.
Yesterday traders in New York were encouraged by a newspaper report that
Cuban sugar mills had been operating at less than half their capacity in the
middle of this month. Attention has been focussed on Cuba by hopeful sugar
bulls since it was hit two weeks ago by the storms that swept the eastern
seaboard of the US. The earlier stages in this year's price rise were
chiefly influenced by drought-induced cuts in Thai crop forecasts - down
from the initial 5m tonnes to 3.51m, which would be the lowest level for
five years.
The cocoa market had a see-sawing week that ended with the May position
exactly in the middle of its Pounds 24 trading range at Pounds 687 a tonne,
down Pounds 10 on balance. It started with a sharpish retreat in response to
the failure of last week's attempt to negotiate an International Cocoa
Agreement with economic clauses. That fall was recovered in mid-week before
the downtrend was renewed yesterday. A forecast by London trader Gill &amp;
Duffus of a 118,000-tonnes production deficit in the 1992-93 season did
little to support the market.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Pit stop on the way to the market: Despite this week's coal
plan, the UK government remains committed to a free market in energy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fact that it took Mr Michael Heseltine nearly twice as long as he hoped
to devise his rescue plan for the pits shows that UK energy policy remains
the passion-rousing tangle of competing interests it always was.
But does the blandly titled 150-page document The Prospects for Coal, which
the UK trade and industry secretary finally came up with on Thursday, point
the way to a better energy policy for Britain, or does it merely make the
tangle even worse by trying to keep alive struggling coal mines?
Historians will probably conclude that the white paper was only a brief
hiatus in the drive by successive Conservative governments to transfer the
whole energy industry to the private sector - and there let market forces
have their way. Anyone tempted to think that the coal crisis might have
deflected the government from its free-market objectives need read no
further than page three of the white paper.
'Competitive markets provide the best means of ensuring that the nation has
access to secure, diverse and sustainable supplies of energy in the forms
that people and businesses want, and at competitive prices.'
Sure, government has a role to play, but the main one is 'encouraging the
development of competition'. There is virtually nothing in Mr Heseltine's
plan which interferes with these long-term objectives. British Coal is still
to be shrunk to a commercial size and privatised.
Two of coal's chief competitors, nuclear power and natural gas, are
unaffected. The deregulation of the electricity market is to continue. All
that has changed is the timetable: it may now take a few years longer, but
the danger of a further political backlash diminishes as the coal industry
is whittled down.
Coal may have touched the country's heart-strings, but so far as Whitehall
is concerned it remains a dirty and costly fuel which has to justify its
existence. The lack of radical measures in the white paper may even have
surprised some Heseltine-watchers who believed him to belong to the more
interventionist wing of the Tory party.
But if his proposals really amount only to a pause on the way to the free
market, his biggest task remains to convince sceptics that such a market is
achievable and makes the best sense for Britain. None of the UK's EC
partners has set itself that policy objective; virtually all of them
subsidise energy in one way or another. Indeed, Mr Heseltine's proposal in
the white paper to set up an Energy Advisory Panel to help the government
draw up an annual energy report is a concession to the public's instinctive
sense that government needs to keep an overseeing eye on the nation's energy
balance.
There is also a strong current of opinion which believes that privatising
coal in present market conditions would be unfair: it would have to compete
against other fuels which are bolstered by monopolies and subsidies. The
long time horizons needed to keep pits in business handicap them against
fuel, sources such as gas, which can be developed quickly.
So if Mr Heseltine's aim of privatising coal is to have any credibility he
will have to move on smartly to the next items on his energy free market
agenda.
The first and most urgent is nuclear power; the white paper promises to
accelerate a review of nuclear power which was originally scheduled for next
year. This state-owned industry still receives large sums of money levied
from energy users to help it pay for the cost of decommissioning retired
nuclear plant. And it will continue to receive it for five years more.
Although there is a strong case on commercial grounds for cutting nuclear
power because of its enormous costs, it enjoys considerable support in
government circles because of its long-term potential. Provided the
technology can be made sound, it could become the cheapest form of power
generation in the next century - and environmentally the cleanest at least
in terms of emissions.
If Mr Heseltine believes in these long-term benefits he might be forced to
conclude from the forthcoming review that the cost of helping nuclear was
worth it. This would be ironical given the fate of the pits, but the
difference is that Mr Heseltine is no believer in the long-term benefits of
coal.
The second is the electricity generation industry. The widespread
dissatisfaction with the concentration of power in England and Wales in the
hands of the two generators, National Power and PowerGen, will have to be
addressed before long. It may even be a necessary prelude to privatising
British Coal, because investors will be wary of placing their money in the
company after seeing from the present crisis just how vulnerable it is to
the generators' duopoly. British Coal will need a market that has more than
two clients.
So far, Mr Heseltine has left the question of whether to call a monopoly
investigation to Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator.
And he has said he needs more time to decide. If Mr Heseltine wanted to
reinforce his belief in a free energy market, he might well feel tempted to
call for one himself.
There is also a new factor in energy policy which will have a growing
influence on the energy balance: the environment. The introduction of a
household fuel tax in Mr Norman Lamont's Budget was a brave step given the
battle to save coal. But it marks the beginning of what is likely to be a
long-term trend to increase fuel taxation and force through greater energy
efficiency. Other countries such as Germany and the US have also recently
overcome long-term resistance to the idea and proposed similar measures.
All this needs to be seen against the background of last year's Rio Earth
Summit and the commitments made there by the industrial nations to reduce
their carbon emissions. Eventually, this could lead to an internationally
agreed carbon tax, though it is not yet clear how this could come about.
The environmental factor is likely to give a fresh impetus to government
interference in the energy sector. Taxation will have to be slanted to
encourage use of the cleanest fuels, regulation will have to be strengthened
to cut emissions, and subsidies may even have to be provided to help
essential industries clean up their acts.
At the moment the most one can realistically look ahead is about five years.
By 1998 the UK could have a tiny privatised coal industry producing fewer
than 40m tonnes a year (less than half recent levels). Several coal-fired
stations would have been closed down, and the remaining ones would be
investing heavily in equipment to reduce carbon and sulphur.
Alongside these there would be a flourishing new sector of more than a dozen
power stations burning natural gas (compared to only two now). The generator
duopoly would have been broken up into three, possibly four, companies.
Nuclear Electric might have been split into two: one half comprising new,
commercially-viable nuclear stations (possibly ripe for privatisation), the
other half still in state hands consisting of old, soon-to-be-retired
stations with their huge clean-up costs.
On the fringes, there would be a growing number of 'green' power sources
such as wind and tidal, but their contribution would be symbolic rather than
substantial. All this assumes the government makes rapid progress - and even
then the state would be involved through nuclear power and its efforts to
swing energy in an environmental direction.
The banner of free enterprise continues to adorn the government's energy
policy, but Mr Heseltine still has a long road to tread.

FT  27 MAR 93 / When terror takes a toll: How international tourist
destinations are affected by political violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, NIKKI TAIT and MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year ago, the Cairo Sheraton hotel was 75 per cent full. This month, 41
per cent of its rooms are occupied. Some Cairo hotels are just over a third
full. One five-star hotel is charging only Dollars 28 a room.
The Gama'a al-Islamiyya, the Islamic militant group which is seeking to
destabilise the Egyptian government, has deliberately targeted the country's
tourist industry. Late last year, gunmen shot at tour buses in Upper Egypt,
killing one British visitor. Earlier this year, two visitors were killed
when a bomb exploded in a cafe in Cairo's Tahrir Square.
Mr Fouad Sultan, the tourism minister, says earnings are down by a fifth on
last year. Many in the industry consider that an underestimate. The tourist
ministry has hired Burson-Marsteller, the world's biggest public relations
company, and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi to help improve the country's image.
While terrorism and the murder of foreign visitors can substantially damage
a nation's tourism, the effect differs widely from country to country. As
Egypt agonises over how to salvage its fastest growing industry and biggest
foreign currency earner, the tourist businesses of other countries have been
largely unaffected by terrorist and criminal violence.
Third world destinations appear to suffer more than developed countries from
attacks on tourists. Kenyan tourism was badly hit last year as a result of
publicity surrounding the trial of two game rangers accused of the murder of
British tourist Julie Ward in 1988, and by reports of other attacks on
tourists.
By contrast, the murder of a British visitor in Florida last year had little
effect on the state's tourism. Thomson, the UK's biggest travel group, said
that while the depreciation of the pound against the dollar had deterred
some British travellers, reports of violence had little effect.
Similarly, Egyptian tourism has been much more severely affected by
terrorist incidents than the industries in the UK or the US. Despite years
of widely-reported deaths and injuries from IRA bombs, the British tourist
industry has suffered little long-term damage. Mr Alan Jefferson, the
British Tourist Authority's international marketing director, says his
offices abroad usually receive no more than a handful of calls after IRA
attacks. One New York travel agent said that, while some US tourists about
to leave for the UK had asked about recent IRA bombs, they had decided to go
ahead with their trips.
The UK tourist industry has been more severely affected by events elsewhere.
The US bombing of Libya in 1986 contributed to a 4 per cent fall in visitors
to 13.9m, as Americans, fearing terrorist reprisals, stayed at home. The
Gulf War resulted in tourists to the UK falling to 16.7m in 1991, from 18m
the year before.
In the US, the bombing of New York's World Trade Centre last month produced
'no significant cancellations', according to the city's Convention and
Visitors Bureau. Airlines servicing the New York area also say that there
has been very little impact on passenger traffic.
The National Parks Service reports that the number of visitors to New York
attractions such as the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island ran at about
3,500-4,000 daily during February, a typical number for the month.
While tourist destinations such as Egypt and Kenya might feel they are the
victims of double standards, travel industry executives say they suffer from
a perception that they are societies under siege. The futures of the US and
British governments are not perceived as being threatened by violent crime
or terrorism.
Although the IRA has bombed areas frequented by tourists, foreign visitors
to the UK have not been specific targets as they have in Egypt. Mr Peter
Kerkar, chief executive of Cox &amp; Kings Travel, a London-based company,
argues that American visitors to the UK are behaving quite logically in
ignoring IRA attacks but staying at home during the Gulf War and in the wake
of the bombing of Libya. 'The IRA is not singling out Americans. If they're
involved in an IRA incident, it's because of bad luck. In the case of Libya,
Americans were a target.'
One British travel industry manager points out that Florida, while plagued
by violent crime, offers tourists a sense of safety, however illusory, that
countries such as Kenya and Egypt do not. 'America is familiar territory,
where everyone speaks the same language and where half the TV programmes are
the ones you see at home.'
Mr Martin Brackenbury, president of the International Federation of Tour
Operators, says there are a few general principles which countries can apply
when attempting to limit the damage caused to tourism by violence. 'The
first is: never attempt to cover up. Clearly admit a problem if there is
one. The second is to put in place measures which can clearly be seen to be
effective,' he says.
He says Kenya has responded constructively to Ifto recommendations. The
Kenyan government has begun aerial surveillance of game parks and has issued
advice about which areas of Nairobi are considered dangerous.
Mr Martin Thompson, managing director of the London-based tour operator
Abercrombie &amp; Kent, says his business to Kenya fell to 30,000 travellers
last year from 34,000 in 1991 as a result of press coverage of violence in
the country. However, he expects business to return to 1991 levels this
year.
The Egyptian authorities, after initially criticising the western media for
what it described as a biased, exaggerated campaign, is now taking active
steps to restore the country's image. It has supplied more tourist police,
troops and helicopters to protect visitors at sites in Upper Egypt.
Both the government and the country's tourism industry are now hoping that
this iron-fisted policy will stem the terrorist attacks. Mr Taher el-Sharif,
chairman of the Egyptian Businessman's Association says: 'The problem is we
just don't know when this will stop - unlike the Gulf War, when we knew
there would eventually be an end.'
Mr Brackenbury says that once a destination is perceived as being safer,
recovery for the tourist industry can be swift. 'People's memories are
short,' he says.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Letter: Health and safety burden beyond EC directives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRYAN CASSIDY MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You report that 'more than half UK companies are not complying with six
health and safety laws which came into force on January 1' ('Companies 'fail
to meet' EC health laws', March 23). It is hardly surprising. The Health and
Safety Commission failed to publish the texts of some of the new UK
regulations until December 1992 - eg, Personal Protective Equipment at Work
Regulations 1992, Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992,
Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1992.
Another reason for their failure to comply is that many will have realised
that the UK regulations impose burdens on UK companies that go much further
than the requirements of the EC directives.

<TEXT>
Sir, When reading John Hopkins ('Pride of Lions with an English accent',
March 20) explaining his choice for the British Lions - with only two
Irishmen in a squad that would include 21 Englishmen - I must confess I
thought him slightly arrogant, especially as he said his selection was
'strictly on merit'.
Later that day, after Ireland beat England 17-3, I realised it was a
leg-pull, so I apologise to him for my earlier unworthy thought.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Letter: Few companies are interested in the merits of older
people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From SHARIF LONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read Marc Thompson's letter on the merits of employing staff over 45
(March 17) and would like to add some comments.
All the positive aspects of hiring 'older' staff disappear when the American
attitudes of budget constraints have to be taken into consideration.
Somebody with a doctorate, a few years' experience and who is still under 30
and willing to start for a salary which is within the budget targets is what
all the personnel managers are after. Hardly any companies are interested in
the merits of older people.
And then there is the psychological handicap. In professions and cultures
where confidence and achievements come with maturity, this may be easier to
face, but in the society that reflects American aspirations - youth appears
to be everything. What happens to them when the waist thickens even
slightly, or the pace slows down. . .
I see companies where grey hair in the management meetings is becoming a
rarity. You need to look smart, young and slim.
Lacking any of these characteristics may not be a great asset for your
career.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Letter: Why consumers need financial advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL SWAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your coverage of the two reports from the Office of Fair Trading and
its reactions to the Securities and Investments Board rules on investment
regulation (March 19 and March 22) have not addressed the full implications
of this further blow against the independent financial adviser.
The OFT is rightly concerned with the interests of the consumer, but it is
difficult to see how these interests are best served by the extermination of
the IFA as a species.
Insurance has been described as a very simple business made complicated by
insurance practitioners. While consumers are growing in sophistication, it
is doubtful if their sophistication and the insurance industry's
de-mystification are converging rapidly enough to make professional
financial advice redundant.
Of course the question is, who pays for this advice and how much? The
industry does not believe that it can justify its distribution costs - hence
the opposition to disclosure.
The trouble is that customer resistance makes life insurance a very
expensive commodity to sell. It is ironic that the less the customer wants
the product the more he ends up paying when finally persuaded to buy. So why
not simply leave the customer alone to buy or not if he feels the urge?
No one can justify hiding from customers the cost of advice, but perhaps the
life insurance industry, and the OFT could do more to educate the public
into an appreciation of the value of such advice.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Pressure of people to test the west: Migration has focused
attention on soaring world population
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industrialised countries will be confronted with an unprecedented influx of
would-be immigrants in the next few decades, putting their economies under
enormous pressure. That is the message delivered by Mrs Nafis Sadik,
director of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), to the UN conference
on European population this week in Geneva.
More than 2m immigrants are believed to have entered both Europe and North
America over the past two years alone. While Poland, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia have so far taken the brunt of Russians, gypsies and
Romanians from the east, political chaos in Russia could intensify westward
migration. This is quite apart from the pressures from the south, Mrs Sadik
warned.
Migration, many UN officials and economists in Geneva argued, would be the
factor spurring industrialised countries to pay more attention to the
world's soaring population. Prince Charles pointed out that at last June's
Earth Summit in Rio, the link between numbers of people and destruction of
the natural environment was conspicuous by its absence from the agenda.
The Vatican's resistance to including population in the talks was
unsurprising, but the Philippines and some Middle Eastern countries with
high birth rates also proved obstructive. Environmental pressure groups,
wary of telling developing countries how to manage their affairs, were also
quiet.
Such reticence is difficult to understand in the light of UN population
projections - one puts the world's population at 11bn in 2050, double its
present 5.5bn, before it stabilises. Mr Miroslav Macura, demographer with
the UN Economic Commission for Europe, reminded the conference that the
total 'could be anywhere from 5bn to 20bn' if fertility rates turned out to
differ even marginally from the model's assumptions.
Nearly 95 per cent of the projected rise will come from developing
countries, despite the considerable success of many Asian and Latin American
countries in bringing down the rate of population growth in the past two
decades.
India now has a fertility rate of about 4 - the average number of children
per woman implied by the current birth rate - a fall of about a third in the
last two decades. China, after its ferocious policy of curbing family size,
has a rate of about 2.4, though that is still above the two children per
woman which maintains a static population.
But across much of sub-Saharan Africa, fertility rates have been running at
more than 6. Recent studies, although based on less than perfect data,
suggest the Aids epidemic is cutting only 1 percentage point off population
growth. Ethiopia, despite recurrent famine, still has a fertility rate of
about 3.
According to Mr Fred Sai, president of the International Planned Parenthood
Federation and chairman of Ghana's population council, African countries now
recognise that family planning is a tool for health improvement. But the
answers to restraining a high growth rate of population are not clear-cut.
Recent evidence shows that the traditional assumption that family size falls
with economic progress does not always hold true. Sri Lanka, Thailand,
Bulgaria and Kerala in India have all shown sharp falls in family size
despite relatively low prosperity, while the Gulf states have maintained
fertility rates of more than 3 during a period of sharply rising wealth.
'For every level of prosperity, you can find an enormous range of fertility
rates,' said Mr David Coleman from Oxford University. 'The things that
really bring down family size are more complex, to do with culture and
education'.
Contraceptive programmes do help though, the UNFPA, maintains: it called
last week for the present total of Dollars 4.5bn spent worldwide on family
planning programmes to double by 2000.
But even if such measures are successful, the population of developing
countries will continue to surge ahead that of industralised countries.
Fertility rates in western Europe now average only about 1.7 children per
woman - the UK rate is 1.8. Italy and Spain have rates of only 1.2, below
West German levels of 1.4, according to Ms Charlotte Hohn director of the
Federal Population Institute of Germany.
The result is that pensioners will soon outnumber children in Europe and
North America for the first time, the UNFPA said. Under-15s currently
outnumber the elderly by a third in Europe and North America. But the number
of people older than 60 has risen from 90m in 1950 to 185m today, and could
reach 310m in 2025.
The idea that any resulting labour gap could be filled by immigration is
disputed. Mr Coleman argued that 'only about 60 per cent of the potential
workforce in western Europe is actually working, and there is plenty of
slack.'
Past immigration can adversely affect the host country, he added. The
availability of cheap labour may be one factor behind Europe's relative lack
of investment in high-technology industries, he said.
It is clear from west European delegates that the increasing pressures of
migration are likely to prompt a tightening of frontiers to try to preserve
standards of living for their own citizens. But if the arguments that Europe
does not need immigrants to maintain prosperity are right, its cultural urge
to shut the doors may not have adverse economic consequences.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Letter: Where a deflationary market is not a new experience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From M J PRITCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan's article (Economic Viewpoint, March 25) is the first
reference I have noticed in the press to the possibility of deflation.
As we are in the business of acquiring industrial land, placing building
contracts and undertaking transactions on commercial properties, we have
been working in a deflationary market since 1990.
We regularly receive tenders for building contracts and, without exception,
the prices are now generally back to 1986 levels. Even building materials
have fallen back to mid-1980s prices. Coincidentally, when one of our main
clients, Sheffield Insulations, announced its year-end results (UK Company
News, March 25), it was interesting to see that its statement formally
acknowledges material price deflation.
The only inflation which my household witnesses is of staple commodities
such as food and clothes, in addition to - somewhat surprisingly in the
recession-hit south-east - school fees.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was surprised to see that one of the charts used by the chancellor in
his Budget broadcast showed interest rates declining steadily from 14 per
cent to the current level of 6 per cent. I am sure that it is an episode he
would rather forget, but I seem to remember a 'blip' to this declining trend
in mid-September last year.
Creating history in terms of record levels of unemployment, record length of
recession, record speed in breaking election pledges, and most rapid exit
from the ERM is all very well, but re-writing history is another matter
altogether. Politicians may see it as their role to manipulate facts, but we
cannot allow them to change the truth, however painful it may be.

FT  27 MAR 93 / An instinct for survival: Yeltsin's opponents have been
wrong-footed this week while he has kept popular support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Boris Yeltsin had won much by the time he strode into the Grand Kremlin
Palace yesterday morning. This week, he had managed to steer a fairly
consistent course while all about him disappeared up to their necks.
In the many opinion polls which have appeared in the past few days, the
Russian president has consistently scored near or more than 50 per cent on
any question which contrasts his actions with those of his rivals in
parliament. In spite of the obvious economic misery of the country - high
inflation, falling living standards, vast gulfs between the poor majority
and the conspicuously wealthy tiny minority - Mr Yeltsin appears largely to
have kept a popular base.
It is true that nearly all the mass media are either controlled by, or are
loyal to, him; and that no single contender is directly challenging him. But
Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, his press secretary, was probably right to claim
yesterday that the opposition to the president had been wrong-footed by the
'wave of popular support'.
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, certainly seems to have
been wrong-footed. He switched from 'the case for impeachment of the
president is as clear as day' on Tuesday, to 'frankly speaking, I'm no
supporter of impeaching the president', on Thursday. Yesterday, his rhetoric
when opening the Congress was muted. In contrast to the blistering
off-the-cuff attack he made in the last Congress two weeks ago, this speech
was read, stumblingly, from notes. Mr Khasbulatov now has many colleagues in
parliament who want to shift him from his post: he, not Mr Yeltsin, may be
the largest political victim of this week.
The chairman of the Constitutional Court, Mr Valery Zorkin, has fared almost
as badly. He, too, began the week with a flurry of rhetoric, following Mr
Yeltsin's weekend appeal to the people, pre-judging the decision of his own
court. The judgment, that the president had violated the constitution in
some dozen places, was said by a court official to be 'mild' only because it
did not call for his impeachment - an index of how politicised and
extra-judicial the court is expected to be. Mr Zorkin appeared in Congress
yesterday, still playing the politician, with a 10-point compromise
programme which gave Mr Yeltsin much of what he wanted and decried
impeachment as a dangerous move.
In the four days between Mr Yeltsin's speech and the publication of the
decree which gave it legal force, it was widely said he had watered it down.
The phrase 'special powers', which he had said he was assuming, does not
appear in his speech: but the mechanism for ruling by decree was set out. It
consists of forbidding parliament to countermand his decrees and
instructions unless the Constitutional Court judges them unconstitutional.
He has already started shunting out decrees at a great rate.
What the gap between speech and publication of decree did accomplish was to
flush out his opponents. As Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the deputy prime minister
who is the grandmaster of the president's strategy, said on Thursday
evening, they betrayed their weakness by taking an extreme position -
impeachment - then being unable to muster sufficient votes to execute it. Mr
Shakhrai sees himself as General Kutuzov to Mr Yeltsin's Tsar Alexander,
drawing the Napoleonic armies deeper and deeper into Russia, fooling them
with apparent victories, only to force them to retreat when their supply
lines ran out.
Finally, Mr Yeltsin has - at least he believes he has - given his government
a clear space within which to operate. On Thursday, Mr Boris Fyodorov, now
the head of economic reform in the cabinet, laid out a scenario which would
restart the long-stalled radical reform.
Thus, yesterday, among the accusations of treachery was the clear rustle of
the suits for peace being handed in to the presidential office. His
strongest case - that he wishes to put, at a popular vote on April 25, his
own presidency and a draft constitution to the people - has won because of
its essential simplicity.
It is important that Mr Yeltsin wins, for it is important that a coherent
source of power attempts to govern Russia. But his victory - if that is what
it turns out to be - must be qualified by three serious considerations.
First, if he does win the right to proceed with political and economic
reform, this is only the beginning. He must in record time shape a
constitution (whose fundamentals, he said, would not differ from a draft
already approved by the Sixth Congress of Peoples' Deputies six months ago);
he must support an economic programme which will, or should, bring real
pain; he must find some rational settlement to the contradictory demands of
the republics and regions in Russia.
Second, he is not going to get too much help from abroad, in spite of
western rhetoric on this score: the Russian president rather bitterly
reflected in his speech yesterday that one of his mistakes had been to
over-estimate foreign aid. The Group of Seven countries will repackage the
kind of sums they were putting up last year, not extend them: they will seek
to target them at more publicly obvious projects, and will probably give
substantial debt relief. This could be very valuable, but at bottom, Russia
is, as ever, on its own.
Finally, Mr Yeltsin has taken a good deal of power into his own hands. He is
likely to make some kind of compromise, but it does not appear that he will
have to retreat too far. Can he be trusted?
Perhaps more to the point, can Mr Yeltsin trust himself? If he wins the
struggle over the division of powers and becomes indisputably the first in
the state, he will be under great pressure to adopt tougher authoritarian
measures to push through reform and to quell discontent. Mr Khasbulatov's
consistent complaint that there is now a greater threat of monopoly of power
is wholly correct, though he spoilt it by being so obviously in pursuit of a
95 per cent share.
In the end, it all depends on Mr Yeltsin's instincts. The past week has
shown that nothing is yet in place - no party structure, no parliamentary
structure, no court structure - which can be a strong enough safety net for
failing democratic institutions. His instincts have been good so far: it
must be hoped they stay that way.

FT  27 MAR 93 / The dangers of drift: G7 attitudes to the Russian crisis

Most leading industrial countries are clear that they want Mr Boris Yeltsin
to remain in control of the reins of power. What is less evident to them,
however, is what he will do with them.
There is now relative confidence that Mr Yeltsin will stay on. The doubts
centre on whether his struggles with parliament will leave him capable of
executing reforms. As one British official put it yesterday: 'The danger is
more of drift than of civil war . . . It looks as if he will survive. But he
needs to survive in an effective form to do something.'
Germany yesterday signalled relief that Mr Yeltsin appeared to be gaining
ground. Bonn officials see the alternative group supporting Mr Ruslan
Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, as incoherent and irresponsible.
They also believe that Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president, has lost
support, and lacks the popular base to be an alternative president.
German officials say the Group of Seven countries is moving towards a
three-part plan to aid Moscow - the first element of which would be to speed
up releasing all the cash in the Dollars 24bn package agreed last summer.
'That silly question of supporting Yeltsin or democracy does not exist,' one
Bonn official said yesterday. 'The government programme is going in the
right direction. Yeltsin has a strong team. These people do have a coherent
programme. They are driving towards a market economy and more democracy.'
In Washington, a fierce public debate has centred on one question. Is
President Bill Clinton staking too much on the survival of Mr Yeltsin, just
as Mr George Bush put too much faith in Mr Mikhail Gorbachev?
Mr Clinton says the US supports Mr Yeltsin because he is 'the first elected
Russian president in 1,000 years', and because economic and political
reform, however halting, has been launched under his leadership.
But the US adds that its investment is in the reform process ('with or
without Yeltsin' as Mr Clinton put it) because, without reform, there will
be no post-cold war peace dividend at home. The administration knows the US
cannot, of its own accord, keep Mr Yeltsin in power. But the White House
recognises that if he is toppled, it will get some of the blame, much as
'Who lost China?' and 'Who lost Iran?' were dominant questions 40 and 14
years ago.
In Paris, the foreign ministry believes Mr Yeltsin has enough popular
support to win his referendum and face down the Congress. But, like the US,
France is emphasising its backing for democracy and economic reform, rather
than solely for the Russian president.
Mr Roland Dumas, the outgoing foreign minister, has been trying to hang on
to his parliamentary seat ahead of tomorrow's second round of French
legilsative elections. But he expressed confidence on Wednesday that Mr
Yeltsin was still in control, and that the army would not intervene.
On the question of new western aid, French officials believe the west should
return to the ambitious plan worked out by ex-Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar.
Stabilisation of the rouble should be left to the IMF which, they admit, has
so far had little success in imposing monetary discipline on the Russian
central bank - more under the influence of Congress than that of Mr Yeltsin.
The G7 member showing most indifference to Mr Yeltsin's fate is Japan.
Rather than being seen as the saviour of Russian democracy, Mr Yeltsin has
earned distrust for his perceived belligerence over the Kurile Islands,
occupied by the Soviet army in 1945.
Mr Yeltsin was once called a 'liar' by Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign
minister, for his allegedly inconsistent statements on the Kuriles. There
would be few tears in Tokyo if the Russian president, after his high-wire
balancing act, came a cropper after all.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Man in the News: A bold leap into the Big Blue - Lou
Gerstner / The appointment of a new boss at IBM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON, LOUISE KEHOE, NIKKI TAIT and ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fate of the world's largest high-technology company - ailing
International Business Machines - was yesterday entrusted to a man who knows
plenty about selling cigarettes, crackers and credit cards, but who is no
computer expert.
IBM announced that its two-month search for a new chief executive had ended
with the appointment of 51-year-old Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman of R J R
Nabisco, the cigarettes and food business, and former president of American
Express. He will succeed Mr John Akers, who is stepping down early because
of the company's poor financial performance.
Mr Gerstner takes on one of the hardest jobs in corporate America - turning
around a company which has been synonymous with US industrial might for the
past 30 years but is now floundering for direction, with an entrenched
bureaucratic culture which responds too slowly to the pace of change in the
information technology industry.
In choosing Mr Gerstner, the IBM board is taking two gambles. The first is
that the company's problems can be fixed by a new broom - a 'change agent'
in the fashionable management jargon - who comes not only from outside the
company, but from outside the computer industry too.
The second is that Mr Gerstner is the right agent of change, for while he is
often described as one of America's best managers, his track record at R J R
is mixed.
Some American observers argue that IBM's main problem is a lack of
technological vision, which Mr Gerstner will find hard to provide. But
others maintain the company's difficulties stem from weak management, which
he may correct.
Mr James Burke, the director who headed IBM's search, indicated yesterday
that the board took the latter view. 'The company is not run as much like a
business as it needs to be,' he said, pointing out that technological
know-how was only one of eleven qualities the board listed as desirable.
Others included 'unusual leader with immediate credibility' and
'customer-oriented'.
Mr Gerstner, the son of a distribution manager for a New York brewing
company, took an MBA at Harvard and spent his early career at management
consultants McKinsey &amp; Co before joining American Express.
It was there that he made his name as a clever strategist who played a
crucial role in revitalising the credit card business. He eventually became
heir-apparent to Mr James Robinson, the chief executive ousted in a
boardroom coup earlier this year. 'The best young manager I've ever seen,'
one eminent non-executive director of American Express once said of him.
But in March 1989, possibly frustrated at playing second fiddle to Mr
Robinson, Mr Gerstner accepted one of the most enticing business challenges
of the day - to shake up poorly performing R J R Nabisco, which had just
been acquired by management buy-out specialists Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts in
the biggest and most ferocious takeover bid of the 1980s.
Mr Gerstner slashed R J R's bloated cost structure and quickly sold off some
Dollars 6bn of peripheral assets to help reduce the buy-out's Dollars 30bn
debt burden. The company's borrowings are now down to a manageable Dollars
14bn, thanks to a series of refinancings.
This experience will be invaluable in tackling one of IBM's most pressing
problems - the excess fat which still afflicts the group. Despite numerous
rounds of job cuts, observers reckon IBM may still need to cut its 300,000
work-force by up to 100,000.
Furthermore, Mr Gerstner's personality, and status as an outsider, should
help him revive a stifling, inbred corporate culture in which decisions are
too often made to protect individuals or groups rather than to increase
competitiveness.
He is a stocky, round-faced, impatient man who elicits considerable loyalty
from staff despite sometimes seeming insensitive. 'His insensitivity is
going to be a problem at IBM,' says an old friend, 'because there are a lot
of teddy bears who like to be hugged.' In his first year at R J R he
travelled more than 150,000 miles, talking to people at all levels of the
company, and he is likely to bring a similarly down-to-earth approach to
IBM, where insiders often complain about the remoteness of top management.
Additionally, his preference for setting broad strategy but then delegating
responsibility down the line is likely to fit well with IBM's own devolution
programme, implemented by Mr Akers a year ago.
This involves its various businesses acting increasingly independently - and
possibly being spun off altogether - while the chief executive's role
becomes, in Mr Akers's phrase, that of a 'portfolio manager' allocating cash
and managing central services.
But while Mr Gerstner's cost-cutting credentials seem good, there is less
certainty about his ability to expand a business over the long term. In the
three full years since the buy-out, R J R's operating profits have been flat
at about Dollars 2.9bn.
Tobacco is the larger of R J R's two divisions and makes a handsome return
on sales. However, with cigarette consumption on a slow but relentless
decline in the core US market, the game is all about grabbing market share.
Here, R J R's record has not been impressive. According to Mr John Maxwell
at analysts Wheat, First, Butcher, &amp; Singer, the company's total share of
the US cigarette market has slipped from 31.8 per cent in 1988 to 28.8 per
cent last year, while its arch-rival, Philip Morris, has moved from 39.3 per
cent to 42.3 per cent.
On the food side, the story is similar, albeit more cheerful. At home,
Nabisco has generally clung on to its chunky market shares in the biscuit
and snacks markets. But it had to cope with a slowdown in US consumer
spending; a squeeze by retailers; and a price war. Increased marketing
support has been needed and profit growth has been slow.
In short, there have been successes and failures and the prevailing view is
that much has yet to be proven. 'Mr Gerstner created a strategic plan and is
probably more than a third of the way through,' says Mr Barry Ziegler,
analyst at A G Edwards. 'But now he's leaving in mid-stream.'
One of his toughest tasks at IBM, given his non-computer background, may be
articulating a new sense of strategic and technological direction. The
company has clung for far too long to the bulky mainframe computer, and its
own proprietary software, while the world around it has moved to much
greater reliance on desktop models arranged in networks and using standard
software. IBM still has to decide its role in the computer industry of the
1990s, and then dispose of those parts of the business which do not fit.
This involves placing tough technological bets.
Still, Mr Gerstner is not a complete technological novice and he has a
reputation as a very rapid learner and a man who surrounds himself with
good, diverse lieutenants. He took a degree in engineering, and sits (or did
until yesterday) on the board of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph. At American
Express, one of the world's most sophisticated users of information
technology, he was the moving force behind the development of an important
new computer system. 'He really likes this stuff', says an old colleague.
He also has an invaluable, intimate adviser in his brother Richard, who ran
IBM's personal computer business and Asian operations before retiring
recently because of ill-health.
IBM itself is hardly short of technological talent. The challenge for Mr
Gerstner is to tap it effectively. A popular move, inside the company and
the computer industry generally, would be for Mr Gerstner to appoint
well-respected technologist Mr James Cannavino as group president,
succeeding Mr Jack Kuehler, who will retire this year. Mr Cannavino
currently heads IBM's personal systems division - the personal computer and
computer workstation businesses.
By pairing the two men, IBM could achieve a balance between hard-driven
'portfolio management' and technological vision.
There is a successful precedent for the leap Mr Gerstner is making. Ten
years ago, Mr John Sculley, then chief executive of Pepsi-Cola, amazed the
business world by joining Apple Computer, which after a bumpy patch has
become one of the world's most successful personal computer companies.
However, in an interview some years ago Mr Sculley said he felt it essential
for the head of such a company to have a clear grasp of technological
directions and acknowledged that it took him several years before he felt
confident in this respect.
At IBM the issues are bigger and more complex than at Apple, and Mr Gerstner
does not have the luxury of a long learning curve. The crisis requires rapid
action.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Leading Article: A question of confidence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLIER THIS week the results of a Gallup poll suggested that only 18 per
cent of the British people thought that the chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont,
was doing a good job. It is tempting to conclude, on that basis, that he
must be doing a great deal that is right. But if his intention in the Budget
was to inspire enough confidence to underpin a solid economic recovery, the
conclusion has to be mixed.
Mr Lamont's case for deferring rises in taxation until 1994-95 was that by
delaying the increased flow of revenue into the exchequer's coffers, he
would allow the recovery to take a firm hold. There might, perhaps, have
been something in this hypothesis if the proposed tax increases were levied
on the kind of consumption goods that people could be relied on to buy
sooner, in anticipation of higher taxes. But the controversial increase in
VAT on fuel and power gives a bigger incentive to emigrate than to bring
forward spending decisions: no one turns up the heat to escape next year's
tax increase.
The more likely response of the British public to Mr Lamont's deferred shock
therapy may be to batten down the financial hatches before the fiscal
onslaught next year. The chancellor has thus been left, potentially, with
the worst of both worlds. The verdict of Gallup hints that confidence
remains fragile, while the markets still worry about the jump in the public
sector borrowing requirement before fiscal stringency makes its mark on the
figures.
It follows from all this that the recent sprinkling of modestly encouraging
statistics has to be treated with considerable care. The improvement in
retail spending figures might not survive such a Budget; and the sharp
upturn in new mortgage figures remains, as yet, a one-month phenomenon. The
surprise fall in the unemployment figures continues, meantime, to baffle
officials and economists one week after the event.
Escape route
That said, the incipient recovery, unlike most of its postwar predecessors
will not - indeed, should not - be consumer driven. The only plausible
escape route from the present recession is one which is led by manufacturing
output and exports. The upturn will thus look and feel unfamiliar, and will
no doubt confound the forecasters once again.
Consider the obvious potential sources of demand in the upturn. Clearly the
public finances will not permit the government to drive the recovery. A
senior Treasury mandarin told the Treasury select committee on Wednesday
that the Budget tax increases might not be enough to eliminate the
structural element of the fiscal deficit. So that's official.
Nor is the consumer in a position to spend as in earlier recoveries.
Personal sector debt more than doubled in the 1980s as a percentage of
disposable income. While the cuts in interest rates since last September
have reduced the debt-servicing burden and helped reduce the rate of fall in
house prices, it is far from clear that the Budget Red Book's optimism about
a possible rise in prices and turnover later this year is justified.
Housing slump
The ratio of house prices to earnings is admittedly back below its average
for the past 25 years. But the relationship may have reflected a speculative
demand for houses that no longer exists in a market where many owners have
negative equity in their homes. Equally important, the peculiar British
practice of lending up to 100 per cent of value on the security of houses
relies on the readiness of insurance companies to provide cover for the top
slice of the loan.
Insurance companies that have incurred heavy losses in housing are now
obliged to demand more realistic premiums. That suggests that home buyers
may have to save for longer to put down larger deposits in future. The
housing market may thus play a smaller role in this recovery in the past,
although the damper on demand will be less noticeable in the north, where
the housing market was less frenetic. And unlike the early 1980s, there are
no credit controls to remove to provide an alternative expansionary impetus.
The only plausible motor for recovery, then, is output. And here the
Confederation of British Industry's latest survey of industrial trends
offers encouraging straws in the wind. Manufacturing industry's order books
are at their best levels since mid-1990 and manufacturers expect to increase
output over the next four months. After the devaluation of sterling last
autumn, that is just as it should be. The snag, as CBI director general Mr
Howard Davies has pointed out, is that the continental European economy is
in the doldrums.
Until the Bundesbank reduces interest rates significantly, a European upturn
will prove elusive. But with German output contracting sharply, there is a
growing expectation that rates will come down decisively in the second half
of the year. In due course the British may find themselves with a recovery
that derives its strength from the economy north of Watford. For once, the
regions may have their day.

FT  27 MAR 93 / BA prompts new Atlantic fares war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRANSATLANTIC air fares war flared up again yesterday as first British
Airways and then its rivals announced sharp cuts in tariffs.
BA cut its lowest return fare to the east coast of the United States by
Pounds 70 to Pounds 259 for travel between April 1 and June 15. The fares
are the company's lowest late-spring rates to its 21 US gateways for three
years.
The fares also apply to the airline's services from Manchester and
Birmingham, which start tomorrow. BA said: 'It's a spring seat sale. We've
got some spare capacity.'
BA's fares and conditions were soon matched by US carriers United Airlines,
American Airlines and Continental. Virgin Atlantic responded by announcing
fares to its five US gateways that are Pounds 10 less than BA's.
The price cuts come when most airlines on the congested north Atlantic
routes are struggling to make profits. Most, in spite of this, are
increasing capacity between Europe and the US.
Mr Robert Ayling, British Airways group managing director, said: 'We are
operating our biggest programme yet to the US this summer.'

FT  27 MAR 93 / Tory MPs urge help for tax-hit oil companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS growing political pressure on the government to provide
transitional relief for oil companies affected by changes to Petroleum
Revenue Tax announced in last week's Budget.
Some Conservative politicians are calling for help for smaller oil
exploration companies, which stand to lose most from the tax changes.
The government plans to reduce the rate of the tax on existing oilfields
from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and abolish it on new fields. It has also
removed the tax allowances for exploration and appraisal, which will hit the
small independent companies hardest.
The industry is split on the issue and some oil exploration companies such
as Amerada Hess have mounted intense lobbying campaigns against the tax
changes. Others, such as British Petroleum, have stressed the benefits of
the new regime.
In a written reply to a parliamentary question, the Treasury said yesterday
that: 'offshore activities deemed to be commercially viable prior to the tax
changes should be unaffected by the changes'.
But Mr George Kynoch, MP for Kincardine and Deeside, told Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, that some of the smaller companies would need transitional
relief in the move to the new regime.
'I'm making sure I convey the difficulties some companies are incurring in
the transitional period so that the chancellor can make some fine-tuning at
the committee stage,' Mr Kynoch said yesterday. He is gathering evidence
from a range of companies to present to the Treasury after the Easter
recess.
Present arrangements for the move to the new tax regime state that any
companies with outstanding contracts for drilling work will still be able to
claim exploration and appraisal relief. Many independent companies want
those arrangements not only to include firm contracts, but also obligations
for drilling programmes made to the government.

   THE MINING equipment industry faces the loss of 9,000 jobs
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
40 per cent of its workforce - because of the government's plans for the
future of the coal industry, the Association of British Mining Equipment
Companies said yesterday.
The cutting of a world-leading industry's base could cause foreign buyers to
lose confidence in its ability to maintain capacity, the association warned.
A 'disappointing' white paper offered little prospect of increased demand
for coal, it added. Mr William Morrell, association director-general, warned
that equipment manufacturers with overseas factories could also transfer
work to countries where there is an active coalfield. The UK leads the world
equipment market for longwall mining - the UK system of extracting coal in a
continuous run of 200 metres to 300 metres. Exports have risen significantly
over the past five years, accounting for about Pounds 400m of total
production worth about Pounds 900m a year.
The association warned that a sizeable and stable home market was essential
for continuing international marketing success. This was needed to finance
spending on research and development and application technology.
British Coal has traditionally been the equipment industry's principal
customer. The association said its members' state-of-the-art technology had
been a significant contributor to British Coal's 160 per cent increase in
productivity since 1986. The recent decline in the UK coal industry had
taken its toll on equipment suppliers. The association said the closure of
70 per cent of UK mines from end-1987 to end-1991 had reduced the direct
workforce by 50,000 to 22,000.
The association said yesterday that, by taking 18 pits out of production,
the government would remove one third of the suppliers' domestic market,
giving no time for companies to adapt.
The association said many companies will not be able to sustain the research
and development necessary for continued export success, adding: 'Perhaps
most importantly, the government still does not have a long-term energy
policy which makes it impossible for our industry to plan what demand is
likely to be for its products.'

FT  27 MAR 93 / TUC calls march to protest at coal decisions: Labour
launches appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TUC yesterday decided to hold a march, rally and lobby of parliament on
Monday, when MPs debate the government's coal white paper.
It could be the start of the most widespread industrial disruption
experienced in Britain for many years.
The Labour party appealed to the thousands who had protested against the pit
closure announcement in October to lobby Tory MPs, urging them to rebel
against the government in Monday's vote, although party officials conceded
privately that there was little prospect of the government being defeated.
Members of the National Union of Mineworkers intend to strike for 24 hours
next Friday in protest at the closures. Members of the RMT rail union are
due to stop work on the same day in protest over British Rail's refusal to
guarantee that there will be no compulsory redundancies in future.
The latest in a series of one-day London bus strikes will be held the same
day - bus workers' third day of strike action over wage cuts imposed before
privatisation - as well as a TUC demonstration as part of a wider European
trade union protest against unemployment.
Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM president, yesterday called on all workers to join
in the wider action in solidarity with the miners. The TUC is not doing so,
but Mr Norman Willis, its general secretary, said he hoped that the strikes
by miners and railwaymen would 'focus public attention' on the issues being
raised by the European union day of action.
Labour urged opponents of the coal white paper to contact local Conservative
MPs to persuade them not to support the government in Monday's Commons vote.
Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, issuing what he
termed 'an SOS to the nation', called on all who had 'expressed their anger
at the betrayal of the miners to do it again before 10pm on Monday'.
He added: 'The rigged market will not save the pits, but full mailbags of
Tory MPs might.'
He also released a strongly worded Labour amendment to Monday's government
motion approving the white paper, calling for existing volumes of coal
production to be maintained.
Labour intends to press for both its official amendment and an alternative
urging the adoption of the recent trade and industry select committee report
on coal to be voted on.
Some possible rebels were last night keeping their cards close to their
chest. The Batley and Spen constituency office said Ms Elizabeth Peacock,
the Conservative MP, would make up her mind how to vote after reading the
white paper this weekend. Another potential rebel said he would not vote
against the government but might abstain.
Mr Cook attacked Tory backbenchers who were already 'mouthing words of
support' for Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, saying
it was not Mr Heseltine who had 'moved' over the last five months but them.
'Any Tory MP who meant a word of the expressions of support and sentiment
they made last October cannot possibly go into the lobby and vote for this
white paper,' he said.
Mr Cook described as 'extraordinary' the government's decision not to tie
the white paper's subsidy offer to a commitment from the generators to buy
more coal. He said he suspected the Treasury's attitude was to 'hope that
very little extra coal is bought which will mean very little is spent on the
subsidy'.
But Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, last night used a speech to his local
Conservative association to say that the subsidy could be as much as up to
Pounds 500m over five years as proposed by the trade and industry committee
report.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Fishing blockade disrupts Plymouth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BLOCKADE of Plymouth Sound by about 150 fishing boats protesting against
cheap fish imports and government policy on preserving stocks was called off
last night after disrupting the port throughout the day.
The protest ended after threats of legal action from Associated British
Ports, which owns the Devon harbour and 21 other ports. ABP had said it was
'prepared to take whatever legal action is necessary to keep the port open
for our business and our customers'.
A car ferry had to be diverted to Poole and Royal Navy operations were
disrupted, although the naval base said this was minimal.
The protest, following a blockade on Monday at the Port of Tees and
Hartlepool, was joined by boats ranging from crabbers to trawlers which
sailed overnight from other south-western ports to form the blockade at
dawn. Some of the boats fired distress flares across the harbour.
The blockade prevented the Brittany Ferries' Quiberon, sailing from Roscoff,
France, from docking in the morning and it was diverted to Poole, Dorset.
Passengers for the return sailing to Roscoff had to drive or be bussed to
Poole.
Another car ferry, the 23,000 tonne Bretagne, sailing from Santander, Spain,
was due to dock at 6pm but Brittany Ferries decided not to divert it in
light of the expected lifting of the blockade.
Mr Richard Banks, chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen's
Organisations, yesterday co-ordinated the blockade from a trawler. The
action was a rebuff to the fisheries minister, Mr David Curry. In the
Commons on Thursday he called on the fishermen to abandon such protests.
Mr Mike Townsend, chairman of the Cornish Fish Producers' Association, whose
members joined yesterday's protest, said: 'It is perfect fishing weather and
quite a sacrifice not to be fishing, but feelings are so strong that they
have no alternative.'
He said British fishermen were being asked to tie up their boats in the name
of conservation when they only caught about 12 per cent of the stocks of
white fish. 'They are being asked to make a big sacrifice for no benefit,'
he added.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Unit trust funds at record Pounds 69.2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AMOUNT of money invested in unit trusts increased to a record Pounds
69.2bn at the end of February, as buoyant stock markets and falling interest
rates encouraged investors to buy collective funds, Philip Coggan writes.
Gross sales of unit trusts in February were Pounds 1.3bn, the highest figure
since Pounds 1.7bn in September 1987. After allowing for repurchases of
Pounds 738.3m, net investment was Pounds 590.7m, compared with Pounds 509m
in Jan-uary.
The industry was also boosted by strong sales of personal equity plans
(Peps) as the end of the tax year approached. More than Pounds 53m was
invested in UK equity income funds. Income and gains within Peps are
tax-free.
Even more encouraging for the industry was that the number of unit-holder
accounts, which had been steadily declining since 1987, has started to
increase.
At the end of February the number of accounts was 4.4m compared with 4.35m
last year.
However, institutional investment provided almost Pounds 400m of February's
net sales. The Budget change to advance corporation tax has raised fears
that life insurance companies will find it less tax-efficient to invest in
unit trusts. The industry is lobbying the Treasury to try to prevent the
problem.
The Budget also reduced the tax advantage of a Pep for a basic-rate
taxpayer.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Northern Ireland industry gets belated energy help
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to provide at least an extra Pounds 10m to industry users
of electricity in Northern Ireland to help curb rises in their energy bills
 -a move long demanded by Ulster Unionist MPs who may now decide to abstain
in Monday's Commons coal debate.
The announcement by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, was made
in a written parliamentary answer at the same time as Thursday's coal white
paper - but not mentioned by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, in his Commons' statement.
Colleagues of Sir Patrick yesterday denied that the timing of the move was
deliberate. Although Mr Roy Beggs, the Ulster Unionist Party's energy
spokesman, said: 'I'm very pleased that the secretary of state has responded
as positively as he has.'
The party's nine MPs have agreed to meet on Monday to decide how to vote
that night. In October they helped save the government from defeat over the
pit closures by abstaining in a Commons vote.
Although their votes are now less crucial, ministers have listened carefully
to Northern Ireland MPs' demands over the last five months and Mr Beggs has
met Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister.
Ulster Unionists have also welcomed the European Commission's decision
earlier this month to give about Pounds 60m towards the cost of the planned
electricity interconnector between Northern Ireland and Scotland. Mr Beggs
said his party had been concerned about electricity costs which, he said,
were up to 25 per cent higher for large industrial users than on the
mainland.

FT  27 MAR 93 / UDM to ballot members on strike action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Union of Democratic Mineworkers yesterday announced that it would ballot
its 12,000 members next Friday over a 24-hour strike in protest at the
government's white paper for the coal industry, Robert Taylor writes.
The decision by the union's executive to hold a ballot represents a sharp
move away from its moderate policy. It underlines feelings of outrage among
some of the union officials at the proposals of Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary.
The officials believe the proposals have unfairly hit the union's
Nottinghamshire stronghold. 'This is the first time we have ever gone down
the path of industrial action,' Mr Neil Greatrex, UDM president, said
yesterday.
'We have tried to save the coal industry by every proper and intelligent way
and this has not worked. Striking was always seen as our last resort. But we
need to show the rest of Britain just how we feel about what has happened.'
Mr Greatrex said he felt let down by the government after spending the past
four months trying to convince ministers and Conservative MPs not to close
any of the 31 threatened pits. He had felt that in a meeting with Mr John
Major, the prime minister, he secured a clear understanding on what needed
to be done.
Mr Greatrex said the government had changed its position on which pits to
save only late on Wednesday night, after he had been assured all the
Nottinghamshire pits would be secure. 'I was told none of them would be
mothballed but two of the five threatened (Nottinghamshire) collieries have
been,' he said. 'The white paper is an absolute disgrace. It is just
designed to get Mr Heseltine off the hook.'
The union - founded in 1985 by miners who worked through the 1984-85
national coal strike - has worked with British Coal over the past eight
years while pit productivity improvements were introduced.
The UDM leaders believe their loyalty has been abused and they are in the
mood to urge their members to take industrial action.

CONTRACTORS building the Channel tunnel said yesterday that their claim for
substantial extra payments from Eurotunnel had not been undermined by
decisions by the International Chamber of Commerce, Andrew Taylor writes.
The chamber said in an arbitration verdict on Thursday that the contractors
would have to justify each individual element of their claim separately
rather than pursue a single all-embracing claim.
Transmanche Link (TML), the consortium of five British and five French
contractors building the tunnel, said: 'The arbitrator's decision dealt with
a number of issues, several of which fully support TML's contentions and
none detracts from TML's pursuit of its longstanding entitlements to recover
compensation from Eurotunnel.'

FT  27 MAR 93 / Insurers may be sued over refusal to settle Maxwell life
policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON INSURERS refusing to settle a Pounds 20m policy on the life of Robert
Maxwell are being threatened with legal action by administrators of
companies that were once part of his business empire.
It is understood that action could be initiated against some insurers which
are holding out against a compromise out-of-court settlement.
The compromise has been agreed in principle by most insurance companies that
have underwritten the policy, as well as by Mirror Group Newspapers and by
administrators Price Waterhouse and Arthur Andersen.
Under the settlement the insurers, which include Lloyd's syndicates and
London market companies, would pay only Pounds 6.5m, without accepting
liability.
Mr John Fisher, claims underwriter for the lead Lloyd's syndicate, said
yesterday more than 80 per cent of the Lloyd's syndicates involved in the
policy were now in favour of the proposed settlement. He expected a final
agreement to be signed 'within days'.
Broker Willis Corroon said that while the claim continued to be 'under
discussion', it was now of the view that a 'settlement should be
achievable'.
It is thought that writs against some insurance companies on behalf of the
Maxwell companies would follow the settlement.
Insurers which have agreed to the settlement are believed to be seeking a
watertight legal agreement protecting them from any further liability. MGN
and the administrators - on behalf of Maxwell Communication Corporation
(MCC); Robert Maxwell Group, a private Maxwell company; and Headington
Investments - are covered by the policy. But there might be some yet
unidentified associated companies of the Maxwell empire that might still
claim a share of any eventual pay-out
The proposed settlement was the subject of discussions lasting several
months after insurers and claimants failed to agree on the cause of
Maxwell's death.
Mr Roger Rich, of Rich Wheeler Company, loss adjusters acting for the
insurers, said this week that he remained convinced that the most likely
cause of Maxwell's death in November 1991 was suicide.
But a marine report commissioned on behalf of the insured by Price
Waterhouse concluded after a separate investigation that an accident might
have occurred prior to Maxwell's death by drowning off the Canary Islands.
He had fallen from his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine.
Under the policy, drawn up several years ago but last renewed in April 1991,
the full claim would be payable only if Maxwell died from accidental causes
or murder.
A report in the magazine Business Age that Maxwell might have been murdered
by Israeli agents is not being taken seriously by any parties involved with
the policy.
Sources close to the administrators of Maxwell's companies said last night
it was still not clear how any eventual insurance pay-out would be
distributed among creditors, including pensioners.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Violent week culminates in fury: The growing public outrage
over the violence on both sides of Northern Ireland's religious divide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, TIM COONE and Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEEP revulsion felt over terrorism arising from the troubles in Northern
Ireland erupted into fury yesterday after a grisly week of killings -
leaving politicians floundering to address a fresh re-emergence of a
'something must be done' mentality.
The burial of Johnathan Ball, the three-year-old boy killed in Warrington
last weekend was a focus of anger - especially from Dublin.
A peace rally at the city's central post office tomorrow will protest that
the IRA is not acting in the name of Ireland. The site is intensely symbolic
 -the location of the 1916 uprising against British rule.
From the other side of Northern Ireland's religious and political divide six
Roman Catholics have been killed in the province this week by loyalist
terrorists.
The public outrage is palpable but, after almost 25 years of the 'troubles',
is far from unprecedented. Not for the first time either the words of
statesmen on both sides of the Irish sea have failed to cover the political
intransigence gripping the province.
Bogged down by dispute between Unionists and Dublin over whether Ireland's
constitutional claim on Ulster is up for negotiation, political talks are
not expected to resume until after the local elections in the province on
May 19.
In the vacuum, terrorism has surged. Loyalist attacks in particular are
seriously worrying security chiefs. The Ulster Freedom Fighters, the
military wing of the now-banned Ulster Defence Association, is being run by
a younger and more ruthless leadership.
Ironically, the intelligence forces are less able to track many ringleaders
following arrests made as a result of the 1990 Stevens inquiry into
collusion between loyalist terrorists and the security forces.
Sir Hugh Annesley, Royal Ulster Constabulary chief constable, says the
threat from loyalist terrorists has never been greater. The new hard-line
leadership has warned it will escalate its activities.
Politicians are united in their anger. Mr John Major said the 'belief that
these people are evil' was spreading. It was 'intolerable' that the wish of
the majority to live peaceful lives should be frustrated 'by a tiny
minority', said Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister.
But the unanimity quickly degenerates when solutions are addressed. Mr Peter
Robinson, deputy leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist Party, insisted
that 'the men of violence are immune to public outrage - and they are also
immune to political settlement'. Many Unionists say tougher security -
including internment without trial - is the only answer.
Among nationalists, however, the priority is on addressing historical
divisions - and there is a sense that the failure of formal political talks
is a justification for individuals to talk to terrorists.
Irish Senator Mr Gordon Wilson, whose daughter was murdered by the IRA at
Enniskillen in 1987, is to meet IRA military chiefs and has received support
from Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the nationalist Social Democratic
and Labour Party. Mr Mallon has said the opening of such unofficial channels
of communication should be encouraged to stop violence spiraling.
The seemingly irreconcilable divisions only encourage support for the most
radical of solutions - treating Northern Ireland like any other part of the
UK or pushing for Irish unification. Neither Dublin nor London really
believe either can work.
Will anything result from this expression of popular mood? Mr Dick Spring is
trying to woo Unionists, to address their concerns in the hope of
re-starting talks. There might be a resumption in June or July.
Mr Major takes a close interest in the work of the Northern Ireland Office.
A year ago, after a still more ferocious episode of killing, he successfully
kick-started political talks, only for them to collapse later that year.
He is due soon to meet Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, under
an agreement that the two should meet every six months. Maastricht, the
domestic economy and coal pits have distracted his attention. Perhaps
Northern Ireland will be higher on his agenda this weekend.
The IRA said yesterday that one of the four Roman Catholic workmen shot dead
by the outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters, in the past 48 hours was one of its
members. The terrorist group, which admitted the killings in of Castlerock,
had claimed the man was the IRA leader in the Maghera area.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Gold probe leads to arrest of 25
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMS AND Excise officers have arrested 25 people in a series of
co-ordinated raids across the UK connected to a gold smuggling network that
is alleged to have defrauded the Treasury of Pounds 10m.
The arrests on Thursday mark the culmination of a nine-month operation
investigating gold transactions worth Pounds 60m.
About 10 tonnes of gold is said by Customs to have been traded in the scheme
between a series of front companies.
The investigation is the biggest of a series into frauds similar to that
alleged in this case.
New value added tax regulations for gold announced in the Budget and to come
into force in April are expected to largely stamp out such frauds.
Under the new regulations, where the seller of gold issues a tax invoice the
buyer will be liable to pay VAT direct to Customs and Excise.
Customs said that most of the gold involved in the latest operation was
freely brought into the UK after January 1 when customs barriers came down
because of the Single Market Act.
In earlier investigations relating to cases before the new year gangs had
smuggled in gold.
Customs said the gold bars were bought in Belgium at the local VAT rate on
gold of 1 per cent.
In the UK it was then sold on at the market price with 17 1/2 per cent VAT
added.
According to Customs transactions were passed through a series of companies
and the VAT was never paid on to Customs and Excise.
The arrests were centred on addresses in London, Sussex, Avon, the west
Midlands and the Home Counties.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Lamont urged to clarify Bank aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR LAST night reacted to the disclosure that some banks are receiving
financial support from the Bank of England by calling for a government
statement on the nature of the support.
Mr Alistair Darling, the party's City spokesman, said there was 'a clear
contrast' between the Bank's prompt action to save some banks and the
'marked reluctance' of the government and financial institutions to save
struggling manufacturers.
His comments followed the disclosure that a number of small and medium-sized
banks had received financial support in the second half of 1991 and that
some of them were still in receipt of Bank funds.
Mr Darling said Mr Lamont should explain both how much was spent and where
the support came from. 'The chancellor must say whether it was the Bank of
England's money, or whether the Bank persuaded other banks to put together
support packages,' he added.
He called for the Bank to say whether it gave implicit or explicit
guarantees to any bank as part of a support exercise. He planned to ask Mr
Lamont to encourage banks to show 'a similar understanding' in their
relationships with industrial and other commercial concerns.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Leyland Daf van plant loses 227 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY one in five workers remaining at the Leyland Daf van plant in
Birmingham was made redundant by the administrative receiver yesterday, with
the loss of 227 jobs.
The Birmingham workforce, which totalled 1,960 when Daf collapsed into
receivership in early February, was cut yesterday from 1,201 to 974.
A further round of redundancies is expected next week at the Leyland Daf
truck plant at Leyland, Lancashire.
However Lancashire County Council yesterday boosted plans for a management
buy-out of the truck operation. The council said it was considering a joint
bid with the management buy-out team for the Leyland site.
The council said discussions were still only at the 'initial planning
stage'. Under the proposal, Lancashire Enterprises, the county council's
economic development agency, would develop the Leyland site into 'a business
and high-technology park', while the buy-out team would concentrate on the
existing assembly operations at the site.
The plan for the rescue of the UK truck business received further
encouragement from Daf Trucks in the Netherlands, which has reached an
agreement in principle with the buy-out team to sell the UK-built Leyland
Daf 45 series light truck range through its European dealer network.
Mr John Gilchrist, leader of the Leyland management buy-out team, said last
month the eventual success of a buy-out depended on the signing of a
contract to supply the newly formed Daf Trucks.
Leyland Daf said yesterday nearly 30 per cent of its output of 13,967 trucks
last year comprised deliveries of 45 series trucks to continental Europe. A
further 3,972 of the 45 series trucks were built for the UK market, while
1,384 trucks were military vehicles for the Ministry of Defence.
Daf Trucks, the new company formed in March to take over the core
medium-duty and heavy-duty truck operations of the collapsed Daf group in
the Netherlands and Belgium, said it had also 'expressed its intention to
arrive at a long-term contract' for the 45 series to be marketed through its
European dealer network.
Mr Gilchrist said the team aimed to complete its business plan so it could
start 'definitive financing discussions' with institutions interested in
supporting a management buy-out.
In Birmingham, Leyland Daf Vans has already been established as a
stand-alone business with the promise of support from 3i, the venture
capital group. Formal negotiations with the receivers are expected to start
soon with the target of completing a deal in the second half of April.
The receiver said yesterday the latest redundancies in Birmingham resulted
from a decision to cut production to only 200 vans a week from the previous
level of 250. The company was producing 350 vans a week before the collapse
into receivership.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Bankers fear exodus from British export support role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S export bankers fear that five months of incon-clusive negotiations
with the government may lead to a cut in interest margins on project
exports, prompting a steady withdrawal of bank support for exporters.
Large exporters have expressed concern over the 'dwindling band' of banks
able to support their export efforts.
A leading capital-goods exporter said yesterday: 'Even with margins at their
present levels, there is a very limited number of UK-based banks which
maintain the size of team and have the necessary commitment to help UK
exporters win major business in a range of overseas markets.
'To reduce their incentive to provide such help would not be helpful for the
improvement in capital goods exports which the government is otherwise
actively encouraging.'
A five-year agreement reached in 1987 expired at the end of last November
and no new agreement is in place.
A stand-off has followed efforts by the Export Credits Guarantee Department,
the government agency responsible for backing long-term export finance, to
trim the nominal cost of supports to banks - fixed rate export finance, or
Frefs - by 20 per cent from Pounds 44m a year to Pounds 34m.
Banks insist that Frefs, ranging from  1/2 per cent to  7/8 per cent
depending on the life of a loan and the currency it is denominated in, are
at a bare minimum for covering the costs involved with aiding exporters in
arranging financing packages for overseas projects.
They argue that any further cut in margins would result in more bankers
withdrawing from the business.
Cuts forced on banks in 1987 are blamed for having pushed more than a dozen
out. Just a dozen banks remain active in the business today, including
Midland, Barclays, Lloyds and National Westminster, along with Standard
Chartered Bank, Kleinwort Benson, Morgan Grenfell and ANZ Bank.
The government appears to accept bankers' claims but continues to demand
cuts. A spokesman for the ECGD said yesterday: 'We are still looking for
some savings which will be significant for us, but are discussing a proposal
which has been reshaped very much to take account of the preferences of the
banks.'
He said margin rate cuts should be offset by extra income from the higher
volume of export business being handled by the ECGD.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Heath accuses Thatcher of inciting rebels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR EDWARD Heath exacerbated Conservative divisions yesterday by accusing
Baroness Thatcher, his successor as prime minister, of inciting Tory MPs'
opposition to Maastricht and the government. Sir Edward also said that Mr
John Major, the prime minister, should stop being 'quite so nice'.
At the same time as Sir Edward was warning Mr Major that the Tory right wing
could never be appeased, Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, was
preparing a speech urging Britain to fight for a Europe 'in our own image'.
But he appealed for loyalty, saying that as ratification of Maastricht
neared, 'the Conservative party is visibly pulling together on Europe'.
Mr Howard said in Folke-stone: 'The Tory vision is of a wider Europe
dedicated to free trade, decentralisation, deregulation, low taxation, and
above all, a low-cost Europe, flexible enough to compete with the dynamic
economies of the Far East.'
The renewed tension between Euro-enthusiastic and Euro-sceptic wings of the
Conservative party will serve as a warning to the government that its
Maastricht problems are far from over. This is in spite of its success this
week in pushing ahead with the treaty legislation, helped by Liberal
Democrats.
Speaking on Channel Four television, Sir Edward said there was 'no doubt'
that Lady Thatcher and Lord Tebbit, the former party chairman, were inciting
rebel Conservative MPs.
'We see Lord Tebbit sitting in the lobby just by the entrance to the
members' chamber and grabbing people and trying to influence them, and they
are taken down to Lady Thatcher's room in the Lords where they are also
addressed and where she also attempts to influence them against Maastricht
and against the government.'
Sir Edward said Mr Major 'simply mustn't be quite so nice'.
He added: 'There is one thing that one always has to remember in my party
which is you can never appease the right wing. Never. You live happily with
them but you recognise they will not accept your general policies and they
will, wherever possible, protest.'
He complained that Maastricht opponents had stood on the Conservative ticket
at the last election. 'If they wanted an election to object to Maastricht
they can form their own party. Or they can stand as independents. That is
the honourable course,' Sir Edward said.
Separately, Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday warned at a
Scottish conference that his party's support could not be taken for granted
by ministers: 'We are an independent party in this. We do not toe the Tory
line.'

<TEXT>
NIGERIA WILL take a step closer to democratic rule this weekend, when two
officially permitted political parties each choose a candidate for
presidential elections in June.
The party conventions, beginning today, are the penultimate stage in the
fourth attempt to end seven years' military rule with a peaceful transition
to elected civilian government, set for August 27.
Most of the structures for civilian rule are in place. There are elected
local councils and civilian governors in all 30 states. The national
assembly's members have been on full pay since last year but they have no
legislative powers until a president has been elected.
Both the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the National Republican
Convention (NRC) are the creations of President Ibrahim Babangida, who has
promised that before restoring democracy to Nigeria he will purge civilian
politics of corruption and create a new group of politicians fit to run.
The government has written both parties' manifestos and neither gives a
clear sign of ideology or policy direction.
Most prominent civilians with experience of government are either barred
from standing or have not entered the race. Some of the leading candidates
who were disqualified last year, such as Mr Musa Yar'Adua in the SDP and
Adamu Ciroma, remain influential behind the scenes.
Mr Moshood Abiola, a frontrunner for the SDP, is a Yoruba businessman from
the south-west and proprietor of the Concord newspaper empire. His main
party rival is Mr Baba Gana Kingibe, a former ambassador and director of the
intelligence service.
Both leading contenders for the NRC, businessman Bashir Tofa and physician
Dalhatu Tafida, have connections going back to the defunct National Party of
Nigeria.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Vietnam looks to Tokyo for diplomatic help

<TEXT>
VIETNAM wants Japan to use its diplomatic influence to encourage Washington
to normalise US-Vietnamese relations and allow international financial
organisations to fund the country's redevelopment.
Mr Vo Van Kiet, Vietnam's prime minister, in Tokyo on a five-day visit, told
Japanese leaders the country is keen to resume normal ties with the US,
whose economic embargo has limited Hanoi's access to foreign aid and
investment.
In Washington yesterday US secretary of state Warren Christopher suggested
America might accelerate the normalisation of relations with Hanoi. But he
gave no timetable.
'We certainly hope that we can continue on the road map (toward ties) and
perhaps even at a somewhat accelerated speed with Vietnam,' he said.
The visit was the first by a Vietnamese prime minister since 1973, and was
seen as an indication of Japan's willingness to develop an Asia policy
independent of Washington. The US is still inhibited by memories of the
Vietnam war and is yet to be satisfied on the issue of military personnel
still listed as missing in action.
Tokyo has been wary of offending the US and until last year had asked
companies to adopt a low profile in broadening business dealings in Vietnam.
But after ending a 14-year ban on assistance last year, Japan is now
confident that stronger ties with Hanoi will not compromise its US
relationship. It plans to send a study team to Vietnam to devise an
infrastructure development plan.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japanese prime minister, said his government 'wants to
co-operate' to ensure success of Vietnam's economic reform programme.
Tokyo has offered two grants totalling Y684m (Pounds 3.95m) for medical
equipment and forestry machinery, insisting that the machinery be used for
cultivating new forests.
Japanese officials also asked Mr Vo Van Kiet to exercise restraint over the
recent killings of ethnic Vietnamese in Cambodia. United Nations officials
are concerned that Vietnam may retaliate, complicating peace efforts in
Cambodia.
Meanwhile, Japan ann-ounced yesterday it would send about 50 military
personnel to Mozambique as part of a UN peacekeeping mission. The decision
has so far been uncontroversial, in contrast to the despatch of 600
personnel to Cambodia last year.

FT  27 MAR 93 / UN to send force of 30,800 to Somalia: Troops will have
strongest-ever rules of engagement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS, UN Correspondent and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, MOGADISHU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UN Security Council last night voted unanimously to dispatcha
peace-keeping force to Somalia that would be the biggest ever mounted by the
world body, costing an estimated Dollars 1.55bn (Pounds 1.09bn).
A contingent of 20,000 troops plus 8,000 logistical support personnel,
backed by 2,800 civilian staff, will have the strongest rules of engagement
of any UN peace keeping operation mounted to date.
The UN troops will replace the coalition led by the US that has battled to
restore law and order in Somalia since December.
The changeover is planned to begin on May 1 with the UN assuming virtual
control of the country - on an even bigger scale than the present operation
in Cambodia, which has a Dollars 1.4bn budget.
There are fears that the factional conflict in Cambodia, which has hobbled
UN efforts there, may be paralleled in Somalia unless the troops are
empowered to adopt tough measures.
Last night's resolution vastly extends the customary authority of UN
peacekeepers. Sir David Hannay, the UK delegate, termed it 'much more tough
and robust' than any past resolution. It meant that force could 'operate
without the consent of any government,' he said.
The resolution, drafted during intensive private consultations, invokes the
enforcement provisions of Chapter VII of the UN Charter, and stresses 'the
crucial importance' of disarming trigger-happy bands that have spread terror
and anarchy throughout Somalia.
It also 'demands' that all local parties comply fully with agreements made
at a peace conference in Addis Ababa, in particular implementing the
ceasefire.
Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN Secretary-General, will have to use the
troops also to ensure the enforcement of the arms embargo already in effect.
Although he initially proposed an operation lasting a year the resolution
speaks only of a six-month period, mainly due to the high cost.
However there is no doubt that the force, known as UNOSOM II - a small
number of UN troops went in last year - will have to be renewed past October
31, whatever the cost.
Among the UN's tasks will be relief and economic rehabilitation, the
repatriation of Somali refugees and the restoration of law and order in a
nation that for months has had no central governing authority.
Low-flying US fighter aircraft led an American military push yesterday to
block any attempt by one of Somalia's leading warlords to seize the southern
Somali port of Kismayu, Reuter reports from Mogadishu.
A 4,200-strong US amphibious troop force set off from Mogadishu for Kismayu
by sea on Thursday following reports that warlord Omar Jess planned an
offensive against dominant Kismayu warlord, Mohammed Said Hersi, also known
as Morgan.

A CORRUPTION scandal in the South Korean parliament claimed its first
victims yesterday as two MPs from the ruling Democratic Liberal party (DLP)
resigned.
At least 15 other MPs, including the speaker of the National Assembly, may
be punished by the DLP for engaging in illegal property speculation and tax
evasion.
The actions are part of an anti-corruption campaign launched by Mr Kim
Young-sam, the new president. He recently ordered DLP legislators, who hold
161 seats in the 299-member chamber, to disclose their assets.
The disclosures appear to confirm public suspicions legislators have amassed
arge personal fortunes from political contributions and secret financial
transactions. The average wealth of ruling party MPs amounted to won Won
2.5bn (Pounds 2.2m) despite their relatively low salary.
Mr Kim is using the anti-corruption campaign to assert his control over the
DLP.

<TEXT>
Ireland's central bank yesterday dropped its short-term facility (STF) rate
by half a percentage point, to 10.25 per cent the lowest level since late
1991, Tim Coone reports from Dublin.
The STF underpins wholesale and commercial money market rates in Dublin, and
is now half a percentage point below the 10.75 per cent rate last September
just before sterling left the ERM and which brought heavy pressure to bear
on the punt and Irish interest rates.
The STF has been brought down from 13.75 per cent in a series of cuts,
raising the prospect of accelerating depreciation since the punt was
devalued by 10 per cent within the ERM last January, and following the
series of cuts in German interest rates.
Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister said yesterday that the latest cut
'clears the way for all lending institutions to make further early
reductions in retail interest rates'.

US dollar, to which the forint is partly linked.
The central bank said that the rate cut was part of this year's strategy of
lowering the forint in small steps in line with producer prices. But
independent analysts saw yesterday's move as confirming a fundamental
softening of the government's policy of maintaining a strong forint to
suppress inflation.
Yesterday's currency step is the largest for over a year and comes just six
weeks after the last, 1.9 per cent devaluation.

<TEXT>
INDIAN police yesterday seized nearly 1,500kgs of plastic explosives, five
times the amount used in a bombing blitz earlier in the month that killed
250 people and injured 1,400 in Bombay, Reuter reports from Bombay.
The explosives, found in a locked apartment at Kausa town in Thane district
northeast of Bombay, were probably meant for a second round of attacks on
the city, Mr Amareet Singh Samra, the Bombay police chief said.
He said the bombers had apparently wanted to trigger a new round of
Hindu-Moslem clashes in Bombay, which was swept by communal bloodshed in
December and January.
Mr Samra said the explosives were traced on information disclosed by one of
four key people involved in carrying out the attacks, in which 13 bombs
ripped through the port city in the space of two and a half hours on March
12.
Police have so far arrested 17 people, including some suspects who have told
police how the RDX explosive was smuggled into Bombay, and how they were
trained to plant it.
Authorities have identified a wealthy Muslim family, the Memons, as key
suspects in the case. Some of them are believed to have fled to Karachi in
Pakistan.
Pakistan said it has been unable to catch the primary suspects because India
provided too little information too late.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Nigerian parties to meet as democratic rule nears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA WILL take a step closer to democratic rule this weekend, when the
country's two officially permitted political parties each choose a candidate
for presidential elections in June.
The party conventions, beginning today, are the penultimate stage in the
fourth attempt to end seven years' military rule with a peaceful transition
to elected civilian government, set for August 27.
Most of the structures for civilian rule are in place. There are elected
local councils and civilian governors in all 30 states. The national
assembly's members have been on full pay since last year but they have no
legislative powers until a president has been elected.
Both the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the National Republican
Convention (NRC) are the creations of President Ibrahim Babangida, who has
promised that before restoring democracy to Nigeria he will purge civilian
politics of corruption and create a new group of politicians fit to run.
The previous presidential campaign ended abruptly in October when the
government disqualified all candidates for electoral fraud less than two
months before the polls. Primaries began again in February under a complex
new system designed to produce leaders with grass roots support and to
reduce blatant vote-buying.
The government has written both parties' manifestos and neither gives a
clear sign of ideology or policy direction. The campaigning at local
government and state level so far has centred on ethnic, religious and
personal loyalties, and there has been virtually no debate on the national
issues which a future president will face in office.
After a decade of military rule and three postponements of the handover in
three years, most prominent civilians with experience of government are
either barred from standing or have not entered the race. Some of the
leading candidates who were disqualified last year, such as Mr Musa Yar'Adua
in the SDP and Adamu Ciroma, remain influential behind the scenes.
Mr Moshood Abiola, a frontrunner for the SDP, is a Yoruba businessman from
the south-west and proprietor of the Concord newspaper empire. His main
party rival is Mr Baba Gana Kingibe, a former ambassador and director of the
intelligence service.
Both leading contenders for the NRC, businessman Bashir Tofa and physician
Dalhatu Tafida, are northerners with connections going back to the defunct
National Party of Nigeria.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Japan's industrial output rises 1.9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE industrial production rose 1.9 per cent last month, compared to a
month earlier, but the increase could be short-lived as manufacturers
apparently lifted output in the hope of a recovery in domestic demand this
month.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said the month-on-month
increase was the first since last September, but year-on-year production was
down 5.4 per cent, compared to falls of 7.6 per cent in January and 8.5 per
cent in December.
Carmakers have increased production in expectation of fresh demand for
newly-released models, and the Japan car manufacturers' association reported
a rise in sales for the first half of this month.
The slowly returning confidence of carmakers was reflected in 4.4 per cent
increase in transport machinery production in February, as well as a 7.9 per
cent increase in metal production and a 7.6 per cent increase in precision
machinery output.
Meanwhile, Tokyo's consumer prices rose 1.6 per cent in the current fiscal
year, the smallest increase in four years, due to increasing price
competition in a slowing economy and an 11.9 per cent fall in vegetable
prices that followed favourable weather conditions.
The management and co-ordination agency, in a preliminary report, said the
recent strengthening of the yen will mean cheaper imported foods and fuels,
while the easing of the labour market will limit increases in service
charges.
In the fiscal year to the end of this month, housing expenses are estimated
to have risen 3.0 per cent, entertainment and medical expenses 2.7 per cent,
and clothing and footwear 0.8 per cent.
The agency also said household spending fell 2.1 per cent in January, as
consumer confidence declined in tandem with the slowing of the economy.
There was an 8.8 per cent decrease in purchases of furniture and other
household goods and a 5.3 per cent fall in spending on recreation and
leisure activities.

FT  27 MAR 93 / An odd society battles on: David White finds Falkland
Islanders an endangered species
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEASURED by the ratio of military to civilians, the Falkland Islands must
have the most heavily defended population on earth. The colony's 2,200
inhabitants, almost all of British descent, barely outnumber the 2,000 UK
airmen, soldiers and sailors posted there.
Since the 1982 UK-Argentine conflict over the islands, an influx of new
blood has reversed the population decline. But numbers have never been much
greater than today and as a surge of prosperity based on squid fishery
peters out, nothing short of an oil bonanza is likely to change that.
The two communities live apart. Most servicemen are housed at Mount
Pleasant, a new airfield complex built on a peat bog 35 miles from Stanley,
the capital, along a road that (although the islands' best) is only partly
tarmac.
They are pretty self-sufficient. A sore point, under discussion with local
authorities, is that mess kitchens use New Zealand lamb, in a territory
whose treeless, wind-battered expanses serve little productive purpose
except as grazing for 750,000 sheep.
The meat comes by way of Britain, 8,400 miles away, in what is probably the
longest voyage ever undertaken by a meat carcase. The thing is that the
islands have no EC-standard abattoir and they say they cannot now afford
one.
Nevertheless, the armed forces are the islands' biggest cash customer, and
the biggest tourism earner. They are warmly appreciated.
Military flights, which anywhere else might be considered a nuisance,
provide reassurance. 'We get complaints when people don't low-fly enough,'
says Rear Admiral Neil Rankin, British forces commander.
Islanders worry about the improving relations between London and Buenos
Aires. The need to co-operate with Argentina, whether on fisheries or on
future oil development, is a bitter pill to swallow.
The scars from 1982 show no sign of healing. Argentine citizens are still
banned. There are no transport connections. The main link to the outside
world is the 18-hour, twice-weekly flight to the UK by RAF Tristar. The
garrison, with a few Tornado fighters, heavy Hercules aircraft, helicopters
and a frigate, is designed to hold the base until reinforcements arrive in a
crisis.
Running expenses are put at Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m a year, not counting the
pay servicemen would get anyway, nor the cost of the RAF staging post on
Ascension Island.
In spite of the 'firm and unwavering commitment' pledged during a visit this
week by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the British defence secretary, the number of
military personnel may be reduced. But the islanders' numbers could dwindle,
too. Sixth-formers go to the UK; there may be less reason for them to come
back.
Prospects opened up after the war. Under a programme to bring land into
local ownership, farm employee Mr Robin Marsh bought 20,000 acres in West
Falkland, the smaller of the two main islands, with 5,000 sheep.
But for the past three years, as world wool prices have plummeted, he has
depended on support from the Falkland Islands government. This support may
now stop.
The government tapped unprecedented wealth from a licence regime set up in
1987 for vessels fishing within a 150-mile zone. The boats are mostly squid
'jiggers' from Japan, Korea, Taiwan and southern Europe. Government revenue,
previously about Pounds 6m a year from wool tax receipts and UK grand aid,
shot up to an unaided Pounds 40m.
But last year Argentina launched a rival licence scheme, a move widely seen
in the islands as deliberate economic pressure. Argentina is in a powerful
position, since the young squid move south to the Falklands through its
waters.
It agreed with Britain last December to limit this season's number of
licences. But the Falklands have slashed their estimate of licence earnings
for the financial year just ending from Pounds 23m to Pounds 15m. Next year,
government officials say, the planning figure is just Pounds 10m.
At the islands' secretariat on Thatcher Drive, Mr Ronald Sampson, chief
executive, describes it as 'perhaps the greatest reduction in revenue that
any country will experience short of having a war.'
Public works, including the upgrading of tracks into something resembling
proper roads, have run out of money.
The good times have nonetheless left their imprint. A new hospital and
school have been built. With a gradual migration from 'camp' - the country
areas - residents say Stanley has become more bustling and urban.
Japanese four-wheel drive vehicles can be spotted among the Land Rovers.
Outlying settlements now have telephones and next month should receive
television programmes.
But where else do the armed forces provide the only television service?
Sparseness, Englishness and remoteness make for an odd society. Darts
matches and sheepdog trials are covered live on radio. The islands have no
cash machine, no Indian restaurant, no illegal drugs and as yet no dole.
There are as many species of penguin as pubs.
What the islanders are waiting for is offshore oil. Successful exploration
has been carried out in nearby Argentine waters. A seismic survey to the
south is almost complete. Another has started to the north. Mr Sampson says
even getting as far as exploration would bring a dramatic boost in
population.
Oil could transform the islands. But people are in two minds about the
prospect. They value their unspoilt lifestyle. Says Mr Sampson: 'The most
endangered species here would be Falkland Islanders.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA said yesterday it hoped Hong Kong's multi-billion dollar airport could
be built before 1997 and held out the possibility of future Sino-British
co-operation over the transfer of the colony.
In a marked change in rhetoric, Mr Lu Ping, China's top official on Hong
Kong affairs, was reported in the pro-Beijing New Evening Post yesterday as
saying China and Britain had many issues to resolve on the transfer of
sovereignty in 1997.
He said they should be dealt with by the Joint Liaison Group (JLG), the
Anglo-Chinese forum set up to deal with the details of Britain's withdrawal
from Hong Kong. JLG talks have been stalled since October last year when
Governor Chris Patten made public his proposals for a more democratic Hong
Kong.
Mr Lu also said that he still hoped the colony's HKDollars 175bn (Pounds
15.8bn) airport could be finished before British administration ceased in
1997. He said that Britain had to adhere to the memorandum of understanding,
signed by the British and Chinese prime ministers in September 1991 -
something the Hong Kong government has said it has done all along.
Over the past week, senior Chinese officials have sought to moderate the
somewhat emotional response which has characterised China's reaction to Mr
Patten's publication two weeks ago of legislation for more democracy in Hong
Kong.
In a further move to draw back from the brink, China's top central banker,
Mr Li Guixian, said in Beijing yesterday that China welcomed British
investment in China from companies which were 'co-operative'. A week ago
China said British interests in, and trade with, China could be put at risk
by Mr Patten's actions.
Mr Patten has yet to set a date for the beginning of the legislative process
to ratify, or modify, his plans for political development.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Clinton steps up pressure over Bosnia peace plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bosnian Serbs are facing growing international pressure to accept the
peace plan put forward by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the international
mediators, now that the Bosnian Moslems have signed its main and most
controversial element.
Yesterday US President Bill Clinton promised a concerted diplomatic effort
to 'press' the Serbs to join the accord and threatened to increase sanctions
if they did not.
'I think international impatience is going to grow rather rapidly with the
Serbs if they are going to continue with the carnage in Bosnia,' he said
yesterday after a White House meeting with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany
and Mr Alijah Izetbegovic, the Bosnian Moslem leader.
Mr Clinton said America's allies were now more eager to enforce a ban on
flights by Serbian aircraft over Bosnia and the US was ready to try to
strengthen international economic sanctions.
By endorsing the map of the semi-autonomous provinces into which
Bosnia-Hercegovina would be divided, Mr Izetbegovic has ensured that most of
the blame for the continuation of the Bosnian conflict will be put on Mr
Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader.
Though Moscow's envoy to the peace talks, Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian
deputy foreign minister, was reported to have tried hard to persuade Mr
Karadzic to change his mind, he persisted in his refusal to sign the map.
Mr Karadzic is now the only Bosnian leader not to have accepted either the
map or the interim arrangements to be implemented during the period between
a peace settlement and the organisation of elections, though he signed the
constitutional framework for the new state at the beginning of this year.
The Moslems and Croats, on the other hand, have now accepted all four parts
of the peace plan.
The US, Britain and France have already begun discussing a new UN Security
Council resolution, expected to be voted on next week, which would threaten
the rump state of Yugoslavia - Serbia and Montenegro - with stronger
sanctions if the Bosnian Serbs remain intransigent.
The international mediators and western leaders have made no secret of their
belief that President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia is the only political
leader capable of forcing Mr Karadzic to adopt a more constructive attitude,
as he did at the time of the Geneva discussions on the constitutional
principles for Bosnia.
The Security Council resolution is expected to include cutting Serbia's
transport links, freezing financial assets and the seizure of aircraft,
ships and trucks which have violated existing sanctions.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said the aim of the resolution
would be to oblige the Serbs to put pressure on their Bosnian Serb allies to
negotiate and reach agreement on the peace plan.
US officials said existing sanctions were already costing the Serbian
economy dearly.
However, direct military intervention in Bosnia continues to be ruled out by
the major members of the Security Council.
President Clinton also repeated yesterday that he planned to discuss with
his allies a selective relaxation of the UN arms embargo against the former
Yugoslavia to help the Bosnian Moslems, but the suggestion appears to be a
non-starter.

<TEXT>
RUHRKOHLE, the largest coal producer in Germany, confirmed yesterday that
20,000 jobs will be axed in the next two years because of the worsening
steel crisis, as 70,000 angry steel workers protested in Bonn.
The acceleration of job cuts in the German mining industry, an increase of
12,000 over what was originally planned for the next two years, is a direct
result of cuts in steel production, where another 35,000 to 40,000 are
expected to lose their jobs.
The threat of total closure still hangs over one entire pit - the
Aden/Monopol mine in Bergkamen where 8,000 coal miners are employed. An
entire coke works will close at the end of June.
The company had planned to carry out the total 20,000 lay-offs by 1999, with
production gradually decreasing to 38m tonnes. But it had speed up its
restructuring as orders from steel producers, expected to reach 41m tonnes
of coal and coke per year between 1992 and 1996, fell to 32m tonnes.
Ruhrkohle said sales in 1992 plunged by 28 per cent. Unsold stocks have
steadily increased, from 15m tonnes of coal equivalent at the end of 1991 to
a forecasted 20m tonnes at the end of 1993.
Faced with a bleak future, steel workers marched over the last three days
from the Ruhr valley to Bonn where they reiterated their call for a national
steel conference to debate the fate of the German steel industry.
'We are not only stricken by an economic crisis. We are also the witnesses
of a profound political crisis,' Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the leader of IG
Metall, Germany's giant engineering union, told the crowd.
The union is calling on politicians to draw up a long-term strategy for the
future of the national steel industry.

FT  27 MAR 93 / A bed of thorns for French partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S Socialist President Francois Mitterrand once said of his first
cabinet meeting in cohabitation with a centre-right government: 'I was
surrounded by men, 60 per cent of whom hated me and 80 per cent of whom
fought against me'.
However, by the end of the two-year period of cohabitation between 1986 and
1988 the wily president had not only out-manoeuvred Mr Jacques Chirac, the
conservative premier, on the international stage, but thrashed him in the
1988 presidential elections.
The critical question for Mr Mitterrand, and for the conservatives, now
waiting with ill-disguised patience to return to power after the second
round of voting for the parliamentary elections tomorrow, is whether the
president will find it quite so easy to thwart the government in the next
round of cohabitation.
The French constitution is vague on the division of power between the
president and parliament. French presidents, unlike their US counterparts,
do not have a right of veto over new legislation. The president can refuse
to sign decrees, but the government is permitted to bypass the president by
implementing its proposals through parliament. Mr Chirac did this and went
on to dominate the domestic agenda.
However, Mr Mitterrand held sway in the international arena claiming that,
as head of state, the president is responsible for foreign affairs and
defence. The constitution is not clear on this issue. But Mr Mitterrand
insisted on representing France at international summits thereby upstaging
the unfortunate Mr Chirac.
In theory President Mitterrand should be more vulnerable now than he was at
the start of the last cohabitation government. He is older, at 76, and
frailer following his prostate surgery last autumn.
He may also lose his political power base if Mr Michel Rocard, former French
premier, succeeds in his 'big bang' plan to abandon the Socialist Party,
which Mr Mitterrand revived in 1971, to form a centre-left alliance with the
ecologists.
Moreover the conservatives are on course tomorrow to win up to 480 of the
National Assembly's 577 seats. This should give them the highest majority of
any French government since the early 19th century and make it even easier
to force through domestic legislation. The scale of the majority may also
strengthen the conservatives' claims that they have a mandate from the
electorate to extend their influence over foreign affairs.
However, the new conservative government's position may not be as strong as
it seems. There are serious splits between the Gaullist Republican Rally
(RPR) and the Union for French Democracy (UDF) on critical issues, notably
in foreign policy.
The UDF is more enthusiastic than the RPR about continuing the socialists'
policy of forging close economic relations between France and Germany.
It is also less aggressive than the RPR in its calls for the renegotiation
of the agricultural reforms agreed last year by the European Community.
President Mitterrand has in the past proved to be adept at exploiting such
tensions. He fired his first shot this week by curbing Mr Chirac's calls for
his resignation with a series of well-placed leaks that he might retaliate
by refusing to nominate a prime minister from the RPR, Mr Chirac's party.
These leaks have already caused chaos on the right. Mr Chirac has no wish to
be prime minister again, believing that it might lessen his chances in the
1995 presidential elections. However he does want to ensure that the premier
is an RPR candidate, ideally the apparently malleable Mr Edouard Balladur.
Mr Chirac has already started to back-track.
Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the UDF leader, has been making conciliatory
noises to Mr Mitterrand in an attempt to use Mr Chirac's predicament to
further his own prime ministerial ambitions.
The hapless Mr Balladur has followed suit in a bid to repair the damage
caused by his party leader.
Yesterday's Le Figaro offered sound advice to all the conservatives. 'Watch
out]' it said. 'The leaders of the RPR and UDF are walking into a minefield.
Even the smallest of their disagreements will be used against them.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Group of Seven western industrialised nations could and should put
together a package of aid measures for Mr Boris Yeltsin's Russian economic
reforms before April 25, the day of his Russian referendum, according to a
senior German official.
Mr Horst Kohler, the state secretary in the ministry of finance in Bonn and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's 'sherpa' for the G7 world economic summit, told a
Washington audience that the target was necessary to give 'effective and
visible support' to the Russian reform plans.
He was speaking shortly before Japan confirmed meeting of G7 foreign and
finance ministers will be held in Tokyo on April 14 and 15, after the
bilateral summit between President Bill Clinton and President Yeltsin in
Vancouver on April 3 and 4.
Japan also announced that Mr Yeltsin will be invited to attend the G7 summit
in Tokyo in July, a move immediately welcomed by other members of the group,
including the UK and Germany, as a visible sign of western support for the
embattled president.
Officials in Bonn believe the G7 negotiators can come up with a three part
package, including a deal for extremely close co-operation and monitoring of
the Russian reform programme on a weekly, if not daily basis.
The first part of the package would be the acceleration of payments from the
Dollars 24bn package put together by the last G7 summit in Munich last July,
relatively little of which has so far been disbursed. I
The second part will be a micro-economic package of measures designed to
bring western aid directly to the Russian population.
Included are plans to develop new 'pilot islands' of privatisation and
reform programmes, such as Nizhni Novgorod, financed by the World Bank, and
Vladimir, where Germany is involved.
The third part of the package, the officials say, would be to set up a
mechanism for close co-ordination with the Russian government, through Mr
Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime minister and now finance minister.
The idea is to monitor the Russian reforms as closely as a central bank
might monitor an ailing bank in a financial crisis, and to bring Mr Fyodorov
into almost day-to-day contact with the western finance ministries to
support his programmes.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Foreign companies operating in US may be asked to pay more
in tax
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FOREIGN COMPANIES are bracing themselves for further US efforts to extract
more tax money from them after a renewed onslaught in the Senate this week.
Senator Byron Dorgan, a newly elected senator from North Dakota who is
leading the attack, said tax avoidance by multinational companies, and
especially foreign-based companies, was epidemic, and he called for a
radical overhaul of the way tax is assessed on multinational businesses.
'I can only view this system as a system that is in collapse. We are
losing,' Mr Dorgan said at Senate hearings this week, citing a study by the
General Accounting Office that showed that between 1987 and 1990 around 72
per cent of foreign-owned companies paid no US income tax.
'We are being ripped off,' added Senator Carl Levin of Michigan.
However, the same study showed that 59 per cent of US-owned companies also
paid no tax over the same period, and Mr Natwar Gandhi, GAO's associate
director for tax policy, said the current rules on multinational taxation,
which have recently been modified, should be given a chance to work.
Foreign companies and governments had relaxed somewhat after President Bill
Clinton backed away from his campaign claims that he could raise an
additional Dollars 45bn in the four years from 1993 to 1996 by making
multinationals comply fully with the tax code.
Mr Clinton's economic programme, outlined last month, contained a compliance
initiative but more modestly claimed only Dollars 1.8bn of additional
revenue over the same 1993-96 period.
Senator Dorgan, however, said 'easily, at least Dollars 10bn a year
disappears into the dark recesses of the compliance mess.'
He called for the US to jettison the arm's length standard now
internationally used to assess which country a multinational's income should
be taxed in in favour of formulary apportionment, used by many US states.
Companies would be taxed on a proportion of their worldwide income, assessed
by weighting their sales, payroll and property in each jurisdiction.
Senator Dorgan has formed an alliance with his fellow North Dakotan, Senator
Kent Conrad, whose seat on the Senate finance committee gives him influence
over taxation issues.
Senator Daniel Moynihan, the committee's chairman, has promised to hold
hearings on the subject, and some Washington tax lawyers believe there may
be an effort to add legislation on foreign company taxation to the full
budget bill later this year.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Mexico to arrest seven officials
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S Attorney-General has ordered the arrest of seven former top
officials of Seguros La Republica, the Mexican insurance company in which
Commercial Union of the UK has a major stake. The officials are accused of
falsifying financial information.
Commercial Union says that it lost less than 1 per cent of group assets of
Pounds 1.2bn as a result of misrepresentation of information both when it
bought its stake and during the course of operations. Comercial Union has
been forced to diloute its original stake of 46 per cent in the company
after a Mexican partner injected capital to keep the company afloat.
The fraud came to light last year, after Mr Carlos Hank Rhon, a Mexican
businessman, bought out Mexican partners. He found that losses were much
higher than had been reported - leading to an investigation and subsequent
order of arrests of the former director-general, and other senior officials.
Mr Jim Raffray, head of the international side of Commercial Union, said
earlier this year that he was pleased with the 'very forceful' response of
the Mexican authorities to the fraud.
But he recommended future investors in Mexico make 'an extremely tough due
diligence.' He said the Mexican government has not 'fully modernised their
way of regulating the insurance industry.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Yakuts ponder identity in a post-Soviet world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   YAKUTSK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN TSARIST Russia, the main role of the remote republic of Yakutia was to
accommodate exiles banished by the authorities.
After 70 years of socialism brought it literacy, some industry and the
status of an autonomous Soviet, socialist republic, Yakutia is proceeding
towards a new chapter in its history.
It has become one of the big players in current attempts to transform the
so-called Russian Federation (proclaimed by the Bolsheviks, but never
realised) into a genuine federal state.
So far, relations between Moscow and individual republics have been a
question of messy bargaining, with President Boris Yeltsin trading economic
concessions for political support. The striving by Yakutia - or Sakha, as it
named itself when declaring sovereignty last year - for the right to run its
own affairs is mirrored elsewhere in the Russian Federation.
Some of the concessions it has won from Moscow are in the spirit of the
federal treaty, for instance in giving it more rights over its considerable
natural wealth, which includes 98 per cent of Russian diamond production.
The urgency of the process was underlined yesterday at the Congress of
People's Deputies in Moscow when the leader of Karelia, another constituent
republic of Russia, called on the parliament to quickly adopt laws to
implement a federation treaty signed this time last year.
The treaty, conceived to avoid a Soviet-style collapse of Russia, divided up
responsibilities between the federal and local governments in 89 constituent
republics and regions.
That call received strong backing from Mr Yuri Skokov, the secretary of
Russia's Security Council, who told deputies the state was already
collapsing: 'We do not have a crisis of power, we have a crisis of
statehood. Our life depends on the regions.'
Yakutia has set up its first diamond-polishing factory in association with a
Japanese company, Arda, in an attempt to make more of its wealth. And Mr
Afanasy Stepanov, adviser to the Yakut president, said plans are under way
to offer diamonds as collateral to encourage foreign investment in other
sectors of the economy.
Apart from gold and diamonds, the republic has oil, gas and coal.
But some of its strivings for more independence reflect its desire to save
itself from the chaos of economic crisis in the absence of effective federal
reform.
Mr Stepanov said the republic wanted its local branch of the Russian central
bank to have the right to license commercial banks to take into account its
specific conditions. He cited the fact that the republic was sparsely
populated, extremely cold and that its only form of transportation was by
aircraft.
In practice, the banking demand is aimed at allowing Yakutia to set its own
reserve requirements for local banks and to set lower interest rates.
Although Moscow has reason to resist excessive decentralisation which could
break up an already primitive financial system, it has other tasks,
including the fight against inflation. Its other responsibility is to make
the banking system more efficient.
With money transfers taking weeks to go through Moscow and then further
afield, Yakutia wants the freedom to set up accounts with foreign banks and
its own clearing system.
The specific conditions of Yakutia are also used as an excuse to slow
privatisation as decreed by Moscow.
But while Yakutia has declared a state monopoly over all its natural
resources, it has yet to come up with an efficient and transparent system
for managing that monopoly.
If he survives his battle with Congress, President Yeltsin's next challenge
will be to combine effective economic reform, binding for the whole country,
with decentralisation that is seen to be fair.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Macedonia paves way for end of dispute over name

   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MACEDONIA has agreed to join the United Nations with the temporary prefix of
'former Yugoslav republic,' opening the way for its nomenclature dispute
with Greece to be settled through international arbitration.
UN recognition, even under the interim name, will make it possible for
Macedonia to resume full-scale trading with western Europe after a year of
problems in securing credit from banks abroad because of its uncertain
status.
A UN Security Council resolution, proposed by Britain, France and Spain,
also provides for Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance, co-chairmen of the Yugoslav
peace process, to supervise a swift arbitration procedure to find a
compromise name, such as New Macedonia, acceptable to Greece.
Although Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, Greek prime minister, launched the idea
of arbitration, he faces a difficult task this weekend in persuading his
party's nationalist faction to accept the UN resolution.
Talks on confidence-building measures, based on proposals put forward last
year by the European Community, are to be held in parallel with the
arbitration process.
The main obstacle to a rapprochement between the two neighbours is Greece's
insistence that Macedonia should change its flag, which carries an emblem
associated with King Alexander the Great.
Greece also wants Macedonia to change its constitution, to avoid implying
that there is a Macedonian minority living in northern Greece. Macedonia is
anxious to get guaranteed access to the northern Greek port of Thessaloniki,
its nearest outlet to the sea.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Russia takes radical rhetoric with a grain of salt: Mr
Yeltsin's government may have trouble putting its package of economic
reforms into practice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RADICAL economic reform in Russia leads a strange existence.
It is universally called 'shock therapy' by its many detractors inside and
outside parliament, who blame it for high inflation, high prices, the
decline of living standards and the fall in production.
Its supporters within the cabinet would say it has not really begun. The
package of measures revealed to the cabinet on Thursday on the eve of the
Congress of People's Deputies session yesterday is designed to give it a
kick-start.
Designed by Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime minister for the economy and
finance, the package was the cabinet's answer to President Boris Yeltsin's
call at the weekend for urgent proposals to stabilise the economy.
According to Interfax news agency, the package includes lifting the bank
rate to 8 per cent a month (from a rate of between 80 per cent and 100 per
cent a year), putting a strict limit on the issuing of credits to
enterprises, establishing a hard currency fund to be used for stabilising
the rouble, demanding a six-month moratorium on foreign debt repayments,
easing the way to allow citizens to buy private plots and take part in
privatisation, and enforcing personal responsibility of ministers for the
success of their briefs.
If implemented, the package will be radical in its effects, especially if
credits are limited, since it would indicate the government is winning its
struggle with the central bank to slow down what it sees as the main engine
of inflation.
But Mr Fyodorov wants to go further. He is seeking the head of Mr Viktor
Gerashchenko, the bank chairman, and has asked Mr Yeltsin to fire him. Mr
Yeltsin may oblige: he blames the central bank for playing 'a negative role.
. . in stirring up inflation'.
Limiting credits and pushing up interest rates (albeit to a point still far
below the inflation rate of around 25-30 per cent a month) should finally
force to the wall many of the companies that are staggering on with credit
infusions to keep them alive.
The resulting bankruptices will raise the low unemployment figure and is
calculated to send a shock through the company sector, forcing restructuring
and development of market mechanisms.
But will it be implemented? Mr Fyodorov told the cabinet the measures would
have to be trimmed to keep in mind the political imperative of winning a
large vote of confidence in the president on April 25, when Mr Yeltsin's
proposed popular vote of trust in him is scheduled to take place.
More weightily still, Mr Yeltsin said yesterday in his speech to Congress
that the government had made many mistakes and that insofar as a 'new
course' in the econonmy was required, it should be a course towards more
social balance.
The president said nothing about the harsher measures in Mr Fyodorov's
package, stressing instead a raising of the minimum wage, new benefits and
pay for the military and the need to stop the slide in living standards.
Further, the cabinet will face another battle with the Congress over the
budget, approved on Thursday - though the ambiguous relationship between the
government and parliament after Mr Yeltsin's assumption of presidential
powers may mean it will simply ignore the lawmakers' proposals. The approved
budget amounts to Rbs17,000bn (nearly Pounds 17bn at the current exchange
rate) and would, says the government, push up the budget deficit from an
estimated 12 per cent of GNP this year to about 22.5 per cent.
Mr Fyodorov is the key figure in this. Firing Mr Vassily Barchuk as finance
minister and Mr Andrei Nechayev as economics minister puts the two
ministries, which he already oversees as deputy prime minister, in his
hands.
He will be his own finance minister and can probably get an ally in Mr
Nechayev's job. If he also gains the ousting of Mr Gerashchenko and has a
more compliant central bank chairman, he will be monarch of economic policy
in a way Mr Yegor Gaidar, former acting prime minister, was only for the
first quarter of last year.
But everyone is cautious. The rhetoric of radical reform has been devalued
by so many false starts and obstacles. Once again, there must be a pause
while yet another hurdle - the April 25 vote - is negotiated. The cabinet is
divided and Mr Fyodorov has inherited a demoralised bureacracy and lacks the
mechanisms for making his plans concrete.
There is little question that Mr Fyodorov's general line will be supported
by Mr Bill Clinton during the summit meeting with Mr Yeltsin next week and
by the Group of Seven leaders in their later meetings.
But the line still needs to become practice.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Administration set to press ahead with big cuts in defence
spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration is sticking to its plans to cut defence spending,
despite the increased instability in Russia.
Mr Les Aspin, the US secretary of defence, who will present a detailed
defence budget today, says he cannot wait for everything to settle down, but
argues that reduced military spending is still prudent because the
dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact is permanent.
'These Humpty Dumpties are not going to get put back together again,' he
said this week in a speech to the National War College in Washington.
President Bill Clinton has already outlined an approximate path for the
defence budget that would take spending down to Dollars 264bn in fiscal
1994, around Dollars 12bn less than the Bush administration had planned,
with further steady cuts to Dollars 248.4bn in 1997 before a rise to Dollars
254.2bn in 1998.
But Mr Clinton also warned that the Bush budget may have understated the
costs of the troops and equipment included in its defence planning, while
overstating the savings to be achieved from a review of defence management
structures.
Even the savings contained in the Bush budget, therefore, may prove hard to
achieve, let alone the additional savings proposed by Mr Clinton.
Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate armed services committee, has
warned that he may rebel against the administration's budget plans if he
sees a danger to the US military forces.
Mr Aspin has been further hampered in his efforts to balance this equation
by his recent heart illness, which led to an operation to implant a
pacemaker last week.
He said the budget was only a first step towards addressing the new threats
of regional conflict and nuclear terrorism, as well as dangers further
removed from traditional defence planning such as the possible reversal of
reform in the former Soviet Union and the economic weakening of the US.
Mr Aspin promised a 'really bottom-up review of defence budgets of the
future' as soon as this year's budget exercise was completed.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Growth at 4.7% in fourth quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR RON BROWN, the US Commerce Secretary, yesterday hailed final figures
showing real growth at an annual rate of 4.7 per cent in the fourth quarter
of last year as confirmation that 'the begin-nings of a meaningful economic
recovery are at hand.'
But he warned that increased consumer confidence and business profitability
had yet to be translated into higher levels of investment, employment and
personal incomes.
Mr Brown praised Congress for passing President Bill Clinton's
deficit-cutting plan but urged it quickly to approve the associated Dollars
16bn package of short-term measures to stimulate the economy.
Growth at an annual rate of 4.7 per cent in the fourth quarter was
marginally slower than an earlier estimate of 4.8 per cent growth.
However, it was the fastest rate of expansion since the end of 1987, when
the 'Reagan boom' was still under way.
The expansion was led by consumer spending which grew at an annual rate of
5.1 per cent in the fourth quarter.
It was the seventh successive quarter of growth in the US after a brief
contraction in the autumn and winter of 1990/91.
The figures also confirmed a revival of corporate profits. After-tax profits
were up 9.2 per cent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter compared with
the third quarter and by 10 per cent during last year as a whole compared
with 1991.

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN COMMISSION plans to negotiate a free trade zone with Russia between
now and the end of the decade have won support from the 12's ambassadors to
the Community.
This initial endorsement comes as a delegation to Moscow of EC foreign
ministers and the Commission today meets members of the Russian government
to discuss the bilateral relationship and Russia's crisis.
Brussels' request for a mandate to widen its 'partnership' negotiations with
Russia to include an eventual free trade agreement has to be endorsed by
foreign ministers of the 12 on April 5 in Luxembourg.
The hope is to get an agreement that EC heads of government can approve at
their summit meeting in Copenhagen on June 21-22. But despite fears that
some member states might try to spike the proposal, 'all went surprisingly
well' at this week's EC ambassadors' meeting to discuss it, said one EC
diplomat.
At first, France adopted a 'low-key' approach to the free trade plan,
diplomats said, while Belgium - which had been reticent when foreign
ministers had a preliminary discussion of the idea on March 8 - now strongly
supports it.
But the clearing of this preliminary hurdle coincided with news yesterday
that the Commission has opened an inquiry into a surge of Russian aluminium
imports into the EC, acting on a complaint from French producers.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Saved pits could start to close within year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL executives expect to start closing some of the 12 reprieved
pits within a year even if the company secures deals to sell extra coal to
the electricity generators.
They believe further pit closures and redundancies will be inevitable around
April next year because of a fall in sales to generators from that month,
and fear they may be forced to act sooner.
'Even if we can negotiate good supplementary deals with the generators,
there are severe doubts about whether all 12 can survive a year,' one
executive said.
Problems will increase significantly in April 1994 because contracts about
to be signed with generators include a 25 per cent sales drop from then, he
said.
Similarly pessimistic views were being expressed privately yesterday by a
range of senior British Coal employees. Their comments will add substance to
charges by the Labour party and trade unions that the coal white paper,
published on Thursday, was a short-term fix aimed solely at ending a Tory
backbench revolt over earlier plans to close 31 pits.
An early test of miners' feelings will come next week after the politically
moderate Union of Democratic Mineworkers decided yesterday to hold a strike
ballot over the government's revised pit closure plans under which 19 of the
31 mines will either close or cease significant production.
The Labour party said yesterday that in Monday's parliamentary debate on
coal it would be calling for existing volumes of production to be
maintained. It will also urge that the House of Commons adopts the recent
report on coal by the trade and industry select committee which called for a
larger market for coal than the government has created.
The government seems certain to survive the vote but will face renewed
criticism if, as seems likely, the negotiations between British Coal and the
generators fail to secure a future beyond Christmas for all 12 reprieved
pits.
The manager of one of the reprieved mines said yesterday: 'There are two
other mines in this area which have been reprieved. At least one of us will
close within a year.'
In the next few days British Coal and the electricity generators and
regional power companies are likely to sign 'core contracts' involving 40m
tonnes of coal for the year from April 1 and 30m in the subsequent four
years.
It could take months, however, to conclude contracts for additional tonnages
aimed at keeping open the 12 reprieved pits. The level of subsidies, needed
to satisfy generator demands that British Coal provides coal at world
prices, is to be determined and this will have a crucial effect on how much
coal the generators commit themselves to.
The potential will be restricted by white paper provisions that British Coal
must license to the private sector any pits it does not want. All of this
could mean British Coal would have to settle for an extra 10m tonnes of
sales in each of the two years the subsidies are likely to last and less
still beyond that.
Increasing productivity means some of the additional coal could be mined
from the 19 pits whose short-term future was always secure. 'We are going to
have to fight to keep more than a handful of the reprieved pits open after
1995,' said one executive.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Yeltsin rivals urge compromise: Russian deputies draw back
from threatened impeachment of president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAIN opponents of Russian president Mr Boris Yeltsin yesterday proposed
various forms of compromise at an extraordinary Congress of Peoples'
Deputies and expressed horror at the prospect of impeaching him.
In his own speech to the Congress, more confidently delivered than most of
his recent public statements, Mr Yeltsin insisted on the need for a popular
vote on trust in himself and on a new draft constitution on April 25.
Pressing his case that he held the Russian people to be the 'highest court',
he challenged the sullen hall of deputies to put the question of trust in
the Congress to the test in the same referendum. The Congress adjourned
without making any decisions and is due to resume today.
In Washington yesterday, President Bill Clinton expressed hope that Russia
might be moving towards resolving its crisis. 'Things look pretty good
today,' he said, before talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany. Mr
Kohl warned that the west might have to rearm if Mr Yeltsin lost his
struggle.
In Mr Yeltsin's cabinet reshuffle, three ministers lost their posts in moves
which strengthen the position of Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime minister
for finance and the economy.
Mr Vasily Barchuk was told to vacate the finance minister's office for the
Russian embassy in Norway; Mr Andrei Nechayev was relieved of the economics
portfolio; and Mr Boris Saltykov, a deputy prime minister, was demoted to
science minister.
Further appointments are likely to be made, according to Mr Alexander
Shokhin, deputy prime minister for foreign economic affairs. These are
likely to come from the so-called centre-ground of politics, and the search
is on for centrists who can be bent to the will of the radicals.
The economic line of the cabinet is likely to be retained - indeed, measures
approved by the cabinet on Thursday, including tightening credit and raising
interest rates, indicate a more radical turn. Mr Yeltsin called for more
emphasis on social support and said the crisis had been deepened by
government mistakes.
The shift by the opposition to a position of statesmanlike compromise was
led by Mr Valery Zorkin, chairman of the Constitutional Court, in his
favoured role as political broker. Mr Zorkin had led the attack on the
president's call to the nation for backing in a plebiscite, which he said
was unconstitutional.
Yesterday, Mr Zorkin told deputies impeachment of Mr Yeltsin could be
catastrophic. He produced a 10-point programme which would reshape the
constitution to give the president a more powerful position, see the
parliament draw up a law on elections for a two-tier parliament and hold
elections for presidency and parliament in autumn.
Mr Yeltsin has not betrayed any enthusiasm for imminent elections, but he
has said he is not against them.
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the speaker, flatly made a speech of relative
moderation in which he blamed Mr Yeltsin for the political impasse but said
a compromise could and should be made.
General Alexander Rutskoi, the vice president who had opposed Mr Yeltsin's
appeal and claim to assume special powers, launched a ferocious attack on
the president's aides but then proposed an eight-point programme which
accorded in most respects with what Mr Yeltsin wanted - including a
plebiscite.
Regional and republican leaders who took the floor made clear that they
supported Mr Yeltsin.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Timex workforce takes arguments back to court: The
acrimonious background to today's appeal by the unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIMEX had to sack its entire manual workforce to save the business after
failing to reach agreement on settling an industrial dispute, Mr Peter Hall,
UK president of the company, said yesterday.
His decision sparked angry scenes outside the gates of the Dundee plant,
with 5,000 marching through the town in support of the Timex workers last
Saturday - 16 were arrested outside the plant on Monday in the worst
picket-line violence for seven years. At the same time the company has been
vigourosly pursuing its case through the courts.
The Court of Session in Edinburgh should today hear an appeal by the trade
unions against an interdict (injunction) banning mass picketing outside the
Dundee plant. Inside the factory, on an industrial estate on the edge of the
city, the newly hired labour force is assembling printed circuit boards and
other products. 'Output is rising and productivity is increasing,' says Mr
Hall. 'We will progressively strengthen the workforce as new contracts build
up in the coming months.'
The 200 newly hired manual workers have to run the gauntlet of about 150
sacked employees, most of them middle-aged women, as they arrived in two
chartered double-decker buses each morning. At 7.40am yesterday there were
ferocious shouts of 'scab' as the buses went through the gates, and staff
arriving by car were jeered.
Five weeks ago Mr Hall dismissed all 320 of Timex's hourly paid workers and
pronounced the industrial dispute which had led to a 20-day strike over. But
the demonstrators at the gate, whose ranks on Monday were swollen by
protestors including members of Militant from other parts of Scotland,
regard the issue as anything but dead.
'We're prepared to dig in for a long dispute,' says Mr Willie Lesslie deputy
shop stewards' convener, outside the gates. 'From what we hear it's a
complete shambles in there. Either they'll have to take us all back to get
production going again, or Timex will have to close the plant.'
The workers seem fairly sparse in the 150,000 sq ft plant but production is
visibly under way. The main role of the Dundee plant - an offshoot of Timex,
the unquoted US company whose main product is watches - is 'populating' or
installing tiny components onto printed circuit boards, the basic building
block of electronic products such as personal computers.
Mr Hall arrived in 1991 from the south of England, where he had managed two
engineering businesses which collapsed in the recession.
He says he tried to improve performance by quarterly briefings. The workers
already owned 10 per cent of Timex Electronics, the Scottish subsidiary
company, through a share scheme. There was pro-fit-sharing and an employee
director on the board.
At the end of 1992 the 13 shop stewards elected a new convener and deputy
convener, and two other members of the shop stewards' committee resigned. In
Mr Hall's view 'the link I had had with the workforce was broken.'
Outside the gates a man who has been sacked says: 'It's Hall that's created
this trouble. This was a contented place until he arrived. It's been
confrontation all along.'
New problems arose because of 'degradation' of the order book for the early
part of 1993. The unions demanded that the necessary cuts be spread by
rotation, management insisted on making a single group of workers redundant.
At the end of January most of the workforce went on strike.
After 21 days the workers agreed to go back to work under protest, but
rejected what Mr Hall calls a four-point peace plan which entailed job cuts
without rotation, a one year pay freeze, reduced fringe benefits and an
enhancement of the profit sharing scheme so that the employees would have
enjoyed 50 per cent of the plant's profits.
On February 17 Timex dismissed all the hourly paid workers, including 17 who
worked through the dispute. He said he had been advised by lawyers that he
had to sack all those who 'had an interest in the dispute'.
Timex recruited 200 new workers, some of whom had previously had temporary
jobs at the plant.
He says production did not stop after the sackings because of the efforts of
supervisors and other staff. The company is fortunate that this is normally
a low season for electronics subcontracting, but business is expected to be
strong in the second half of the year.
Timex points out that under employment laws the dismissed employees will be
eligible for rehiring three months after their sacking. It says it will
consider that when the time comes.
Many of those sacked had been with Timex for more than 20 years - some as
many as 36.

FT  26 MAR 93 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Sharp decline at BNB Resources
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 30th March 1993) appended to this article.
BNB Resources, the recruitment, training and advertising group, returned a
73 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 712,000 for 1992.
Mr David Norman, chairman, blamed a rise of Pounds 1m in rental costs and a
reduction of Pounds 1.2m in bank interest income. Barker's regional
communication side lost Pounds 446,000.
The core advertising business increased profits by 19 per cent to Pounds
2.46m despite volume decline in the market, said Mr Norman who expects
stabilisation, if not growth, in UK demand this year.
Turnover was up to Pounds 62.9m (Pounds 54.9m). A final dividend of 3.3p is
proposed for a maintained total of 4.9p uncovered by earnings per share of
3p (8.3p).
CORRECTION
BNB's core business is executive search, selection and recruitment
advertising. It was incorrectly identified in last Friday's edition.

with Coca-Cola soon
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FEMSA, Mexico's largest drinks company, could conclude negotiations with
Coca-Cola over selling a minority stake in its soft-drinks division in two
or three weeks, according to Mr Othon Ruiz, the company's director-general,
writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City.
Mr Ruiz said Coca-Cola was seeking to buy 30 to 49 per cent of the soft
drinks division, which would then be spun off from Femsa and listed
separately on the Mexican stock market through an initial public offering
(IPO). Once an agreement is concluded the new company will be an anchor
bottling operation for all Latin America, including Brazil.
Femsa and Coca-Cola have reached agreement on the business plan of the new
company, the nature of the joint agreement, and the franchise agreement the
company would have with Coca-Cola. The only issue to be resolved was price,
with the two sides 'close'. Baring Research estimates the soft drinks
division is worth around Dollars 600m.
Mr Ruiz said once the Coca-Cola deal was finalised he would study the
possibility of similar joint venture for the beer division.
There is no question, he said, that Miller is the most probable partner. 'We
need to be ready in time for the North American Free Trade Agreement, which
comes into force on January 1 1994.'

Scientific experiments do not always produce the expected results. When
plant geneticists at Clemson University in South Carolina decided to develop
a pepper plant that was resistant to root knot, they also produced pepper
that is at least twice as strong as tabasco.
But the Charleston Hot, seeds of which will go on sale in the US from
Foundation Seeds Incorporated from the autumn, is not the hottest pepper
developed, says Philip Dukes, one of the developers of the plant. That
dubious claim to fame is held by a Japanese pepper. Foundation Seeds: US,

FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Pittard hit by higher sheepskin prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARPLY HIGHER sheepskin prices hit profits at Pittard Garner, the leather
company, which yesterday reported a 16 per cent drop at the pre-tax level to
Pounds 1.76m for the year to December 31.
Mr David McDonald, chairman, said the price of sheepskins had almost doubled
between September and December. This was partly due to the effects of
devaluation which made UK sheepskin more attractive to foreign buyers,
consequently driving up the price. He said, however, there would be a
benefit from devaluation in the current year.
Sales in the year fell just 1 per cent to Pounds 96.8m. However, after the
disposal or closure of the fellmongery and tanning businesses, continuing
operations showed a 5 per cent growth in turnover.
Having warned at the interim stage that trading would be difficult, Mr
McDonald said second half profits had been 'a disappointing setback'.
The clothing and chamois division had suffered operating losses of about
Pounds 900,000 amid weak demand. Nevertheless, Pittard was committed to this
division in the long-term, he said.
The gloving division increased sales and operating profits by 10 per cent on
the back of better overseas sales.
The shoe and leather goods operation showed a 25 per cent increase in
profit, although Mr McDonald said 1991 had been depressed by losses from the
tanning business, now closed. On a comparable basis profits were maintained
at similar levels.
The final dividend is held at 1.5p, for a total of 2p (1.5p). Earnings fell
from 6.4p to 4.7p per share.

FT  26 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Redland reverse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of a rising tax charge in this year and in 1994 and an
uncovered dividend served to reverse an early rise in Redland shares. They
were strong at first, climbing to 499p after revealing a 19 per cent
increase in in preliminary profits and a maintained dividend.
But following the meeting with the company, the shares came under heavy
pressure as some analysts cast doubts over the dividend and took a bearish
stance on the outlook in Germany, one of Redland's real successes this year.
The shares dipped to the day's low point of 459p before picking up to close
a net 21 off at 467p. Turnover was above 5.3m shares.
Other building specialists pointed out, however, that much of the selling in
Redland reflected profit-taking after the stock's 15 per cent outperformance
over the past quarter. 'If one accepts the dividend will be maintained, the
stock offers a highly attractive 6.7 per cent yield,' said one.
Headline Book Publishing jumped 12 to 258p after better than expected
profits - up 58 per cent - and the 20 per cent increase in final dividend.
Analysts were nudging future profits estimates higher yesterday's figures.
Both leisure and drinks stocks were affected by the UBS Phillips and Drew
programme trade. Among these, Bass retreated 12 to 549p, Whitbread 9 to 461p
and Grand Metropolitan 5 to 451p, although the latter did rally on US
support.
There was good two-way business in hotel stocks. Queens Moat Houses was
steady at 45p in turnover of 9.8m and Forte slipped a penny to 197p on 6.1m
traded.
While results from Booker were in line with expectations, analysts did not
like the details, in particular the gearing figure and the cautious note
struck on food distribution at the company meeting. The shares fell sharply
and continued to come off for most of the day, finishing 29 down at 410p.
Food specialists said the fall had made the stock attractive on a yield
basis and that a correction may be due. One analyst said that while the pain
had been felt in the results for 1992, worries about longer-term earnings
growth remained.
A profits warning from Dalepak Food sent the shares tumbling, closing 63
down at 201p, after touching 194p. Argyll Group found some support from
NatWest Securities and Lehman Brothers and the shares rose 4 to 348p. Asda
retreated 1 3/4 p to 69 1/2 p with some suggestions in the market that
recent sales talk growth may have been exaggerated.
Talk of a price war in the DIY market rumbled on, hitting related stocks in
its wake. Boots fell 9 to 499p and WH Smith dropped 14 to 410p. The two
groups own Do It All. Ladbroke, owner of Texas, shed 4 to 195p. However,
Kingfisher, owner of B&amp;Q, basked in post-results comments and rose 6 to
550p.
Shares in Laird Group, car components and industrial products, put on 4 to
280p, on speculation, confirmed shortly after the market closed, that it is
to pay a second interim dividend of 6.3 p next month, instead of a final
payment, making a total of 10.5p for 1992. Market watchers said the move was
related to the revised ACT rules announced in the Budget earlier this month.
A 22 per cent profits fall and unfavourable analysts' meeting sent shares in
APV, the food manufacturing equipment maker, tumbling. They gave up 11 to
101p, having been lower earlier in the session as analysts reduced current
year estimates.
Trading worries, general profit-taking and a broker's sell recommendation
combined to exact a toll on Weir Group, the Glasgow- based engineering
company, which reported a 14.5 per cent improvement in profits earlier this
week. The shares gave up 11 to 638p. NatWest Securities advised investors to
sell saying the company, 'will not so much disappoint as fail to provide the
acceleration in earnings growth that will be essential during the recovery
phase to avoid the shares underperforming.'
Lines of shares were said to have been available in several stocks in the
engineering and aerospace sectors. These included Siebe which closed 4
lighter at 445p, and TI Group, also down 3 at 299p. Smiths Industries also
suffered from the same fate with a block of around 250,000 said to have been
looking for a home. The shares closed 2 off at 334p.
Merchant banks fell heavily on profit-taking. Hambros, unsettled by news
that the Norwegian Guarantee Institute is appealing against a judgement for
Hambros relating to the collapse of the Reksten shipping firm in the late
1970's, dropped 19 to 332p. Schroders non-voting stock fell 68 to 1495p,
Kleinwort Benson 8 to 385p and SG Warburg 15 to 626p.
The NatWest Securities buy recommendation continued to drive BT shares
higher. They closed 10 1/2 up at 430 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 14m shares.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Occidental in Dollars 34m deal
to explore for oil in Peru

<TEXT>
THE PERUVIAN arm of US-owned Occidental Oil and Gas Corporation has signed a
USDollars 34m exploration contract with state oil company Petroperu.
The contract awards exploration rights for six years over an 880,000-hectare
(2.2m-acre) area of the Peruvian Amazon, attractive for its proximity to the
north eastern oil pipeline.
Occidental is Peru's oldest established private operator, responsible for
almost half of the country's present crude output of about 120,000 barrels a
day.
The signing underlines a new willingness by the Peruvian state to speed up
approval for contracts with private operators. Petroperu's president, Mr
Jaime Quijandria, points out that Peru, although almost virgin territory in
oil terms, 'is not the only petroleum-rich country in the region, nor the
most important. We have to compete for investment with Ecuador and Colombia
to name but two'.
Petroperu aims to sign exploration contracts worth a total of at least
USDollars 110m a year until the end of the century, according to Mr
Quijandria. This will boost both the flagging reserves position and current
output. 'Peru must aim at supplying all its internal oil requirements and
becoming a medium-sized exporter,' he says.

COCA-Cola, the US soft-drinks group, is pumping a further Dollars 150m into
China to extend its bottling capacity inland to take advantage of growing
affluence in the hinterland.
The projects - which will involve building plants or upgrading existing ones
 -will be in 10 inland cities, including Xi'an, Wuhan and Shenyang. This
will bring the company's total investment in China to about Dollars 250m by
1998.
'This time we've picked 10 inland cities because we think they've all got
great potential. People in those cities are quickly becoming more affluent,'
said Mr BC Lo, of Coca-Cola China, based in Hong Kong.
Coca-Cola signed a memorandum of understanding last month with China's
ministry of light industry to extend its activities deeper into the country.
Coca-Cola is one of the largest foreign investors in China. Its 13 bottling
plants, located mainly in coastal cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin,
Guangzhou, as well as Beijing and Nanjing, produce 75m cases of soft drink
annually.

FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Pick 'n Pay ahead 10% at R93m in
tough trading

PICK 'n Pay Stores, South Africa's largest supermarket chain, yesterday
posted a 10 per cent rise in net profits to R93m (Dollars 29.3m) for the
year to February 1993, from R84.4m the year before, Reuter reports from Cape
Town.
Earnings per share advanced to 59.3 cents from 53.9 cents - taking account
of a two-for-one share split last November. The directors have recommended a
final dividend of 26.25 cents a share, making 33.5 cents for the year,
against 28.75 cents the previous year.
Trading profits moved up to R146.2m, from R131.2m, on turnover R510,000
ahead at R6.42bn. After net interest income of R13.9m, against R3.4m, and
investment income of R1.2m, compared with R11.2m, pre-tax profits emerged
R22.3m higher at R161.3m. Tax took R68.3m, compared with R54.6m.
The group expects tough trading conditions for at least another year but is
confident it can show continued earnings growth, AP-DJ reports.
Mr Raymond Ackerman, chairman and chief executive said a staff productivity
deal was likely and 10 new stores were planned. A 4 per cent rise in South
Africa's value added tax could depress consumer spending briefly, but
inflation was falling and turnover growth of 8 to 10 per cent would be
enough to keep ahead of inflation, rather than the 10 to 15 per cent needed
recently.

<TEXT>
NCC, the Swedish property and construction group, slumped to a SKr1.22bn
(Dollars 157m) loss in 1992 after property write-downs of SKr1.4bn.
The group was also hit by SKr417m in losses from associate companies,
including the stainless steel group Avesta Sheffield and the shipping
company Effjohn. It is scrapping its dividend after paying out SKr2 per
share in 1991, when its loss was SKr122m.
NCC said its result before property write-downs and excluding associate
companies improved to SKr587m from SKr430m despite weak construction markets
and falling rent levels. Its rationalisation programme, which has cut 4,300
jobs, had started to yield results, with overheads down by more than
SKr500m.
The construction division improved profits to SKr811m from SKr742m, while
real estate operations returned a SKr88m profit before write-downs, against
a SKr25m loss in 1991. The international division recorded a reduced loss of
SKr20m, compared with SKr128m.
NCC has written down its property portfolio by SKr1.8bn in the past two
years. The latest write-down was bigger than its forecast of SKr700m-SKr1bn.

<TEXT>
SWISSAIR, the Swiss national airline, said it would halve the dividends on
its shares and dividend right certificates following unsatisfactory 1992
results.
While group net profits rose more than one-third to SFr113m (Dollars 75.3m),
the gain was mainly due to sales of aircraft and profits from ancillary
activities. For the third consecutive year, flight operations were in loss.
Group revenues rose 4.7 per cent to SFr6.4bn. Traffic volume increased 9.1
per cent to 2.7bn revenue tonne kilometres, but the parent airline company's
revenues were up only 2.7 per cent to SFr5.5bn.
The airline's net profit, including proceeds from aircraft sales, fell 54
per cent to SFr20.8m. The directors proposed SFr10 per share on the shares
and SFr2 per certificate.
Leu Holding, the private banking subsidiary within the financial group built
around Credit Suisse, said its consolidated net profit rose 14 per cent last
year to SFr104m.

</HEADLINE>

   MUNICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BMW is escaping the worst of the downturn afflicting the German motor
industry, Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, the group's chief executive said
yesterday.
Mr von Kuenheim, who later this year will take over as chairman of BMW's
supervisory board after 24 years as chief executive, said the group made an
operating profit in the first three months of the year - in stark contrast
to other German car manufacturers which have plunged into operating losses.
Whilst both sales and production dropped over the three months, Mr von
Kuenheim said that the drop was significantly less than that of the German
market overall, where car registrations were likely to fall by 25 per cent
over the year.
BMW's turnover was down by 6.4 per cent to DM7.3bn (Dollars 4.6bn) in the
first quarter compared to the same period last year and car production
slipped by 4.9 per cent to 150,500 units. Car deliveries fell 5.7 per cent
to 133,000.
Last week, BMW reported net profits for last year down to DM726m from
DM783m, although turnover climbed almost 5 per cent to DM31.2bn.
BMW said that currency movements had been the chief factor behind the
downturn: the appreciation of the mark in the latter months of last year had
shaved DM200m to DM300m from operating profits. These were down to DM1.48bn
last year from DM1.75bn in 1991.
The BMW group delivered a record 594,895 cars last year, 42,235 more than in
1991. The US saw sharp growth where deliveries rose by more than 20 per cent
to 66,000. BMW said yesterday that it expected US sales to increase by at
least 10,000 cars this year.

FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Low first pay-out for Italian
bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISTITUTO Bancario San Paolo di Torino, Italy's biggest banking group in
terms of assets, closed its first year as a listed company with a
L300-a-share dividend, appreciably below some forecasts made at the time of
the flotation.
Although the bank had indicated a dividend of up to L400 a share, some
analysts had set their sights even higher. The eventual pay-out reflects the
effects of unexpected tax increases, which cut earnings by around L35bn
(Dollars 22m) at parent bank level, and heavier loan loss provisions owing
to the recession.
The impact of tax and credit problems stood out at group level, where net
profits after minority interests fell by about 7 per cent to L502bn from a
pro forma L553bn in 1991. Provisions amounted to L647bn, while write-downs
on securities and shareholdings reached L224bn. Overall group pre-tax income
rose 8 per cent to L1,232bn.
Net profits for the parent bank increased by 2 per cent to L390bn, while
pre-tax earnings jumped by 17 per cent to L779bn, in spite of loan loss
provisions of L520bn and write downs on securities of L120bn.
Group deposits climbed by 12.4 per cent to L170,500bn, while direct lending
to clients went up to L89,755bn. The effect of recession was made clear in
the rise in non-performing loans to 3.38 per cent of the total loan book
from 2.84 per cent in 1991.
Credito Italiano, one of the prime candidates on Italy's privatisation list,
suffered a steep fall in net profits to L208bn from L289bn in 1991. Group
net earnings dropped to L202.2bn from L297bn.
The falls, reflecting sharply lower earnings at most Italian banks last
year, were particularly marked in the case of Credito Italiano, the
country's sixth-biggest financial institution, on account of its prominent
role in securities.
Rising interest rates in the later months of 1992 triggered steep falls in
government bond prices, leading to expectations - now realised - of heavy
write-downs on many banks' securities portfolios.
Credito Italiano wrote down L243bn on its securities holdings - the largest
figure reported by any bank in the current results season. However, the
dividend is being maintained at L85 for ordinary shares and L100 for savings
stock.
The bank escaped relatively lightly on loan losses, which have risen sharply
elsewhere. The proportion of non-performing loans in Credito Italiano's
total portfolio rose to 2.01 per cent from 1.99 per cent in 1991.
Gross operating profits, which rose 16.5 per cent to L1,123bn, were helped
by a 19.1 per cent surge in the bank's interest margin to L2,388bn.

FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: VNU hit by provision on printing
unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
VNU, the Dutch publisher, said a large provision needed for its printing
division caused 1992 net profit to tumble by nearly 60 per cent to Fl 47.9m
(Dollars 26.2m).
The company, which is engaged in talks on trying to sell part of its
printing operations, said it planned to maintain its dividend at Fl 3.60
because the Fl 80m printing provision was a one-off item and also because
most of its businesses saw improved performances last year.
If it had not been for the provision, VNU's net profit would have risen by
just under 10 per cent to Fl 127.9m.
VNU, which released its figures after the close of bourse trading, said the
value of its printing operations had had to be 'substantially adjusted' to
reflect changed prospects.
It cited in particular the series of currency devaluations elsewhere in
Europe which have affected export markets.
Operating profit rose by 18.2 per cent to Fl 241.2m, on turnover that was
steady at Fl 2.74bn.
VNU attributed the profit rise to reorganisations and cost-cutting measures
as well as to lower paper prices and profits contributed by acquisitions.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Barclays loses finance director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER WOOD, finance director of Barclays, is to leave the UK bank and
join Standard Chartered, Barclays said yesterday. The announcement came the
day after Barclays had disclosed it intended to appoint a chief executive
from outside.
Mr Wood, 50, who would have been a contender to take over as chief executive
of Barclays if it had wanted an internal appointment, made no comment on the
reason for his departure. Both banks said he had been talking to Standard
since January.
Barclays appointed Mr Oliver Stocken, finance director of its BZW investment
banking division, to succeed Mr Wood from May 1. Mr Andrew Buxton, Barclays'
chairman and chief executive, said the bank was 'sorry to lose' Mr Wood.
Mr Wood will succeed Mr Richard Stein, who is retiring as a director from
June 30. Mr Rodney Galpin, Standard chairman, welcomed Mr Wood's 'wide and
varied experience in one of the world's leading banking groups'.
Barclays emphasised yesterday that talks about Mr Wood's appointment had
predated its announcement on Wednesday that it will undertake a worldwide
search for someone to take on Mr Buxton's role as chief executive while he
remains chairman.
Mr Wood's approach to Standard came after Mr Buxton disclosed that he
intended to split his two roles, and might seek a chief executive from
outside. Institutional shareholders had pressed for a division of roles.
'I would like to do it as quickly as we can, but it is not going to be that
easy. There are not that many candidates,' says Sir Denys Henderson, the
non-executive director of Barclays Bank who is leading the effort to find a
new chief executive.
Sir Denys says the bank has 'some very competent' people at the top. But the
decision to look outside sends a signal to the heads of Barclays' three
divisions. These are the huge banking division, which has Pounds 98bn
(Dollars 145bn) of the bank's Pounds 149bn assets, the BZW investment bank,
and service businesses.
Other internal contenders to become chief executive would have been Mr
Alastair Robinson, head of the banking division, and Mr David Band, head of
its BZW investment bank.
Sir Denys believes the successful candidate will probably come from a bank
or a financial services company. 'If some genius appears who had done a good
job elsewhere, and could cope with the change of industry, then we would
consider him,' he said.
Appointing someone from a competitor would carry a serious risk of offending
the remaining senior managers. That might make it tempting to bring in the
senior manager of a large US bank that has already recovered from similar
difficulties with property-related lending.
Barclays' ordinary shares closed 1p down at 414p, and Standard's fell 3p to
710p.

FT  26 MAR 93 / UN effort to halt Bosnia onslaught
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia, General Philippe Morillon,
arrived in Belgrade yesterday to try to stop a Bosnian Serb onslaught in
eastern Bosnia.
Bosnian Serbs were reported to be poised last night to overrun the besieged
Moslem enclaves of Srebrenica and Zepa, which would force a refugee exodus
and prove a serious reversal for the international peace plan granting the
area to Moslems.
Gen Morillon's visit to the Serbian capital reflected a belief that the
Serbian president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, would be able to exert pressure on
ethnic Serb forces in neighbouring Bosnia.
'I have come to ask him to help me implement every demand. The most urgent
being a permanent ceasefire and an air corridor around Srebrenica . . . If
that cannot be achieved I will be obliged to report back to the security
council,' the French general said.
In an earlier meeting with Mr Milosevic, Mr Jose Maria Mendiluce, the
special envoy of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) tried to win
access for relief organisations to Srebrenica, where up to 60,000 Moslems
have been trapped for nearly eleven months by a Serb siege. Despite
assurances from Mr Milosevic that he would lend his influence to get UN
access, a UNHCR official said: 'We are not terribly optimistic. We have been
given such assurances in the past which have not borne fruit.'
A UN official yesterday warned that Srebrenica was in imminent danger of
falling to Bosnian Serb forces.
At the same time Sarajevo radio said Serb forces had launched an attack on
Zepa, a smaller Moslem enclave, south-west of Srebrenica.
Mr Cedric Thornberry, deputy head of the UN operation in Bosnia, said the
Serb seizure of Srebrenica would have serious political and humanitarian
consequences.
'The Bosnian Serb army is moving forward steadily within the area, taking
village after village. I am afraid that if there is not a ceasefire the
whole of that pocket could fall within 15-20 days,' he said.
Serb leaders on Wednesday had agreed to an evacuation of wounded Moslem
soldiers and civilians from Srebrenica in exchange for Serbs from Tuzla, the
Bosnian government stronghold. But the helicopter relief operation was
suspended after Serb shelling killed at least three people and injured
several, including two Canadian UN soldiers.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Bonn seeks way round ban on military action abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bonn government has agreed to keep German crews on board reconnaissance
aircraft over the Adriatic if the UN Security Council decides to enforce a
no-fly zone over Bosnia - but the decision will immediately be challenged in
the constitutional court by the minority coalition partner.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, vice-chancellor and senior member of
the Free Democratic Party in the government, will allow his party colleagues
to appeal against the decision approved by Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
In the meantime, German crews will not be allowed to fly on missions
providing information for UN enforcement. They will, however, be allowed to
prepare the Awacs aircraft.
The court will be asked to consider whether keeping German crews on the
reconnaissance aircraft offends against the constitution or not. Hitherto,
that document has been interpreted to prohibit the use of any German
military personnel on active operations outside the Nato area.
Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats insist that the constitution is not clear in
its prohibition. The FDP and the opposition Social Democrats insist that
such missions require a full constitutional amendment, which the SPD has
refused to endorse.
Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, parliamentary leader of the SPD, yesterday condemned
the delicate manoeuvre as 'simply ridiculous', and a 'crazy piece of
government trickery'. A colleague called it 'an early joke for April Fool's
Day'.
Even Mr Otto Lambsdorff, the leader of the FDP, said it was absurd and
remarkable. But he, like Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the parliamentary leader of
the CDU, roundly blamed the opposition for forcing them into it: it was the
refusal of the SPD to agree a constitutional amendment which left the
coalition condemned to contortion.
Lawyers warn that the court may simply refer the issue back to Bonn for a
constitutional amendment.

FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Merrill Lynch alters structure
of top management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MERRILL LYNCH, the largest US securities firm, has shuffled its top
management structure, creating an office of the chairman, to focus on
developing client relationships, and an office of the chief executive, to
run the company on a day-to-day basis.
However, the shake-up has left unclear the answer to one of the more
intriguing personnel questions on Wall Street - who is likely to succeed Mr
Daniel Tully as president and chief executive of the group?
Mr Tully is due to become Merrill's chairman in June on the retirement of Mr
William Schreyer, chairman since 1985.
The restructuring, Merrill's third in three years, comes at a time of
intensifying competition in broking - demonstrated by the recent merger
agreement between rivals Smith, Barney and Shearson - and investment
banking, an area where Merrill has big ambitions.
Mr Tully said the new structure was the 'next logical step in Merrill's
strategic evolution over the past two decades from a sales-oriented
organisation to a marketing-oriented, client-focused financial management
and advisory company'.
The office of the chairman includes Messrs Schreyer and Tully along with Mr
Stephen Hammerman, vice-chairman, and Mr John Heimann, chairman of global
financial institutions.
It involves two other men who have been given new titles: Mr Barry
Friedberg, head of the investment banking group since 1985, becomes
chairman, investment banking.
Mr Thomas Patrick, previously executive vice-president, equity markets
group, becomes chairman, special advisory services, in charge of liaising
with clients on new product ideas.
The executive office includes Mr Tully, Mr Hammerman, and Mr John Steffens,
executive vice-president for the private client group, along with two other
men given new titles: Mr Herbert Allison becomes executive vice-president
for investment banking and Mr David Komansky becomes executive
vice-president for both the debt and equities markets groups.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Yeltsin unlikely to be impeached as rival retreats: Speaker
promises qualified co-operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and DMITRI VOLKOV
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE IMPEACHMENT of Russian president Mr Boris Yeltsin appeared unlikely last
night after his main political rival Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov made a surprise
about-turn on his demands for such a move.
However, a direct confrontation between the president and parliament is
still possible at today's Congress of the People's Deputies.
The turnround by Mr Khasbulatov, speaker of the conservative-dominated
parliament, came when he remarked that 'frankly speaking, I'm no supporter
of impeachment'. This follows his declaration on Tuesday that the case for
impeachment was 'as clear as day'.
Mr Sergei Shakhrai, deputy prime minister, said he expected the parliament
instead to invoke a clause of the constitution which strips the president of
his powers if he attempts to disband or suspend other elected institutions.
The deputies, said Mr Shakhrai, would be invited by Mr Khasbulatov to
resolve to bring this clause into play if Mr Yeltsin continued his
confrontation with them - and would clarify the clause by laying down that,
in that case, the office of president would pass to General Alexander
Rutskoi, currently vice-president.
Mr Yeltsin, however, is using the special powers he granted himself under a
decree published on Wednesday which forbids anybody but the Constitutional
Court to countermand his instructions. The government met yesterday to adopt
a package of priority measures on the economy under the president's
instructions.
Interfax news agency reported that these included a plan to delay for six
months the repayment of foreign debt while emergency stabilisation measures
are in effect. No elaboration of this was immediately available. A fund
would would be established to stabilise the rouble, drawn from existing
foreign exchange reserves and international credits.
A new 8 per cent per month interest rate will be set by the central bank and
a rigid limit on credits from the central bank, and a simplification of the
system of selling land to the population will be introduced.
Mr Yeltsin, speaking on television last night, said that 'an attempt to
remove the president is being made behind the back of the voters'. Claiming
the support of the executives of most of the regions and republics within
Russia, Mr Yeltsin said: 'The more the Congress meets, the more the people
are alarmed.' He promised to put a stop to it.
In a prior televised interview, Mr Khasbulatov said that 'we cannot let the
executive authorities concentrate all power in their hands'. In an extended
attack on 'shock therapy', the radical economic reform the government is now
attempting to put in place, Mr Khasbulatov promised co-operation with Mr
Yeltsin if he would change the economic course and stabilise prices.
Mr Shakhrai, in his detailed rehearsal of the Congress's expected tactics,
said that it would attempt to wrest control of a referendum proposed by Mr
Yeltsin for April 25. It would call elections for the presidency and
parliament for June 12, and have the Supreme Soviet - the smaller permanent
parliament - prepare an electoral law.
Then, forecast Mr Shakhrai, the Congress would be reconvened on June 10 in
order to cancel elections. The deputy prime minister said: 'Since we have
their scenario we are able to plan our counter measures' - but he refused to
reveal his next move.
The continued gulf between the two sides, and the determination of Mr
Yeltsin to continue with his version of the referendum - seeking support for
his measures and a new constitution - now makes any successful compromise
unlikely.
Many deputies nonetheless expect further attempts at a deal to be made
during the Congress today or, if prolonged, at the weekend.
Elections in the near future have the rhetorical support of all sides but
they differ on the form of a referendum, the need for a new constitution,
the powers of the president in the period leading up to the elections and
the programme of the government.

<TEXT>
LAST NIGHT the government secured a majority of 195 (275-80) to defeat a
Labour backbench amendment to prevent Britain joining other members of the
EC in January next year in the second stage of economic and monetary union,
Ivor Owen writes.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, denied that entry
into stage two would imply acceptance of stage three, involving the creation
of a single European currency and a central European bank.
During stage two, he said, monetary policy would remain the responsibility
of national governments.
He gave an assurance that provisions in the Maastricht treaty ensured that
the Bank of England retained its present condition indefinitely 'unless and
until we choose to move to stage three'.

FT  26 MAR 93 / The Coal White Paper: Electricity users may avoid pool
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RELIEF was expressed in the gas, electricity and nuclear industries after
the government confirmed it had rejected radical solutions suggested by some
contributors to the coal review.
Mr Michael Heseltine refused to restrict the growth of gas-fired power
generation to increase the market for coal, although he has provided a
subsidy for coal to compete with world prices.
He confirmed the timetable for increasing competition into the electricity
market from 1994 to achieve a fully open market by 1998. There will be no
restriction on sales of electricity from France.
Mr Heseltine did say he was considering allowing large energy users, such as
British Steel and ICI, to bypass the electricity pool or wholesale market,
striking direct contracts with generators and avoiding the fluctuations in
pool prices. In addition, the pool authorities are considering whether to
give large users a cost incentive to shift their electricity demands to
off-peak periods.
There was also relief for the Nuclear Industry. The government said it saw
no reason to force Nuclear Electric to close its Magnox stations, but is
bringing the nuclear review forward by a year.
Gas-fired generators say gas can compete with subsidised coal.
'It's the best we could have expected, given that there is a need for
transitional arrangements for coal,' said Mr David Lewis, director of Enron
Europe, the UK arm of the large US gas company.
Enron will now press ahead with talks on building two additional gas-fired
power stations at an investment of Pounds 800m. The company is bringing its
1,800MW station at Teesside on stream by the end of March.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Bosnian Moslems and Croats sign final peace papers:
Milosevic offers to host ceasefire talks between UN and Serbs

A BREAKTHROUGH in the Bosnian peace negotiations in New York, and a call by
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia for a negotiated ceasefire, last
night provided the first real hope for months of an end to the year-long
conflict in Bosnia.
Bosnian Moslem and Croat leaders last night signed the remaining documents
in the peace package proposed by international mediators. But the Bosnian
Serbs maintained their refusal to endorse the most controversial elements of
the peace plan, notably the map of the 10 semi-autonomous provinces into
which Bosnia would be divided.
It was nevertheless the first significant development in the negotiations in
New York chaired by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen since all the warring
Bosnian parties endorsed the mediators' constitutional framework for Bosnia
in Geneva at the start of the year.
The United Nations Security Council last night welcomed the signing of the
documents and called for a 'cessation of hostilities by all parties' in
Bosnia. It said it stood ready to take the 'steps required' to bring a peace
settlement - an indication it could tighten economic and political sanctions
if necessary to put pressure on the Serbs.
After talks with General Philippe Morillon, the commander of UN forces in
Bosnia, Mr Milosevic offered to host ceasefire talks between Gen Morillon
and Gen Ratko Mladic, the commander of the Bosnian Serb army in Belgrade
today.
'We want to support efforts . . . for a complete ceasefire in
Bosnia-Hercegovina,' Mr Milosevic said. He has voiced similar sentiments
before, and the real test of his sincerity will be the extent to which he is
prepared to put pressure on both Gen Mladic and Mr Radovan Karadzic, the
Bosnian Serb leader.
The immediate effect of yesterday's signing by Moslems and Croats of the
provincial map and interim arrangements for the administration of Bosnia
until elections are held, is to isolate Mr Karadzic.
In Washington, the White House, echoing a television interview given by
President Bill Clinton on Wednesday night, said that arming Bosnia's Moslems
would have to be an option to be considered if the Vance-Owen peace process
failed because of Serb intransigence.
However, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, cautioned against
the selective lifting of the UN arms embargo on the former Yugoslavia.
Among the objections to such a step were the difficulty of securing united
Security Council approval and the additional threats that might be posed to
existing humanitarian operations in Bosnia.
Instead, Mr Hurd envisaged a further tightening of the economic embargo on
the rump Yugoslavia, exempting only humanitarian supplies, but involving
air, sea and river blockades, particularly on the Danube, and the impounding
of cargoes.
After hesitating for many weeks, Mr Alijah Izetbegovic finally signed both
the map dividing Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces and the interim
arrangements covering the period between the conclusion of a peace
settlement and the holding of elections in Bosnia.

FT  26 MAR 93 / French battle for power heats up: Conservatives are aiming
to reduce Mitterrand's influence over policy
</HEADLINE>

FRENCH conservatives stepped up their efforts yesterday to curb the
influence of Mr Francois Mitterrand, the Socialist president, over the
government which they will form after Sunday's second round of parliamentary
elections.
Mr Jacques Chirac, head of the Gaullist RPR, which emerged as the biggest
single party in the first round last Sunday, challenged Mr Mitterrand's
claims on policymaking. He said in an interview with Le Figaro newspaper
that the conservatives 'did not intend to share power with defunct
socialism, but would exercise their responsibilities to the full'.
The RPR leader, who has this week led conservative calls for the president
to resign, is anxious to avoid a repetition of the last cohabitation between
1986 and 1988, when he was prime minister and Mr Mitterrand repeatedly
outmanoeuvred the conservatives.
Mr Chirac said the conservatives planned to control areas of policy
traditionally deemed to fall to the president, notably defence and foreign
affairs. He said this could involve France taking a more active role within
Nato.
Meanwhile Mr Mitterrand, who has fiercely rejected calls to resign, has
begun protecting his position. A number of French newspapers yesterday
published leaks from the president's staff of comments by him at the last
socialist cabinet meeting on Wednesday.
He is reported to have said he would not allow the conservatives to 'isolate
me, lock me up in a rat-trap, or slit my throat in the dark' and to have
warned that the return of the right would herald social chaos. 'When the
suburbs go up in flames, you will see riot police hitting young people,' he
was quoted as saying.
Mr Mitterrand's staff, responding to Mr Chirac's demands for his
resignation, have been stressing to the press that the president might not
choose an RPR candidate as prime minister if such a campaign continues.
Although Mr Chirac has made it clear that he does not want to be the next
premier, in case it jeopardises his chances in the 1995 presidential
election, he is anxious that the prime minister should come from the RPR
rather than the UDF, the other big conservative party.
Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the UDF leader who also hopes to be a
presidential candidate in 1995, tried to strengthen his party's claims on
the premiership. He said on French radio that the choice of prime minister
had 'never been mathematical' and that 'several figures in the UDF' would be
suitable candidates.
Mr Edouard Balladur, who was finance minister in the last cohabitation
government and is believed to be Mr Chirac's choice as premier, sought to
lower the political temperature, saying in a speech at Mans that an 'adult
tone should prevail in French politics'.

PROSPECTS for a breakthrough in the see-sawing Bosnian peace talks improved
last night after the Moslem president of Bosnia, Mr Alija Izetbegovic,
promised to sign a key part of the package drawn up by international
mediators.
The sudden improvement in the atmosphere of the talks, which only 24 hours
earlier had seemed close to collapse, came as the situation on the ground in
Bosnia took a turn for the worse.
Mr Cedric Thornberry, deputy head of the United Nations Protection Force in
the former Yugoslavia (Unprofor), told a news conference in Belgrade that
the eastern Bosnian Moslem town of Srebrenica, which has been under siege
for the past 11 months, could fall to the Bosnian Serbs within days.
'There are clear indications that the Bosnian Serb army has not just
strategic, but territorial ambitions in the whole area,' Mr Thornberry said.
The signal that serious progress at last appeared to have been made at the
negotiations in New York, chaired by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, was given
by the announcement that a plenary session of the conference would be held
later in the day.
The meeting, later postponed for some hours to give Mr Izetbegovic time to
consult his government colleagues in Sarajevo, would be the first
face-to-face meeting between the leaders of the warring parties during the
current round of talks.
It followed several hours of intensive negotiations on Wednesday night
between Mr Izetbegovic and Mr Mate Boban, the Bosnian Croat leader, who is
the only one of the three protagonists to have signed all three parts of the
proposed peace agreement.
During their meeting, the Moslem and Croat leaders agreed a number of minor
changes to the map of the 10 provinces into which Bosnia would be divided
under the Vance-Owen proposals. They also agreed to amendments to a fourth
document, the interim arrangements which will cover the period between the
conclusion of a settlement and the holding of elections.
Important as the Moslem and Croat acceptance of the peace plan would be, it
would not be workable without the signature of Dr Radovan Karadzic, the
Bosnian Serb leader, who has been held responsible by western governments
for most of the atrocities committed in Bosnia.
Yet the mediators had no illusions that Dr Karadzic, who was on the point of
returning home earlier this week after they had chided him for his negative
attitude, was any nearer to putting his name to an agreement.
According to Lord Owen, his position was far removed from that of the other
participants and he was still hoping to create an independent Bosnian Serb
state, which could eventually merge with a greater Serbia.
Mr Fred Eckhard, the conference spokesman, nevertheless described the latest
developments in New York as 'a sudden turn for the better'.

FT  26 MAR 93 / US House Speaker hits at Ulster violence
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Thomas Foley, Speaker of the US House of Representatives, yesterday
issued a vigorous condemnation of violence by both republican and unionist
terrorists in Northern Ireland and called for the resumption of political
talks on the province's future.
Coming from a prominent Roman Catholic politician of Irish ancestry, the
statement was warmly welcomed by the UK government, which has been nervous
about US policy on Northern Ireland since Mr Bill Clinton, in last year's
American presidential campaign, called for the appointment of a US special
envoy to the province.
Mr Foley attacked the bomb planted by the Irish Republican Army which last
week killled a child in Warrington as 'senseless savagery', and condemned
the bombing this week by the Ulster Freedom Fighters of homes of Sinn Fein
councillors in Northern Ireland.
But he also added blunt criticism of US groups which raise money for Irish
terrorist groups.
'These villainous attacks are a grim and signal lesson to anyone who,
through financial or other assistance, supports groups and organisations
supplying the wherewithal to perpetrate the terrorist's cowardly, despicable
attacks against humanity,' Mr Foley said.
British Prime Minister John Major tried to deflect Mr Clinton from
appointing a special envoy when he visited Washington last month, but the US
president said last week, during a visit by Irish Prime Minister Albert
Reynolds, that he was still giving 'serious consideration' to the idea.
Indeed, Mr Foley's name was one of those mentioned as a possible envoy,
although the speaker's office made it clear he was too busy shepherding Mr
Clinton's legislative programme through Congress to take on another role.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, yesterday warmly welcomed Mr
Foley's statement, calling his words 'very wise'.

law

<TEXT>
THE US has warned that Argentina must rapidly approve patent protection
legislation which has lingered since 1991 if it is to avoid being targeted
for trade sanctions.
On April 30, the US Trade Representative's office reviews progress worldwide
in intellectual property protection. US officials say the office could list
Argentina for sanctions under the US Trade Act's Section 301 unless the
Argentine congress approves the bill by the end of April. The UK, France,
Germany and Japan are also seeking patent protection.
Argentine pharmaceutical companies and their allies in the congress are
successfully resisting the pressure. On Wednesday, a key congressional
committee voted to postpone debate until Gatt's long-delayed Uruguay Round
ends.
Mr Pablo Challu, executive director of CILFA, a local laboratories' trade
body, said: 'We are not opposed to paying an adequate royalty.' He suggests
one tied to Argentina's share of pharmaceutical world trade, a sum he
estimates at Dollars 22m (Pounds 15.4m) a year, or 0.9 per cent of annual
sales of Dollars 2.6bn.
CILFA also demands that patent holders be denied a legal monopoly over
products they have developed, claiming that higher drug prices would cost
Argentina Dollars 500m a year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOKKER, the Dutch aircraft builder, yesterday announced plans for deep job
cuts in response to the continuing malaise in the civil aviation market.
The company, which is due to pass into the control of Germany's Deutsche
Aerospace (Dasa), is to eliminate 2,118 out of 12,500 jobs this year, mostly
through compulsory redundancies. Fokker said it did not expect demand for
new aircraft to begin reviving until 1995.
The job losses had been expected, particularly after the company said
several weeks ago that it was again reducing output to match lower sales
prospects. Production of the 50-seater turboprop Fokker 50 is to be cut to
20 a year from 27, while the number of new 100-seater Fokker 100s is to fall
to 40 from 59.
Fokker said that the job losses and other cost-cutting moves will generate
annual cost savings of Fl 270m (Pounds 103m). Wages represent some 70 per
cent of Fokker's production costs.
The company is also proposing to freeze the wages of its remaining workers.

Moscow
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN Chancellor Helmut Kohl will urge a big increase in US assistance for
President Boris Yeltsin's reform programmes, when he meets President Bill
Clinton for the first time today.
The precarious state of Mr Yeltsin's government is certain to be a dominant
theme of the talks, with both sides having outspokenly pledged support for
the Russian leader in his tussle with parliament.
Mr Kohl yesterday welcomed the US president's proposal for a 'concrete aid
programme' for Russia, which Germany has been urging for months, but
underlined that it is now up to the rest of the Group of Seven leading
industrialised nations to provide more finance.
'We expect our partners to get more actively involved than they have up till
now,' he told the German Bundestag shortly before leaving for Washington.
'We Germans have provided more than 50 per cent of all western help so far,
with more than DM80bn. . . But with that, we have already reached the limits
of what we can afford.'
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said yesterday that the US
aid programme for Russia that Mr Clinton plans to announce at his Vancouver
summit with Mr Yeltsin next month would concentrate on 'practical, tangible
down to earth, non-ideological programmes for prompt assistance to the
Russian people.'
Mr Christopher said Mr Andrei Kozyrev, his Russian counterpart, had
'pleaded' for technical assistance at the micro-economic level in his talks
in Washington this week.
US bilateral aid would focus on micro-economic programmes in fields such as
energy and housing, Mr Christopher said, acknowledging that in the past aid
for Russia had been 'halting and inadequate'.
Macro-economic assistance to stabilise the Russian economy and ward off
imminent hyperinflation would be primarily multilateral, and would be
announced by the G7 after the Vancouver summit.

FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Cuomo backs Murdoch bid to
acquire NY Post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE for the New York Post, the bankrupt tabloid newspaper, took a new
twist yesterday as it emerged that Mr Rupert Murdoch had won the support of
New York Governor Mario Cuomo and two US Senators in his bid to acquire The
Post.
Mr Murdoch, who owned The Post between 1976 and 1988, is seeking a waiver of
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulation that bans anyone from
owning both a newspaper and a television station in the same city. Mr
Murdoch's Fox television network owns a New York station.
Governor Cuomo, in a letter sent to Mr John Dingell, chairman of the
Congressional committee with jurisdiction over the FCC, argued in favour of
a waiver for Mr Murdoch, although he added: 'I anticipate that under the
prospective ownership of Rupert Murdoch I will continue to find myself at
odds with The Post's coverage.'
Mr Murdoch has the 'right of first refusal' to buy The Post if its present
owner - Mr Peter Kalikow, a bankrupt property developer - decides to sell.
The Post saga became more muddled still yesterday when another bidder for
the newspaper - Mr Steven Hoffenberg, the debt collector who is being sued
for fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) - was told by a
federal court judge to provide a full accounting of his personal and
business assets within 10 days or face arrest.
The unusual court order, which concerns Dollars 1.4m of cheques written by
Mr Hoffenberg to The New York Post and to a company he controls, came as Mr
Hoffenberg sought bankruptcy protection for five subsidiaries of his debt
collection agency - Towers Financial.
Mr Abe Hirschfeld, the car parks magnate who currently controls The Post and
was until recently Mr Hoffenberg's main partner, was meanwhile enmeshed in
yet another of what have become almost daily battles with Mr Pete Hamill,
the mutinous and yet highly popular editor of the newspaper.
The newspaper has been traumatised over the past fortnight by the arrival of
the 73-year-old Mr Hirschfeld, an eccentric who has sacked and re-hired a
number of staff, including Mr Hamill.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers cheered by Maastricht
progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MARATHON Commons sitting of more than 22 hours allowing for the detailed
discussion of the Maastricht bill was hailed by ministers yesterday as
having broken the back of the legislation's gruelling passage through
parliament.
In spite of the procedural victory, however, the government still faces
serious difficulties on outstanding amendments to the legislation, which
threaten to unite all the opposition parties and the Tory rebels over the
social chapter.
The all-night sitting was a significant boost to the morale of pro-European
Tory backbenchers. They had been growing increasingly angry that on several
occasions the government whips had not tried to force a vote on extending
the sitting because they were likely to lose.
One loyalist said: 'It was nice to have a government win on Maastricht.' An
official commented: 'We are in clear sight of the end of the committee
stage. We are on track.'
Labour admitted yesterday that unless the government was foolish in trying
to force a weekend sitting it could organise matters so it could rely on
Liberal Democrat support in future procedural votes.
That impression was reinforced yesterday when Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal
Democrat leader, urged Labour to change its approach to the consideration of
the bill. He said Labour would have to change its tactics or its credibility
as a pro-European party would be seriously damaged.
Labour and the Tory rebels opposed the government's motion on Wednesday
night to allow the extended debate to take place, but the support of the
Liberal Democrats enabled the government to win by 17 votes.
The rapid progress made overnight means that the Commons was able to cover
three groups of amendments dealing with the European central bank and
national banking arrangements, EC economic policy and national government
deficits.
The progress brings closer, however, the critical vote on the social chapter
which is already in the schedule, quite apart from the question of whether
Mr Michael Morris, the deputy speaker, will allow a further debate on the
social chapter. This could aggravate the government's difficulties if more
amendments are chosen for inclusion.
The Euro-sceptics insist there is more scope for delay and some said morale
was still high because their arguments were getting through. But others
conceded that the main debates had been taken. Sir Teddy Taylor, a leading
rebel, said that the government had 'blitzed through' the main parts of the
bill.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Competition policy queried
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LACK of a cohesive approach by the competition authorities to defining
markets is producing inconsistencies in the vetting of monopolies and
mergers, research published yesterday by the Office of Fair Trading shows.
The research, carried out for the OFT by economic consultants Nera,
indicates that a company's 'market share' is invariably quoted by the OFT
and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to help justify a decision to
block a merger on competition grounds, or to infer that a company enjoys a
dominant market position.
But the question of how the particular market is defined is rarely addressed
explicitly and there are inconsistencies in approach between one case and
another, the report says.
For example, the MMC's approach to defining markets in cases involving
secondary products (spare parts) has varied considerably, it says.
Nera says that in an attempt to iron out such inconsistencies the OFT and
MMC should be obliged to define the relevant market as an explicit stage in
their analysis before using market shares to support their conclusions.
This would bring UK competition policy into line with the way the European
Commission and the European Court apply EC competition law.
Nera notes that many different concepts of the term 'the market' exist, and
suggests an economic approach to market definition, including checklists for
dealing with specific problems such as deciding whether a market is national
or international, and assessing how similar two products need to be in order
to be classified in the same market.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Fishermen spurn peace move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROBLEMS of the fishing industry are being exacerbated by the antagonism
between catching and processing interests, Mr David Curry, the fisheries
minister, told the Commons yesterday.
He disclosed that when he sought to bring the two sides together earlier in
the week, either in a meeting under his chairmanship or in a discussion
conducted in his office, the offer was accepted by the processors but turned
down by the fishermen's representatives.
Mr Curry stressed that the fact that the two key parts of the industry were
'diametrically opposed' was making the government's task more difficult.
He rejected a demand by Mr Austin Mitchell, Labour MP for Great Grimsby, for
the imposition of a temporary dumping ban on fish imports from Russia.
Mr Curry urged those who favoured such a course to think of the large number
of people in the processing industry whose jobs depended on an adequate
supply of fish.
More fish went into the processing side for fish fingers and other products
than went to the fresh fish market, he said.
The minister also pointed out that the landing of under-sized fish, along
with heavy landings of cod in the ports of Humberside, were among other
factors that had to be taken into account.
While it was difficult to know the precise quantities of Russian fish which
was being imported into Britain, these imports were certainly not sufficient
to account for the whole of the problem in the market, the fisheries
minister ar-gued.
Mr Curry used his speech to appeal to Britain's trawlermen not to engage in
any further blockades of ports, following their previous action, and
suggested that while demonstrating they had failed to notice recent signs
that fish prices had 'firmed considerably'.
Mr Brian Donohue, Labour MP for Cunninghame South, called for an inquiry
into why fish prices in the shops were still high in spite of the 'massive
downturn' at the quayside.
Mr Curry said a distinction had to be made between fish destined for
processing, and fresh fish supplied to the shops.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major reaffirms government's
commitment to reducing basic rate of income tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday reaffirmed the government's commitment to reducing
the basic rate of income tax to 20 pence, Ivor Owen writes. The prime
minister said it was proposed to extend the current 20p rate band as
'rapidly and as prudently' as possible.
To Labour cheers, Mr Elliot Morley, MP for Glanford and Scunthorpe, claimed
that for most people total taxation was now far higher than when the last
Labour government left office in 1979. He said the action taken in the
Budget to extend value added tax to domestic fuel would have a crippling
effect on many people with small occupational pensions which took them just
above the income support level.
The prime minister retored that if Mr Morley was really concerned about the
tax burden he should dissociate himself from the demands for increased
public expenditure repeatedly made from the Labour benches.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Competition policy doubted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LACK of a cohesive approach by the competition authorities to defining
markets is producing inconsistencies in the vetting of monopolies and
mergers, research published yesterday by the Office of Fair Trading shows.
The research, carried out for the OFT by economic consultants Nera, says a
company's 'market share' is invariably quoted by the OFT and the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission to justify a decision to block a merger on
competition grounds or to infer that a company enjoys a dominant market
position.
But the question of how the particular market is defined is rarely addressed
explicitly and there are inconsistencies in approach between one case and
another, the report says.
The MMC's approach to defining markets in cases involving secondary products
(spare parts) has varied considerably, it says. In two photocopier inquiries
the MMC concluded that the secondary products for toner and maintenance
formed part of the same product market as the photocopiers themselves. In a
Ford inquiry, however, the commission defined Ford body panels as a separate
relevant market.
Nera says that in an attempt to iron out such inconsistencies the OFT and
MMC should be obliged to define the relevant market as an explicit stage in
their analysis before using market shares to support their conclusions.
This would bring UK competition policy into line with EC competition law.
Nera notes that many different concepts of the term 'the market' exist.
It says the most useful concept of the relevant market identifies it
according to whether a single supplier of a particular product (or
hypothetical monopolist) would find it profitable to raise the price of that
product. If it would, the product represents a separate market. If not, the
product is part of a wider market.
It suggests an economic approach to market definition, including checklists
for dealing with specific problems such as deciding whether a market is
national or international, and assessing how similar two products need to be
in order to be classified in the same market.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Warning on low skills of young workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH employers are competing for recruits in a much smaller pool of
well-educated 16-year-olds than companies in most main competitor countries,
the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said yes-terday.
The institute says in a report that low attainment in the UK produces low
employer expectations of skill standards. It quotes a recruitment officer
who, when asked what qualifications he would like machine operators to have,
replied: 'We like them to be able to read and write.'
The report's conclusions include:
The proportion of British 16-year-olds attaining a standard equivalent to
that in other industrialised countries in science, the native language and
mathematics, was only half that of France, Germany and Japan, though it
points out that national qualifications are not identical in curriculum
coverage.
The proportion of British 16-to-19-year-olds in full-time education and
training was lower than in competitor countries.
Fewer British young people aged 18-plus gained school or vocational
qualifications than in France or Germany.
Any substantial increase in the quality and quantity of youth training in
the UK would impose consider-able additional costs on employers.
The report attributes differences between countries to a range of factors,
some related to internal features of the system such as curriculum design,
and others related to the social context, including parental expectations.

FT  26 MAR 93 / NatWest faces refunds in BES row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank and Hambros Bank face a possible repayment of more
than Pounds 25m to investors, following an initial ruling by the Inland
Revenue that shares in their 'Homeshare' loan-backed business expansion
scheme companies were not issued in time to beat the deadline announced in
the Budget.
The chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, disallowed loans on BES shares unless the
shares had been issued to investors before midnight on the day before the
Budget. According to the Inland Revenue it would be left to the discretion
of individual tax inspectors to decide whether shares had been properly
issued in time for the deadline.
Yesterday NatWest and Hambros, which sponsored the issue, wrote to
investors, and said: 'Despite advice from leading counsel to the effect that
the shares were issued by the Homeshare companies before March 16 1993 for
the purposes of the proposed legislation, a preliminary indication from the
Inland Revenue is that they do not agree.'
The banks said they would pursue the issue with the Inland Revenue 'with
vigour'. If this is unsuccessful they will consider alternative courses of
action to provide an exit for investors who would have made use of the loan
facility.
NatWest had originally promised investors a loan of 74p after six months for
every Pounds 1 invested. Top-rate taxpayers would have received tax relief
of 40p per Pounds 1 invested, giving a total increase on the original
investment of 14 per cent. Without the tax relief taking the loan involves a
substantial loss to investors.
The scheme was launched in the first week of March and raised the full
subscription of Pounds 25m within two days. It was mostly marketed directly
to NatWest's own customers.
NatWest's action follows a similar problem for Barclays De Zoete Wedd, the
securities arm of Barclays Bank.
BZW wrote to shareholders in its Gracechurch business expansion scheme
companies last night to say that it had still not received a ruling from the
Inland Revenue on whether shares in its Pounds 25m scheme had been issued in
time for the deadline.

FT  26 MAR 93 / DTI confirms du Cann asset probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INLAND Revenue bankruptcy petition against Sir Edward du Cann, the former
Lonhro chairman, was automatically dismissed yesterday because a bankruptcy
order had already been made.
The Department of Trade and Industry confirmed that a bankruptcy order was
made against Sir Edward in the High Court on a petition by the solicitors
Denton Hall Burgin &amp; Warren on March 12 for unpaid fees.
The case has been transferred to Taunton Crown Court near Sir Edward's
residence in Somerset. The department yesterday said an official receiver
had been appointed to look at the circumstances of Sir Edward's bankruptcy
and to ascertain his assets and liabilities.
Sir Edward faces separate proceedings against him and six other directors of
Homes Assured, a financial-services company which was wound up in October
1989.
Proceedings were started by the Department of Trade and Industry under
Section 6 of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. Under the Act
Sir Edward could be disqualified from holding office as a company director.
Earlier this month Sir Edward failed to appear in a separate hearing at
Taunton County Court involving the National Rivers Authority. The authority
alleges that it is owed Pounds 425.25 in respect of a consent to discharge
sewage from a local property in 1991.
Sir Edward's political career has has included several high-level posts
including the chairmanship of the Conservative party and of the influential
1922 Committee in the Commons. He has been a privy councillor since 1964.
The Privy Council said yesterday that there were no rules governing members
who might be declared bankrupt and would not comment on Sir Edward's case.
Only two privy councillors have resigned voluntarily this century: the
former war minister John Profumo, and the former Labour MP John Stonehouse.
The only privy councillor forced to resign this century was Sir Edgar
Speyer, a financier who had his council position revoked in 1921 after being
accused of pro-German activities.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Appeal Court upholds BCCI ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HIGH COURT ruling won by former customers of the collapsed Bank of Credit
and Commerce International that they could 'set off' deposits against their
debts to the bank was upheld yesterday by the Court of Appeal.
Three judges dismissed appeals by Touche Ross, the BCCI liquidators, against
High Court orders made last December by Mr Justice Hoffman in favour of two
groups of associated companies and their directors who had banked with BCCI.
When the bank was wound up Impexbond Ltd and Tucan Ltd together owed about
Pounds 3.3m while a guarantor director, Mr Nasir Abdul Amir, had deposits
which were worth about Pounds 4.5m.
In the second case director Mr Raees Ahmed had Pounds 426,000 on deposit
while his companies, High Street Services Ltd, Cira Ltd and Portman Fashions
Ltd, owed more than Pounds 1m. Both men had signed BCCI's standard guarantee
forms for their companys' debts.
Touche Ross had argued that the setting off could not apply because no
demands under these guarantees had been made of either director.
But Lord Justice Dillon said the principle of setting-off was long
established in bankruptcy, insolvency and company liquidations where there
had been mutual credits, mutual debts or other mutual dealings.
The criteria for applying set-off had been met in these cases. If there was
a set-off between Mr Amir or Mr Ahmed and BCCI it must automatically reduce
or extinguish the companies' debts. It was not something BCCI could put in a
'suspense account', he ruled.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Lifeboats launched in City rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME SMALL and medium-sized banks are receiving financial support from the
Bank of England, the Bank disclosed yesterday.
Yesterday it took the unusual step of disclosing that in the second half of
1991 it launched financial lifeboats for a number of small and medium-sized
banks. A lifeboat involves either the Bank putting funds into a troubled
bank or the injection of money from commercial banks with a guarantee from
the Bank.
A Bank executive said yesterday some small banks were still in receipt of
Bank funds.
The Bank refused to disclose which banks had been rescued. However, Lord
Spens, one of the acquitted defendants in the Guinness trial, claimed in the
House of Lords that City Merchants Bank, part of the Invesco MIM group, had
received Pounds 40m from National Westminster Bank and that an indemnity had
been given to NatWest by the Bank.
It is also understood that the Bank played a role in organising a Pounds
200m cash lifeboat for National Home Loans, one of the UK's largest mortgage
lenders, in July 1991. The funds were provided by the eight largest UK
clearing banks.
The Bank rescue of small banks was prompted by the withdrawal of wholesale
deposits - or deposits from financial institutions and professional
investors - from these banks.
Deposits were withdrawn for a number of reasons:
Small banks were thought to be particularly vulnerable to the recession and
losses on bad property loans.
Three small banks, Chancery, Eddington and British and Commonwealth Merchant
Bank, had already been closed.
The closure of BCCI in July 1991 led local authorities in particular to
re-evaluate where they placed their funds.
After the closure of BCCI some small banks saw a withdrawal of virtually all
local authority and public-sector corporations' deposits, according to the
Bank.
The Bank's official policy is to act as a lender of last resort to banks
only if the collapse of a bank poses a threat to the financial system. The
Bank said in mid-1991 it believed there was considerable nervousness in the
financial markets and that the collapse of small banks could have had
damaging consequences.
A banker yesterday disputed that the financial system had been at risk at
the time. A Bank executive said it was too early to say whether the Bank was
likely to lose any money from the lifeboat operation.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Council acts on teachers' boycott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WANDSWORTH COUNCIL in south London is seeking a High Court injunction to
require the NASUWT, the second-largest teaching union, to withdraw an
instruction to members in the borough to boycott national curriculum testing
and assessment, John Willman writes.
The union is to fight the challenge which, if successful, would almost
certainly trigger similar actions throughout England, Wales and Northern
Ireland. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, NASUWT general secretary, said the boycott was
not directly against testing but against the excessive workload imposed on
teachers in implementing the testing arrangements.
However, legal advice obtained by teaching unions not involved in boycotts
has indicated that such action would be illegal.
The application is likely to be heard at the High Court today, when a date
could be fixed for a full hearing early next week.

road to recovery'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont, the chancellor, last night said it is up to companies to
'lead Britain down the road to recovery' by capitalising on his 'Budget for
British business'.
He told London businessmen: 'You cannot get strong economic growth at the
flick of a switch. However, the basic conditions for recovery are in place
and economic indicators are improving.'
Tax burdens on business had been cut for the year ahead, and small companies
looked forward to a reduction in the burdens placed on them because of his
VAT penalty reforms, he said. Businesses, especially in the south, could
plan ahead knowing they will not see a real increase in their rate bills
next year, he said.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Bank 'will not compromise' on new reports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England yesterday said it would not welcome Treasury
interference in the preparation of its new quarterly reports on Britain's
inflation performance.
Professor Mervyn King, the Bank's economics director, told a banking
seminar: 'There is no way we will compromise on our judgment.'
The Bank issued the first report last month, intended to stiffen
anti-inflationary resolve by monitoring the government's progress in
pursuing its 1 per cent to 4 per cent target.
At the seminar, organised to explain the workings of the independent German
Bundesbank, Prof King made clear he favoured greater independence for the
Bank of England, although he said the Bank was not 'campaigning' for it.
Asked about the Bundesbank's history of taking unpopular decisions which
have sometimes unseated Bonn chancellors, Prof King gave an
independent-minded quip at the expense of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor
of the exchequer.
'Nothing could improve the popularity of the Bank of England more than being
thought responsible for the resignation of the chancellor of the exchequer,'
he said.
Prof Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's board member responsible for economics,
said countries with independent central banks were most likely to have lower
inflation.
'It is amazing that comparatively few countries have so far decided in
favour of the independence of their central banks,' Prof Issing said.
On the subject of the Bank's inflation reports, Prof King said these studies
 -with the Bank's new remit to produce price stability - were 'innovations
for monetary policy in this country'.
Prof King, responsible for the content of the reports, said he sent a first
draft of last month's document to the Treasury for comment, partly as a
'courtesy' and partly because he expected some 'helpful' reactions.
The Treasury made comments on largely technical points. 'Some were helpful,
and some we didn't take on board,' he added.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Finance summaries 'difficult to read'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUMMARY financial statements are often more difficult to read than a
company's full annual report, a study sponsored by the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales says.
A desire to save costs is the main reason why companies offer shareholders
summary statements, says the report. However, it says, the profit and loss
account and balance sheets statements are normally identical to those
provided in the full accounts, but come without the notes.
Summary statements were introduced in the 1989 Companies Act. Companies can
send them to shareholders in place of the full accounts.
The survey, based on the experiences of 300 industrial and financial
companies, found that producing summary statements rarely saved money.

FT  26 MAR 93 / BBC and ABC injoint news plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC and the ABC network in the US are joining forces to create one of
the largest television and radio newsgathering operations in the world.
The alliance, which will involve sharing bureaux and correspondents, means
new international partners for both organisations.
At present ABC has links with Independent Television News and the BBC's US
partner has traditionally been the NBC network.
Mr Tony Hall, managing director of BBC news and current affairs, said
yesterday that the agreement brought together two of the world's largest
newsgatherers.
'It will lead to greater efficiencies in the field and give us access to an
even wider range of news material from across the globe,' he said.
The BBC has more than 50 foreign bureaux and ABC has bureaux in Europe, the
Middle East and Far East.
The organisations will exchange news, will co-ordinate coverage of important
stories, share technical and broadcasting facilities and will explore
collaboration in current affairs.
The deal will ensure that ABC material is available to BBC World Service
Television, which is increasingly challenging Mr Ted Turner's Cable News
Network in international markets.
The BBC is considering launching a 24-hour television news channel in the UK
although previous talks with British Sky Broadcasting about a joint venture
seem to have made little progress.
Most large television news organisations are seeking to cut costs while
expanding their operations.
Negotiations between the BBC and ABC have been under way for several months.
CBS, the leading US network in terms of audience share, has also been
looking for an international partner. Mr Howard Stringer, the CBS
broadcasting president, has had talks with the BBC and ITN.
The ABC/BBC deal may lead to more intensive talks about the possibility of
CBS taking a stake in a restructured ITN.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Society fraudster jailed for five years
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DARIUS GUPPY, a society gems dealer turned fraudster, and Mr Benedict
Marsh, his business partner, were yesterday jailed for five years over a
bogus robbery and false insurance claim.
They were each fined Pounds 533,000 for conspiracy to steal Pounds 1.2m from
the gemstones company of which Mr Guppy was an executive director, and
warned that they would serve an extra three years if it was not paid within
six months.
The sentences came five weeks after the end of a three-month trial at
Snaresbrook Crown Court, east London.
Judge Andrew Brooks sentenced each man to five years for conspiracy to
defraud Lloyd's of London of Pounds 1.8m, five years concurrently for
conspiracy to steal Pounds 1.2m from their company - for which the Pounds
533,000 fine was also imposed - and 12 months concurrently for conspiracy to
commit false accounting.
They had pleaded not guilty at their trial to the three charges.
At a later hearing on March 4 Mr Guppy, who was best man at the wedding of
Earl Spencer, pleaded guilty to three charges of falsely claiming he was
entitled to repayment of VAT for bogus gold bullion exports, and Mr Marsh
pleaded guilty to one charge.
Yesterday the judge imposed a fine of Pounds 2,000, with an alternative of
45 days imprisonment, on each charge.
Judge Brooks also ordered that the two men be barred from being company
directors for at least 10 years.

FT  26 MAR 93 / EC social policy has impact on employers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community's social agenda has had a significant impact on
employers and unions in Britain in spite of government hostility to many
parts of it, according to a report from the Policy Studies Institute.
The report says unions are increasingly integrating ideas from the 1989
Social Charter into collective bargaining and strengthening links with other
unions in the EC.
It says employers are reviewing differing working conditions in their
organisations across the EC so as to be able to respond to comparison claims
from UK unions.
The report says unions and employers have been largely reactive to the EC's
social agenda and have played only a small role in setting it.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Court threat over building society rents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BUILDING society which sold an estate agency chain that later went into
liquidation is facing demands for unpaid rents from landlords who insist it
is still legally responsible for its former subsidiary.
The claim against Northern Rock, Britain's 11th-largest building society,
comes from a group of landlords from whom estate agency offices were rented.
The claim hinges on Section 22 of the 1986 Building Societies Act, requiring
societies to discharge the liabilities of subsidiaries. The case is believed
to be the first of its kind.
Northern Rock, which has rejected the landlords' demand for rents totalling
more than Pounds 300,000, insists its obligation ceased when it sold the
chain last year. Mr Chris Jobe, society secretary, said: 'We believe that
when we dispose of a subsidiary company that liability ends.' But some
landlords and their legal advisers are meeting today to decide whether to
pursue their claim, possibly in the High Court.
Solicitor Mr Peter Hughes, at whose office the meeting will be held, said:
'It's a question of interpretation of the legislation and the surrounding
circumstances.'
Mr Hughes, a partner in Corbould Rigby &amp; Co, is acting for two landlords and
co-ordinating an investigation on behalf of 10 more.
Northern Rock Property Services, a subsidiary of the Newcastle-based
building society, built up an estate agency chain in the 1980s, trading
under different names in various parts of England. At its 1989 peak it had
about 100 outlets. As the property market slumped and the chain's generation
of mortgage business proved disappointing, Northern Rock decided to quit the
estate agency and sold the chain to several buyers.
In September last year 51 estate agency offices in London, the south-east
and on the south coast were sold, under the name Seleridge to a company
called Franklin Fox. Two months later Seleridge went into liquidation.
Mr Hughes said that in many cases leases entered into by Seleridge have been
disclaimed by the liquidator. Mr Chris Potter, former managing director of
defunct Northern Rock Property Services, said: 'The landlord has to take the
same chance as anybody else in commerce these days.'
Mr Michael Coogan, deputy secretary of the Building Societies Association,
said that to his knowledge the case was the first of its kind.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Study of finance regulators urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL REGULATORS have expanded into areas which should have nothing to
do with regulation and their activities need to be re-examined, says a
report from Professors Julian Franks and Stephen Schaefer of the London
Business School, released yesterday.
But they conclude that the direct costs of regulation in the UK are broadly
in line with costs in the US and France. The report is to be published on
April 2 as part of the City Research Project, set up to examine the
competitiveness of the UK as a base for financial services business.
Threats to investor protection in the past stemmed 'almost exclusively' from
fraud, misappropriation and malpractice, the two professors argue.
Regulation should be focused on these areas, they say, rather than on
improving standards in the industry or developing capital adequacy rules to
protect investors when an investment business is wound up. Their comments
precede publication of a far-reaching review of investment regulation by Mr
Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board.
In the UK, there are about six regulators for every 1,000 people employed in
the securities industry, compared with nearly 12 in the US. Regulatory costs
total 0.53 per cent of the industry's costs, excluding interest expenses,
compared with 1.34 per cent in the US.
Investment management is more expensive to regulate in the UK, however.
Costs amount to 0.43 of a basis point (hundredth of a percentage point) of
funds under management, compared with 0.16 bp in the US and 0.11 bp in
France.
There are 6.8 regulators for every 1000 employees, compared with 1.7 in the
US and 1.3 in France.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Watchdog praises sale of BT shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SALE of the second tranche of British Telecom shares at the end of 1991
gave the taxpayer value for money, but the National Audit Office, the
parliamentary watchdog, says it could not say whether the government's
special efforts to boost the number of long-term small investors had worked.
In a report on the Pounds 5.3bn sale of half the government's remaining BT
shares, the audit office says the government did 'all it could' to maximise
proceeds.
The office reaches no judgment on the success of the share shop scheme -
intended to make it easier for small investors to deal in shares - beyond
noting that 59 per cent of the shops' transactions in the three-month
special dealing period after the sale were on behalf of individuals
disposing of BT shares.

SOME 8,000 white-collar staff at Ford held a 24-hour strike yesterday but
the company said the stoppage had not interrupted production on the
launch-day of the new Mondeo model.
Mr Jim Thomas, chief staff negotiator at Ford, said the strike had been 'a
total success' and had showed 'the depth of feeling' among the workforce
over the issue of compulsory redundancies.
The company is 80 jobs short of the 2,200 cuts it has been seeking by
voluntary means. It has said it will impose compulsory redundancies if it
does not reach its target by the end of this month.

BRITISH AIRWAYS yesterday agreed to go back on pay cuts of up to 10 per cent
it imposed on 450 cabin crew staff at Gatwick airport when it acquired Dan
Air last November, Robert Taylor writes.
The move, which will cost the company Pounds 400,000 in backdated salary,
followed an application to an industrial tribunal by the TGWU general union
on behalf of 280 staff involved in the pay cuts.
BA said it intended to restore the cabin crews' basic pay to its original
level - backdated to November 7 last year - and to restore pay supplements
which were reduced at the same time. Staff can expect to receive between
Pounds 750 and Pounds 2,000 as a result.

FT  26 MAR 93 / GM seeks more grants to build engine plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS, the US-based vehicle maker, is considering the UK as the
location for a diesel engine plant in an investment that could total more
than Pounds 200m.
But Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of GM, said yesterday that the UK's
attractiveness was being hampered by its uncompetitive grant aid regime.
Mr William Ebbert, Vauxhall chairman and managing director, said: 'Current
UK grants do not compete with the kind of support being offered by our
European neighbours. We want to see a stronger UK manufacturing base and the
government could help to attract inward investment through a more liberal
approach to the grant system.'
Britain is facing stiff competition from several other potential European
sites for one of the largest inward investment projects planned in the
western European automotive industry. As part of a campaign to have the
plant built in the UK, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
held talks earlier this week in London with Mr Louis Hughes, president of
General Motors Europe and GM's executive vice-president for international
operations.
Earlier this year a team of officials from the Department of Trade and
Industry visited GM Europe's HQ in Zurich to press the UK's case.
The government has told GM that the UK has significant advantages compared
with the rest of western Europe, including lower labour costs, favourable
corporate taxation, an expanding components supply base and more flexible
labour practices outside the proposed social chapter of the Maastricht
treaty.
Mr Hughes said GM was planning investments in new capacity for diesel
engines and multi-valve petrol engines in the mid to late 1990s. 'We must
find the most efficient way of making these investments. We are looking now
where is the most cost-efficient place,' he said.
It is expected that the diesel engine plant would have a capacity to produce
200,000-300,000 engines a year.
GM has already started to invest more heavily in the UK and last year
started production at its new Pounds 193m engine plant at Ellesmere Port,
where it will have capacity to produce 135,000 V6 engines a year. Ellesmere
Port would also be the likely location for the diesel engine plant.
Vauxhall said yesterday it had failed to gain UK grant aid for the V6 engine
plant through a misunderstanding of the UK aid regime, which had cost it as
much as Pounds 30m.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Exports to lead modest upturn, CBI says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN CAN expect a modest recovery from recession, led by manufacturing
output and exports, the Confederation of British Industry says.
The CBI predicts in its latest forecast for the UK economy that gross
domestic product will increase by a real 1.4 per cent this year. This
compares with the 0.7 per cent growth forecast in November and the 1.25 per
cent growth forecast by the Treasury in last week's Budget.
Output is expected to rise by 2.4 per cent next year - broadly in line with
the CBI's earlier forecast of 2.3 per cent growth.
The recovery will be insufficient, however, to prevent seasonally adjusted
unemployment rising to more than 3m at the end of this quarter. The CBI
expects unemployment to reach 3.1m, or 11.2 per cent of the working
population, by the end of this year and rise more slowly to 3.15m, or 11.3
per cent, by the end of next year.
Mr Sudhir Junankar, the head of the CBI's forecasting team, said that there
were encouraging signs in the UK economy although it was not yet time 'to
crack open the champagne'.
Consumer spending and investment held up better than expected in the final
quarter of last year, while the latest evidence pointed to a strengthening
of retail sales volumes and higher export demand following sterling's
depreciation.
Mr Junankar said that North Sea oil production was also expected to be
higher this year, adding about 0.3 points to economic growth.
The CBI forecast that manufacturing output will rise faster than the economy
as a whole over the next two years, with growth of 1.6 per cent in 1993 and
2.8 per cent in 1994. The tax increases announced in Budget are expected to
hold back growth in consumer spending when most of them take effect next
year.
Exports of goods and services are forecast to increase at above-average
rates of 4.7 per cent this year and 5.5 per cent in next year. Imports are
expected to grow more slowly than exports but the growth of import volumes
is expected to outpace domestic demand.
The CBI says the UK current account will continue to deteriorate, with the
deficit widening to Pounds 18.6bn in 1994 from Pounds 17.5bn this year and
Pounds 11.9bn in 1992.
The CBI estimates the growth of world trade in manufactured goods at 1.6 per
cent this year and 3.3 per cent next year after 2.1 per cent last year. Last
week's Treasury Red Book projects trade growth of 4.25 per cent this year
and 5.75 per cent at an annual rate in the first half of next year, after
4.5 per cent last year.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Job teasers that need working out: Current employment trends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS IT a freak or is it a trend? Since last week's surprise announcement that
unemployment fell slightly last month - the first fall in nearly three years
 -City economists and Whitehall officials have been trying to come up with
the reason.
One Department of Employment official said yesterday it was 'probably real',
meaning that the jobless total would not necessarily continue falling next
month but that the underlying rate of growth had started to slow.
The official was supported by Mr Kevin Gardiner, an economist at S G
Warburg. He pointed to supplementary evidence such as February's increase in
working hours and vacancies as well as the optimistic tone of some leading
private recruitment agencies.
One novel explanation for the new trend, provided by a senior government
economist, is 'over-sacking'.
The suggestion is that many big companies have made too many staff redundant
during the recession. Some of them are starting to rein in redundancy
programmes or even re-hire staff.
There are several possible reasons companies might be tempted to over-sack.
Labour market reforms and weaker trade unions have made it easier. Some
companies believe shareholders like to see big redundancy announcements and
tend to mark up share prices after they are made.
Also, the accounting convention which allows redundancy costs to be taken
below the line, thus not depressing earnings, is soon to be revised. After
June big redundancy packages will have a direct bearing on earnings, so
there is an incentive to clear out people while the old system prevails.
The accounting change does not help to explain why unemployment fell last
month, and there is little hard evidence for the over-sacking theory, which
is based mainly on the fact that there has been a much sharper fall in
employment relative to output than in previous recessions.
But while few companies that have over-sacked are likely to admit to it,
some companies, such as British Telecom, have openly established systems for
re-employing staff if it turns out that they are hit by shortages in the
course of a redundancy programme.
Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland Bank, has also admitted that the
bank is having trouble re-establishing old-style branches because it has
pensioned off too many senior branch managers.
There is harder evidence that many companies have cut back on staff as far
as they can go without damaging the skill-base they require when business
improves. One such company is John Brown Engineers and Constructors of
Portsmouth, where all 750 employees accepted a 10 per cent pay cut last
month to enable the company to hold the workforce together in spite of a
shortage of orders.
Mr David Rossington, chief executive of Lincolnshire Training and Enterprise
Council, says that many big companies in his area have cut to the bone and
will have to start recruiting at the slightest upturn.
Mr John Fosdyke, chief executive of Kent Tec, also expresses 'guarded
optimism' that the employment outlook might be turning.
Some government economists argue that the labour market reforms of the
1980s, which made it easier for companies to fire in the recession, will
also make it more attractive to hire at the first sign of upturn.
But for every employment optimist there is still at least one pessimist and
the the Engineering Employers Federation has revised upwards its latest job
losses estimate for the engineering industry.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Britain moves to attract GM engine plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS, the US-based vehicle maker, is considering the UK as the
location for a diesel engine plant in an investment that could total more
than Pounds 200m.
But Britain is facing stiff competition from several other potential
European sites for one of the largest inward investment projects planned in
the west European automotive industry. As part of a campaign to have the
plant built in the UK, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
held talks earlier this week in London with Mr Louis Hughes, president of
General Motors Europe and GM's executive vice-president for international
operations.
Earlier this year a team of officials from the department of trade and
industry visited GM Europe's headquarters in Zurich to press the UK's case.
Mr William Ebbert, chairman and managing director of Vauxhall, the UK
subsidiary of GM, said yesterday the attractiveness of the UK was being
hampered by its uncompetitive grant aid regime.
'Current UK grants do not compete with the kind of support being offered by
our European neighbours,' he said. 'We want to see a stronger UK
manufacturing base and the government could help to attract inward
investment through a more liberal approach to the grant system.'
The government has told GM that the UK has significant advantages compared
with the rest of western Europe, including lower labour costs, favourable
corporate taxation, an expanding components supply base and more flexible
labour practices outside the proposed social chapter of the Maastricht
Treaty.
Mr Hughes said GM was planning investments in new capacity for diesel
engines and multi-valve petrol engines in the mid to late 1990s. 'We must
find the most efficient way of making these investments. We are looking now
where is the most cost-efficient place,' he said.
It is expected that the diesel engine plant would have a capacity to produce
200,000-300,000 engines a year.
GM has already started to invest more heavily in the UK and last year
started production at its new Pounds 193m engine plant at Ellesmere Port,
where it will have capacity to produce 135,000 V6 engines a year. Ellesmere
Port would also be the likely location for the diesel engine plant.
Vauxhall said yesterday it had failed to gain UK grant aid for the V6 engine
plant through a misunderstanding of the UK aid regime, which had cost it as
much as Pounds 30m.

FT  26 MAR 93 / The Coal White Paper: Future for coal - Heseltine holds his
ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The story of the changes in the various coal proposals over the last five
months is primarily the story of how the government was persuaded it was
politically imperative to reprieve at least some of the 31 pits earmarked
for closure last October.
This is the effect of the subsidy proposals unveiled yesterday. The prospect
of 12 high-producing pits being saved looks to have staved off the worst of
the threatened backbench rebellion which nearly swamped the government in
the autumn.
But there is no guarantee of how long the reprieve will last and Mr
Heseltine has reserved the right to close 12 pits, to mothball a further six
and to retain one under development with production halted.
In short, the extent of the government's achievement in the white paper
could yet be confined to ensuring the closures announced in October are
phased in over a much longer period.
Yesterday's package bore a strong resemblance to last month's draft white
paper, with the important exception of the changes forced upon the
government as a result of its failure to win a commitment from the main
electricity generators to take more than the 160m tonnes of coal over five
years they had agreed.
This scuppered hopes that an additional short-term market for deep-mined
coal could be created by encouraging the generators to run higher stocks
than they had planned.
The government has also seen no need to impose a limit on open-cast coal
output, which it hinted at in the draft white paper, since such production
is expected to fall anyway.
Measures related to orimulsion were restricted to making its subject to
hydrocarbon duty, rather than forcing power stations burning the
bitumen-based fuel to fit flue gas desulphurisation equipment - a step
hinted at in the draft and recommended by the trade and industry select
committee.
The government decided to pass over the committee's most radical proposals -
postponing electricity market liberalisation, cutting the pounds 1.2bn
nuclear levy and cutting purchases of electricity from France - because of
its strong preference for avoiding legislation, except that needed to
privatise the industry.
It has stuck to its faith in the market as the ultimate arbiter of Britain's
energy mix, with little change from its position in October.

FT  26 MAR 93 / The Coal White Paper: Market to determine pits' future - The
government's blueprint to tackle projected energy demands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has signalled a much bigger role for market forces in the
coal industry with its commitment to move towards privatising British Coal
as quickly as possible and to sell off pits the corporation wants to close.
The government's white paper stressed the limited options available for
extending the market for coal. There is little market for coal outside
electricity generation, and the 'demand for coal in this market is set to
decline significantly from current levels. There is no likelihood of
significant growth in demand in other markets and a substantial risk of
further decline.'
The government wants to leave decisions about energy use to the free market,
but it is setting up a panel to advise it on developments. This is what the
white paper had to say about the main sectors:
Coal
The government confirms that British Coal's decision to close 31 pits 'was
soundly based in the market conditions'.
But it concluded that there is a case for enabling British Coal to phase the
inevitable closures needed and also offer the coal industry a viable future
in the private sector.
In order to do this, the government is providing a subsidy for additional
tonnages of coal the corporation can sell to the generators.
This will be on top of contracts already signed to supply 160m tonnes over
five years - 40m tonnes in 1993 to 1994 and 30m tonnes in each of the
following four years. Negotiations about any additional tonnages are still
under way.
The subsidy will enable British Coal to compete with imported coal and other
black fuels such as orimulsion. It will encourage the generators to
substitute coal from the UK for coal from overseas.
This will give British Coal time to implement the productivity and cost
improvements in order to make coal competitive with world prices within five
years.
The level of subsidy is for negotiation, but the white paper embraces
figures put forward by the select committee. These state that subsidies
should provide the difference between the cost of additional British coal
and imported coal. The subsidy will stop when the industry is privatised.
It does not give any indication of what additional tonnages the corporation
can expect to sell as a result of the subsidy.
The government intends to speed up the privatisation process and the white
paper says privatisation will be achieved at the earliest practical
opportunity.
The government stresses that it cannot legally force the generators to carry
higher stocks of coal as a way of increasing the market, but that it would
continue to consult with them over stock levels as a matter of urgency.
Opencast mining production is expected to fall even further than British
Coal's forecasts because of government efforts to subsidise deep-mined coal.
British Coal had forecast that opencast mining would fall from 16m tonnes to
12m tonnes by 1997 to 1998. Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, is
reviewing planning guidance on opencast coal.
British Coal has agreed that, in the approach to privatisation, it will
offer to sell or licence any pit it plans to close.
A new Coal Authority with responsibility for licensing pits and maintaining
records of mining activity will be set up in Nottinghamshire.
The government also plans to remove limits placed on underground working
hours in an effort to help British Coal improve efficiency.
The government intends to pass legislation that will remove restrictions
under which British Coal is unable to license mines at which more than 150
workers are employed.
Nuclear
The government sees no justification for forcing Nuclear Electric to close
any of its Magnox stations before the end of their planned lifetimes.
The review of future prospects for the nuclear industry will be completed
earlier than planned and the government will make an announcement later this
year. The nuclear review was planned for next year.
Mining communities
The white paper increased the amount of cash available for helping areas
affected by the pit closures to Pounds 200m.
Environment
The government expects the amount of coal burnt at power stations to fall in
the longer term because of environmental pressures. But it has made an
additional Pounds 12m available over the next three years to support
research into clean coal technology at British Coal's Coal Research
Establishment.
Gas
No measures to restrict gas-fired power generation.
Orimulsion
Orimulsion exports from Venezuela to the UK will stay at minimum contracted
levels for the foreseeable future.
This should see a reduction in consumption of at least 500,000 tonnes
equivalent of coal a year from the current level.
Electricity
The government reaffirmed its commitment to an open electricity market with
more competition to be introduced in 1994 as planned.
Consumers should pay lower electricity bills because the generators will be
buying subsidised coal and could then pass these savings on.
The government is considering whether to allow large electricity users to
bypass the pool - or the wholesale market.
The electricity pool authorities are looking at introducing demand-side
bidding into the electricity pool which means that large users could be
given incentives to shift their electricity demands to periods of low usage.
There would be no restriction on imports of French electricity.
Energy Commission
The government plans to set up an energy advisory panel of independent
experts, which will offer advice on the development of energy markets.

FT  26 MAR 93 / The Coal White Paper: Big power users may cut costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Heseltine announced the creation of an energy commission of
independent experts to advise the government on developments in the
industry. It will also contribute to an annual energy report which will
provide relevant business information on the now largely privatised energy
industries.
The government also gave some hope to large energy users when it said it was
considering allowing them to bypass the electricity pool - the wholesale
market for electricity.
This would allow the users to sign direct contracts with the generators and
avoid the fluctuations in pool prices. This would lead to a reduction in
their electricity costs.
The pool authorities are also considering whether to give large users a cost
incentive to shift their electricity demands to off-peak periods.
Mr Heseltine refused to restrict the growth of gas-fired power generation to
increase the market for coal, although he has provided a subsidy for coal so
that the industry can compete with world prices.
He confirmed the timetable for increasing competition in the electricity
market from 1994 - designed to achieve an open market by 1998. There will be
no restriction on sales of electricity from France.
There was also relief for the nuclear industry. The government said it saw
no reason to force Nuclear Electric to close its Magnox stations, but it is
bringing the nuclear review forward by a year.
Gas-fired generators say gas will be able to compete with subsidised coal.
'It's the best we could have expected, given that there is a need for
transitional arrangements for coal,' said Mr David Lewis, director of Enron
Europe, the UK arm of the large US gas company.

FT  26 MAR 93 / The Coal White Paper: True contentment, but only for the
lucky few - How one miner found his 'dream' job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
STRIDING OVER the limestone grassland of Durham's coastline, Denis Rooney, a
former colliery fitter, cannot believe his luck.
After 18 years working underground he is now paid to roam the cliffs near
his home, protecting the scenery he loves. As National Trust warden for this
curious north-east coast, where dramatic cliffs and meadows studded with
orchids lead down to beaches black with coal waste, he has found job
satisfaction.
When his wife spotted the job advertisement in the Sunderland Echo Mr
Rooney, then 45 and unemployed, doubted his chances. 'I said 'everybody has
degrees who get those jobs'.'
Two years later the keen conservationist still cannot believe his good
fortune. 'I still haven't come off cloud nine, it's just a dream come true,'
he says.
Mr Rooney, last of a family of miners, decided in 1987 to take his
redundancy from Dawdon colliery - since closed and now the northern boundary
of his four-mile warden's beat. In the late 1980s it was easier for former
Durham miners to find work. But since mid 1991 Dawdon and Murton collieries
have closed, costing East Durham 2,000 jobs and creating a large pool of
job-hunting miners.
Today, Mr Rooney says, the prospects are 'dire' for those facing redundancy
from East Durham's last pits, Vane Tempest and Easington. The two pits
employed 2,300 men when they were earmarked for closure last October. 'There
are no jobs around. It will create a lot of problems with a lot of miners
unemployed. And for the young ones coming up now there's nothing.'
Mr Rooney did not find the job he wanted easily. He tried to get work on the
Channel tunnel project, but failed. He endured repetitive engineering jobs
and was made redundant a second time by a Sunderland cranemaker. He had been
on the dole for 10 months before his wife, a school cook, spotted the
crucial advertisement.
His warden's job may be a 'dream' but it is no idyll. To protect his
coastline he has had to confront youths with airguns, and flytippers.
For Pounds 10,000 a year he works far beyond his official 39 hours a week.
When he is not out with his mongrel Sabre and lurcher Bracken patrolling, or
supervising volunteers, he lectures to schools and clubs and studies for a
conservation qualification.
Yet it has worked out well. Mr Rooney used part of his Pounds 18,000 pit
redundancy to buy his terraced ex-colliery house in Seaham, a Durham coastal
town which until recently had three pits. That way, he figured, his family
would have a home whatever happened. Coalmining was never an option for his
sons. One is a care worker in a home for young delinquents and the other a
council gardener.
Mr Rooney loves his job's combination of freedom and responsibility, and the
chance it gives him to enhance the very coastline his former industry has
desecrated for the past century with colliery waste. In recent years 1.5m
tonnes of waste annually has been tipped on to the beaches from British
Coal's coastal Durham pits, turning once-golden sand into a black quagmire
so vile it featured in the film Alien Three. British Coal argued that the
costs of other disposal methods would have to be borne by the collieries,
rendering them uneconomic.
'From a conservation point of view it doesn't upset me the collieries are
closing, but from the jobs point of view it does,' says Mr Rooney. 'It's a
pity they have to close because there's nothing to replace them.'

FT  26 MAR 93 / The Coal White Paper: 'Greens' give grudging welcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENVIRONMENTALISTS gave a grudging welcome yesterday to the white paper's
acknowledgement that 'in the longer term environmental pressures will
operate against coal as a primary source of energy'.
The environmental damage caused by coal burning is well-recognised - the
emission of carbon dioxide, thought to be implicated in global warming, with
sulphur dioxide which contributes to acid rain, and nitrogen oxides which
cause breathing difficulties.
The white paper concedes that it is impossible to say whether its measures
will lead to more coal being burnt in the UK. That depends on British Coal's
success in winning more sales with the benefit of the new subsidies.
But Mr Dieter Helm, director of Oxford Economic Research Associates, said:
'The effect of the subsidies is likely to be the displacement of overseas
coal imports with British coal - the total coalburn in the UK may not go
up.'
Environmentalists welcomed the smaller role given to orimulsion because of
its high sulphur content. The white paper expects an annual reduction in
orimulsion use of at least 500,000 tonnes equivalent of coal.
The Campaign for the Protection of Rural England also warmed to the
shrinking share of opencast coal mining. The paper accepts British Coal's
projections of a fall in opencast output from the current 16m tonnes to less
than 12m tonnes in 1997-98.
However, sharp differences emerged between the government and pressure
groups over which fuels would replace coal in the long term.
The white paper says: 'Some of the groups found themselves attempting to
reconcile a wish for strict emissions targets, and hence a wish to phase out
all fossil fuel burning, with a dislike for the nuclear option and support
for coal in the short term. They were able to do so only by implausible
assumptions about the speed at which renewables and energy efficiency could
contribute.'
Friends of the Earth and other groups attacked the statement that there was
no reason to close down Magnox nuclear reactors prematurely.
The white paper supported long-term research into clean-coal technology,
which strips coal-burning power stations' emissions of many of their
damaging components - although not carbon dioxide - but warned that the
present cost made it uneconomic.
Up to Pounds 12m of new research funds will go over next three years to
British Coal's Research Establishment.
Friends of the Earth called the paper's encouragement for renewable energy -
wind and wave power - 'a glimmer of light'. The paper has accepted the
recommendation of last year's advisory group that the UK should try to have
1,500MW of new electricity generating capacity from renewables by the year
2000.

FT  26 MAR 93 / The Coal White Paper: Reprieves may not last three years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TRANSFORMATION in the British coal industry was set in motion by
yesterday's white paper. But in three years' time the industry under British
Coal - or its successors after the privatisation promised yesterday - may be
little different in size and efficiency from what the government envisaged
before the pit crisis developed.
Public pressure has forced a reprieve for most of the 31 pits originally
earmarked for closure. But in many cases the reprieve will be temporary and
in some cases it will last perhaps less than a year.
Radical changes in working practices were outlined in the white paper. For
example the 1908 restriction on hours worked underground will be removed.
But privatisation may have made these changes inevitable.
The changes will help British Coal to become more competitive, but it will
struggle to match the prices of its international competitors by the time of
privatisation, probably in two or three years.
If it proves impossible, PowerGen and National Power will look abroad once
more for whatever coal they need above the 'base tonnage' contracts that
must be signed by the end of the month.
By 1995 the coal industry will have to compete with increasing amounts of
nuclear power and, more importantly, gas-fired electricity. The chances of
keeping all 31 surviving pits open after two years, let alone re-opening the
seven which were mothballed yesterday, seem remote.
Negotiations between British Coal and the electricity generators will
continue on additional tonnages above the base contracts. There was nothing
in yesterday's document, however, likely to persuade the electricity
industry to take anything like the 65.5m tonnes over five years which the
government originally hoped for.
Even 40m tonnes will be difficult following the imposition of value added
tax on domestic fuel prices, which will depress the demand for coal.
What has become clear, however, is that the government is setting a course
for gradual privatisation of the coal industry by selling off both the 12
pits which are definitely to close and the seven which are to be mothballed.
In the meantime British Coal's powers over potential competitors will be
reduced by the establishment of an independent coal authority, which will
take over the corporation's role of supervising licensees.
British Coal was sanguine about the white paper's outcome. Mr Neil Clarke,
chairman, said: 'We accept that the white paper represents the best outcome
from the review that can be achieved.'
British Coal anticipates that the closure of the two collieries and the
mothballing of the seven will lead to the loss of about 5,800 jobs. This
compares with more than 30,000 envisaged in October, although more than
8,000 have left the industry since then.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Michael Heseltine
Trade &amp; industry secretary

'I have done all that I reasonably could, consistent with economic
realities and legal constraints, to increase the opportunities for
British Coal. The outcome will be settled. . .in the market place.'
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Norman Willis
TUC general secretary
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
'The White Paper is a deliberate deception. What is on offer is nothing

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Neil Clarke

Malcolm Edwards
Former commercial director British Coal

British Coal over the last six months.'
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Richard Caborn
Chairman trade &amp; industry select committee
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
'All 31 pits could be closed in three to four years' time. That is going
to cost the British taxpayer Pounds 2 billion. This year there could
be 18 pits closed, and 18,300 jobs lost'

FT  26 MAR 93 / The Coal White Paper: Power station may mean 5,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GO-AHEAD for a gas-fired power station at Connah's Quay, Clwyd, may lead
to the creation of up to 5,000 jobs for Merseyside, Cheshire and north Wales
 -but it will not save the Cammell Laird shipyard from closure in July, Ian
Hamilton Fazey writes.
The Pounds 500m, 1,360MW power station will guarantee a market for four new
gas fields discovered by Hamilton Oil, Lasmo and Monument in Liverpool Bay.
Gas supplies of 1,000bn cu ft should last up to 25 years, as will an
associated find of 200m barrels of oil off Southport. Hamilton puts total
investment at Pounds 1.5bn, with 3,000 construction jobs and 200 permanent
ones. But little construction work is likely before next year - too late for
Cammell Laird at Birkenhead.
Amec, previously the most likely buyer for the yard, is unlikely to bid now,
especially with spare capacity at Amec Offshore on Tyneside. VSEL, the
nuclear submarine builder which owns Cammell Laird, yesterday confirmed the
closure will go ahead.
Amec stopped discussions while the future of the Liverpool Bay gas and oil
fields was uncertain.

FT  26 MAR 93 / The Coal White Paper: Relief as Heseltine offers haven from
Tories' political storms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER NARROW shaft of sunlight has broken through the dark grey clouds
that have overshadowed the government for a full six months. Yesterday the
mood of relief on the Conservative benches was palpable.
Mr Michael Heseltine's highly political compromise on coal may signal the
beginning of a much-needed period of calm for Mr John Major's embattled
administration.
Obstacles undoubtedly lie ahead, not least the Newbury by-election. But the
whiff of optimism in the economic indicators, the successful attempt on
Wednesday to accelerate the Maastricht ratification process and what looks
set to be an escape from the mire of the coalfields has raised Conservative
spirits.
In the parliamentary lobbies last night government business managers were
openly confident about Monday's coal debate.
There may well be continued muffled Tory backbench criticism that the
government ever found itself in such trouble, but the reassertion of
divisions along party lines in the Commons chamber suggested that
traditional political antagonisms over coal have been re-established.
The trade and industry secretary started his statement hesitantly. But it
was soon apparent that the widely leaked formula for the pits should prove
to be enough to secure Monday's vote.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade spokesman warned: 'This is not a rescue plan,
merely a stay of execution,' adding that it might 'buy off' the Tory benches
but would not do the same for the country. But the attack appeared only to
restore Mr Heseltine's confidence as he shouted over heckling that the state
of Britain's coal industry was largely the fault of the last Labour
government.
When Dr Michael Clark, Tory MP for Rochford and a rebel in October, rose to
speak, it was clear he had been won round. Less positively, another Tory
rebel, Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, MP for Batley and Spen, seemed to be shifting
back towards the government, while raising some doubt as to whether enough
had been done to find new coal markets.
But of the original six Tory rebels and five abstainers only Mr Richard
Alexander, the Newark MP, appeared ready to continue defying the whips when
he warned of the 'devastation' which closures would bring to Nottinghamshire
pits.
It was also apparent that party politics was back in harness within the
trade and industry committee.
While Mr Richard Caborn, the Labour chairman, and Mr Malcolm Bruce, the
Liberal Democrat, both made their continuing dissatisfaction known, several
Tories, such as Dr Keith Hampson, a long-time Heseltine loyalist, insisted
that the broad thrust of the committee's demands had been met.
At the weekly meeting of the Tory backbench 1922 committee last night there
was a distinct sense that, for the first time since last year's 'autumn of
banana skins', a hint of spring has broken through.

FT  26 MAR 93 / The Coal White Paper: NUM attacks plan as a 'cynical
political fix'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL THE mining unions reacted angrily last night to the white paper in a
chorus of denunciation. It was condemned as 'a sham', a 'betrayal' and a
'deliberate deception'.
A lobby of parliament is being organised for Monday by the Trades Union
Congress to protest at the plans.
The National Union of Mineworkers called Mr Heseltine's proposals a 'cynical
political fix' designed to deceive the public. The NUM is already holding a
24-hour strike next Friday in protest at the proposed pit closures and
further industrial action is expected.
The leaders of the moderate Union of Democratic Mineworkers were
particularly disappointed by the white paper. For the past four months they
have lobbied the government and Conservative MPs behind the scenes to save
the threatened pits in their stronghold, the Nottinghamshire coalfield.
'It means closure by stealth. The miners have been conned. It is a
short-term fudge,' declared Mr David Prendegast, UDM vice-president.
Mr Heseltine said in the Commons that the government could not reprieve pits
simply because the moderate UDM was the dominant force and not the more
militant NUM.
Only three of the threatened Nottinghamshire pits - Bilsthorpe, Rufford and
Calverton - are to be saved compared with five in the Yorkshire region.
Three more Nottinghamshire pits - Clipstone, Bevercotes and Shirebrook -
have been put on a care and maintenance basis.
The government has tried to cushion the blow for the coalfield. The
headquarters of the proposed Coal Authority will be based in Nottingham,
while a regional development authority is to be established for the east
Midlands.
Even the British Association of Colliery Management (Bacom) expressed strong
opposition to Mr Heseltine's proposals. Mr John Meads, Bacom's general
secretary, denounced them as 'a sham'.
Mr Heseltine announced that the government intended to improve its existing
allocation of help up to Pounds 200m for regeneration programmes designed
mainly to introduce new industry on to the coalfields.
Last week it was announced that the miners' redundancy scheme would continue
to the end of the year to help the 5,800 further miners who will be made
redundant. About 9,000 have volunteered for redundancy since last October.
The decision to give the go-ahead to more flexible working practices
designed to make the surviving pits more competitive would mean - subject to
consultation - removing the 80-year-old maximum restriction on working hours
to allow longer shifts to be worked.

FT  26 MAR 93 / The Coal White Paper: Ground is laid for full privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Coal has been told to prepare for full privatisation. The government
intends to sell all British Coal's commercial operations to the
private-sector, and is proposing a new form of regulatory structure. A bill
is expected in the next session of parliament beginning in the autumn.
The crucial element will be separation of the regulatory and mining
functions of British Coal to remove the potentially serious conflict of
interest which could arise from British Coal licensing competitors.
A new public body, the Coal Authority, will be responsible for licensing all
coal mining activity. The authority, which will be prohibited from mining,
will have its headquarters in Nottinghamshire.
The white paper says there are clear benefits to the coal industry and to
consumers in freeing the industry's managers from the constraints of
public-sector ownership.
'It is to a large extent these constraints that have brought British Coal to
its present position, and there can be no confidence that within them the
industry will achieve the dramatic changes necessary if it is to have a
long-term future,' it says.
The government wants transfers to the private sector to be implemented as
quickly as possible once the legislation is passed. British Coal will also
be prepared to consider proposals for the sale of regional coal mining
packages as well as the sale of individual pits.
The white paper view that there were considerable attractions to giving
private-sector mining companies the opportunity to run pits that would
otherwise close was welcomed warmly, though cautiously, by the companies.
Many private mining groups were enthusiastic. Mr Richard Budge, chairman of
RJB Mining, which operates two deep coal mines in north-west England, said
it was a 'very balanced result' which would give subsidies to both the
public and private sectors.
He said of privatisation: 'It's not a question of cutting wages - it's a
change of culture that matters. With the commitment of our workers it would
be bound to be a success.'
Mr Malcolm Edwards, former British Coal marketing director who hopes to lead
a consortium to licence up to four mines in the Yorkshire region, said coal
buyers would warmly welcome alternative suppliers of UK coal, as British
Coal had not always been able to supply some specialised markets.
'We can't make an immediate commitment - we are miles from that. All we can
do is express a genuine commercial interest and say what could be done.'
Hanson, one of the companies most frequently named as a potential buyer, was
particularly cautious. All a spokesman would say was: 'Until we have more
information it is difficult for us to reach any decision, so we do not
register interest or disinterest until details are clearer.'

FT  26 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers to hold drug cost talks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT will meet pharmaceutical industry representatives to seek
agreement on why the National Health Service drugs bill is rising so fast,
MPs were told yesterday.
Mr Tom Sackville, junior health minister, told the House that his
department's analysis of 'complex' reasons for the 39 per cent real terms
increase from Pounds 1.2bn in 1982 to Pounds 2.9bn in England last year
differed from the industry's.
'We must ensure that money spent on medicines is money well spent,' he said.
Later Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said the government was
backing the pharmaceutical industry's belief that the London area was the
most promising site for the European Medicines Evaluation Agency - if the
body was located in the UK.

<TEXT>
LOCAL COUNCILS should act as the natural leaders of their communities in
directing initiatives and seeking investment, Mr John Redwood, the local
government minister, urged yesterday, Alison Smith writes.
As part of the government's drive to develop a better partnership between
central and local government, Mr Redwood said local authorities should
expand on their experience in developing bids for City Challenge funds to
show their ability to co-operate with local business and community leaders
in other areas.
Labour last night suffered its second landslide council by-election defeat
in three weeks at London's troubled Lambeth borough.
Liberal Democrat Ms Sally Prentice gained a seat at Vauxhall's Bishops ward
on a 37 per cent swing from the 1990 polls.
In Westminster, the Tories kept their seat in Hyde Park ward in the
by-election caused by the resignation of former leader Dame Shirley Porter,
but there was a 3.9 per cent swing to Labour.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Watchdog warns on handling of
complaints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PARLIAMENTARY ombudsman has warned government departments and agencies
to maintain adequate complaints procedures for the public when contracting
out Civil Service work.
In his annual report published yesterday, Mr William Reid said complaints
against government departments and bodies rose 18 per cent to 945 last year,
the highest level since 1980.
More than half the 190 complaints investigated were fully justified, he
said. Altogether, 93 per cent had been partly or fully justified.
Mr Reid said the government's contracting-out programme could have a
significant impact on the quality of those services that were of great
importance to the public.
'Whatever the merits of any system, those charged with running it are human
and will make mistakes,' Mr Reid said. 'There should be an effective way of
delivering redress for justified grievances.'
Departments and agencies should not pass responsibility for maintaining
standards of service to the contractor who is providing them, the ombudsman
said.
The department of social security remained the biggest source of complaints,
providing 30 per cent of cases referred. The next largest workload came from
the Inland Revenue (19 pee cent), environment department (7 per cent) and
transport department (5 per cent).
The Home Office, Scottish Office and department of health recorded
significant falls in complaints.
The biggest single subject of complaint was the new disability living
allowance, introduced in April 1992. More than 80 complaints had been
received about extreme delay and the mishandling of claims.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Mexico: Salinas leads the attack on poverty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE dusty squatter town of Chalco, in the state of Mexico, slogans for
Solidarity cover billboards and houses. Schools, roads and clinics are named
Solidarity. Women in blue tracksuits roam the streets promoting Solidarity.
This is Mexico's Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.9bn) a year anti-poverty
initiative, the most visible government programme of President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari. Attacked by critics as a pork-barrel that subverts
democracy, Solidarity is hailed by government officials as a leap forward.
The need for some kind of anti-poverty programme is uncontroversial.
According to the World Bank around 20 per cent of Mexicans - 17m people -
are extremely poor: that is, they do not have enough money to meet minimum
nutritional levels. Most of these live in the countryside. They have the
lowest levels of education and are from, and have, large families.
Solidarity is intended to integrate these people into the mainstream
economy, by giving them critical public services, and letting them benefit
from the government's pro-market economic reforms and restructuring
(lowering inflation to single digits, reducing middle-class subsidies and
reforming agriculture). In four years, Solidarity has provided around 10m
people with electricity and water, 8m with drainage, provided half a million
school scholarships and created 2,400 small businesses.
Unlike many poverty plans, the Solidarity infrastructure programme does not
pour money into depressed areas. It is founded largely on the president's
belief that projects that are run locally will be better supported and more
efficient. The community must first form a Solidarity committee which
requests funds for specific projects. The federal or state government
provides basic materials, technical help, and the local Solidarity committee
builds its road, school, or clinic.
Since the community is sharing the cost of a project (through time
committed) and identifying its own needs, it is unlikely to choose plans
that do not benefit it. Further, the federal government saves money. Mr
Carlos Rojas, head of Solidarity, estimates that roads are built at 70 per
cent of normal cost and schools at 60 per cent.
There are about 100,000 Solidarity committees around the country, forming a
network of support for Mr Salinas.
The president has taken care to ensure he is identified closely with the
programme: he spends two days a week inaugurating Solidarity projects and
handing out land titles, dashing with his entourage of journalists,
businessmen, and politicians from village to village by helicopter. The
school, clinic, or land title is then widely seen as his personal gift.
The opposition argues that the programme undermines democracy by making it
difficult for the opposition to compete.
There is also evidence Solidarity spending is directed politically. Mr Juan
Molinar, a professor at the Colegio de Mexico, has just completed an
econometric evaluation of Solidarity spending and concludes: 'Solidarity is
not an apolitical policy for alleviating poverty; on the contrary it is
clear that the central planners make the decision to spend based on
political and electoral concerns.'
The World Bank asks whether the Solidarity programme should be more focused
on its key programmes. It covers food support for the undernourished, free
credit for farmers, risk capital for small businesses, scholarships for
children, land titles for squatters, and urgent infrastructure needs, such
as as roads, electricity, hospitals, to name a few.
Government officials retort that an all-embracing programme is necessary
given the costs associated with the restructuring of Mexico's economy. Mr
Donaldo Colosio, social development minister, says: 'The network of social
protection is crucial given the current economic restructuring, above all
the (economy's) technological and productive transformation.' Solidarity, Mr
Colosio says, is thus helping start new businesses in parts of the country
worse hit by industrial restructuring - Puebla, Veracruz, and northern
Tabasco.
Mr Carlos Flores Rico, the social development delegate for the state of
Mexico, argues Solidarity has helped the Institutional Revolutionary Party
electorally not just because it gives public goods away, but also because it
gives citizens a stake in their community. 'Now people own their houses,
electricity, and water whereas before they were outcasts,' he says. Their
view of the system has changed.'
For this reason, even those like the World Bank who believe the structural
economic reforms are likely to have a longer term impact than a Dollars
2bn-Dollars 3bn anti-poverty programme, accept the value of Solidarity. The
programme, they argue, has helped generate political support for economic
reforms by giving people tangible benefits instead of just hardship.

GERALDO MARINHO lives on a hill with one of the most spectacular views in
the world. Spread out below is the palm-fringed crescent of Rio's Sao
Conrado beach, lined with luxury apartments blocks, their rooftop swimming
pools glimmering in the sun.
Unlike those he looks down upon, Mr Marinho lives with his seven-member
family in a crumbling two-roomed shack in Rocinha, one of the many favelas,
or slums, clinging to the hills of Rio, and the largest in Latin America.
Mr Marinho's home is reached through a labyrinth of narrow passageways,
crowded with similar shacks. No door can shut out the fetid smell from the
black stream of sewage and litter gushing alongside with its constant threat
of diseases such as cholera.
Mr Marinho is one of 43m Brazilians living in poverty. Brazil has one of the
world's biggest gaps between rich and poor. The richest 20 per cent earn
more than 26 times the poorest.
Despite being the richest economy in Latin America and the ninth largest in
the world, Brazil's infant mortality and illiteracy rates rank along with
Bolivia and Guatemala as the worst in the continent. The world's second
largest food exporter, Brazil has scenes of hunger comparable to
famine-struck Africa.
Mr Jutahy Magalhaes, minister for Social Well-being, sums up: 'We are
simultaneously the most developed and the poorest country in Latin America.
We export technology and manufacture satellites yet we have not erased
diseases of the middle ages.'
Long ignored by politicians, Brazil's 'social apartheid' is now provoking
hot debate. The army minister has warned of social unrest and President
Itamar Franco has called for his ministers to devise poverty eradication
programmes after receiving a 'hunger map' showing 32m Brazilians suffering
chronic malnutrition.
Those in Rocinha are sceptical. 'Governments are just for the rich,' says Mr
Jose Carlos de Souza from the Favela Association.
The rapid industrialisation which transformed Brazil from a sleepy coffee
economy to an industrial power and saw an annual growth rate of 7 per cent
between 1940 and 1980 served largely to strengthen the grip of the elites.
Today's real minimum wage of Dollars 64 (Pounds 45) per month for example is
two-thirds of its 1940 level.
The recession of the past three years has worsened the situation, with
higher unemployment and inflation.
Brazil's poverty has been made more visible by the rural migration which
accompanied industrialisation. Since 1960 the proportion of the population
living in cities has risen from 40 to 75 per cent.
Official figures show the number of favelas in Rio has increased from 373 to
570 in the past 10 years; in the city of Recife they are home to 44 per cent
of the population. According to Mr Jutahy, Brazil's housing deficit is 10m
and rising. Most poverty is concentrated in the north-east. The area suffers
blistering yearly droughts because of the lack of infrastructure to harness
the country's rainfall.
Despite the government's current cash crisis, Brazil's social problems do
not emanate from a lack of funds. Rather than tackle the real causes,
politicians have offered short-term solutions such as emergency
food-baskets, usually around election time.
Much of the money allocated to social programmes is lost through waste and
corruption. Mr Jutahy estimates as little as 15 per cent of federal funds
reach their intended destinations. A World Bank official says: 'This
wouldn't be so bad if what was left was spent usefully, but it's not.' This
has discouraged action by international agencies. Mr Agop Kayayan, Unicef
representative in Brazil, says: 'I feel like Don Quixote tilting at
windmills.'
The fact that the problems can be tackled is demonstrated by the recent
experience of Ceara, Brazil's third poorest state. Despite inheriting a
bankrupt administration on becoming governor in 1986, Mr Tasso Jereissati
managed to reduce infant mortality by a third. He says: 'The problem in
Brazil is far more lack of shame than lack of money.'
The Jereissatis in Brazil are few; people are losing hope in the future and
all faith in the political system. 'We are heading towards an explosive
situation,' says Mr Jutahy.
Brazil is the world's second largest market for private jets, yet 52 per
cent of the working population earn less than Dollars 120 a month.
Shocked by the contrast between Brazil's haves and have-nots, particularly
visible in Rio, visitors often ask why there is no revolution. In fact,
groups from the favelas have taken to attacking supermarkets and emptying
them of produce. One can be shot for a pair of sneakers or have one's hair
hacked off at knifepoint. In some ways the revolution has already started.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Venezuela: little trust of state among the poorest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARRIO Union, rising up the slopes of the mountains east of Caracas, is by
no means the worst of the slums in Venezuela, one of the region's richer
countries. It is a comparatively old barrios bajos, having emerged in the
1950s. Most houses are built of cinder-block rather than the chipboard that
dominates newer slums. The residents paint a depressing picture of a decline
in the 1980s which progressively worsened.
'The years 1988, 1989 and 1990 were disastrous for the Barrio Union,' says a
community leader, Ms Cira Macado.
In almost every contact with the state, the citizens of Barrio Union are
given reason for deeper distrust. They see police in league with the drug
traffickers; soldiers arriving with weapons to sell to criminals;
politicians who arrive just before election time laden with promises.
The country is Latin America's most urban society - 85 per cent of the
population lives in the cities.
The government put in place 'targeted' poverty programmes after the February
1989 food riots. Yet claiming the food and other benefits often means
travelling long distances, and hours in queues waiting for handouts.
These targeted measures are described by Mr Gustavo Marquez, an expert in
poverty at the Caracas business school IESA, as 'the most important effort
ever made by any government in Venezuela to support low income groups
through an economic crisis'. However,although in 1991 the government spent
close to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 704m) - 2 per cent of GDP - on these
programmes, he says they were too little to compensate the poor for the fall
in real incomes.
Mr Marquez says the exclusive emphasis on poverty alleviation is misplaced.
'We need to produce policies that are able to integrate the poor as
consumers and producers in a growing economy. Growth and enhanced
availability and access to high-quality social services, particularly
education and health, are the proven way out of poverty.'
The quality of health and education provision has declined sharply through
the 1980s. Government spending on these did not drop drastically, but the
allocation of resources is uneven, and often heavily weighted towards
administration costs.
Yet not all is not pessimism. The government has enlisted the help of
voluntary organisations. It has sought a decentralisation of power and to
enhance the role of state and local government.
Channelling money into local projects has, in areas such as Nueva Tacagua,
met with significant success. Nueva Tacagua, a barrio perched high over the
west of Caracas, is home to 100,000 people. In 1989, it suffered fires,
floods and collapse of mountainside houses.
The lack of official response prompted residents to take matters into their
own hands. In an unusual exercise of democracy, they established a programme
for developing the area. Out of it emerged a local leadership, not linked to
political parties, and an organisation covering education, health and
environment.
However, the extent to which small community groups can be expected to
administer a nationwide system of poverty alleviation is open to question.
And there is no guarantee that current programmes will continue when the new
administration takes power early next year.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Lands where rich and poor are furthest apart: Poverty in
Latin America - As the IADB meets in Hamburg, FT writers look at the plight
of individual countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATIN America's governments have won wide praise for economic reform
programmes credited with restoring growth and lowering inflation. Investors
have responded enthusiastically. Net capital inflows to Latin America last
year exceeded Dollars 50bn (Pounds 35.2bn), suggesting much of the region is
at last emerging from the debt crisis of the 1980s.
Yet the recession induced by the debt crisis may have left a more lasting
legacy that could yet thwart the aspirations of these new investors and
reverse the pro-market economic policies that encouraged them. The shift to
democracy in much of the region may also be at risk.
The problem is poverty and the related issue of income inequality. Income is
more concentrated in the hands of the rich in Latin America than in any
other region of the world. In the 1980s, inequalities worsened significantly
and poverty increased.
Meeting last year in Washington, the region's finance ministers decided this
could undo all their good work. Social objectives - to enable the poor to
benefit from growth - were pushed up their agendas. Partly as a result,
social issues are a high priority at this year's annual meetings of the
InterAmerican Development Bank, starting today in Hamburg.
Yet raising national income is a complicated task; adding specific policies
to improve income distribution makes it more so. As a two-year round of
presidential elections approaches in the region, the question arises of
whether both issues can be tackled in the framework of economic policies
still regarded favourably by investors. 'Spending more is easy; spending
better is difficult,' says Mr Gustavo Marquez, a Venezuelan expert on
poverty.
A study from the World Bank underlines the deterioration in social
conditions in the 1980s. It suggests the number of people in poverty -
defined as a household income in 1985 dollars of Dollars 60 monthly - in
Latin America grew from 27 per cent of the population in 1980 to 32 per cent
in 1989. Other estimates suggest a more dramatic increase in poverty through
the decade from 130m to 180m, two-fifths of the population. The study also
suggests income inequalities grew in all except four countries: Colombia,
Costa Rica, Paraguay and Uruguay.
In the 1980s, the study indicates, poverty in Latin America and the
Caribbean became a mainly urban rather than rural problem. More of the poor
now live in cities (69m) than in the country (64m); in 1980, most of the
poor lived in rural areas (53m) rather than in urban areas (39m).
Most poverty is concentrated in a few countries. Brazil alone, with
one-third of the population, accounts for 44 per cent of the poor. Mexico
had 11 per cent and Peru 9 per cent. A further 19 per cent lived in a small
group of countries including Bolivia, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras and
Nicaragua. As much as 44 per cent of the total increase in poverty in the
1980s was in Brazil, and 14 per cent in Peru.
Resolving the poverty issue is on the face of it simple, but in practice
hugely complicated. Wealth is so concentrated in Latin America that a
relatively modest sacrifice could apparently address the problem. As the
World Bank's 1990 World Development Report suggested: 'Raising all the poor
in the continent to just above the poverty line would cost only 0.7 per cent
of regional GDP - the approximate equivalent of a 2 per cent income tax on
the wealthiest fifth of the population.'
Even if such taxes were levied - and, even less likely, paid - social
programmes would still have to be implemented. These fall into two
categories: trying to provide support to alleviate immediate suffering; and
aiming at longer-term objectives, such as improving education and health
standards to provide a way out of poverty.
Yet Latin American experience has been that little of the money aimed
directly at the poor reaches them, raising the question of how to manage
poverty programmes. Furthermore, attempts to deal with issues such as health
and education founder usually against the opposition of powerful vested
interests such as teachers' and health workers' unions.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Franco curbs Brazilian electricity price rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Itamar Franco of Brazil yesterday announced a 30 per cent limit on
electricity price increases for April and imposed a limit of 5 per cent
above inflation per month for the next five months.
The president's action appears to threaten the radical change in Brazil's
energy policy implemented in January to allow state distribution companies
to decide their own electricity tariffs.
The new limits were prompted by a decision by the state of Mato Grosso do
Sul on Wednesday to raise electricity prices by 56 per cent.
The policy change giving the states a free hand on prices was approved by
Congress in January with the aim of recuperating the financial health of
Eletrobras, the state holding company, which is owed an estimated Dollars
20bn (Pounds 14bn) by its distributors. They in turn are owed large amounts
by state companies.
Energy tariffs have always been set at one price by the federal government,
regardless of the efficiency of the local concessionary, and kept
deliberately low by governments to contain inflation. The president of
Eletrobras says prices are now at a historic low in real terms. In the last
two months, for example, there has been no increase despite inflation of
around 27 per cent a month.
Under the new legislation the local distribution companies of Brazil's 27
states were told they were free to set their own tariffs from the beginning
of April after presenting cost plans to the federal government.
The heads of state companies say price rises allowed under the president's
new restrictions are insufficient. They point out that since October,
electricity prices have risen only 133 per cent, whereas the cost of
telephone calls has gone up 372 per cent. An official from the Mines and
Energy Ministry warned: 'If they don't like this then we'll just have to go
back to the old system where we set the tariffs.'

FT  26 MAR 93 / US home sales fall sharply again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SALES of existing US homes fell sharply in February for the second month
running, but most analysts expect a recovery in the spring following a
recent surge in mortgage applications.
Sales fell 6.1 per cent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
3.55m, according to figures from the National Association of Realtors. This
followed a 6.4 per cent decline between December and January.
The fall since Christmas has wiped out most of the market's recovery last
year, leaving sales only 2.6 per cent higher than in February 1992.
The figures are notoriously volatile and contrasted with analysts' forecasts
of a modest rebound in sales following a weaker-than-expected housing market
in January.
The weakness last month was broadly based, with all regions, including the
west and south, reporting falling sales. This suggests the decline is not
fully accounted for by adverse weather conditions mainly afflicting the east
coast.
Economists at Merrill Lynch, the New York broker, predicted a strong sales
recovery from next month, reflecting a sharp increase in mortgage
applications in recent weeks after the decline in long-term interest rates.
Mr William Chee, president of the National Association of Realtors, said:
'More people are becoming convinced the recovery is here to stay. There is
substantial pent-up demand to be filled, due to consumer reluctance to enter
the market during the recession.'
Separate figures published yesterday showed a slight decline in state claims
for unemployment insurance to 349,000 in the week ending March 20,
indicating labour market conditions are improving slowly.
Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan said there was some reason for
optimism that bank lending would improve, although problems remained, Reuter
reports from Washington.
In prepared testimony before the House committee on small business, Mr
Greenspan said there was some 'firmness' in commercial real estate markets
and surveys by the Fed indicated banks were feeling less cautious about
loans and risk-taking. Nevertheless, the effect on banks of 'excess optimism
in real estate in the 1980s is not. . . as yet behind us.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN governments must not allow the problems of Russia and other former
Soviet republics to divert attention from the needs of even poorer countries
in the third world, Mr Lewis Preston, the World Bank president, warned in a
carefully timed speech yesterday.
'We must not neglect what is the fundamental challenge of the remainder of
this decade: development - economic and social progress throughout the
world,' he said, noting that 60 per cent of the world's population subsisted
on less than Dollars 2 a day.
The Group of Seven industrial countries is preparing a package of support
for Russia.
Mr Preston criticised governments for cutting aid budgets when the list of
countries needing help was growing and called on the US in particular to
honour its Dollars 3.75bn (Pounds 2.6bn) commitment to a planned Dollars
18bn replenishment of funds for the International Development Association,
the arm of the bank that provides highly concessional loans for the poorest
countries.
Bank officials are worried that the US Congress may baulk at approving the
US's generous contribution to IDA, which was agreed during the final months
of the Bush administration. The fear is that the domestic sacrifices called
for in President Bill Clinton's economic plan, coupled with pressure for
increased financial support for Russia, will erode congressional support for
foreign aid, which tends to be fragile at the best of times.
'Without US approval, the agreement could completely unravel,' Mr Preston
said, noting that each dollar committed by the US was matched by Dollars 4
from other countries.
Support for economic development was the 'only solution to the challenges of
the post-cold war era', he said. There was a growing 'commonality of
interests' between rich and poor countries because a fifth of world output
was now traded between the developed and developing worlds.
In the US, trade with developing countries was the fastest growing segment
of the economy. Helping poor countries was thus 'one of the most effective
ways to create jobs and wealth here in America', he said.
'Conversely, not helping the poorer countries carries negative consequences
for us all' - including increasing numbers of refugees, spread of drugs and
disease and the prospect of an 'irreversibly damaged' environment.

JAPANESE commercial land prices fell an average 11.4 per cent last year, the
first time there have been two consecutive years of decline, the National
Land Agency said yesterday.
The continuing fall reflects the pressure on Japanese banks, much of whose
bad loan burden arises from lending to property developers or their
acceptance of over-priced property as collateral.
Commercial property values slipped by as much as 24.2 per cent in the area
around Osaka, Japan's second largest city, where prices surged above those
of Tokyo in the late 1980s during the so-called 'bubble era'.
Residential prices fell by an average 8.7 per cent nationally, with the
largest fall of 22.9 per cent also in the Osaka area, where speculative
building of apartments peaked just after the asset price collapse began in
early 1990.
The agency said the fall in prices appears to be continuing, although in
some residential areas of Tokyo buyers have re-emerged in recent months,
believing that prices are near their bottom.
Commercial prices are particularly weak, as developers have continued with
projects in the hope that the market would improve, creating an ever larger
glut of office space in areas of Tokyo and Osaka.
Japanese banks are hoping that the property market will be stimulated by the
work of their Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company (CCPC), which was
established in January and yesterday began buying banks' non-performing
loans and assessing property collateral.
In coming days, CCPC is expected to release a list of deals done and
assessed property values, which the banking industry would like to use as a
floor for still falling prices. However, it is expected that the company
will be reluctant to assess properties too harshly for fear of prompting
further price falls.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Netanyahu voted Likud leader

MR Binyamin Netanyahu was yesterday elected leader of Israel's right-wing
opposition Likud party and is likely to be a strong contender for the
premiership when it is contested in about three years' time.
At 46, he is the first of the younger generation of Israeli politicians to
emerge as a contender for the country's highest office and can be expected
to launch an immediate assault on the performance of Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the
prime minister, who led Labour to victory in last June's general election -
the result that prompted the retirement of the veteran Mr Yitzhak Shamir as
Likud's leader.
Mr Netanyahu, best known in Israel as 'Bibi', won the four-cornered contest
by a surprisingly large margin of 52.1 per cent of the vote by Likud
members, against 26.3 per cent for Mr David Levy, a former foreign minister,
15.1 per cent for Mr Benny Begin, son of former prime minister Menachem
Begin, and 6.6 per cent for Mr Moshe Katsav, a former transport minister.
The size of Mr Netanyahu's victory should allow him to exercise authority
over a divided party which suffered from a bruising and bitter leadership
campaign.
The run-up to the election was marked by an extraordinary allegation by Mr
Netanyahu that a senior Likud opponent had attempted to blackmail him over
his marital infidelities. Mr Levy, who claimed that the allegation was aimed
at him, said in advance of yesterday's result that he could not serve under
Mr Netanyahu.
After yesterday's result Mr Levy asked: 'Can I co-operate with someone who
called me a criminal?' He refused to congratulate the winner but said that
he would stay in the party. The other two candidates both said they would
co-operate with the new leader. It is believed most other former Likud
cabinet ministers also voted for candidates other than the winner.
Mr Netanyahu is best known internationally as Israel's principal spokesman
during the Gulf war but has also served as deputy foreign minister and
ambassador to the UN. His mastery of television, good looks, and ability to
speak in short, pithy sentences, worked in his favour but has prompted
accusations that he lacks depth and political conviction.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Jingsheng makes first public appearance since imprisonment
in 1979
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR WEI Jingsheng, China's most celebrated dissident, has been shown on Hong
Kong television - the first time he has appeared publicly since his
imprisonment in 1979, Tony Walker writes.
The 'unveiling' of Mr Wei, who is still serving a 15-year jail term,
suggests that the authorities may be preparing the ground for his release.
His appearance also seems aimed at answering international criticism of
China's human rights record.
China is sensitive to continuing criticism in the US Congress, accompanied
by threats that it may deny Beijing renewal of its Most Favoured Nation
status, vital to its continued access to the huge American market. Beijing,
which is bidding to stage the 2,000 Olympiad, is also thought to want to
forestall suggestions by human rights groups that its continued detention of
dissidents should disqualify it from securing the Olympics.
Mr Wei, an electrician, was accused of passing military secrets to
foreigners, and also of being one of the ringleaders of the democracy
movement in the late 1970s. The long-serving dissident had never admitted
his guilt.

MR Simon Upton, the New Zealand health minister responsible for implementing
an unpopular reform of public hospitals and health funding, lost his
portfolio yesterday in a cabinet shake-up apparently designed to bolster the
National government's chances in this year's general election.
He is being replaced by the Prime Minister Jim Bolger's closest ally, Mr
Bill Birch, who is widely acknowledged as the most powerful minister in the
cabinet. Mr Birch, known as Mr Fixit, is expected to lead a campaign to
explain and popularise the planned changes in the health area. Opinion polls
show 75 per cent of voters oppose the changes.
The main surprise was that Ms Ruth Richardson, the finance minister, kept
her position It had been widely expected that she would lose her
responsibilities for tax matters following widespread disquiet among
government backbenchers. Last week Ms Richardson suffered a setback when she
was forced to back down on proposed tax changes due to party opposition.
Mr Wyatt Creech, the minister of revenue, who had been expected to be
appointed a full associate of Ms Richardson's in the finance ministry, was
instead given additional responsibilities as minister of state owned
enterprises.
The changes follow opinion polls which show that the government is
consistently trailing Labour by between 18 and 20 points.

FT  26 MAR 93 / China to cut 8m bureaucratic jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA plans to cut staff in its vast bureaucracy and among bloated
industrial enterprises by more than 8m, or 25 per cent of the total. It is
also overhauling its entire bureaucratic structure, abolishing a number of
ministries, bureaux and departments and creating new institutions to replace
them.
If Beijing presses ahead with staff cuts and alterations to ministries -
previous grandiose plans for bureaucratic reform have foundered - it would
amount to the most sweeping reorganisation of the state sector since the
early years of the People's Republic.
Ministers have also pledged to increase wages of state employees, partly to
stem an alarming exodus of some of the government's more talented people to
the private sector.
The government's timetable for these changes has not been spelled out.
Western officials note that Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's supreme leader, called
for wholesale bureaucratic reform in 1979, but progress has been extremely
slow because of resistance from entrenched interests.
But the recent explosion in the Chinese economy - economic growth last year
was close to 13 per cent - had strengthened arguments for accelerated reform
of China's sprawling state sector.
One official said that, while scepticism was in order about China's likely
success in 'downsizing' its giant bureaucracy, 'what's going on here is not
smoke and mirrors.'
Perhaps the most important aim of the restructuring, apart from reducing
numbers, was to strengthen policy-making departments at the centre, while
hiving off sections of the bureaucracy engaged in commercial activities into
decentralised corporations.
Sketchy details of the government's plans to slash staff were disclosed at a
Beijing press conference this week by Mr Zhan Dongwan, the minister of
personnel, who outlined cuts of more than 25 per cent to state industrial
enterprises, and 20 per cent to party and government agencies.
He said government staff totalled 34m. Party employees and bureaucrats
number 9.2m. The plans are being debated at the current session of the
National People's Congress, or parliament. A number of deputies have opposed
the changes.
Mr Zhan pledged that the 'mass lay-offs' would not spawn unemployment.
Redundant staff would find work in other areas such as the service sector,
or would 'return to the grass roots.' Others would be retrained. The
retirement age would be strictly enforced.
'Government organisations at all levels are overstaffed which runs counter
to our market economy,' he declared. Among changes proposed to the
ministerial structure are abolition of seven ministries: Energy, Machine
Building and Electronics Industries, Aviation and Space Industries, Light
Industry, Textile Industry and Commerce and Supplies. In their place the
government is proposing five new ministries.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Akers-Jones asserts his loyalty to HK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR David Akers-Jones, the former chief secretary of Hong Kong who will
shortly become China's first expatriate adviser on the colony's affairs, is
a little confused.
He has been surprised and yes, a little saddened, by the reaction to his
appointment in Britain, the land of his birth. The adjective 'perfidious',
which China reserves for Governor Chris Patten, has, in the UK at least, now
been used to describe his decision to accept Beijing's shilling; his loyalty
has been questioned.
'There is no question about my loyalty,' Sir David said yesterday. 'My
loyalty is to Hong Kong and my desire to do all I can to help Hong Kong with
its relations with China - to ensure co-operation and understanding.'
Sir David's mooted appointment as a China adviser, which has yet to be
formally announced, has drawn a cool response from the Hong Kong government,
his former employer. Between clenched teeth, colleagues are contemptuous of
his decision.
'The Chinese are welcome to him,' said one.
Others commented that, in his professional life, he had always been willing
to see China's point of view and had advocated a slow development of
democracy in the colony. Sir David, who is clearly proud of being chosen as
China's first expatriate adviser, says he hopes to be able to contribute
advice to China from a different point of view to its local Hong Kong
Chinese advisers.
'I have been involved in the political development of Hong Kong for a great
deal of my professional life as well as in its planning and infrastructure
development. I think I know what we need to do for the territory's future
development,' he said.
'There is a lack of knowledge in Beijing of how the Hong Kong government
works and how decisions are taken. This could be very useful to China and so
I hope to be able to bring some of that knowledge and understanding to bear
in the advice I give.'
As for Hong Kong's political system, he regards the introduction of limited
democratic elections, in September 1991, as a retrograde step. They did not,
he believes, produce a Legislative Council (the local law making body)
'representative of Hong Kong's polity'.
He is concerned about the government's plans for elections in 1995 and
accepts China's reading of the current breakdown of relations.
'I would like to see the government return to the understandings reached
(between the UK and China in early 1990) and the assumptions the Chinese
quite reasonably made from those exchanges.'
In particular, the Hong Kong government should shelve its plans to create
nine new LegCo seats, the electorates of which are drawn from Hong Kong's
2.7m working population. Instead, they should resemble the existing
'functional' seats which draw their voters from the professions and business
groups.
'One of the achievements of Lord Wilson (the colony's former governor) was
the idea of the smooth transition and the 'through train' concept, whereby
those elected in 1995 served after 1997. It is an achievement that should
not be sacrificed.'

FT  26 MAR 93 / Bombings put focus on India's criminals: The growth of
Bombay's underworld and its links with politicians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITHIN five minutes' walk of the police commissioner's office, street
traders in Bombay are busy selling contraband - anything from French perfume
to Japanese colour televisions. There is even a demand for smuggled condoms.
It is here, working these innocuous-looking stalls in Manish market, that
some of the city's most notorious suspected criminals started their careers
 -among them the two men police believe helped to organise the bomb blasts
which shook Bombay earlier this month.
The pursuit of those held responsible for the attack, which left about 300
dead and more than 1,000 injured, has taken the police deep into the Bombay
underworld.
The hunt has exposed the scale of organised crime in the city - and the
extent to which politicians and businessmen condoned its expansion.
Bombay residents have unwittingly fostered an atmosphere of tolerance of
crime which ultimately helped even the terrorists.
As Mr D S Soman, a former city police commissioner, says: 'Turning a blind
eye to the theft of Rs10 is a little thing, but little things lead to bigger
things.'
The city's criminal underworld was spawned by its port. Prostitution,
gambling, after-hours drinking have long been a part of life, as they are in
many other port cities.
With them came extortion and protection, as well as hiring out thugs for the
settling of commercial disputes.
The opportunities for crime multiplied with an unsuccessful attempt from the
early 1950s to the late 1960s to enforce prohibition in the city. The
efforts by successive Indian governments to protect the country's industries
through high import duties created further scope for illegal profits.
So did controls on foreign exchange, gold and silver. Smuggled gold alone
last year totalled 200 tonnes, worth Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.7bn), against
legitimate imports of 100 tonnes.
The city's gangs accumulated capital and contacts, principally in the
trading centres of the Middle East, including Dubai which has developed into
an off-shore haven for Indian smugglers.
With this growing clout came access to the immensely lucrative international
drugs trade - especially when war in Afghanistan in the 1980s forced many
narcotics smugglers to move their processing operations from Afghanistan and
northern Pakistan to safer locations.
With property prices soaring as the city's population grew, gangs
diversified into land-grabbing - particularly ejecting slum-dwellers so that
their huts could be levelled and the land put to profitable use.
Hindus, Moslems and Christians alike join Bombay's criminal gangs. But
Moslems are the most numerous, partly because Indian Moslems are often
poorly educated, suffer discrimination in mainstream life and because the
most lucrative illegal trade connects India with Islamic countries.
The first to dominate the underworld after the turmoil of independence were
mainly Pathan settlers, tall and strong people from Afghanistan with a
natural advantage in street fighting.
Their leader was Mr Karim Lala, whom the police suspected of controlling
smuggling rings but who escaped prosecution and later engaged in legitimate
businesses. Glorified in Indian films as a latter-day Robin Hood, he now
lives in semi-retirement aged about 80.
Other gangs rose to challenge Mr Lala, none more strongly than a group led
by Mr Dawood Ibrahim, which established itself in gold smuggling in the
1980s. Mr Dawood Ibrahim's and Mr Lala's followers fought a violent turf-war
in which Mr Dawood Ibrahim lost his brother and Mr Lala his adoptive son and
heir.
The violence led police to crack down harder on organised crime. In 1985 Mr
Dawood, Ibrahim, who was wanted by police for questioning in a murder case,
fled to Dubai, from where he continued to direct his operations and earned
the title of king of the underworld. Mr Baljit Parmar, a veteran Bombay
crime reporter who has interviewed Mr Ibrahim, says: 'The stories about
Dawood Ibrahim are sometimes exaggerated. But he is the most powerful gang
leader.'
Criminals could not have prospered without co-operation from police and from
politicians.
'Such connections are difficult to pin down, but they exist,' says Mr Soman.
He says frequent transfers of police between jobs helps to lessen the risk
of policemen falling prey to criminals. But the danger persists, not least
because 15 per cent live in illegal slums for lack of money and proper
housing.
Politicians suspected of gangland links include Mr Pappu Kalani, a liquor
distributor who joined the ruling Congress (I) party and became a member of
the Maharashtra state assembly and a supporter of Mr Sharad Pawar, the chief
minister.
Mr Kalani was arrested last year under the terrorist and disruptive
activities act in connection with a murder investigation and is now in
police custody.
Another state assembly man, a member of the Hindu militant Shiv Sena party,
was arrested under the same anti-terrorism act during the recent riots when
guns were found in his car.
Mr AS Samra, the police commissioner has said the bombers clearly wanted to
cause as much economic damage as possible. He has also said that India's
recent economic liberalisation, including steep cuts in import duties, have
squeezed the smugglers' profit margins.
So the bombers may have had an economic motive. Police decline to be drawn
on the theory that the bombers were paid and supported by an Islamic
fundamentalist group which wanted to avenge the destruction the Ayodhya
mosque.
Officers point out that Yakub and Mushtaq Memon, the brothers they believe
are the prime suspects in the bombings belong to the Memon community, a
wealthy group of Moslems hailing from western India who were hard hit in the
riots because their homes and shops were singled out for burning by Hindu
militants.
The bomb blasts wrought havoc in Bombay. But if they lead to a decline in
the tolerance granted to crime in the city, then some good may come from the
tragedy. As Mr Pawar, the chief minister, told the state assembly this
month, in a veiled reference to the ties between criminals and politicians:
'We have made mistakes in the past. Now we must correct them.'
