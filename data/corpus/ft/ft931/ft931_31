FT  08 FEB 93 / Daf demerger plans win support of Dutch ministry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DUTCH economic affairs minister Mr Koos Andriessen has expressed his support
for plans to unbundle Daf, Europe's sixth-largest truck manufacturer,
salvaging the core operations in the Netherlands and transferring UK plants
to a separate new unit.
Speaking on Dutch television on Saturday Mr Andriessen said he regarded
Daf's core operation as a viable long-term business.
A broad demerger plan, details of which were being finalised by the
company's receivers over the weekend, is 'likely to be implemented', he
added. Under the plan, the Dutch government could emerge as a dominant
shareholder in the newly-formed Dutch operation after an injection of
several hundred million guilders in new liquidity. Dutch banks, including
ABN Amro, would also join in the finance operation, with the present Daf
group being declared bankrupt perhaps as early as this week.
Mr John Talbot, the receiver of Leyland-Daf, the truck and van operations
which employ 5,500 in the UK, returned to London after reviewing the future
for the UK operations with administrators at Daf's headquarters in
Eindhoven.
So far, there are understood to be no substantive talks in progress between
the UK receiver and rival truckmakers with a possible interest in all or
part of the UK operations.
Those with a possible but undeclared interest include Daimler-Benz and MAN
of Germany, Paccar of the US - which already owns Foden in Britain  - and
Hino, the Japanese truckmaker.
Daf announced the financial collapse last Tuesday and sought protection from
its creditors in the Netherlands, Belgium and the UK after running up losses
of more than Fl 800m (Pounds 297m) over the last three years.
The new continental company, comprising core medium and heavy truck
production units now employing 5,000, would be set up in the Netherlands.
The Belgian operation in Westerlo, which produces car and truck axles for
the Eindhoven plant and employs 1,500, would be separated into a stand-alone
unit owned by Belgium's General de Banque, according to reports.
Some workers at Leyland-Daf won a pay rise in January that will raise their
pay by 10 per cent by the end of the year if the deal is not scrapped as
part of a survival package.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Leaden results in a golden age: American Express is at a
loss to explain the red ink at its Shearson Lehman brokerage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the challenges facing the new leadership of American Express, the
troubled travel and financial services group, few are as serious as the red
ink at Shearson Lehman Brothers, the group's brokerage and investment
banking subsidiary. Last month Shearson, the second biggest stockbroker in
the US, disclosed a loss of Dollars 116m (Pounds 77m) for 1992 and said its
brokerage commission income rose by a paltry 1.8 per cent during the whole
year.
By contrast, Merrill Lynch, the market leader, last year enjoyed net profits
that were 37 per cent higher at Dollars 952.4m and brokerage commission
income that rose by 12.3 per cent. PaineWebber, ranked third, reported 41
per cent better net earnings of Dollars 213.2m and brokerage commission
income that improved by 14 per cent.
Last week, as the dust began to settle on the boardroom battle at American
Express which led to the resignation of Mr James Robinson as chairman,
analysts were still puzzling over the reasons behind Shearson's losses in
1992, a year that saw some of the fattest earnings in securities industry
history.
There was also confusion about the leadership of Shearson. The question
arose because Mr Robinson had been named chairman and chief executive of
Shearson just four days before he severed all ties to the American Express
group. In winning those positions Mr Robinson had elbowed aside Mr Howard
Clark as Shearson chief, relegating him to vice-chairman. The firm is now
being run on an interim basis by Mr Richard Fuld and Mr Tom Hill, the
Lehman-side executives who were recently named co-presidents.
On Wall Street a surprising number of analysts who follow American Express
and Shearson said they did not have enough information to understand the
underlying reasons for Shearson's malaise.
Shearson has put up the barricades. Journalists and analysts are being given
few details. Mr Michael Egizio, a financial services analyst at Duff &amp;
Phelps, the credit rating agency, said that because he had been denied
access, he could not really know what was wrong with the firm. 'The company
doesn't seem to know either - that's what's so disturbing,' he said.
At first glance Shearson's fourth quarter 1992 net loss of Dollars 166m and
full-year deficit of Dollars 116m can be explained by a variety of special
charges.
These charges include a Dollars 150m after-tax write-off relating to loans
and equity held by Shearson in Computervision, a company that has had
trouble for the past two years in servicing a 1990 bridge loan that was to
have been refinanced by junk bonds. Also included is a Dollars 107m
write-down of property holdings and Dollars 59m in unspecified legal
provisions.
But in the fourth quarter of 1992 Shearson still only made Dollars 4m of
operating income before special charges. Mr John Keefe, an independent
financial service analyst at Keefe Worldwide Services, said it was odd that
'if you take away these unusual items it is still hard to find much
operating income - and this is during a golden age for the securities
industry.'
One man who should be in a position to explain the performance is Mr Harvey
Golub, who replaced Mr Robinson as American Express's chief executive and
who is now working on plans to restaff Shearson and return it to
profitability. But in his first press conference since Mr Robinson resigned,
Mr Golub and Mr Richard Furlaud, the new non-executive chairman of American
Express, spent more time defending their earlier support for Mr Robinson
than discussing future strategy.
When asked why Shearson made no money in 1992 Mr Golub spoke of the charges
as 'structural and baggage issues' and admitted that the security firm's
cost base remained too high. When asked specifically why the second biggest
brokerage house in the US had essentially flat brokerage commissions in
1992, Mr Golub replied: 'The answer is that I don't know.'
Mr Golub's aides eventually claimed the commissions had been flat because
gains in retail and institutional sales had been offset by declining
commodity commissions. They also blamed a shift in the reporting of
individual managed investor accounts from the brokerage commission to the
custodial and advisory income category. Shearson declined, however, to
provide a financial breakdown.
Mr Golub was equally reticent about the possibility of American Express
deciding to sell Shearson, saying at first he didn't know and then
correcting this to a 'no comment'. Mr Golub said only that Mr Clark would
not be reinstated as chairman and that there was 'no timetable' for
selecting a new chief executive. 'It certainly would be useful to have a CEO
at Shearson,' Mr Golub said.
In fairness, Mr Golub is neither an investment banker nor an expert in the
brokerage industry. He is something of a technician whose main task in life
has been to turn around the travel related services (TRS) division of
American Express. Mr Furlaud said that TRS would remain a prime
responsibility for Mr Golub.
Mr Golub pledged also to spend time on Shearson, which until recently seemed
to have recovered from its worst period two years ago when it suffered huge
losses and saw Mr Peter Cohen, chairman, forced out by Mr Robinson.
Some former Shearson executives blamed excessive compensation and overhead
costs for the firm's problems. Over the past two years Mr Robinson took a
personal hand in plotting Shearson strategy, apparently allowing costly and
overlapping expenses to occur when he came up with the idea of dividing
Shearson and Lehman into separate brokerage and investment banking arms of
the group. The unhappy marriage between the blue-bloods of Lehman Brothers
and the retail brokers of Shearson continues to create tension within the
firm.
The single biggest component of a brokerage firm's costs is employee
compensation - salaries and bonuses. At Shearson, compensation expenses have
grown faster than revenues. Last year, for example, the firm's compensation
expenses grew 14 per cent, while net revenues rose only 11 per cent.
These expenses, by some estimates up to Dollars 250m too high on an annual
basis, may explain part of the reason why Shearson, which analysts say
should have earned as much as Dollars 700m in full-year operating income
last year, only made Dollars 204m before charges, less than half the 1991
level.
Many on Wall Street are betting that American Express will move to cut
costs, strengthen capital and ready Shearson for an eventual sale - as part
of the group's gradual dismantling of Mr Robinson's 1980s strategy of trying
to build American Express into a 'financial supermarket'. Whatever happens,
it is clear that Shearson will remain an albatross for Messrs Furlaud and
Golub for some time to come.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Sale of Charter house expected this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL Bank of Scotland is expected to announce the long-awaited sale of
Charterhouse, its merchant banking subsidiary, to two European banks this
week.
Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank of Germany and Credit Commercial de
France will each take a 45 per cent stake in Charterhouse, with Royal Bank
of Scotland retaining the remaining 10 per cent.
The price of Pounds 235m - which is currently being mentioned - for the 90
per cent stake that Royal Bank of Scotland is selling is higher than
originally expected. The deal will be the first time a UK merchant bank has
been bought by a Franco-German banking partnership. CCF and BHF have their
own investment banking operations and want to build a pan-European merchant
banking business around Charterhouse.
Negotiations have dragged on for several months. Analysts had expected
Charterhouse to be sold for around Pounds 200m, but Royal Bank of Scotland,
which is being advised by the merchant bank S. G. Warburg, is understood to
have held out for an improved offer price.
The deal is intended to give Charterhouse access to the French and German
banks' customers in continental Europe and in the UK.
Royal Bank of Scotland wanted to concentrate on its retail business and felt
that owning a merchant bank was not 'synergistic' with its clearing bank
operations.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Investcorp profits rise 20% to Dollars 62.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTCORP, the Bahraini-financed international investment bank which
controls well-known businesses in the US and Europe, pushed up its after-tax
profit by 20.2 per cent to Dollars 62.7m (Pounds 41.5m) in 1992.
Investcorp, which was set up 10 years ago, specialises in channelling funds
held by wealthy Arabs into well established businesses, such as Gucci and
Saks Fifth Avenue. It is attempting to buy and reorganise Circle K, the
bankrupt US convenience store chain.
Mr Michael Merritt, Investcorp's chief administrative officer, said there
were two main reasons for the profit growth. Investcorp realised two of its
US investments, Catherine's Stores, a US retail chain specialising in extra
large clothing for women, and Sports &amp; Recreation, a sporting goods
retailer.
The second source of profit growth was the two corporate acquisitions it
organised during the year, on which it earned fees. On behalf of its pool of
investors and also using its own funds, a 50 per cent stake in the German
Mondi Group, a clothing manufacturer, was bought.
In early 1992, it bought Nouvelle Lemania, a manufacturer of watch
movements, and then merged this business with Breguet, the Swiss watch
company owned by Investcorp and its clients. Mr Merritt said Investcorp was
looking at possible investments in the UK.
He and Mr Elias Hallack, Investcorp's chief financial officer, are being
appointed co-chief operating officers.
A Dollars 15m cash dividend is being paid - identical to the payment for the
past few years - representing a 15 per cent return on the capital invested
by the founder shareholders in the business.

FT  06 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Tension grows over Heron restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADVISERS TO some creditors of Heron, the property and trading group
negotiating a Pounds 1.4bn debt refinancing, are complaining about Heron's
decision to stop paying fees it regards as not essential to the
restructuring.
Heron said it could not comment on individual fee arrangements, but that its
action had been taken in the interest of creditors. Fees involved so far
amount to nearly Pounds 40m.
Tension is mounting between the parties to the restructuring plan which is
due to be put to the banks by the end of this month.
'It is all coming to a head now,' one said, adding that in such cases it was
only when negotiations became fraught that progress was made.
Without a refinancing Heron would go into receivership - an outcome the
group believes would realise less for credit-ors.
The depths of Heron's problems are revealed in a letter sent to the advisers
by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, Heron's merchant bank. This, says the group, 'will
only have cash funds available to pay fees up to January 31'.
The steering committee of banks, the letter says, is considering providing
new money of Pounds 1.6m to meet in part the company's cash requirements for
February.
Heron's advisers and those of the banks have agreed to 'defer a substantial
proportion of their fees for a year' and make payment of those fees,
amounting to Pounds 1.2m, 'contingent on the restructuring being
implemented'.
The letter proposes that fees for the advisers to the bond holders 'will be
paid contingent upon, and immediately after, implementation of the
restructuring proposals'.
Some advisers say that if they recommend bond holders to accept the
restructuring plan, the holders will say their advice is biased by the
prospect of a fee.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Motoring: And now the one-box vehicle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE developing fashion for multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs) is anything to
go by, the family car of the future will be box-shaped. It would be
sensible. A car with neither bonnet nor boot takes up less road space than a
'three-box' saloon or 'two-box' hatchback or estate. And, logically, there
is no reason why the engine should be up front, where the horse used to be
before the horseless carriage came along.
More than 40 years ago, Volkswagen's Microbus - the first MPV - had the
engine tucked away at the back. Renault's Espace, the first MPV to be bought
because it was smart as well as practical, has a normal front-wheel drive
power pack, but that is inside the body and under the sharply-sloped
windscreen.
Toyota took the bold step of burying the engine of its rear-wheel driven
Previa MPV under the floor. Why not? All routine checks can be made simply
by lifting the grille. And no one tinkers with electronically-managed
engines any more, if they are wise.
The latest MPV to reach Britain is Nissan's Spanish-built Serena. At first
sight, I thought it looked like a cross between one of those Italian hearses
with chromium-plated cherubs on each corner and a dignified, 1930-ish
English limousine. When I swung up into the high seat behind the wheel, it
felt decidedly van-like. But the more I drove it, the more I liked it.
Building a vehicle as tall as this gives it an enormous amount of interior
space. Passengers sit high enough to peer over hedgerows. The driver's view
of the road is so commanding that I found the Serena ideal transport in the
crowded West End of London.
There is hardly any bonnet - the engine is mounted further back than usual -
and no rear overhang at all. Combined with very light power-assisted
steering, this makes the Serena easier to park than a conventional car of
similar size.
The top-of-the-range SGX model I used had a British-made, 126-horsepower,
16-valve, two-litre engine driving the back wheels though a pleasant,
five-speed gearbox. Fairly low overall gearing made it flexible in town,
lively when accelerating up to 60 mph (97 kmh), and good at romping up hills
in top or fourth gears, even loaded.
It takes time to reach 80 mph (128 kmh) but holds it on an autoroute without
sounding frantic. On a windy day - or when overtaking speeding container
lorries - you are aware it has higher sides than a car.
There are seven Serena variants offering four or five doors (including the
huge tailgate); six, seven or eight seats; and 1.6 or two-litre petrol
engines plus a two-litre diesel. The one I drove had six separate and
plumply comfortable seats, two normal front doors, and a single sliding door
on the near side.
Having six seats is useful, but only when the rear pair are folded away is
there a large amount of luggage space. One of the optional layouts with
seven seats (converting to five with a vast boot) would be more useful to a
family with three children and a dog who do not want to travel long
distances with all the luggage on the roof.
Prices range from Pounds 12,950 for the 1.6-litre LX to Pounds 17,750 for
the two-litre SGX which comes with ABS brakes, two power-operated sun-roofs
and air-conditioning as standard.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Dollars 50m US plan for natural gas car: Shape of vehicles
to come
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Dollars 50m development programme that could lead to the first US
production of cars powered solely by natural gas has been launched jointly
by Ford, a Californian utility and the Chicago-based Gas Research Institute.
Another Dollars 23m (Pounds 15.2m) is being spent on a similar programme for
vans and pick-up trucks.
A fleet of 50 cars, adaptations of Ford's Crown Victoria model, are to
undergo trials during a three-year evaluation programme in the US and
Canada, during which several other utilities will also monitor the vehicles'
operating costs, reliability and other data.
Provided the cars are shown to have competitive operating costs and no
reliability drawbacks, there is a potential market of many thousands of
vehicles a year from the mid-1990s, as the federal Clean Air Act and
individual state legislation clamp down on car exhaust emissions.
Natural gas is potentially one of the cleanest 'alternative' fuels and it is
claimed that initial tests of vehicles in the programme have shown emissions
within California's requirement for ultra-low-emission cars, which starts in
1998.
Under the Clean Air Act, federal and state governments are requiring fleets
of 10 or more vehicles operating in the 22 most polluted US cities to begin
phasing in very low emission cars, reaching 50 per cent of all fleet
vehicles purchased by 1999.
While there is already a sizeable market for converting cars to run on
either petrol or natural gas, both in the US and Europe, the Ford vehicles
will have engine and other components made to take full advantage of the
fuel's emissions and energy characteristics.
The Gas Research Institute and Southern California Gas are contributing

FT  06 FEB 93 / Unions likely to fight pits plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Coal's demands for sweeping changes in working practices to save
many of the 31 pits threatened with closure look set to antagonise mining
unions.
The corporation wants flexible working time, involving longer shifts and
weekend working. It favours extending the shift system used at the Asfordby
pit in Leicestershire. That involves a six-day working week incorporating
three seven and a half hour shifts, with crews working 45 hours a week for
three weeks followed by one week off.
This would end overtime working. At present shifts longer than seven and a
quarter hours underground and eight hours on the surface are voluntary. The
legal restraint was repealed last year, but has not yet become effective.
British Coal also wants a revision of the 1954 Mines and Quarries Act to
enable more effective response to technological innovation in mines without
lowering safety standards.
The corporation hopes to end the joint consultation system in the pits and
wants to be able to impose compulsory redundancies. It is also calling for
multi-skill training to allow electrical and mechanical engineers and miners
to become more versatile.
The National Union of Mineworkers is opposed to changes in work
organisation. Its delegate conference on Thursday rejected unanimously the
corporation's aims.

FT  06 FEB 93 / How To Spend It: Designer blends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER the Dualit toaster, the Philippe Starcke lemon squeezer and the Alessi
kettle - welcome to the Waring blender, latest must-have kitchen appliance
for the design-conscious foodie set.
And lest that sounds too frivolous or dismissive, let me hasten to add that
almost any half-way enthusiastic cook might like to own it, too.
The Waring Professional Blender, to give its full name, saw the light of day
in the US in 1935. Before long it became a kitchen classic. Sturdy,
long-lasting and powerful, it was just what the eager cook needed.
Cooks love it because it has a two-speed switch and a strong and powerful
commercial motor which enables it to cope with tougher foods, such as meats
and pates.
It is also generously sized, holding 40oz, and it is simple and easy to
clean - the top fits straight on to the motor base.
The design-set love it because with its heavy metal base, its thick glass
and 'Deco' styling it is redolent of the heyday of American soda-bar
culture, the golden pre-war period when the US truly seemed the land of
opportunity.
I like it best in its original chrome but it is also available in three new
colours - red, blue or green.
It costs Pounds 129 from Harrods of Knightsbridge, London SW1, Divertimenti
of 139/141 Fulham Road, London SW3 and Wigmore Street. For other stockists
contact the importers, Robot Coupe, 62 Westbourne Grove, London W2 5SH.

FT  06 FEB 93 / How To Spend It: The tastebud test is best
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TECHNICALLY safe our tap water may be; a joy to drink it is not. So welcome
to Kenwood's Ultrascreen water filter which I have been testing for the last
few months.
Slightly more complicated (and expensive) than simple counter top jugs, much
less complicated (and expensive) than full-blown plumbed-in systems, I have
the impression it makes a real difference.
Laboratory testing is not one of my strong points. I have no impressive
scientific data to offer, all I can say is that going by the simple tastebud
test I like water better when it has been through the Kenwood system than
straight from the tap. Our kettle, too, seems to like it better and needs
only the occasional minor defurring compared with the heavy decrusting that
it seemed to need before.
Kenwood, as is only right and proper, has all sorts of stalwart scientific
data to offer those of a more rigorously technical turn of mind, but to put
it at its simplest, the system is based on a filter cartridge that contains
a patented selection of ion exchange resins which Kenwood claims 'reduces a
comprehensive range of impurities such as aluminium, chlorine, copper, iron,
lead, mercury, nitrates and zinc.'
It is the only portable table-top electronic system. It remineralises the
water once it has been filtered (if you take everything out of water it
tastes rather dead, remineralisation returns trace elements). In addition
the pump system disperses water more evenly over the filter, resulting in
more efficient filtration than gravity-fed activated carbon filters.
There are a few other points prospective buyers might like to bear in mind.
Firstly, Ultrascreen, as you can see from the accompanying photograph, is
larger and more cumbersome than smaller counter-top jugs  - I still prefer
it but others who are short of space would have to take this into
consideration.
Secondly, the cost, at Pounds 59.99, is about four times that of the
simplest systems and more importantly perhaps the cost of the filters is
Pounds 6.99 a time. In our (mainly) two-person London household a filter
seems to last about two months, which works out at under a pound a week - a
price I am very happy to pay and a lot cheaper than drinking bottled water
but again it should be borne in mind.
One big advantage is that the machine delivers the filtered water faster
than most table top models. Ultrascreen is the only machine which alerts
users to when it is time to change the filter. The built-in memory points
out when the cartridges's effective life is ending.
It can be found in most good kitchen and department stores. Double packs of
replacement filters can be bought for Pounds 14.99 by mail order from OAS
Ltd., Bletchington, Oxford OX5 3AX. (Tel: 0869-50949).

FT  06 FEB 93 / Workers at warship yard go on strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKERS at the Yarrow warship yard on Clydeside have gone on indefinite
strike for the first time since 1985 after rejecting the company's pay offer
and their union officials' recommendation to accept it.
The 1,300 strikers, who are employed at the most successful of Britain's
bigger warship yards, want a substantial increase on their basic weekly
rate, now Pounds 218 for a skilled man.
The company's two-year offer would give them a Pounds 300 lump sum payment
immediately followed by a 3.8 per cent rise in July. In return, the company
wants some changes to working practices, including the abolition of a Friday
morning tea-break.
Strikes are now rare at the once militant Clyde shipyards, and in the UK as
a whole there were only 21 stoppages in November 1992, the last month for
which figures are available. The strike at Yarrow is unlikely to herald a
new wave of industrial action.
Public sector workers appear reluctant to take action against the
government's 1.5 per cent pay norm and, according to the Confederation of
British Industry, nearly one company in three is freezing pay or at least
deferring the annual pay rise.
The CBI data are contested by pay analyst Incomes Data Services, which says
that only one settlement in six is being frozen. National Westminster and
Lloyds banks have decided to award no general increase.
Yarrow, owned by Britain's General Electric Company, is in a relatively
comfortable position, with orders for five Type 23 frigates for the Royal
Navy and two for the Malaysian navy.
But the company said there was no more money to offer and that any strike
would have an adverse effect on future orders in the tight defence market.
It recently made 400 workers redundant at the yard, which employs a total of
2,300 people.
Mr Ernie Horan, convener of the unions at Yarrow, said: 'We have accepted
some unpalatable deals over the last few years, when we have been fighting
for our lives. Clearly people feel that with the orders there now there's a
bit more leeway.'
Pay rates were last increased by the rate of inflation in July 1991 as part
of a two-year deal.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Tecs accuse government of trying to impose contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAINING and Enterprise Councils yesterday accused the government of trying
to impose the terms of new contracts which demand shorter periods of
training for the long-term unemployed and the settling of more trainees in
jobs.
Tecs, the employer-led bodies which deliver government training schemes in
England and Wales, say the government is seeking to impose the terms of the
contracts rather than negotiate. They say they will be forced to 'cream off'
the people most likely to get work or qualifications.
The Department of Employment's contracts relate to a scheme called Training
for Work which is to be launched in April.
The new scheme draws together two existing schemes - Employment Training for
people who have been out of work for more than six months, and Employment
Action, a work-experience scheme that offers participants Pounds 10 a week
on top of their normal state benefits.
The contracts are intended to cut training time from 26 to 14 weeks.
Mr Rodney Skidmore, chief executive of Centec, a Tec based in Redditch,
Hereford and Worcester, said the proposed contracts would give Tecs less
scope to offer people work on community projects.
Mr Tony Lloyd, Labour's training spokesman, said: 'This further demotion of
training is a real failure because high-quality training is what this
country needs.'

FT  06 FEB 93 / Court approves restructuring of O&amp;Y Canadian operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A RESTRUCTURING plan for Olympia &amp; York Developments was approved by an
Ontario judge last night, ending nine months of court protection for the
collapsed Canadian property developer.
O&amp;Y, which was the world's biggest developer prior to seeking bankruptcy
protection for its Canadian operations last May, will emerge still nominally
owned by the Reichmann family, who built up the company over 25 years, but
controlled by its creditors.
The plan covers only O&amp;Y's Canadian operations. It does not affect Canary
Wharf, the project in London's Docklands, which has also been under the care
of administrators since last May. Canary Wharf's future is currently the
subject of negotiation between the administrators, a group of international
banks and the UK government.
Under the Canadian plan a new company will be formed. It will be known as
O&amp;Y Properties, and will concentrate on property management. O&amp;Y's Canadian
buildings, as well as its US properties and its non-property investments,
will remain under the umbrella of O&amp;Y Developments.
As part of yesterday's court order, Mr Justice Robert Blair sanctioned the
appointment of an administrator who is expected to preside over the gradual
dismantling of the company and the seizure of several of its buildings by
creditors. The restructuring involves about two thirds of O&amp;Y's total debt
of CDollars 13.5bn (Pounds 7bn).
The administrator is expected to be Mr Robert Lowe, an insolvency expert in
the Toronto office of auditors Coopers and Lybrand.
The future of O&amp;Y's US properties, comprising about 20 buildings, depends on
the outcome of talks between the company and lenders to the various
buildings.
Mr Paul Reichmann, who masterminded O&amp;Y's expansion in the 1970s and 1980s,
resigned earlier this week from the board of the US subsidiary.
Mr Justice Blair said he was satisfied that the plan was 'fair and
reasonable'. Under the restructuring proposals, most secured creditors will
be allowed to seize their collateral on 30 days notice.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Finance ministers of G7 to meet soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCE ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries are
to meet soon, probably in London or Bonn.
The meeting is likely late this month or early March, with the February
27-28 weekend a strong possibility.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the new US treasury secretary, has pressed for a meeting
before the next scheduled G7 gathering, at the end of April.
Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, is also keen for ministers to meet to
discuss ways of boosting activity in the world economy. The bleak outlook in
Japan and Europe is casting a shadow over the US upturn. The problems of
Russia would probably be on the agenda.
The meeting would allow Mr Bentsen and Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, the new Japanese
finance minister, to meet other members of the group.
The finance ministers' meeting would not be concerned with preparations for
the next economic summit of G7 leaders from the US, Japan, Germany, Britain,
France, Canada and Italy, which will be held in Tokyo from July 7 to 9.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's second attempt to find a woman for the top US legal
job suffered a setback yesterday when Judge Kimba Wood withdrew her name
from consideration for the position of Attorney General, AP reports from
Washington.
She said her baby sitter had been an illegal alien for seven years - the
same problem which torpedoed Mr Clinton's first choice, Ms Zoe Baird.
Ms Wood, 49, had been named by officials as Mr Clinton's near-certain choice
yesterday when they said she would be named unless problems developed during
an FBI background check.
During his campaign Mr Clinton promised to have a cabinet that 'looked like
America', but after naming men to the traditional top jobs of state, defence
and treasury he came under considerable pressure to name a woman to the
Justice Department.
Now that Ms Wood has withdrawn the two remaining candidates most widely
touted for the job are men: Mr Charles Ruff, a Washington lawyer, and Mr
Gerald Baliles, a former Governor of Virginia.
Judge Wood said she had done nothing illegal.
'I have fulfilled every legal requirement with respect to the employment of
our baby sitter. Nevertheless, and after further consultations, I have
concluded that in the current political environment, proceeding further with
the possibility of my nomination would be inappropriate.
'In March 1986 (when the baby sitter was hired), it was lawful to openly
employ aliens who were in the country, like my baby sitter, on an expired
visa, as long as all required taxes and forms were filed,' she said.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Traumatic week for modest Dutch: Troubles at Daf, Fokker and
KLM have hit home hard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE perpetually-modest Dutch are disinclined to seek the limelight. But,
during a traumatic week for the economy, they have been thrust into
international prominence.
Three of the Netherlands' corporate heavyweights - Daf, the truck maker,
Fokker, the aircraft company, and KLM, the national airline - have been
battered by adversity.
This well-managed, free-trading economy, running a large trade surplus and
tipped as a likely winner from the EC's single market, is now worrying about
the future.
'All in all, it was an awful week,' says Mr Be van der Weg, leader of the
FNV industrial union. 'It highlighted our international vulnerability, and
created an awareness that there is more restructuring to come.'
On Tuesday, Daf, the last remnant of Dutch ambition in the European motor
industry, announced financial collapse and sought protection from creditors
in the Netherlands, Belgium and the UK.
The following day, it was Fokker's turn. The troubled aeroplane manufacturer
confirmed reports that it is seeking a state bank loan of up to Fl 1bn
(Pounds 373m) as its liquidity position worsened.
On Thursday, KLM turned in a massive loss, was forced to cancel Fl 750m in
new aircraft orders and announced another round of rationalisation.
Despite the strength of multinational giants such as Royal Dutch Shell,
Unilever and the chemicals specialist Akzo, the country's industrial course
is now a matter of concern.
On Monday, Philips, the country's leading electronics company, shelved plans
to introduce a European-standard high-definition television (HDTV) on which
it had pinned recovery hopes.
Over the past three years, Philips has cut its workforce by about 50,000.
Amid flat demand for its electronic products, this has had little effect on
overall performance.
Dutch business culture, sometimes unwilling to anticipate change, had little
influence on the basic factors behind this week's events. Daf, Fokker, and
KLM are all suffering from changes in global industrial demand.
Nor is the country's industrial policy entirely at fault. The Dutch
government has mixed pragmatism with expediency in recent years -
privatising where possible, intervening with limited aid where practicable
and productive.
But, in a gloomy economic environment, the Netherlands is seeking ways of
combining relatively high labour costs and commitment to free markets with
measures to gain international comparative advantage.
While its expertise in agri-business, transport and the entrepot business
has stood it in good stead, these are hardly the vigorous industries of the
future. The country needs to finance education and infrastructure, as well
as to stimulate high technology, amid budgetary constraints caused by slower
growth.
One important influence has been the recession in Germany, by far the
Netherlands' most important trading partner. The Netherlands' latitude in
monetary affairs, as a senior Dutch central bank official acknowledges, is
'severely restricted'.
This year industrial investment is expected to fall 4 per cent, according to
the CBS statistics bureau. This contrasts sharply with industry's own
forecast of 5 per cent growth, released as late as last summer.
The EC's latest economic forecasts see Dutch GDP expanding by only 0.6 per
cent in 1993. This is still ahead of Germany, but well below accustomed
rates of around 2 per cent in recent years.
At present, one in seven of Dutch workers are employed by a loss-making
company. In 1993, the percentage will grow to one in four, predicts the VNO
industry federation.
'These are alarming figures,' says Mr Evert Elbertse, a VNO economist. 'Our
ideal European landscape has always been one of laissez faire. But when we
look around, this is not what we see.'
Pressures for more interventionist government policies are on the rise.
On the high street, too, the atmosphere has changed. Fluorescent 'Special
Clearance' signs shine from shop windows, as the traditional January sales
drift into the second week of February.
While several industrial sectors, including base chemicals and metals, face
further difficulties, some of the gloom is exaggerated. There is a chance,
for example, that parts of Daf will emerge from the salvage operation in a
sufficiently attractive form to woo a foreign buyer. But it seems likely the
Dutch will not have to wait much longer for more examples of a transition
into a less secure industrial future.

<TEXT>
RIDING high on the first Croat military victory over the Serbs in a disputed
enclave, President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia is poised to tighten his lock
on power in tomorrow's district elections.
Clashes between Serb and Croat forces in Krajina, the self-styled Serb
state, yesterday appeared to ease after an upsurge of violence on Thursday.
Mr Tudjman and his Croatian Democratic Union look set to reap the rewards of
the 14-day offensive when some 3m voters cast ballots for the upper house of
the Croatian parliament.
The Croat push across UN lines into the Serbian enclave helped Mr Tudjman to
silence any criticism from the opposition that he has been soft on Serb
rebels who in 1991 proclaimed their own state within Croatia. It also served
to jeopardise the year-long UN peace plan which ended the eight-month
Serbo-Croat war that killed some 20,000 people.
The upper house has only limited power to override the house of
representatives.
Meanwhile in the Adriatic, western warships policing a trade embargo on
Yugoslavia - now comprising Serbia and Montenegro - yesterday intercepted a
Croatian vessel which said it was loaded with explosives. A UN arms embargo,
imposed nearly two years ago on the former Yugoslavia - including Croatia -
has been widely violated.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: BES still grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Business Expansion Scheme continues to expand in spite of its planned
abolition at the year's end.
No schemes with a non-recourse loan facility, which allows exit after six
months, are available. And many intermediaries are having difficulty
investing in these schemes before they are fully subscribed - funds are
allocated on a first-come first-served basis, so many cheques sent to
sponsors are being returned. There is also a risk that novice investors
could be rushed into an inferior deal.
The easiest way around this is to use one of the larger intermediaries.
Biggest in the field are Allenbridge Group and BESt Investment, both based
in London.
The three schemes launched this week are ingenious. All invest in
residential property:
Peppa is a unique investment which combines a personal equity plan with a
BES. It involves a listing on the Luxembourg stock exchange.
The underlying investment is split into two. Eighty per cent goes into a
Luxembourg-listed BES company which will purchase a portfolio of residential
rental properties from Wimpey homes, the housebuilding group. Wimpey has
undertaken to make up any shortfall, compared with the purchase price, after
five years. There is no set limit on the profit potential for the BES
companies. However, there is no independent bank guarantee.
The BES element attracts tax relief for the investor in the standard way so
that a Pounds 1,000 investment will cost only Pounds 750 for a basic rate
taxpayer and Pounds 600 for a top rate payer.
The remaining 20 per cent of the portfolio will go into a Pep managed by
Abtrust which will invest in a portfolio of blue chip shares and gilts.
Investors can use their full Pounds 9,000 annual Pep allowance, if they
wish, since the plan qualifies for both single company and general Pep
status.
At the end of the five years, the Luxembourg listing will provide investors
with a ready made exit route from the BES; the BES shares can also be
transferred into the Pep.
Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000 and maximum is Pounds 45,000.
Cavendish Gleeson Guaranteed, sponsored by Smith &amp; Williamson, has a
buy-back guarantee after five years from the MJ Gleeson Group, which has
been underwritten by Lloyds Bank. After five years it will pay 115p for ever
Pounds 1 share bought now. There is no early exit option, and total capacity
is only Pounds 5m.
Cavendish Growth, also sponsored by Smith &amp; Williamson, will buy properties
from the Household Mortgage Corporation. HMC has covenanted to buy back the
properties at the end of the five-year BES qualification period at Pounds
1.18 for every Pounds 1 share. Total capacity is Pounds 15m. Minimum
investment in both schemes is Pounds 1,000.

The Halifax and Nationwide indices yet again gave conflicting information
about the direction of UK house prices last month. Halifax, the country's
biggest mortgage lender, reported that house prices had fallen by 0.4 per
cent in January, while Nationwide, the second-largest building society,
reported that prices had risen by 1.2 per cent last month, the biggest
monthly rise since May 1991. However, both societies agreed that there had
been an increase in the number of potential purchasers requesting mortgages
and inquiring about properties for sale.
Lending activity in the last quarter of 1992 was very depressed according to
the Council of Mortgage Lenders. Net advances totalled Pounds 2.6bn, down
from Pounds 5.5bn the previous quarter. The CML attributed the weak figures
to lack of confidence on the part of potential housebuyers after sterling's
exit from the exchange rate mechanism in September.

FT  06 FEB 93 / International Company News: Campbell finds the boardroom
locked - The US group has 58% of Arnotts but no control of its board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four months after launching a bitterly contested takeover offer, Campbell
Soup, the US food group, finds itself the owner of 58 per cent of Arnotts,
the Australian biscuit company. One question remains: what happens now?
Campbell's ADollars 8.80 a share bid was intended to deliver control of
Arnotts by increasing its shareholding from 32.9 per cent to at least 50.1
per cent.
In the event, the US group comfortably exceeded the target, after increasing
the offer to ADollars 9.50 and extending it for a week.
Campbell increased its holding by just over four percentage points on the
final day as a number of financial institutions and small shareholders
responded to the AMP Society's decision to accept the offer.
AMP, Australia's largest financial institution, sold a 6.3 per cent stake in
Arnotts to Campbell on Thursday, propelling the US group past its target
holding of 50.1 per cent.
On a superficial level, the outcome is a triumph for Mr David Johnson,
Campbell's Australian-born chief executive, who resisted institutional
pressure for a higher price, correctly gambling that sufficient
institutional investors would eventually accept ADollars 9.50.
It became clear that Mr Johnson's judgment had paid off when the AMP
Society, Australia's biggest financial institution, sold a 6.3 per cent
shareholding.
However, Campbell's relationship to Arnotts underwent an unexpected
transformation during the campaign after Schroders Australia, the biscuit
group's adviser, spotted a surprise legal defence.
The defence related to an agreement drawn up between Arnotts and Campbell in
1985, when the US group took a friendly shareholding as part of Arnotts'
defence against an unwelcome bid from Bond Corporation Holdings.
The New South Wales courts initially ruled that the agreement was
meaningless. However, the appeal court subsequently judged that it prevented
Campbell from using its shareholding to elect directors, unless it acquires
at least 85.1 per cent of the shares.
The effect was to prevent Campbell taking control of Arnotts' board, even
though it owns more than half of the company.
Campbell will not even be able to influence the appointment of replacements
for directors who retire.
Mr Bill Purdy, chairman of Arnotts, says Campbell's shareholding gives it no
moral rights on the board, and rules out a voluntary agreement to scrap the
voting restrictions.
The only way Campbell can overcome the terms of the agreement, he says, is
to make a second offer which would be recommended by the board - probably
ADollars 11 a share.
This is precisely the course which Campbell resisted during the takeover
battle, but it is one which analysts say may be forced on the group if it is
serious about winning control.
Alternatively, Campbell could seek permission from the federal government
and the Australian Securities Commission to utilise the creeping takeover
provisions of the corporations law, which would allow it to acquire 3 per
cent of the stock every six months at the market price.
However, even if regulatory permission was granted, Campbell would find it
difficult to achieve the 85.1 per cent target shareholding because more than
20 per cent of the stock is in the hands of family shareholders, many of
whom have said they will not sell under any circumstances.
As a result, Campbell has spent about ADollars 330m (USDollars 223m) to
acquire a majority shareholding in a company it cannot control. Analysts say
its lack of influence may even prevent the consolidation of Arnotts'
earnings under US accounting law.
Mr Johnson, putting a brave face on the outcome, says Campbell is now the
dominant shareholder in Arnotts. He says Campbell 'intends to see that
Arnotts invests considerably more than in the past, creating opportunities
for Australia, and positioning Arnotts to compete in Asia against larger and
more established companies'.
Mr Purdy says Arnotts remains prepared to co-operate with Campbell,
especially in the increasingly sophisticated Asian market. However, it is
not clear whether the two companies will be able to agree on how to go about
it.
Campbell, which manufactures the up-market Pepperidge Farm brand in the US,
wants to use the more comprehensive Arnotts range as a pan-Asian regional
brand, to be handled by the US group's extensive marketing and distribution
organisation.
Arnotts, which most analysts think has been slow to identify Asian
opportunities, is more interested in negotiating joint venture agreements
with Asian manufacturers, which it believes are more capable of exploiting
local markets.
The Australian group's strategic planning has been given a significant
stimulus by the takeover offer, and it is likely to resist Campbell's
attempts to entice it into a closer alliance.
Meanwhile, one of the most important lessons to emerge from the takeover
battle is the success of Arnotts' appeal to economic nationalism, which
formed an important part of Schroders' defence strategy.
So effective was the nationalist campaign that the AMP's decision to sell
part of its holding, taken on strictly commercial grounds, provoked a
significant degree of public outrage.
Talkback radio stations reported that more than 95 per cent of callers
criticised the AMP. One family shareholder said the society was either
desperate or naive.

FT  06 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Receiver at Crown's French arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RFM, the French radio network that triggered the collapse of Crown
Communications, has itself gone into receivership.
However, the network, which has a total of 114 stations and goes under the
slogan 'Tous les tops, toute la Pop sans les flops (all the tops, all the
hits and none of the flops) is still on the air.
The intention is to run it as a going concern while the merits of three
different rescue plans are considered. The salaries of staff will be paid
out of advertising revenue.
The collapse of Crown followed the decision of the CSA, the French
broadcasting authority, to block the sale of the network to a consor-tium
that included NRJ, a rival French radio network, and Mr Alain Ayache, a
contro-versial right-of-centre magazine pub-lisher.
The NRJ consortium is one of those now trying to buy the network from the
receiver.
TF1, the French first television channel, has also made a proposal to save
the radio network. The third rescue plan is for a management buy-out of RFM.
CSA approval will be needed for any change of ownership at the radio
network.
Crown had debts of Pounds 16m when it went into receivership, most of them
because of the French operation.
Crown's main business, LBC, the London talk-based commercial radio station,
did not go into receivership and is now under the effective control of
Chelverton Investments, a company set up by Mr John Porter, son of Dame
Shirley Porter, and his partner Mr Matthew Cartisser.

That is Gauguin, as seen through the eyes of Professor Griselda Pollock, a

To be sure, she does not put it quite so baldly. Here is a specimen comment

the Western bourgeoisie in the face of capitalism's modernity.'
Well, I suppose she is right. I felt a bit like that myself when I visited
Tahiti and was asked by the beautiful leading canoeist of Brando's Mutiny on
the Bounty if I would like to marry her daughter. But does it matter to Art
if Gauguin behaved like a pig with women?
I complained to Prof Pollock: You never say whether you think Gauguin was a
good painter or not.
'I don't think it's particularly relevant,' she answered. 'You see, assuming
that the only justification for studying anything in the past is because we
think it is good raises the question: Good for whom? Who said so? By what
criteria? I much prefer to say: historically these people were active.'
Griselda Pollock is Professor of Social and Critical Histories of Art at the
University of Leeds in Yorkshire. She is a leading British feminist with a
Marxist perspective who represents what is called the new art history. She
has the reputation of being very tough and ambitious.
After reading her new book and her earlier Old Mistresses written with
fellow-feminist Rozsika Parker - the title is the only joke in it - I did
not expect to find a prettily-smiling feminine person with fluffy blonde
hair (OK, it was dark at the roots) nor to hear her admit: 'People often say
they expected something different from this sort of floozy blonde.'
But I soon saw the tough side. The moment we sat down she switched on a
tape-recorder.
Prof Pollock started by explaining her version of the new art history. She
told me it was not only about 'the repressed question of gender'. It was not
even about restoring to women painters (there are few in history, but not as
few as you think) the place denied them by men.
Its domain included race and class, exploitation and profit, the way
curators 'choreograph' painters' work and art experts manipulate their
saleroom value. The idea that works of art are purely aesthetic objects is a
20th-century fetish, she said.
Nor was she engaged in psycho-biography. 'I am not trying to peek in, to get
behind the mask and tell you the inner man. I'm trying to work from the
pictures to construct the conditions of those pictures' production, what
motivated them, how they were first perceived.'
Do you actually look at paintings?
'Social historians pay infinitely more attention to art than the traditional
art historians,' she replied firmly.
Prof Pollock is convincing but long-winded. It was difficult to interrupt
her. When I asked her whether she actually liked painting, or preferred one
painter to another, she finally relented.
'Yes. Ten years ago I would have said art is the product of the social and
ideological conditions of its time, which is a strategy for distancing
yourself from the overwhelmingly celebratory, mystical view.
'Now I feel much more able to relax a bit and say I think it's wonderful. I
mean, I think art is so brilliant. I admire the whole process. I wouldn't
dedictate my life to studying it, I wouldn't be so hungry to understand it,
if I was not quite literally made speechless with admiration at what artists
can do.'
Do you get the same feeling when you see an exhibition of dirty
nappy-liners? (I was referring to Mary Kelly's Post-Partum Document shown at
the ICA in 1976).
She replied: 'It wasn't an exhibition of nappy liners. That's a Daily Mail
view. It's in the ordering, not the objects. Mary Kelly's work is deeply
imprinted with the aesthetic preferences of minimalism.' Just as the message
of a Rubens painting of Christ depended on the spectator's knowledge,
conceptual art was legible to those who bothered to learn the language.
Why are you a feminist art historian, not just a female one?
'There are no such things as female art historians. If you are a woman you
are required to be a professional transvestite. To be a feminist art
historian is to say the world might be slightly different from the point of
view of women. Women travel in social space differently. I can't walk down
the street in the same way as you do.'
I asked her about The Nude. Is it wrong for men to have used women's bodies
for so many hundreds of years?
'Not wrong in the moral sense. It is typical of our culture in so far as it
privileges masculinity.'
You quote with approval a theory that men's idealisation of naked women is
due to their fear of losing their willies. Might it not just be because they
like the look of a naked woman lying on a bed?
'If you liked the look of a naked woman lying on a bed you wouldn't make
nudes. If you actually liked women, as Stanley Spencer seems to have done,
you would look at the form in which their bodies actually come. The point is
that looking at women is extremely difficult for men because the body of
woman has become for men a sign of the danger to themselves.
'I don't say you can't have your fantasies. But at whose cost? That's what
most women feel. We are not in this culture, we are the objects of it.'
Griselda Pollock is not struggling against her own biology. She is married,
to a Reader in computer science at the same university and they have two
children.
'He wanted children as much as I do,' she said. 'I have to struggle with him
to get back enough of my children to satisfy my maternal needs.'
She was born in South Africa, lived in Toronto and Quebec and came to
England in her teens. Her father worked for big tobacco companies and her
mother died young. She went to Oxford University: 'I was horrified to
discover that men found it tiresome and unattractive that I was
intelligent.'
Weren't you pretty too?
'I was a sad, earnest young woman who wanted to get an education, and
passionately wanted to be allowed to be a thoughtful and sensible person.
'I saw these louts who'd got degrees by playing rugby and so on while we
were being told (by the careers office) to go and be these men's
secretaries. I thought that was unbelievably unjust.'
At the Courtauld Institute she was asked to give up her scholarship in
favour of a man, realised the women students were not being groomed to run
the National Gallery one day and replied by setting up a women's art history
collective.
The professor may be prettier than her prose, but she can be just as
prickly. We were discussing whether pictures should be studied by gender (a
word that in feminist vocabulary seems to imply a choice) when she dropped
in the fact that she was Jewish. When I asked her later whether she was born
Jewish or was converted on her marriage, she refused to answer. (It may be
because she rejects the notion that anyone can be born Jewish.)
Twice subsequently she accused me of offensive, anti-Semitic language: in
using the word 'disciple' to describe her readers and the word 'jargon' to
describe her prose style. Jargon, she said, was a German word for Yiddish.
(I could find no support for this in the dictionary).
She was much angrier when I accused her of writing in a way that obscured an
interesting story and using terminology that would appeal only to feminists.
An altercation ensued and she said: 'I write with incredible passion and
with a sense this is relevant, not academic. It may be hard, it may be
challenging, it may be unfamiliar vocabulary. But I will not give an inch to
what I see as philistine, anti-intellectual British middle-class
complacency.'
I hoisted the white flag and conceded it might be the message not the words
I found difficult; she, in turn, conceded that her tone was often
'relentless'.
We returned to the safer subject of sex. Prof Pollock became engaging and
said it was a wonder to her that girls managed to grow up heterosexual after
their early attachment to the mother. It was the excuse I needed.
Did you find it difficult to love men?
She was not flustered. 'I get on extremely well with most men. I am happily
married and I have friends of all sexes and sexual orientations.'
You've never been a lesbian?
'No, no,' she said, but musingly. She recalled a stage of her activism which
she described as a kind of political lesbianism. 'I have very many dear,
dear friends who are lesbians. But no. On the other hand, it's very
difficult because I don't think men in general find powerful, intelligent
women particularly attractive.
'I sometimes wish men were more understanding of their own anxieties so that
they could take responsibility for them and engage more easily with women
who are attractive as people.
'To be an attractive woman in a situation like I am means that men just get
horribly confused all the time. Because I'm meant to be the receiver of
their intellect and then I'm meant to give the gift of my sexual compliance.
That's the game. When I promise to be 'a good wife in Israel' (the phrase
from the marriage service) I take that very seriously. I am not available
for gameplaying.
'I am deeply concerned with violence and violation, and art is concerned as
much with that as it is with what is subtle, empowering, creative. We need
to have both versions of it.'
The wrestling over, Professor Pollock was flushed but smiling sweetly once
more. Conscious now of my masculine deficiencies I tried my best to look
neutral. Forget the tender trap, I thought. This is the gender trap.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Game, set, match
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR TWO hours on Thursday I banged balls with my tennis coach, Jasper
Strong. I haven't mentioned my tennis coach before. The reason I haven't
mentioned him is that I resent the hand he was dealt by the gods and
goddesses that presided at his birth.
Jasper Strong is 6ft 5in to my 6ft 2in. He has long blond hair and the
physique of a discus-hero-at-Olympia. He is 23 years of age and has never
been told, as Joan Didion once put it, that golden lads and girls all must
as chimney sweepers come to dust. Result: he lives in a fantasy world where
everything - especially the future - looks 'brilliant.'
On Thursday we worked on my backhand volley. Eventually (we have a machine
that measures this), Jasper was hitting forehand drives at 273mph at my left
eyeball. At those sorts of speeds, one slip and you're dead; the ball would
splatter your brain.
Afterwards, we sat on the clubhouse steps and Jasper ribbed me about John
Major's recent upbeat speech at a Tory fund-raising dinner. According to the
prime minister, the British have a genius for running themselves down. 'It's
time to start selling Britain abroad,' he said, 'and stop selling Britain
short.' There were sound reasons for optimism about Britain's prospects.
'I suppose,' said Jasper pleasantly, 'that John Major was taking a swing at
all you whingeing Wilhelminas in the media. You're doomsters and pessimists.
You trade in misfortunes. Major must be sick of you. Life is really quite
enjoyable, you know.'
'Jasper,' I said. 'It wasn't until I read John Major's catatonically chirpy
speech that I realised how far down the slippery slope we really are. We are
gonners, Jasper. The show is over. Game, set and match. Or virtually.'
'That's not what catatonic means.'
'Never mind. Until that speech I had the whimsical notion that we might just
pull through. Now I'm certain we are doomed. The trouble with mankind is its
optimism. At present, a few John Bull characters are telling us there is
nothing to fear but fear itself; that the recession is a hiccup; that Man's
ascent from the primeval soup to mastery of the galaxy will shortly
recommence. Do not believe a word of it.'
Jasper stirred uneasily. He is not used to hearing things spelt out. Apart
from me, all his clients are rich women who live in the vicinity of London's
Kensington Church Street: fantasyland, daisyworld.
'The biggest problem of all,' I said, 'is unchecked population growth, but
no politicians are grappling with it. John Major doesn't know whether
sterling should go up or down, so how can he envisage the prospects implicit
in runaway population growth? The UN reckons that world population will
plateau, by 2100, at around 11.5bn, more than twice 1990's 5.3bn.
'But an environmental crisis caused by pollution and consumption is already
strangling us. Deforestation. Land degradation. Red tides. The ozone hole.
Possible global warming. Mass extinction of species and attrition of
biological diversity. Ahead of us lie what Paul Harrison, a population
expert, calls 'four decades of the fastest growth in human numbers in all
history.'
'You should read Harrison's book, The Third Revolution. He says that the
population battlefield has been stamped into a morass. On one side are the
Cassandras, the more extreme of whom blame overpopulation for almost every
ill that human flesh is heir to.
'Attacking the Cassandras from the left are the socialists. For them,
inequality in all its forms is the disease, and population growth only a
symptom. On the right, conservatives see interference in free markets as the
only obstacle to everlasting prosperity. They welcome population growth and
can see no reason why it should not continue until we have colonised the
entire galaxy.
'I, Jasper, am a Cassandra. Unless the Cassandras are heeded, it is all over
bar the shooting.'
'What is your solution?'
I said: 'I think I have run out of words. I'll tell you next week.'
Just then, Jasper's mobile phone rang. It was Priscilla Humpington-Kooning,
one of his Kensington clients, asking him to visit her. Her day had been
brilliant. Wasn't life just wonderful. She had been to Harvey Nicks. Had
only spent Pounds 12,000. Said the place was deserted.

FT  06 FEB 93 / A-Z of chess begins with K: 10 things you probably did not
know about Short's sport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT SEEMS that the British are finally to be educated about chess.
On Monday The Sun newspaper, in its own inimitable style, published 'Ten
things you didn't know about Nigel Short'. This sort of accolade The Sun
normally reserves for pop stars and soap actors, but Short is about to
become as much a household name as any in those categories. Following his
victory a week ago in the final eliminator of the three-year-long world
chess championship, Nigel will in September become the first Briton to
contest a match for the title, and only the third non-Russian since 1927.
Short is set to do for chess what John Curry and Robin Cousins did for
ice-skating: turn it into a British craze, particularly among the young. The
Sun is right, therefore: the time has come to explain the game of kings in a
way which is comprehensible to all.
To win at top-flight modern grandmaster chess it is normally required to
have a surname beginning with K. Kasparov is the world champion. He
succeeded Karpov, who himself fought off two challenges from Korchnoi. The
two strongest teenage players in the world, who will be fighting out the
world chess championship well into the next century, are called Kamsky and
Kramnik. Vladimir Kramnik is 17 and already has a higher chess world ranking
than Short who, at 27, is sometimes called 'the grand old man of British
chess.'
When, last week, I told Short that his name began with the wrong letter, he
replied that he had looked into this, and that three of the 13 official
world champions since 1886 began with S - Wilhelm Steinitz, Vassily Smyslov
and Boris Spassky - and that this made the letter S the most successful and
desirable chess initial. But Nigel admitted he is hedging his alphabetical
bets: his guru and coach is grandmaster Kavalek.
Those who followed Short's recent victory will note that his opponent, Jan
Timman, was from the Netherlands. The only European to have won the world
championship in the past 60 years was another Dutchman, the late Max Euwe.
Theories have been advanced that the flat terrain of the Netherlands is
responsible for the national success at chess. Pieces never slide off the
board, which aids concentration and analysis.
The British chess master and industrial psychologist William Hartston has
attempted to apply similar arguments to chess ability. Players with
close-set eyes are likely to miss moves at the outer areas of the board,
while players with wide apart eyes are vulnerable to thrusts in the middle
of the board, players with long arms like to make extended, sweeping moves,
and so on. There is no proof of any of this, but it might also all be true.
I am often asked: 'Is there hooliganism in chess?'. The answer, I am afraid,
is yes. The Romanian grandmaster Florin Gheorgiou is in the habit of hurling
the pieces at the board with such ferocity that they have been known to
bounce up and strike opponents on the head.
Even the world champion, Gary Kasparov, is prone to sneering openly at his
opponents' bad moves. Once he did this to the US champion Yasser Seirawan,
and Seirawan snarled over the board: 'Do that again, buster, and I'll tear
your lungs out.' This is known as the Seirawan counter-gambit. It is
important, when essaying the Seirawan counter-gambit, that you are bigger
than your opponent.
Another question often asked by non-initiates is whether grandmasters can
take their moves back? Technically, the answer is no. It is possible to
adjust a piece's position within the square if it is off-centre, but
etiquette demands that this is preceeded by the utterance 'J'adoube'. Milan
Matulovic, a Yugoslav grandmaster, was notoriously prone to playing a
blunder, and then retracting the move, while muttering 'J'adoube' in a thick
Serb accent. He was known, naturally, as grandmaster Jadoubavitch.
The main problem for the British media, now that chess is about to become
big news, is that players' names tend to be difficult to spell, and even
more difficult to pronounce. Having heard news-readers' tongues stumble over
such simplicities as Korchnoi, Karpov and Kasparov, I fear for the worst
when Kasparov plays against Short: the name of Kasparov's chief aide is
Zurab Azmaiparashvili. It is a disaster waiting to happen. Dominic Lawson is
editor of The Spectator.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Arts: Classic FM finds a niche - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I STARTED my week with Good Morning, Sunday on Radio 2, to hear Lord Soper
on his 90th birthday. He sounded much as he did when I used to hear him in
Hyde Park in his fifties. The questions there had changed, he said - sex
more often than politics, working-class ideas moving up into the middle
class. His choice of records veered from a Greek Orthodox chorus to 'Love
divine, all loves excelling', by way of Fats Waller. Bless him.
The first quarterly summary issued by Radio Joint Audience Research contains
some healthy news for Classic FM that is rather depressing for Radio 3.
Classic FM is credited with 2.8 per cent of total listening time; the figure
for Radio 3 is 1.3 per cent (the same, incidentally, as Radio 5).
Four-and-a-quarter million adult listeners (over 15 for this calculation)
hear Classic FM for at least five minutes in an average week; only 2 1/2 m
follow Radio 3.
I said when Classic FM first began that it was a more likely rival to Radio
1 than Radio 3. Though the figures suggest otherwise, I suspect that it is
not such a rival to Radio 3 at all. Hearing a concert or an opera on Radio 3
is like spending an evening at the Albert Hall or Covent Garden, planned in
advance at the sacrifice of other things. Classic FM provides pleasant
sounds for one's occasional leisure. The early accusation that it never gave
more than single movements of long works is certainly false; the first
complete work I heard on Classic FM was a Bruckner symphony, and they don't
come much longer than that.
Radio 3's rather lighter presentation under its new Controller would be a
misjudgment if meant to answer the prospect of Classic FM. A usual slap at
Classic FM has been its careless announcing, and the lounge-bar sounds
beginning to replace Reithian perfection on Radio 3 are no disguise of any
implicit superiority. However, Classic FM would never have broadcast The Man
with Night Sweats, on Radio 3 last Monday to Thursday. This was a series of
readings by Thom Gunn of his poems lamenting the deaths of friends dead from
AIDS. He feels the loss of his companions but, rather than blaming for a
moment the behaviour that led to their sickness, seems rather to admire
their courage in staying with a pattern they know to be dangerous. 'I love
their daring,' he says of two young men in a San Francisco bar tempting him
with a needle. I found the poems, written mostly in iambic pentameters,
unexpectedly moving.
I hardly found Radio 3's weekly play moving at all. Peter Tegel's Return to
Krnov told of Anton, an exile from Czechoslovakia who, after most of a
lifetime in Britain, returns to visit his unknown family and see his
father's grave. There was little in the way of plot; Anton (Hugh Dickson)
might as well have been on a weekend visit for all he told us about
Czechoslovakia in the 1980s. Richard Wortley was the director.
On the other hand, Radio 4's Monday play, Gary Mitchell's oddly-titled A
Tearful of Dreams, was extremely effective. Like so many stories from
Northern Ireland, it concerned violence, murder, rape, lying, threats and
politics, but it made no overt political point. Tracy (Eileen McCloskie)
works in a bar; her brother Geordie (Tim Loane) is a policeman and her
mother Evelyn (Marie Jones) the ex-girlfriend of the leader of a UVF outfit.
The playing under Pam Brighton's direction was constantly exciting.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Arts: Drama over Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT GLASGOW'S Tramway Theatre, the Wrestling School, a company dedicated to
Howard Barker's work, has this week been giving the world premiere
performances of his The Europeans. The play is in every way a paradox, and
means to be. It is a tragicomedy; a history play with blatant anachronisms;
brutal and intellectual; vulgar and formal. It is often poetic, bad,
provocative, obscure, humane, frustrating, exciting.
And it is about paradox - in particular, the paradox of modern Europe. It is
set in 1683. The Poles have just lifted the Turkish siege of Vienna.
Starhemberg, the victorious general, is modest, inquiring, compassionate -
and curious about the plight of those who have suffered worst. Katrin, a
pregnant and mutilated victim of a Turkish gang-rape, is a glutton for
martyrdom; she gives birth in a city square. He and she fall in love.
They are located amid a panoply of striking characters - the Emperor Leopold
and his Empress; the painter who is to immortalise both ruler and
war-victims; Starhemberg's old mother; beggars; soldiers; and a priest, who
not only takes Katrin's sister as his mistress (without any consummation)
but also becomes hero and confessor to Starhemberg. What all of this
achieves is a fascinatingly ironic picture of Europe: Europe for ever
fragmented (rather than saved), and culturally, sexually and theologically
perplexed. Love and hate; lust and abstinence; belief and heresy; misogyny
and lechery . . the oxymora are piled up before us.
The play, however, consists of more paradoxes than it needs. Why the
quasi-erotic scene in which Starhemberg obliges another officer to fabricate
a story about his childhood? At one point, apropos of nothing (Katrin had
been talking of 'the criminality of motherhood'), the painter says 'on a
clear day, you can see to Transylvania.' Yes, well.
The Europeans is exasperating, but exciting too. Its view of history reminds
you of Shakespeare, Tolstoy, and Brecht. And it lives infinitely better in
live performance than on the printed page. The nine Wrestling School
performers do marvels with animating Barker's language, so difficult because
of its switches between four-letter words and poetic formality ('Her pain
she needs, her suffering she requires'). Two small flaws: Bill Stewart
(Leopold) pronounces 'laugh' like 'love', and Benny Young (the painter)
mispronounces 'Giovanni'.
But all nine create a world on stage - thanks to skilful direction by Kenny
Ireland: a good omen for his regime at Edinburgh's Lyceum. Nicholas Le
Prevost and Judith Scott perform Starhemberg and Katrin with the authority
and integrity of true artists. Congratulations to the Tramway, that bold and
admirable venue, for presenting this premiere.
'The Europeans' now tours to the Leicester Haymarket and Greenwich Theatres

FT  06 FEB 93 / Arts: 'Flute' minus magic - The new Scarfe/Hall production
in LA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIMOTHY PFAFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEATHERS AND all, Papageno is the most normal-looking and theatrically
credible character in Peter Hall's new production of The Magic Flute at the
Los Angeles Music Center Opera. Despite the director's traditional,
straightforward and often fine-grained staging of the opera, Gerald Scarfe's
designs anchor the production in the world of the cartoon. In contrast to
what one can divine of Hall's, Scarfe's is scarcely an allegorical Flute, no
less but no more a parable of the human psyche than an episode of The
Simpsons.
The production seems to have been gauged more to a cliched perception of its
Los Angeles public than to Hall's more earnestly expository sensibility.
What magic there is is of the Disneyland and Hollywood variety. After a
first-scene snake of Ring-Wurm proportions and neo-Baroque decoration, the
ensuing menagerie - animal and human - is an amalgam of surreal animation,
classic-film imagery and robotic, Star Wars futurism.
On their own terms, Scarfe's modishly colourful designs are striking,
visually integrated , consistently amusing and intermittently engaging. But
Hall's story-telling literally comes up against them. When they do not dwarf
the human characters, they pose daunting physical hurdles.
It is all so much fun that the first indication of anything serious about
Mozart's last opera is in the Act 1 finale, when the Priest confronts Tamino
on the latter's first approach to the temples. The trials by water and fire
seem perfunctory, and there is something Peter Pan-ish about the culminating
transformation and would-be enlightenment.
When he is not steering his characters through the sets and around the
props, Hall achieves some telling strokes with his talented singing actors.
Tamino's silence before his uncomprehending Pamina - and the silence he
later attempts to enforce from a differently uncomprehending Papageno - are
affecting. And the priests' barring Pamina from the temple strikes an
original (if somewhat jarringly modern) note.
But the production imposes coarseness on moments once senses Hall might
otherwise have staged with more finesse. The first view of Monostatos,
costumed as a bloated purple frog with a chartreuse, lizard-like head,
menacing Pamina who is sporting a white Valkyrie brassiere and an outsized
blond wig, has visual overtones of King Kong and Fay Wray that lame both
characters.
The cast, all in white face, is vocally strong. In what is in effect
Papageno's show, Rodney Gilfrey responds with a beautifully voiced, finely
inflected yet welcomely unexaggerated bird catcher. Despite a cone-headed
red wig, Kurt Streit emerges an ardent, poetic Tamino. Ann Panagulias, in
clear, shining voice, is a Pamina of uncommon passion (undercut slightly by
a jaunty tempo in 'Ach, Ich fuhl's'). Harry Peters' sympathetic Sarastro,
Sumi Jo's accurate, oddly touching Queen of the Night, and Dale Franzen's
pert Papagena are rewarding. The chorus is stirring in 'O Isis, und Osiris.'
The Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra plays splendidly for Randall Behr. After a
somewhat distended overture, the conductor settles for accompaniment over
interpretation. Hall's production, his first Flute in 27 years, never quite
decides whether it is serious - every word of the German dialogue is
included - or popular entertainment. Scarfe's designs determines it: full of
effects, but little magic.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Arts: Bewitching sisters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the Royal National's Cottesloe Theatre is a literally bewitching play for
children. The Day After Tomorrow by the Dutchman Roel Adam, translated by
Noel Clark, is billed as being directed at four to seven-year olds, but I
think that the RNT could realistically cast its net much wider at the upper
end.
The most striking feature is the set: a huge arm chair, designed by Kate
Burnett, which also serves as a cottage and part of a forest. The chair is
so big that two sisters sleep on top of the arms; the underpart of the arms
serves as tunnels. The sisters are living there because one day some
soldiers burn their parents' cottage to the ground, but beyond that there is
nothing sinister, certainly nothing frightening.
The girls quarrel as sisters do. Alice, the elder, tends to bossiness:
Jenny, the younger, can seem stubborn, largely because she resents her
sister's seniority. What they really want is a baby brother, which is
eventually is what they get. Their pursuit involves a trip through the
forest, a sisterly dispute over who wants white or brown bread sandwiches, a
separation, and a meeting with a witch and a fairy.
The brother is already there but does not want to be born because that would
mean leaving the land of music. An elf-like figure he constantly plays the
violin; the sisters tempt him into life by taking to the strings themselves
and all ends happily.
There are no hidden depths or secret meanings, but the acting by Vikki
Pepperdine as Alice and Kate Somerby as Jenny is consistently good and the
story is intriguing enough to hold the attention of all ages throughout. The
piece runs for just over an hour without an interval and the production,
directed by Anthony Clark, is supported by the Wolfson Foundation.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Arts: New face for Toronto
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ON January 24 the Art Gallery of Ontario unveiled its new face to the world.
A controversial and long drawn-out project of renovation and expansion has
finally been completed - minus some trimmings. Costed originally at Dollars
38m, the eventual cost was Dollars 58m. The AGO triumphantly reemerges as
one of the ten largest public art museums in North America.
To one side, the AGO abuts a thoroughly English early 19th-century brick
mansion, The Grange. In the early 1900s, a wealthy widow, Henrietta Goldwin
Smith, was prevailed upon to make it over to a group of philanthropists
looking for a home for the city's embryo art-collection.
The view from the other side of the AGO tells a different story. The main
facade on Dundas Street surveys the bustling life of Toronto's Chinatown.
Its art gallery straddles two worlds, the city's anglophone, conservative
past and its new, fast-changing, polyglot vitality. Behind the glamour of a
gala reopening party lie two urgent and related problems: first, making the
AGO relevant to a wider public and, second, balancing the books.
In July, the AGO closed for seven months and sacked more than half its staff
in response to a Dollars 4.3m deficit. The AGO wanted a Dollars 6m increase
in its operating grant but the response was only a Dollars 1m increase. An
independent task-force set up by Ontario's Minister of Culture recognised
the gallery was under-funded, but charged it to raise more money from the
private sector. It also criticised the AGO for failing to attract visitors
from different cultural backgrounds and for neglecting its obligations
towards contemporary Canadian art.
Elitist and conservative; it is this perception which Glenn Lowry, AGO's
director for the past two years, is acutely aware that must be changed. The
old AGO did not beckon invitingly. 'Essentially, it was a big white cement
box across a moat, without enough windows', he recalls. But one remarkable
coup had put the Toronto museum on the cultural tourist's map: in 1974, it
succeeded in 'scooping' London's Tate Gallery when Henry Moore made a huge
gift of 101 sculptures, 57 drawings and 105 prints to the city. With
curaAlan Wilkinson, Moore worked on the design of an extremely striking
gallery, awash with cool natural light. The Henry Moore Sculpture Centre
remains the most important and comprehensive collection of Moore's work in
any public collection.
Now the AGO's exhibition space has more than doubled, with 30 new galleries.
The moat is gone. A canopy and cladding for the landmark tower must wait
until the AGO has spare cash.
Inside, however, there is no impression of scrimping. An austere white and
slate-grey entrance hall is flooded with natural light from slits in its
dramatic pyramid roof. At once attention is focussed on the heart of the
matter; in an alcove at high level, Moore's 'Draped Reclining Figure'
surveys all who enter. Upstairs, there stretches a beautifully rhythmic
succession of seven double-height galleries with vaulted ceilings. Here
Canadian contemporary art has its permanent space.
The beaux-arts galleries of European painting and sculpture have been
painted in deep colours, red, green, blue and yellow. Sometimes this
now-familiar trick works, sometimes not. I was also disconcerted by the low
hang of the pictures. This is child-friendly orthodoxy and anyone over 5ft
4ins begins to feel like a giraffe.
Perhaps there is a whiff of over-eager historicising? A Kunstkammer,
intended to evoke the origins of the idea of museums, is too sparse and far
too rational to do anything of the sort. And how strange to wedge
Tintoretto's large and wonderfully animated 'Christ Washing the Feet of his
Disciples' into this same restricted gallery. Toronto has a well-known
collection of Florentine Baroque bronzes, so it would be good to see still
more of them in this intimate space.
There are many discoveries to make among the historic and modern Canadian
collection. The large oils and the vibrant little oil sketches by the Group
of Seven, the nationalist movement in landscape painting at the beginning of
this century, hang close together. Here, surely, is a source of deep delight
and for foreigners, the opportunity to see Canada's most beloved artists,
such as Lismer, Varley, Emily Carr, Lawren S. Harris.
One thing which strikes the European visitor is the omnipresent
acknowledgement of the benefactor. Every room is named for someone.
Benefactors were even invited to 'sponsor' the rehang of a picture in return
for having their name on a plaque underneath for six months. Fund-raisers,
take note.
The Joey and Toby Tanenbaum Sculpture Atrium, a spectacular glass lean-to
structure, is one of many testimonies to an art-loving Toronto dynasty.
After starting in the demolition business, the Tanenbaums have become major
art-collectors. They have been advised by the AGO, to which they have been
major benefactors - a typically north American relationship which is
unfamiliar the Britain. At the AGO's opening, the announcement was made of a
further Dollars 4m gift from the family.
It is impossible here to give an account of the strengths and high points of
the AGO's collection, except to say that they are numerous and include fine
paintings by Bernard Van Orley, Le Sueur, Frans Hals, Poussin, Delacroix,
Augustus John, Matisse, and Picasso. It took a long time and cost a lot of
money, but the result is that Toronto now has an art-gallery which does the
city credit.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Arts: An alternative 'tv' man - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EDDIE IZZARD, the stand-up comic playing at the Ambassadors, calls himself a
tv man, by which he means transvestite not television. He has a mop of blond
hair with an engaging fringe that could be female. He wears a black tunic
with a plunging neckline and gold buttons, black tights and highish heels.
The earings are discrete and the nail varnish more pink than red.
The transvestite jokes run very well for about quarter of an hour. When he
thought about coming out of the closet, he says that some people suggested a
better term would be coming out of the lounge. He also claims to be dyslexic
and not quite sure what transvestism means: transistorism perhaps? As
quickly becomes clear, he is a very good comedian who has to dress somehow.
References to television take over from the other form of tv very early on.
The Daleks and Dr Who are never far away from his act.
Izzard has a number of fascinations. In no particular order, they include
religion, dinosaurs, small insects and, above all, language and ordinary
human behaviour. Oddly engough for a satirist, politics is scarcely
mentioned: John Major not at all.
He can probably beat a Jehovah's Witness on a Sunday morning game, set and
match. For the Witnesses, as he correctly points out, have no new thought
input, whereas he can talk for two days at a stretch and is bursting with
irrelevant information: hence their retreat from his doorstep. He wonders
why Jesus wore flip-flops, what God thinks when people consistently mumble
the Lord's Prayer and why they have to ask forgiveness for trespassing -
'not the most heinous of sins'.
Reverting to dyslexia, he suggests that invisible letters would be just as
logical. He has a brief go at the Queen and her annus horribilis. Where did
she get that from? She knocked it out as if we all say it all the time.
There is other fun with Latin tags. In his brief history of evolution, he
stresses the role of homo 45 degreesus.
Izzard is at his best on London transport and the current wave of
disruptions. He thinks there is a conspiracy to place nutty people on buses,
but that civilised people have a way of dealing with them: they simply stare
straight ahead. Izzard stares, as he does all his acting, very convincingly.
Like most stand-up comics in a theatre, he goes on too long - a good 2 1/2
hours. He proably knows it. There is a splendid moment at the end when he
threatens to come back for a third act. His technique is to pretend to be
disorderly while more or less maintaining the threads. I did not laugh out
loud quite as much as some of the audience, but the chuckle level is high.
The Ambassadors is just the right small theatre for this kind of show.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Books: Cinderellas of the trade - Short Stories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD GARDINER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS tempting to believe that the British short story is enjoying a
renaissance. An enthusiastic audience gathered yesterday evening for
readings at the Purcell Room, and another will assemble tonight to hear Rose
Tremain, Joyce Carol Oates and Barbara Kingsolver. A season of readings is
planned at the Voice Box. Competitions are popping up all over the place.
And bookshops are dedicating shelves to anthologies - Latin American, South
African, Russian, women's and more are due this year.
But much of this is froth. Literary awards favour the novel, and short story
writers are the Cinderellas of the publishing industry.
There are three broad categories of anthology: foreign, mixed, and
single-author collections. The latter are typically bought by readers who
are addicted to the novels of a particular writer, and who would happily
read a car-maintenance manual if it had the right name on the cover. They
lead a poor field. Anthologies of foreign fiction are used by adventurous
readers to sample new writers before shelling-out for a novel.
Bringing up the rear are the indigenous breeds: Malcolm Bradbury's Modern
British Short Stories is a sturdy contender among these because students
have to buy it for courses; anthologies targeted at specific readerships
(women or gays) follow closely behind; thematic anthologies, like the
Serpent's Tail series, make up the numbers as do showcases for new writing,
like the Faber and Heinemann/Minerva series. Lumbering in last are
anthologies of competition winners. Novels romp home, clear winners, every
time.
Reputations sell literary fiction, and reputations are built on novels.
Those few writers who specialise in short stories, like VS Pritchett and
William Trevor, are denied the acclaim heaped on novelists. And the
publishing industry compounds the problem by treating the short story as a
suitable medium for beginners, or failed poets.
American attitudes are, and always have been, more enlightened. The editor
of Granta, Bill Buford, is familiar with approaches on both sides of the
Atlantic: 'Stories here tend to be commission-generated, and generally as
inspiring as the commissions: Spring, First Love. The respect is missing.'
The form is invigorated in the US by a plethora of publications. Preeminent
among these is the New Yorker, which publishes at least one story each week
and performs three vital functions: it attracts a wide, varied readership;
it introduces new writers; and it funds them to continue writing (it pays
Dollars 1 per word, with higher rates for pieces under 2500 words).
There is no equivalent British vehicle. With a payment rate of between
Pounds 500 and Pounds 2000, Granta is the most generous magazine here. Its
circulation is 100,000, but unlike the New Yorker most of its readers are
academics, writers or journalists. Other specialist literary magazines have
small circulations; and the London Review of Books now rarely publishes
short fiction, Womens magazines choose fiction which blends with their tone,
so no publication exists to promote the literary short story.
Radio 4 is the largest patron, but there are severe constraints on writing
for radio. Duncan Minshull, who produces the daily short story, receives
between 100 and 150 manuscripts each week, few of which suit the specific
requirements of his 15-minute programme: pieces must be 2100 words long,
with a simple plot and fast narrative pace, tales rather than sketches.
However, the most debilitating restriction on writing for that format is the
impossibility of allowing pieces to develop organically to the right length.
Minshull increasingly commissions from writers whom he knows will produce
good material, so the outlet bears an uncomfortable resemblance to
journalism. Yet he still manages to find excellent pieces, good enough to
publish a selection, Telling Stories.
Telling Stories sold extremely well for a short story anthology - around
10,000 copies demonstrates the existence of a market for short fiction.
The other main outlet is the leading publisher of thematic anthologies,
Serpent's Tail. Its trade paperbacks comprise a handful of pieces from
established authors, together with about 15 contributions from less
well-known writers whom they hope to introduce to a wider readership. Yet
sales of these may only reach a few thousand copies: the New Yorker's
circulation is 600,000.
Competitions bring new talent to light, and some publish winners. They are
scanned, together with magazines, by those literary agents who are keen to
advocate the form. Giles Gordon of Shell Land constantly watches for gifted
new writers, many of whom find their way into the Heinemann/Minerva
anthology which he edits.
The Ian St. James awards created a buzz when they were initiated in 1979.
The prizes are dizzying: Pounds 7000 and Pounds 3000 for winners of the
longer and shorter categories respectively, with awards last year totalling
Pounds 64,300. The competition is a fine incentive to unpublished writers,
for whom it was created, but because prize money is dispersed over several
individuals, no single prize is sufficiently large to capture media interest
for a sustained period to elevate awareness of the form.
Giles Gordon believes that while sales of hardback fiction have decreased -
a new novel will only sell around 400 copies - single-author collections of
stories have held their own. This seems quite likely; British cultural
habits are becoming more American, and, cliched though it might seem, short
fiction is more suited to urban life-styles. Yet there remains a powerful,
and irrational, public resistance to the short story, and no number of
dedicated writers, publishers, editors or agents seem likely to dent it.
Despite derisory rates of payment, and the lack of outlets like the New
Yorker, exciting short fiction is emerging. Ian McEwan, Adam Mars-Jones and
Georgina Hammick are among the few who achieved prominence firstly through
their short fiction, though McEwan abandoned the form to concentrate on
novels. James Kelman's Not Not While The Giro was a dazzling display, but
Kelman was only really celebrated when he had also written novels. And John
Fuller, Mars-Jones and others are experimenting, linking pieces together
into coherent, novel length works.
Mars-Jones prefers the short form because it does not invite readers to
immerse themselves in a fictional world; they are 'always aware of the
outside edges', as he puts it. Yet the publishing machine exerts
considerable pressure on him to grow up and write proper books - novels. He
wrote one, which is published by Faber this June, and now worries that it
will be reviewed as 'short stories in drag'. He sums up the British practice
neatly: 'The short story is a bouquet given by publishers to successful
authors'.
Tonight's audience at the South Bank may emerge satisfied, but unless
British complacency is redressed, the short story will never flourish here
like its American cousin. An award attracting the same status and media
attention as the Booker Prize but targetted at story collections would be
one boost. Another would be a decision by the Sunday supplements to publish
good - really good - short fiction.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Arts: Stars shine out in Sundance - David D'Arcy finds all
Hollywood in Park City, Utah, talent spotting at the film festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID D'ARCY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TONY Chan shot his first feature film, Combination Platter, in his parents'
Chinese restaurant in Queens, New York for Dollars 200,000. The
unsentimental film has no stars - the lead is a fulltime stockbroker - and
its humour hinges on an Asian-American's perspective, but the 24-year-old
Chan has already been approached by three distributors interested in his
movie, and by Hollywood agents interested in him.
Dozens of Hollywood talent agents and studio executives crowded into the
Utah mountain town Park City last month, viewing everything from the
playwright Sam Shepherd's debut as a film director to two filmmakers' grim
home movie of their own deterioration from AIDS.
Why was Hollywood in Park City? The studio people were among the 5000 film
makers, producers and others at the 1993 Sundance Film Festival, an event
created so that film makers working outside the Hollywood system could see
each other's films. Now Hollywood cannot afford not to be here to tap this
talent pool.
This year's awards reflect the festival's range. Ruby in Paradise, about a
young woman who flees a backward Appalachia for a Florida resort, shared the
dramatic feature Jury prize with Public Access, the tale of a handsome
stranger turned psychokiller in a typical American town. Documentary awards
went to Silverlake Life and to Children of Fate: Life and Death in a
Sicilian Family, about three generations of poverty in a now-leveled Palermo
slum.
Twelve years ago the actor Robert Redford took over a foundering film
festival here, and developed the Sundance Institute alongside it, to
incubate and promote the work of young screenwriters outside the narrow
confines of the studios. The festival accomplished that quietly, introducing
David Lynch, Wayne Wang and Jim Jarmusch, among others, to sympathetic
critics and distributors.
It was after one young director's first film called sex, lies and videotape
charmed Park City in 1989 and went on to take in more than Dollars 60
million at the box office that Hollywood began to pay attention. Attendance
has risen 30 per cent a year since. Critics located the promise of American
cinema there more than a decade ago, and now the box office is confirming
that judgment. The big studios' growing emphasis on high budget blockbusters
has also driven more modest ones into independents' hands. Actors in search
of challenging roles are natural allies. The term 'independent film' has
become hard to define: the Hollywood 'independent' producer's Dollars
10-million movie now shows alongside the Dollars 25,000 gay road odyssey at
Sundance.
Still, if the festival's mission has been to take independent films beyond
their perennial art house audience, then Sundance has been a success. A
dozen films from last year's festival had national releases, among them
Errol Morris's documentary biography of Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of
Time, and Reservoir Dogs, the bloody heist film debut of Quontin Tarantino.
At least another dozen will get into theatres this year.
Besides Combination Platter, the 1993 feature competition included Twenty
Ducks, a picaresque link of vignettes focusing on a twenty-dollar bill
changing hands over the course of several days in Los Angeles. Like many
American independent films, this was a twist on a well-worn story. The
Spanish-language Texan film El Mariachi offered its own version of the
gangster theme, when an itinerant musician in a border town finds drug
dealers' guns in his guitar case. El Mariachi's 24 year-old director, Robert
Rodriguez, has been hired by Columbia Pictures to direct a higher priced
remake of his own script. Columbi has also bought his next screenplay.
Along with the work of precocious novices, Sundance also screened films by
veterans such as Victor Nunez, of Tallahassee, Florida, who helped start the
independent film movement more than 20 years ago. Nunez's Ruby in Paradise
follows a young woman adjusting to strange surroundings with a slow,
meandering pace that an impatient studio would want to accelerate.
Curiously, Hollywood is now courting the director who turned his back on its
way of telling a story.
The competition also presented Boxing Helena, the debut of Jennifer Chambers
Lynch, the 24-year-old daughter of David Lynch. Not surprisingly, Ms Lynch's
lushly shot drama deals with a case of obsession: a respected surgeon's
desire for a petulant vixen who despises him. Madonna was the first choice;
but Sherilynn Fenn ended up in the part, alongside Julian Sands as the
doctor. The two approach their roles in earnest, but the audiences seemed
amused rather than terrified, even as the lovestruck surgeon performed a
series of mutilations on Ms Fenn.
Ms Lynch's film was not the only one at Sundance to be haunted by her
father's presence. Other offerings featured bizarre 'stranger in town'
characters who turn out to be psychopaths or angry young men with guns at
the ready. This twentysomething generation has already been dubbed the
year's emerging trend. Others fault that group for exploiting sheer
strangeness or violence to gain attention, with screenwriting only an
afterthought.
Sundance's strength this year lay in its documentary competition. Leading
the field was Nick Broomfield's response to America's mania for publicising
appalling crimes, Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer. Wuornos is
a former Florida prostitute condemned to death for killing seven male
clients. Wuornos claims self-defence, but the media have branded her
'America's first female serial killer.' Her notoriety proved to be an asset.
The police had sought to sell the film rights to her story even before they
arrested her. Also cashing in are a woman who had adopted Wuornos; and
Wuornos' lawyer, an obese former rock musician who advised her to plead
no-contest. Both of them are paid on-camera for arranging interviews for
Broomfield.
Not all the Sundance documentaries were so serious. Some were even
fictional, such as the satirical rap 'mockumentary' NWH: Fear of a Black Hat
by Rusty Cundieff. NWH stands for Niggas With Hats, a parody of the
controversial group 'NWA,' 'Niggas With Attitude.' Fear of a Black Hat
targets rap's notorious misogyny and its mania for 'badness.' Some real
rappers have said that they have been stereotyped negatively by the
28-year-old Cundieff, a comedian who wrote the screenplay, directed, and
stars as the belligerent rapper Ice Cold.
As a first-time black independent filmmaker, Cundieff fits the Sundance
profile. He also breaks it, since Fear of a Black Hat could emerge as a
mass-audience hit, like the earlier movie it parodies, This is Spinal Tap.
With diversity in independent film comes conflict. Young filmmakers bristle
at charges that they are selling out, becoming 'Hollywood directors for
hire'. Women filmmakers attack the violence that new directors often use as
a trademark, and racial minorities and homosexuals clamour for equal time.
With technology's expansion of low-budget filmmaking, this splintering is a
natural development. It suggests that Sundance has fulfilled its mission.
But the needs of Hollywood itself for ideas and talent may end up sustaining
the festival.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Arts: Alarm bells for real - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER more cries of wolf than even Dracula could manage, arts organisations
throughout the UK could finally be in real trouble in the next few weeks.
The local authorities give over Pounds 300m a year to the arts, more than
the Arts Council, and in recent years many have started to be proud of this
expenditure. Glasgow, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds are just some of the
cities that have spent heavily on the arts to raise their profile to draw in
business investment and tourist expenditure.
But remorseless cuts in government funding, and the need for local
authorities to concentrate resources on front line activities like housing
and welfare, mean that the arts could suffer real damage in 1993-94. The
final decisions will not be made for a month or so but the alarm bells are
ringing furiously around the land.
London seems certain to be badly hit, with the boroughs of Brent, Hounslow,
Lambeth, Camden and Hammersmith giving most cause for concern. It is the
arts centres receiving over Pounds 100,000 a year, like the Tricycle Theatre
in Brent and the Watermans in Hounslow, which are biting their nails. The
Young Vic in Lambeth and the Greenwich Festival are also in the frame for
cuts.
They are unlikely to lose all, but reductions of up to 30 per cent could
decimate their activities. The Arts Council has made clear that it cannot
increase its 1993-94 grants, which it has already announced. Nor can the
London Arts Board. There is talk of the loss of one major arts venue in the
next few months.
Outside the capital, the Victoria Theatre in Stoke, the Octagon in Bolton,
the Crucible and Lyceum theatres in Sheffield, and the Bristol Old Vic are
thought to be vulnerable to reduced grants. In Manchester the council seems
to have singled out the Library and Forum theatres, and Liverpool is in its
usual knife-edge state. The Bournemouth Orchestra is very concerned, and
even the famed arts of Birmingham are not regarded as immune from the
Council's declared cuts in its budget.
Perhaps the greatest devastation will occur in towns like Harlow and Milton
Keynes where the necessary cost savings could only be achieved by halving or
eliminating altogether arts expenditure. Activities like theatre in schools
are an obvious candidate for the chop following reductions in the education
budget in Greater Manchester and elsewhere.
What makes the situation much more serious this year is that alternative
sources of funding are just not there. The Arts Council has pegged its
grants to an average 2.5 per cent rise; commercial sponsorship is much
harder to come by; and box office revenue is falling virtually everywhere.
There is also the knowledge that the Arts Council faces an actual reduction
in its grant for 1994-95. Many arts companies, and local authorities, feel
that if the situation is likely to deteriorate further, it is hardly worth
trying to struggle through this year.
The combination could lead to closures. But its more insidious effect will
be to make theatres, orchestras, dance companies, and opera houses play
safe, presenting traditionally popular works for longer periods and avoiding
the new and the challenging. It is a short term solution which will lead to
a long term disaffection with the arts.
All this is just one more headache for the Heritage Secretary Peter Brooke
who so far has shown himself to be a lack lustre defender of the arts, in
thrall to his civil servants. If he could promise to restore cash growth in
1994-95 the will to live would be stronger. As things stand the Arts Council
might well avert its gaze if a flagship arts company goes to the wall, in
the hope that a first rate crisis will force the government to take funding
the arts more seriously.

On March 21 Radio 3 is transmitting The Hammer, a gothic thriller presented
by the touring drama company Red Shift Theatre. Independent productions have
started to infiltrate the very soul of BBC Radio.
This is partly a matter of cost saving; partly an attempt to widen the
creative input. It is strange that with all the new plays appearing on the
Fringe, or even in sizeable theatres, few get a radio airing. If anything
the flow has been the other way. Howard Barker's Scenes from an Execution
started on the radio before being fleshed out by Glenda Jackson at the
Almeida last year, and the Traverse in Edinburgh will soon play host to Tom
Courtney in Moscow Station, a Radio 3 production of last summer.
The Hammer, which stars Martin Jarvis and Bill Nighy, is produced by
Essential Productions, which sees radio as wide open for independent
producers. And not just in drama: coming up shortly is Radio 3's first
independent music series, Re-wind, hosted by singer Robert Tear.
What has slowed the process is the lack of experience of working in radio by
theatre and music directors. But the situation in the UK is paradise
compared with American radio which is totally monopolised by music, usually
from the pop charts.
A few years ago a group of Hollywood actors set up LA Theatre Works in an
attempt to create a domestic radio drama industry. Naturally they looked to
the BBC for advice and commissions and a succession of movie names, like
Richard Dreyfus, periodically quit LA for a week or so to record in London.
This month Walter Matthau makes his radio debut at the age of 72 in a Fay
Weldon play, The Hole in the Top of the World.
*****
Like many other businesses the Edinburgh Festival is currently in thrall to
the slump in sterling. Its fall has raised the cost of some planned events
by 20 per cent and makes it difficult to confirm whether visits from
overseas companies are financially viable. But Edinburgh has boldly
announced the bones of the 1993 Festival, the first in which the hand of new
director Brian McMaster is visible.
No surprise that there is no one big overwhelming theme, and no surprise
that opera is prominent, which reflects both McMaster's taste, and research
suggesting that opera pulled in visitors who then added on other events. A
highlight is 'Verdi - from first to last', starting with his first, very
rare Oberto, ending with Falstaff, with three in between. There is also a
Schubert meets Janacek theme, and anticipated visits by 14 major orchestras
bringing in their train Tennstedt, Schiff, Lott, Donohoe, and more.
In theatre directors are named but not their plays. They are an impressive
international quartet - Peter Stein, Robert Lepage, Klaus Michael Gruber and
Robert Wilson. In dance the Mark Morris group makes a swift return after its
1992 success and also from the US there is a debut by the Bill T.
Jones/Arnie Zane Company.

THE ENGLISH BIBLE AND THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY REVOLUTION
by Christopher Hill
Viking Pounds 25, 466 pages
TODAY IS Christopher Hill's 82nd birthday. Longevity seems appropriate in an
historian, for although reading about interesting times is almost always
better than living through them, it somehow seems that the historian who
does both must profit thereby. Hill has certainly done so; a figure who
inspires affection, admiration and controversy in equally generous parts, he
is a colossus in his special field - the history of 17th-century England -
and at the same time the only Communist ever to have been Master of Balliol
College, Oxford.
As if to mark his birthday with proof of sparklingly unimpaired powers, Hill
here publishes another major study of the 17th century, this time on the
influence of the English bible on those tumultuous times. Every
characteristic of Hill's writing is on display: astonishingly wide reading,
lucent prose, striking insight, compassion. And so too are the themes for
which Hill has consistently argued, not least among them the conviction that
the English Revolution set the pattern for revolutions to follow, in
America, France and Russia, whose various makers looked back to the story of
Charles I and Cromwell for their models and cautions.
The 17th century is a battlefield of controversy among historians, and Hill
is one of the leading figures in the debate. The controversy's background
lies in the development, in recent decades, of a 'revisionist' response to
the legacy of Whig history which long dominated theories about the English
Revolution. Whig history is premissed on the idea that history is progress,
consisting in the evolution of social and political institutions from less
to more perfect forms. History is improvement; later, Whigs say, is better.
Accordingly their judgment on the 17th century is that the increasing power
of Parliament against the Crown represents progress, and explains the
increasing liberty, wealth and influence of the English people.
This, in a nutshell, is Hill's view. He has indeed been described as 'the
last of the great neo-Whig historians'. In his celebrated book The Century
of Revolution he invites us to compare England at the accession of James I
(1603) with England at the accession of George I about a century later.
James chose his ministers as he wished; Parliament sat at the king's
discretion; Crown revenues still supplied most government finance. England
was a small, poor country, with a one-crop economy and little international
influence. In sharp contrast, Hanoverian England was the world's greatest
power, its king owed his throne to Parliament, and Parliament completely
controlled the nation's government and finances.
And these, Hill argued, are only the bare bones of the story. James's
leather-clad subjects became George's wearers of linen and silk. The former
drank ale and dined off pewter and wood; the latter drank tea, coffee, port
and gin, and furnished their dining tables with pottery and glass. By
George's time knives and forks, looking-glasses and handkerchiefs were
commonplace, and the Duke of Devonshire had an indoor bath with hot and cold
running water. Such, palpably, is progress.
But the 'revisionists' are not persuaded by the assumptions of this picture,
in which the causes and consequences of the Civil War are seen in terms of
Crown versus Parliament, with Puritanism providing the focus of opposition.
For revisionists the picture is much more complex, with many local factors
in play. The distinguished historian Conrad Russell argues that it was not a
revolution that the 17th century saw, but a general breakdown prompted by
three chief factors: it was no longer possible to enforce a single religion;
war was no longer a private enterprise of monarchs but required funding
through taxation, which fractured the financial system; and the problems of
running a multiple kingdom (the Crowns of England and Scotland were united
in 1603) proved as great as the very similar problems now faced by the
European Community. So the Whig picture, revisionists argue, is
insufficient.
Although it is right to describe Hill as a neo-Whig, his chief intellectual
debt is to Marxism. Marxist historiography's premiss is that change in
societies is driven by contradictions inherent within them. In the 1930s,
when Hill was at the beginning of his academic career and a new member of
the Communist Party, the framework of Marxist theory offered a powerful
counter to 'structuralist-functionalist' models in which societies are
viewed as static devices for neutralising change and disorder. Although Hill
left the Communist Party in 1957, his views continued to be influenced by
Marxism, whose optimistic and teleological character is perfectly consistent
with a Whiggish conception of history.
In his new book Hill argues that the English versions of the bible which
appeared in the 16th century, and especially the 'Geneva' Bible (so called
because it was printed in the Protestant safety of that city, with
politically radical marginal notes), had a wide impact on 17th-century
society. It was put to political uses, chiefly on the side of opposition to
kings and tyrants; it provided textual support for dissent; it hugely
influenced literature; and finally it subverted its own authority by
exposing difficulties over interpretation - for if each can read scripture
his own way, its authority is no longer universal. The impact of this
protean and revolutionary book was enormous and often unexpected. Hill's
discussion of it is fascinating, and as usual sure to provoke debate.
In paying warm tribute to Hill as historian and teacher, Conrad Russell this
week remarked that however large the difference of opinion or robust the
debate in which Hill is engaged, 'he always plays the ball, never the man'.
That is a great virtue, and among all the praises that could be heaped on
the head of this doyen of English history and letters, it is an apt one to
single out, for it speaks of the courtesy of his brilliance, and its charm.
Hill's new book displays both these qualities in abundance.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Books: Forced into sleuthing - Crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE protagonist of a detection novel is not a police agent but a
private citizen, the author is always obliged to explain why he or she does
not simply call the cops. A frequent answer is: because there aren't any.
Perhaps the murder takes place in a remote house, isolated by a blizzard
(The Mouse Trap), or on an island where the telephone lines to the mainland
have been cut (And Then There Were None), or perhaps the principals are in a
foreign country where the forces of law and order are corrupt and
unreliable.
In two recent first novels, the authors seem hard put to make their answers
plausible. Bronte Adams, whose Brought to Book (Virago Pounds 5.99, 232
pages) includes a lot of wry, convincing detail about life in the world of
book publishing, invents an unlikely one-eyed heroine who gets herself into
the most absurd punishments rather than risk involving the incredibly
suspicious police. The author does not lack a gift for invention; there is
enough plot for half a dozen murder stories, the setting is well
established, and the sheer absurdity of much of the story (the idea of a
one-eyed girl trying to conceal her identity]) makes it fun to read.
Sarah Lacey's debut novel, File Under Deceased (Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds
14.99, 186 pages), is traditionally and effectively laid out, though here,
too, the intrepid Leah Hunter, virtually forced into sleuthing, seems
particularly wilful in not collaborating with the police, especially since
she finds the sergeant attractive. The small town setting in Yorkshire is
established with real authority, and the social layers of the constricted
society are as distinct as the tiers of a cake. The plot is a bit thick, but
the novel suggests a real talent. In Lacey's next one, the tough but
golden-hearted Sarah will presumably work hand-in-hand with sergeant
Nicholls. He may even have won a promotion.

CULTURE AND IMPERIALISM
by Edward W Said
Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 20,444 pages
FIFTEEN years ago Professor Edward Said, a Palestinian based at Columbia,
published a fashionable, even influential, book called Orientalism. In
Culture and Imperialism he develops and broadens some of the themes of that
book so as to analyse, with references galore to literature and in
particular to the Western novel, the relationship between the imperial
powers and their dependencies.
'Without empire . . .' he writes with typical assurance, 'there is no
European novel as we know it . . . The novel, as a cultural artefact of
bourgeois society, and imperialism are unthinkable without each other . . .'
Which, if you think about it, is not really true. Said starts early with an
example of his approach: in Mansfield Park (which one might have thought was
a pre-imperial book) he declares that Sir Thomas Bertram's plantation in
Antigua is central to Jane Austen's conception of metropolitan England's
peace and stability. Is that insight helpful? I suspect not. He goes on, of
course, to discuss writers more apparently imperial in setting and concerns:
Kipling, Verdi (for Aida), Conrad and, in due course, Forster, Yeats, Camus,
Achebe, Malraux, CLR James, Fanon, and so on.
Said is careful to claim that he responds to his chosen novels first and
foremost as valued products of the creative imagination: only then, he says,
does he set them in the imperial context and without condemning them for
that colonial connection. But there is something depressingly limiting about
this political view of the greatest literature: the 'darkness' whose heart
was explored by Conrad, for instance, is surely diminished if it is
interpreted merely in terms of a non-European society resisting imperialism.
Take Kim as a better example, to which the professor devotes a long section.
I recall him describing Kim in an earlier publication as 'a profoundly
embarrassing novel'. It is good to find that he may have changed his mind:
he now seems to admit that Kim is one of the greatest novels of our age - it
is an astonishingly under-esteemed book, perhaps because it can be foolishly
filed on the children's shelves - but it is also alarming to discover the
limits of Said's response.
Kipling, we are assured, 'assumes a basically uncontested empire'; the Lama
is placed 'within the protective orbit of British rule in India' (see the
Lahore Curator giving him those symbolic spectacles]); Kim is a 'liminal'
figure whose role is to help maintain the bonds of society; at the moment of
his crisis - 'And what is Kim?' - he goes through 'a ceremony of
reappropriation, Britain . . . taking hold once again in India' and so
achieves the 'function of being a Sahib in colonial India'. This sort of
acado-speak nonsense sublimely misses the point, which is that we are
attending Kim's re-birth, as even the younger readers will have noticed. The
boy and the old man have simultaneously come close to death and are now
about to achieve their separate quests - the passage to manhood and the
confronting of death, the two great journeys in all our lives, and nothing
to do with being a Sahib.
This politico-historical approach to a masterpiece is so inadequate that it
distorts and diminishes it, and it is an approach which is too typical of
the rest of the book: you can imagine what Said does with the young Marlow's
admission in Heart of Darkness that he always wanted to fill in the blank
spaces on the map, or Mr Gould blowing up his own mine in Nostromo.
It is true, of course, that the novel of the 19th and early 20th centuries
contains frequent references to the fact of empire. Said focuses on Britain,
and to a lesser extent France and America, and is justified in arguing that
the empire is always there, like the servants, undiscussed, in a great
house. In the earlier period he grants that the empire is available to the
novelist but not always central; after the mid-19th century it becomes a
principal subject of attention. He is also right to argue that the careful
study of cultural imperialism can help us 'draw conclusions that enrich and
sharpen our reading of major cultural texts . . .'
But there's too little pleasure, stimulus, excitement, for the lay as
opposed to the academic reader. The professor's tendency to repeat himself
is the least of the problems. Too often, reading Said is like climbing a
sand dune. For all the exotic location, it is surprisingly exhausting; you
are constantly slipping back and when at last you get to the top, you find
you have expended enough energy to get you up a real mountain, only to find
that this isn't a mountain and that the view is disappointing.

R D LAING AND ME: LESSONS IN LOVE
by Roberta Russell
Airlift Book Company
Pounds 16.95/Pounds 12.95, 306 pages
WHEN Roberta Russell, a New York-bred psychology major and marketing
consultant in her late 30s, first met the revolutionary psychiatrist RD
Laing in 1980, he was 53, with his fame dwindling and his marriage nearing
the rocks. As she was heavily overweight and desperately seeking a man to
share her life, whilst he was drinking too much and earning too little, she
proposed a game plan of co-counselling in which she would work at doubling
his income while he was supposed to help her lose weight.
He agreed to give her some time and tape-record dialogues that might make up
a book. As these sporadically progressed, she found his 'attention,
commitment and good intentions were my allies in the battle against my
persistent resistance to taking my own common-sense advice'. She eventually
spent two months on protein malts and a mile of swimming a day, and lost her
hated 35 lbs - but did little to alleviate Laing's problems.
Toward the end of the book - and of their third year of acquaintance - he
stayed with her for a week in Manhattan and, for the first time, Russell
goes all coy: 'Of course, I cannot really describe the luxury of this
experience, but it changed me forever.' Since we have been led to expect
this ultimate lesson in love from the outset, and since she has been
spilling everyone else's domestic and socio-sexual beans, along with vastly
debatable interpretations, this discreet veil is a bit thick.
But despite Russell's gooey sentiments and ponderous psycho-babble, her
actual conversations with Laing turn the better half of this volume (which
he urged her to complete on her own just before his death in 1989) into an
absorbing document for anyone interested in the maverick polymath's later
development.
Laing originated the liberation of mental patients from unthinking
subjection to drugs, ECT and lobotomies in favour of more caring individual
considerations and long-term healing. Russell's record suggests how much
remains worth learning from him by non-specialists, too. His Divided Self
(1960) remains an indispensable manual for dealing with schizophrenia, even
though he never pretended to be able to resolve his own conflicts - let
alone to redeem what he experienced as 'the injustices of love.'

THE BLACK COOK'S HISTORIAN
by Graeme Rigby

RAVEN
by Thomas Strittmatter
Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 9.99, 249 pages
OLD SOLDIERS never die, especially not heroes of historical sagas. They
simply go on for ever, enjoying a vigorous shelf life long after the last
trumpet has sounded, the last battle been won. And when the battle is
Waterloo, as it was for Richard Sharpe after a dozen best-selling novels by
Bernard Cornwell, there was clearly nothing for his creator to do but put
the old boy out to grass and go back to the drawing board again with a
different soldier, different war, different country altogether.
Rebel is the result, the first in a Sharpe-like series intended to chronicle
the American civil war through the eyes of Nate Starbuck, a refugee from
Yale Divinity School, who has come south in pursuit of a woman and finds
himself stranded in Richmond just as the first shots are fired at Fort
Sumter.
Nate's father is a fire and brimstone Yankee preacher, loathed all over the
South (and by Nate himself) for the virulence of his opposition to slavery.
Rather than be tarred and feathered as his father's son, Nate elects to join
the Confederate army instead, enlisting in a private regiment raised by the
father of an old Yale friend. They shoulder arms and march towards Bull Run,
where Nate's brother is serving on the other side . . .
It's the formula much as before, in fact, a nice picture of fighting on the
front, lots of action between the covers, plenty going on to keep the reader
thoroughly absorbed. The author is not quite in the Margaret Mitchell class
 -he cannot match the tension and excitement of Gone With The Wind - but the
book is perfectly convincing all the same, a sure-fire best-seller if ever
there was one. No doubt Rebel Yell will follow in due course, and Johnny
Rebel after that and - well, you could almost name the rest yourselves.
Less predictable is Terence Stamp, who after three volumes of autobiography
has decided to try his hand at a novel, and a rather unusual one at that.
Billed as a philosophical comedy, The Night tells the story of a dinner
party in Holland Park, and of the eight somewhat freaky people who attend
it.
Chief among them is Zeno, an actor/pop singer with a background not unlike
Stamp's own, who is into circadian rhythms and 16 different kinds of herb in
his Ayurvedic toothpaste. There is also Captain Toby, about whose private
life the less said the better, promiscuous Fleur, homosexual Mr Rose and
ladies' man Nick, who has been known to get through 14 women at one time,
and only two of them disappointed.
Quite a night, by the time it is over. Stamp enjoys himself hugely at his
characters' expense and as a welcome bonus reveals a closet intellectual
beneath his own handsome exterior. He is into equinoxes, reincarnation,
Jung, RD Laing, dukkerinas, Jim Morrison and the earth's electromagnetic
field, among other concepts. His characters may not always seem entirely
believable to the average reader, but the author moves in exotic circles, so
what appears markedly eccentric to the rest of us may well seem quite normal
to him.
The Black Cook's Historian is an unusual story as well. It charts the career
of an 18th century Englishman sold to the press gang and forced to work as
galley slave to the cook of the title. Not for long however, because the
cook poisons their captors and takes command of the ship himself, setting
all the slaves free. They sail away to establish a new Carthage, taking the
Englishman with them. It is an intriguing tale, told with a poet's eye for
detail, and has already won the Constable prize, awarded biennially for the
best unpublished novel from the north of England.
Thomas Strittmatter's Raven is a first novel from Germany (translated by Ian
Mitchell) and reads like it too. Its theme is adolescence and early
adulthood, as experienced by a bunch of misfits glimpsed first at school,
then in a series of low-grade jobs leading nowhere. There are quite a few
jokes along the way, but the author's disjointed style and rambling,
nihilistic approach leave one wondering what on earth it's all about in the
end.

ARCHAEOLOGISTS AND AESTHETES
by Ian Jenkins
British Museum Press Pounds 25, 264 pages
A FOGGY day in London town. What the British Museum loses on such days is
not so much its charm as the details of its exterior decoration. The
conspiracy of fog, fumes and general metropolitan chiaroscuro explains why
most people entering the British Museum, including museum staff, never
notice that its portals are topped by a pedimental facade - and if they have
noticed it, the chances are that they have never bothered to see its
significance.
This pediment deserves more attention. It was designed in the mid-19th
century by Sir Richard Westmacott, whose earlier work elsewhere in London
includes the virile but fig-leafed statue of Wellington as Achilles in Hyde
Park. Westmacott's theme for the British Museum entrance was The Progress of
Civilisation. The viewer is intended to begin at the Eastern end, where man
is seen crawling out from the primal slime. Man sheds the slime to indulge
in hunting and farming; then, in a pagan but intellectually enlightened
state, he studies astronomy, as personified by the central figures of the
pediment. Thence issue mathematics, manufacturing, drama, poetry and music.
Finally, there is the discipline of natural history. By the time he reaches
the Western angle of the Westmacott pediment, man is reckoned to be well on
the way to a civilised existence.
Since the British Museum was originally founded for 'the advancement of the
study of Natural History', this was an appropriate order of things. But
natural history was already having trouble in retaining its eminence within
the Museum. The arrival of the Elgin Marbles, and the steady accumulation of
other antiquities throughout the first half of the 19th century, undermined
the original raison d'etre of the Museum. A contest ensued, between marble
gods and stuffed elephants: the gods won and, while the elephants were
trundled off to Kensington, ample new premises were designed for statues
previously accustomed to the ambrosial heights of the Athenian Acropolis.
Well: this was, after all, the same period in which John Stuart Mill
asserted that the fifth-century BC Battle of Marathon (when Greeks held off
a Persian invasion which might conceivably have proceeded into Europe) was a
more important event in British history than the Battle of Hastings. British
public schools were Spartan and the British constitution, an empire-building
structure operating from a restricted democratic base, was obsessed with its
Classical Athenian prototype. Though Gothic put up a good fight, the
Classical architectural orders were bullying their way all over the country.
Small wonder that the fossils and the stuffed elephants were dislodged from
their Bloomsbury home. Almost as soon as it went up, Westmacott's pediment
was outmoded by an aesthetic of reverence for the Parthenon sculptures.
The story of this process is unfolded with great expertise in this book by
Ian Jenkins, one of the curators of Greek and Roman Antiquities at the
British Museum. Jenkins explores the dilemma posed for Classically-educated
Victorians: whether to salute fifth-century BC Athens as an absolute, an
apogee, or recognise the linear inevitability of Darwinian progress. And he
traces the development of another problem for museum directors: if Classical
Greek art was perfection, where was one to put the also increasing
quantities of Oriental and Near Eastern relics?
Lord Elgin, as is now generally recognised, was driven not so much by
aristocratic cupidity as by a wish to place before the British public
exemplars of perfection, and a desire to encourage a renaissance of the arts
in Britain. He would have been comforted by some of the statistics revealed
by Jenkins: for instance, that in I879 permission to sketch Classical
sculptures in the Museum was granted to some 15,000 art students. But
creating a grand chain of progress in art, whereby Egypt was linked to
Greece via Assyria, proved beyond Victorian ingenuity; and the hope that
Greece might one day be capped by the glories of British art was never
remotely sustained by the virtuosi of the day, however assiduous in their
Neo-classicism.
'No longer is the art of one people judged the inferior of another, but each
is taken on its own terms.' Thus Jenkins nods towards present canons of
intellectual respectability, which dictate that anyone who visits the
British Museum ought to spend as much time in front of the colossal monsters
from Nimrud as with the Elgin marbles.
But, having displaced the stuffed elephants, the Athenian gods and and
heroes still enjoy a special status within the Museum. Although the
'Valhalla' designed for them in 1933 at the expense of Lord Duveen was
modified to make them more accessible to the public gaze, the present
setting of the Elgin marbles continues to nourish a sense of particular
veneration for them. The sheer spaciousness of the Duveen gallery argues
that its contents are examples of very rare and difficult art. It may be
that, a century hence, the dynamics of taste and cultural relativism will
have caused further reorganisation within the Museum; possibly, the Elgin
marbles will not be there at all.
But a museum, over time, becomes a relic in its own right. What Ian Jenkins
has done is a self-reflexive exercise. He is a curator involved, as it were,
with the curatorship of past curators. The results of his research are worth
reading by anyone for whom the British Museum has ever furnished delight and
discovery.

FT  06 FEB 93 / How To Spend It: A serious cooker, for serious cooks - A
kitchen range that is popular with enthusiastic home chefs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL THOSE doomsters who predicted that the family meal was endangered, that
the great warming roasts and casseroles of yesteryear would be nothing more
than a nostalgic memory, might like to know that they were wrong - the
market for serious cookers grows bigger every year.
How do I know? I know because ever since La Cornue, the cult cooker for
serious cooks, was introduced into this country in 1989, other manufacturers
have been rushing to copy them.
After La Cornue, we got Rosieres, with its Bocuse oven; the Viking range
from America; Morice from France with its enamelled ovens; Gaggenau with its
large hobs and double ovens; and New World started offering double ovens and
extra cooking units. All were aiming to fulfil the longing for what
marketing men now call 'hobby cookers.'
Hobby cookers, are what young professionals and family-minded keen cooks,
are looking for. They are no-nonsense, fine-looking, machines. Although they
were way beyond the price most ordinary families would dream of paying, keen
cooks, it seems, were prepared to pay for something that they saw as central
to their domestic lives.
Hobby cooks are attracted by the almost industrial look, robust styling,
beautiful workmanship, and fine finishes coupled with large capacity, high
power and fine precision.
When La Cornue first came out, few could afford it. Each cooker was made to
individual specification and at anything up to Pounds 8,000 or Pounds 10,000
a time the cooker was clearly beyond the reach of all but the most fanatical
or affluent. Which is why Eddie Cottrell of importers Fourneaux de France,
approached a manufacturer in Burgundy to come up with Ambassade, a range of
what he calls 'semi-professional stoves' at much more accessible prices.
They have much of the same charm as La Cornue - generous lines, the
expansive air of being a source of carefully-tended gregarious meals as well
as the technical capacity to produce them.
There are two ovens, both large enough to take the most well-fed of turkeys;
one is a convection electric one, the other a static electric oven with
grill. The hob has five high-powered gas burners (which can bring a 5-litre
pan of cold water to the oil in under 10 minutes) and it comes with pan
stands which enables the cook to cook across the whole surface.
There are removable cast-iron simmering plates which keep sauces at
precisely the right temperature, as well as griddle plates (so you can
char-grill your vegetables as well as any sassy restaurant) saute pans and
steamers which fit across the burners.
There is also a mijotage pan which sits over the large burner and fits in
the oven - ideal for braising when you need first to brown on top of the
cooker and then to finish off slow-cooking in the oven.
The basic two oven, five-burner model sells for around Pounds 2,087 - it is
photographed above with two add-on modular units (which include a built-in
bain marie, a deep fryer and warming ovens) which are around Pounds 700
each. For those who like the sturdy, industrial look but do not need two
ovens, there is a single oven (but capacious with two fans and two sets of
elements) version which sells for Pounds 1,873.
Anyone interested in the cooker can telephone the Fourneaux de France
showroom at 62 Westbourne Grove, London W2 5SH on 071-792-0991 and arrange a
demonstration.
So much for the technicalities, what about something a little more personal?
Sophie Mirman and Richard Ross (once of Sock Shop fame, now happily running
the children's mini-stores Trotters in London's King's Road and Kensington
High Street) have been the contented owners of an Ambassade for three
months.
'We love it dearly,' says Richard. 'We both cook and we were looking for
something for a country kitchen, something a little bit special. We like its
rugged looks, we think it is very beautiful and very luxurious and at the
same time it is wonderful to cook on. It's quite hard to keep it clean but
we find it's worth it.'

FT  06 FEB 93 / How To Spend It: Dunhill goes back to its roots - A company
that is cashing in on nostalgia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE turn of the century London was a city of small shop keepers.
Mass-production had not yet got under way and business was largely made up
of small cottage industries. For historians what is fascinating is trying to
identify just why some of the small cottage industries died and why others
grew into hugely successful modern companies.
Take Alfred Dunhill. In the late 19th century Dunhill was just a little
tobacco shop, one among many. Almost all later fell by the wayside but
Dunhill prospered and is now busy turning itself into a big player in the
luxury goods industry.
Like most successful businesses it was kick-started by a man who was
intuitive enough to anticipate the way the world was going, to offer
customers what they had not yet realised they wanted. Motoring, he foresaw,
was going to be the coming thing and so he developed what he called the
Dunhill Motorities - fine leather coats to keep out the wind, foot-muffs to
warm the feet, motoring-masks, fur-lined goggles, brass lamps, picnic
baskets; the ideas came thick and fast.
From Motorities (which he foresaw would be less in demand once motor-cars
became enclosed and warmer) he moved into an ingenious range of lighters,
watches and accessories.
Now that it has become fashionable for companies to look to their roots
Dunhill, in its centenary year, is doing just that - affirming its spirit,
celebrating its history, digging deep into the archives. It has launched an
Pounds 8m advertising campaign to persuade owners of Dunhill collectables to
sell them back to the company.  Already, several rare pieces have been
bought but there are still some special pieces (such as the 'Dorothy' rose
lighter - a marvellously kitsch design with a platinum and gold basket
topped by 60 cabochon rubies for the roses) which the company longs to have.
Dunhill has also been inspired to try and recreate the best of the pieces.
It has started with a few key designs - the golf ball lighter, a classic of
the 1930s; a marvellous short leather motoring jacket based on the
Motorities coat; a range of watches inspired by a 1930s Dunhill range; and
the Sylphide Lighter.
Sadly, not all the designs have been recreated as finely as the originals -
technology and time move on and what was expensive way back in the 1930s is
almost unaffordable in the 1990s - but all have something of the original
spirit. Pictured here are some of the first pieces from the new Heritage
Collection, to be available in mid-March from Dunhill, 30 Duke Street, St.
James's, London, SW1Y 6DL and branches.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Fashion: Cashmere is fine, but musk ox was the royal choice
 -Daniel Green explores exotic and luxurious types of woollen fabrics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FED UP with cashmere? Too affluent for angora? Try guanaco or musk ox for
some really decadent clothing.
The world's woollens specialists can supply some of the most exotic fabrics
around, if only their customers knew it. For many, cashmere will always be
king. But alpaca can feel almost as good at a fraction of the price.
Cashmere weavers, who would not be seen dead in yak, yearn for vicuna.
But how to navigate about the arcane world of rare fibres? Here is a quick
tour.
Cashmere is the benchmark for all luxury fibres. Connoisseurs seek out white
and pastel coloured clothes because only the highest grades of fibre from
the best Inner Mongolian cashmere goats are pale enough. Poorer, darker,
produce from Afghanistan, Iran or Australasia is made into darker clothes.
Prices of all grades have halved since 1989 and are now back to the levels
of the early 1980s. Sweaters are widely available starting at less than
Pounds 100. Daks Simpson sells a Pounds 699 men's jacket and Aquascutum has
a ladies' coat at Pounds 1,100. For an unusual variation, Sogo on Piccadilly
Circus is stocking a Pounds 395 blazer of wool, cashmere and silver fox.
Harrods has men's cashmere suits at Pounds 1,750.
Mohair comes from the Angora goat and should not be confused with angora
rabbit hair. It is light, warm and soft but a little coarser and stiffer
than cashmere and is easily creased. Lightweight suits are popular in the
Far East. Aquascutum has a ladies' mohair and silk blend sweater at Pounds
245. Chester Barrie has a mohair and wool mix men's suit at Pounds 575. Pure
Mohair suits cost from Pounds 1,200 in Savile Row.
Angora is a rabbit hair fabric that has been out of fashion since the
mid-1980s. Nevertheless, it is soft enough to be an alternative to cashmere
and can be much cheaper. The best comes from Germany, Austria and Japan
where it is popular for thermal underwear. Sweaters cost from Pounds 50 and
Chester Barrie has a men's coat at Pounds 995 - Harrods priced them at
Pounds 595 in its sale and sold out within a week.
Camel hair has a poor image in most of Europe and Japan but competes with
cashmere in the US and Italy. Look out for kid camel hair from Italy. Do not
expect to pick up bargains in the Middle East: the camels required are the
two-humped Bactrian variety from central Asia. Daks Simpson sells a men's
jacket at Pounds 699 and John N Kent in Stafford Street sells an overcoat at
around Pounds 1,200. An Aquascutum classic ladies' coat costs Pounds 749.
Alpaca fibre is the biggest seller from the llama family of the South
American Andes. In terms of fineness it compares with camel hair, yet the
wholesale price is about the same as top sheep's wool. The best comes form
the suri alpaca rather than the huacaya. There is a men's overcoat at Pounds
549 from Daks Simpson and a ladies' swing coat from Aquascutum at Pounds
850.
Vicuna is one of the rarest of all fine fabrics and is widely regarded as a
cashmere-beater. The vicuna is a relative of the llama, but poaching has
decimated wild herds and the remaining creatures are protected. Pure vicuna
garments probably originate from the black market, and legal stocks are
being eked out by blending with cashmere. The cloth, if available, sells at
more than Pounds 1,500 a metre in London but Japan is the main market, where
a pure vicuna men's coat would sell for at least Pounds 6,000. A blended
overcoat in Japan retails at Pounds 2,500.
Guanaco is also a member of the llama family. Some are reared in Wales,
although Argentina produces a higher-quality raw material. It is slightly
finer than cashmere and costs 25-30 per cent more.
Cashgora is an Australasian cross between cashmere and angora goats.
Cashgora is not as soft as cashmere but its fibres are longer and stronger.
It is typically about 20 per cent cheaper than cashmere but lack of customer
awareness means that sales have yet to take off. Germans put it in luxury
blankets and Sogo sells a sweater for Pounds 140 and Aquascutum has a
ladies' coat at Pounds 545.
Yak hair comes from the Himalayas and is rare and fine enough to challenge
the lower grades of cashmere. Unfortunately, each 350kg yak moults a mere
100g of hair a year and the material is most likely to be found blended with
other fibres in overcoats in the US.
Musk ox was once worn by George V and is said to be finer than either vicuna
or cashmere. In 1989, Lyle and Scott of Scotland made 72 musk ox sweaters
and sold them for Pounds 500 each, mostly in Japan. One of the few reliable
sources today is Oomingmak Musk Ox Producers' Co-operative, 64 H Street,
Anchorage, Alaska 99501. Tel 0101-907-272-9225. Hats, scarves and tunics
knitted by native Alaskans cost between Dollars 65 (Pounds 43) and Dollars
385, mail order.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Fashion: Designer dweeb names the guilty - The cynicism of
shop assistants stops Michael Thompson-Noel looking lean and virile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOMAS Mann said: dress like a bourgeois, think like a revolutionary. My
trouble is that I dress like a dweeb, which tends to have a numbing effect
on most of the cerebral cortex. Fashionwise - or even merely clotheswise - I
am dead from the neck down.
How did this come about? It is not that I do not care, for I cringe with
embarrassment every time I see a reflection of myself scuttling past shop
windows or find myself, in restaurants, steered towards the table by the
door.
It is not that I lack imagination. In my mind's eye I see myself as tall and
lean and virile - just like Zoltan Solymosi, a dancer with the Royal Ballet,
who featured, with Darcey Bussell, in a recent issue of Vanity Fair.
In one of the photographs Solymosi wore a Daks dinner suit with a black
polo-neck sweater. I could wear them easily. I could even wear the tartan
sequinned evening jacket and black lycra bodysuit that Darcey Bussell was
modelling.
It is not that I lack the money. I am not awash in funds: 45.6 per cent of
my net salary goes in mortgage payments to the chairman of Abbey National,
to keep him sleek and plump. But I could afford some stylish clothes if I
would only visit the stores.
It is not that I lack taste. Nor that I do not travel, or stay in posh
hotels. Nor - as you mention it - am I as thick as two short planks and
somehow unaware that women look more kindly on men like Zoltan Solymosi,
with his nice shoes and waistcoats and expensively-kept hair, than they do
on men like me.
Some of the soup stains on my ties have soup stains of their own. Neither of
my suits fits. I take refuge in blazers. Most of my sweaters are gross. My
shoes pinch.
Whom do I blame for the state of my wardrobe? Answer: the retailers. Reason:
their cynicism and shortsightedness in employing shop assistants who have
sold me, over the years, clothes that neither fit nor suit me. Is stupidity
a job requirement for people who work in retailing?
I counted my clothes this week. I only own two suits (one from Gieves &amp;
Hawkes, bought in a sale, which needs major surgery and should never have
been sold to me); two blazers; one sports jacket; 10 peculiar pairs of
trousers; one French-made blouson (the only decent thing I own); one hideous
linen safari jacket (Simpson of Piccadilly: they should have refused to let
me near it, let alone take it home); one tatty raincoat; no overcoat at all;
one dinner suit; 20 shirts (only two from Jermyn Street); an idiot's
collection of ties; three pairs of shoes; seven mothy sweaters and a
disreputable collection of T-shirts and Bermuda shorts.
I hate shopping for clothes. In my experience, shop assistants are either
sneeringly superior or too bored or lazy to offer appropriate help or
advice. It has to be dragged out of them. They think that their role is to
flog me duff clothes with minimum expenditure of time or energy. I blame
their bosses. (I blame myself a bit, but not as much as the bosses).
The only time I was sent packing was by an Austin Reed salesman. It was
winter. I needed some shoes in a hurry. The salesman studied my feet, then
rolled his eyes despairingly. He said: 'You have extremely narrow feet, Sir.
I couldn't begin to help. There is nothing in the store - nor at any of our
branches - that could fit such narrow feet. You need specialist advice, Sir.
I expect I could find an address, but it may not be in London. You may have
to make a rail journey.'
He was off his head, of course. I do not have narrow feet. He probably had a
hangover - just wanted to get rid of me. But if more sales assistants were
more honest more often, I would accumulate fewer unsuitable clothes. I would
not hate shopping. As a result, I would shop more frequently and spend the
money necessary to keep my wardrobe up-to-date. Because they do not train
their staff properly, clothes retailers must be cheating themselves of
millions in lost turnover.
If they raised their game, I might even become interested in fashion. Roll
over Zoltan Solymosi; hello Darcey Bussell.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Fashion: Snails and frogs now talk the international power
language
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOTIF tie has become the power neckwear of the 1990s. Gone are the staid
spots, stripes and old school colours; today's high-flyer is wearing a tie
decorated with the unlikely power symbols of owls or rabbits, tea-cups or
palm trees.
For some years, the classic Hermes tie has been the ultimate executive
neckwear, outclassing school and regimental ties with its international
chic. The chains, ropes, stirrups and anchors of upper-class sporting
pursuits were intertwined across the tie in an intricate pattern. And this
interlocking style became an international classic, copied by tie
manufacturers everywhere.
But then, to its traditional themes, Hermes added some audacious designs.
From a distance, these ties appear to be just another intertwined or
repeated pattern. But to the wearer, or a close observer, it is something
far more interesting - the interwoven motif is of an animal, a playful image
which subverts the formality of boardroom dressing with its whimsy.
Hermes began decorating ties with images of elephants, frogs and even
snails. While traditionalists, such as the Prince of Wales and the Duke of
Westminster, have remained true to the original patterns, individualists
such as Sir Tim Bell, Baroness Thatcher's former public relations guru,
Robert Sangster, the race-horse owner, and Sir David Frost, the television
personality, shifted their allegiance to the animal motifs.
Hermes believes that motif ties are bought by confident men, those with
sufficient power or individuality to break with tradition.
Now, every upmarket label is producing motif ties.
Some call them pictorials, others call them character ties, but the fashion
has taken off, as each company tries to create distinctive designs which
combine individuality, wit and elegance.
The boardroom tie market is an important one, and not just in terms of
design. Hermes has claimed to sell around 800,000 ties a year
internationally at Pounds 59 a time. Even a share of that market is
significant.
The competing labels are making an impact. Paul Karvandi, a senior trader at
Paribas, for instance, has noted that the monopoly of the Hermes label is
being eroded. 'People are wearing motif ties widely,' he agrees, 'but not
always the ones by Hermes. That's particularly true of younger City types,
people who started out in the '80s and don't feel tied to tradition in quite
the same way as the older executives.
'Quite often, their ties will be from the other houses, who have taken the
motif and worked it into a more elegant design. There's a lot of choice out
there and there's room for individualism.'
The more closely interwoven the motifs, the more conservative the tie
initially appears; the more scattered and separated the motifs, the more
adventurous the wearer. Some designs retain obvious class associations, with
images of horses, bugles and vintage cars.
But at the more daring end of the spectrum, there are teacups, skiers,
zebras, golfers, bon-bons and gramophones; a wealth of amusing images.
Hermes says, naturally, that the copies are the biggest form of flattery.
But each label has its own distinct interpretation of the original idea. And
motifs come in many moods - they can be witty, graceful, restrained, bold,
continental or British - somewhere in that range must be something for
almost everyone.
Hermes
The original and the most expensive (Pounds 59), the variety and depth of
its colours remains unrivalled. Its witty designs are still immediately
recognisable, but that has been achieved at the cost of sticking to its
original look. Hermes still concentrates on its trademark animals; frogs,
pelicans, dolphins, seals and fish are current favourites, although recent
motifs have also included clouds and tugboats. The most successful, and the
real trendsetter, was an owl motif as sported by Sir Tim Bell.
Ferragamo
It was Ferragamo which really declared motif war. In a series of full-page
tie advertisements last year, it went head-to-head with Hermes, and many
felt that the Italian label's distinctive, clever little figures and deeper
colours surpassed the blunter designs of the French.
Ferragamo ties (Pounds 49) feature mainly people - minstrels, musicians,
knights - with an historical feel, and the actual motifs are now growing
into tiny narrative pictures reminiscent of willow pattern. Colours are
rich, even featuring browns and purples.
Dunhill
Dunhill only entered the motif-market last season. It has tried to capture a
particularly playful, English feel. Tea cups, playing cards and music staves
featured in its first collection, and themes from English country life will
play across the next. Uniquely, it uses Royal College of Art fabric design
students, unrestrained by commercial conservatism, to provide ideas; a
sea-monster design was the result of this collaboration. While retaining its
other, classic tie designs, Dunhill is committed to both wit and vibrant
colour across its pictorial ranges (Pounds 49).
Gucci
There is a small room in Gucci's Bond Street shop in London entirely devoted
to ties, and nowhere is the revival of the label's design sense more
evident. In linked motifs, its graphic interpretations of skiers, gazelles
and striding men have grace and flair. In scattered motifs, its dice,
falling leaves and porcelain cups are clever and elegant.
With dozens of rich and subtle patterns, it seems that in certain circles
Gucci is nowadays considered the most sophisticated motif ties around
(Pounds 55).
TM Lewin
Restraint is the keynote of Jermyn Street style, and that is reflected in
the designs at TM Lewin. It is known for the most competitively priced
shirts on the street, and its motif ties are also very reasonably priced. At
Pounds 24 it has golfers, drums and bugles, and palm trees, at Pounds 20
knights on horseback and, most attractive of all, gramophones.
Hilditch &amp; Key
Each Hilditch &amp; Key design is available in muted colours. It has a much
smaller range (Pounds 29.95, Pounds 24.95 at sale prices), on lighter weight
ties. Its scattered golfers, parcels, cars and bon-bons are only available
on two backgrounds - a somewhat brash scarlet, but also a very effective
black, which sets off the motifs nicely.
Charles Tyrwhitt
The mail order-only shirtmaker Charles Tyrwhitt (telephone 0252-860940 for a
catalogue) has character designs in rich colours in the Hermes style;
golfers and polo players, elephants and parrots, and Sir David Steel's
favourite, chess knights (Pounds 24.50).

FT  06 FEB 93 / Sport: Farmer who thinks he's on a winner - Point-to-Point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BERNARD Heffernan is a punter and horseman of greater than average courage.
This middle-aged Dartmoor farmer has wagered nearly Pounds 20,000 on his
prospects of becoming the champion 1993 point-to-point jockey. Should he
win, Heffernan stands to collect nearly Pounds 750,000.
'I think the bookies should have a kind word said about them,' said
Heffernan as we drank tea at his kitchen table. 'If it wasn't for them, this
whole game wouldn't be on.'
If it was not for the spirit of Heffernan and others like him,
point-to-point would not be enjoying a boom. As the season starts, the
economic clouds over Flat racing and National Hunt seem to have missed
point-to-point. The 1993 fixture list is longer than ever, includes Sunday
racing for the first time, and looks likely to have more runners than ever
before.
In 1992 there were 12,715 runners in point-to-point, compared with a
previous record of 12,549 in 1988. There were 1,407 races last year, the
previous record was 1,293 in 1989. The 202 meetings held in 1992 were the
most for 30 years but, if the weather smiles, there will be 205 this season.
Rural simplicity gives point-to-point its charm. Every horse must have been
subjected regularly to the muddy rough-and-tumble of a local hunt. No
highly-strung thoroughbred darlings need apply. The usual course is over the
land of a sympathetic farmer, although some hunts do use steeplechase
courses. Races average three miles; ferociously long by the standards of the
Flat. Point-to-point is also dangerous and there are many accidents to both
horse and rider.
In the car parks, Range Rovers and filthy farm Land Rovers stand side by
side. Horses and riders mingle with the crowd. Pints of beer and pork pies
are far more in evidence than smart picnics - if only because the weather
often is foul. The only common ground is a love of horses - something not
always found on professional tracks.
Heffernan is aiming for 100 rides on just over 30 race days. A wall of his
sitting room is covered with a chart listing dates, meetings and horses.
Almost all of his rides will be on his own animals. Stabled around the muddy
farmyard are 20 hunters and former racehorses collected as part of this
audacious bid. 'I only rides my own,' he says with a thick Devon burr. 'At
my age, you don't want to risk getting up on other people's rubbish.'
The most famous of the string is Yahoo, runner-up to Desert Orchid in the
heart-stopping 1989 Cheltenham Gold Cup. 'They say he's too old but us old
boys got to stick together,' says Heffernan. 'His job is racing. You
couldn't just turn him out in a field. Getting into point-to-point has given
him a new lease of life.'
That might also be true of the owner. Three years ago, Heffernan had never
raced a horse, although he is a lifelong amateur show-jumper and hunts with
the East Cornwall. Last year, he had his first winner - followed by five
more - and eight seconds, and took the Woodhouse Trophy as point-to-point's
leading owner-rider.
'I don't see myself taking on Scudamore (National Hunt's top jockey) but on
the amateur circuit I'm entitled to my bit of fun,' he asserts. 'I'm a doer.
Can't be bothered with watching. There's so much enthusiasm and friendliness
in point-to-point, it's a fun thing.' Public and participants obviously
agree. Although racing generally is stricken and attendances are falling,
point-to-point expects record crowds.
Some say the big boys, sheltering from the financial problems of National
Hunt, are using the amateur world of point-to-point to keep their hand in
and their horses visible. Alternatively, with the continuing bad prices at
horse sales, perhaps breeders are holding on to animals and giving them a
run or two in point-to-point, hoping that a win might make them attractive
when life returns to the market. But perhaps the open, almost naive,
camaraderie of the 'pointers' is infectious.
After news of Heffernan's bet trickled out, his 'phone scarcely stopped
ringing. Even arch-rival Robert Alner, a Dorset farmer and last year's
champion, called to ask how things were going. Trainer Stan Mellor has
offered Heffernan tuition, but he is not sure if that would be fair.
Alner had 31 winners in 66 rides in 1992 and the bookies have him at 4-1 to
repeat the feat. The odds on Heffernan have closed to 10-1 since he placed
his own bets last summer.
How does he rate his chances? 'The biggest thing is me staying sound,' he
laughs. 'You can get another horse but if you lose the jockey youm
buggered.'
A team of six works on the Heffernan string. The farm has its own gallops
and the horses - bought for an average of Pounds 2,000 each - work out each
morning on the spectacular expanses of Dartmoor outside the front gate.
Heffernan's wife Denise, also a race rider, is putting nearly as much into
this effort as he is.
'I don't consider this a gamble,' Heffernan says, but his Devon accent
vanishes momentarily - perhaps a sign of a leg-pull. 'It's an investment in
our ability to produce a first-class animal. I just hope the whole bloody
thing stays fun. I want the public to come and say, 'Have a go, Joe'. I'm
nothing special.'

FT  06 FEB 93 / Sport: When every tackle is a culture clash - Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MY FRIEND Dai is a rational sort of chap. He lives near Birmingham (well, no
one is perfect) and writes calmly and only occasionally irascibly about
golf. There is nothing to suggest he has rabid tendencies. Yet, this man is
metamorphosed on occasions such as today when Wales are playing rugby
against England.
A couple of years ago, we were in Jacksonville, Florida, on the day Wales
faced England. In the early evening, Dai returned from telephoning home with
a smile as large as his stomach (which was, and is, ample). 'We stuffed 'em,
12-9,' he said. It did not matter that it was a rotten game. The only
important thing was that the men in red had won.
England versus Wales is, indeed, like no other rugby match. Wales against
Ireland is a meeting of (fairly) like-minded Celts. Scotland against France
has its own particular appeal, notably because the Scots have never won at
the Parc des Princes in Paris (or beaten France in Paris since 1969, for
that matter). But England v Wales has an edge that is sporting and
sociological, physical and political.
'Forget the All Blacks, the Wallabies, and the Springboks,' said David
Watkins, the former Wales and British Lions international. 'It's beating
England, the oppressors, that fires the imagination of every Welshman.'
In my view, the Welsh and the English are like the French and the English.
They are not meant to co-exist, and it is unfortunate that the two countries
are in such close proximity. One can sing, the other cannot. One can play
cricket, the other cannot. One owned the mines and the steel works, the
other worked in them. One bred sheep, the other stole them. One supplies the
water, the other drinks it.
Character and temperament are two differences that mark out the Welsh from
the English. Language is a third; Gareth Edwards and Barry John used to
confuse opponents by talking to one another in Welsh.
George Ewart wrote in The Strength of the Hills: 'No one can understand the
seriousness that is paid to rugby in Wales unless he views it as a social
and political affirmation of its nationhood. For a nation that has existed
for many years as subject to a more powerful one, it is the sheet anchor of
its self-respect.'
You need only a slight grasp of history to be aware of the sense of
injustice the Welsh can summon up against the English - and do, regularly.
Before the game in Cardiff in 1977, skipper Phil Bennett is said in his team
talk to have dwelled on every sociological and political slight delivered to
the Welsh by the English.
'They have taken our coal, our water, our steel. They buy our houses and
they only live in them for a fortnight every 12 months. What have they given
us? Absolutely nothing. We've been exploited, raped, controlled and punished
by the English - and that's who you are playing this afternoon.' (Wales won,
14-9).
In speech, England and Wales are two nations divided by a common language.
In England, the game is often known as rugger. In Wales, it is rugby - and
you will be laughed out of a pub if you start talking about rugger.
In literature, the difference is striking. England's rugby heroes are
described as if they are Greek gods. Of Ronnie Poulton-Palmer, it once was
written: 'The wondrous Poulton, the fleet and flaxen, a golden-haired Apollo
who stood as a symbol of the heart of England.' By comparison, the Rev Frank
Marshall damned with faint praise when he described Arthur Gould, of Wales,
a truly great player and one far superior to Poulton-Palmer, as: 'The
greatest centre three-quarter that has ever played.'
In their book Rugger, published in 1927, former England internationals
Wavell Wakefield and HP Marshall wrote: 'A man who plays (rugby) must be
ready to give and take hard knocks, but he will take and give them with a
grin. He will need courage and determination and a sense of humour, and he
must learn the meaning of unselfishness.'
Contrast that with this passage by Richard Llewellyn in How Green Was My
Valley, published only a few years later: 'But Cyfartha is like a
fisherman's net. The fly-half has been too clever and wants the try himself,
and on he goes, tries to sell a dummy, and how the crowd is laughing, for to
sell a dummy to Cyfartha is to sell poison to a Borgia.'
In spite of the two countries' differences, one date has considerable
significance for both: June 8 1987 when Wales beat England 16-3 in Brisbane,
Australia, in a quarter-final of the first World Cup. I think that was the
worst result for Wales and the best thing to have happened to England. The
Welsh reaction was to gloat - again proving themselves superior to their
oldest and bitterest rivals. The reality was that this victory covered
serious deficiencies. What was wrong quickly became apparent, and Wales
entered a trough comparable to that between 1923 and 1930 when they won only
nine of 32 games.
England, by contrast, began a recovery programme that has made them one of
the three leading nations in world rugby. In their past three meetings with
Wales, the English have scored 83 points, the Welsh only 12.
'Wales is proud of this victory. Welsh peers and labourers - with all the
intervening stratas of society - were united in acclaiming and cheering the
Welsh team. It was . . . a victory for Wales that probably is impossible in
any other sphere.' So wrote the Western Mail, the national daily newspaper,
the morning after Wales had defeated the 1935 All Blacks 13-12 at the Arms
Park. The same might be said if the Welsh win at Cardiff this afternoon.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Motoring: And now the one-box vehicle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE developing fashion for multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs) is anything to
go by, the family car of the future will be box-shaped. It would be
sensible. A car with neither bonnet nor boot takes up less road space than a
'three-box' saloon or 'two-box' hatchback or estate. And, logically, there
is no reason why the engine should be up front, where the horse used to be
before the horseless carriage came along.
More than 40 years ago, Volkswagen's Microbus - the first MPV - had the
engine tucked away at the back. Renault's Espace, the first MPV to be bought
because it was smart as well as practical, has a normal front-wheel drive
power pack, but that is inside the body and under the sharply-sloped
windscreen.
Toyota took the bold step of burying the engine of its rear-wheel driven
Previa MPV under the floor. Why not? All routine checks can be made simply
by lifting the grille. And no one tinkers with electronically-managed
engines any more, if they are wise.
The latest MPV to reach Britain is Nissan's Spanish-built Serena. At first
sight, I thought it looked like a cross between one of those Italian hearses
with chromium-plated cherubs on each corner and a dignified, 1930-ish
English limousine. When I swung up into the high seat behind the wheel, it
felt decidedly van-like. But the more I drove it, the more I liked it.
Building a vehicle as tall as this gives it an enormous amount of interior
space. Passengers sit high enough to peer over hedgerows. The driver's view
of the road is so commanding that I found the Serena ideal transport in the
crowded West End of London.
There is hardly any bonnet - the engine is mounted further back than usual -
and no rear overhang at all. Combined with very light power-assisted
steering, this makes the Serena easier to park than a conventional car of
similar size.
The top-of-the-range SGX model I used had a British-made, 126-horsepower,
16-valve, two-litre engine driving the back wheels though a pleasant,
five-speed gearbox. Fairly low overall gearing made it flexible in town,
lively when accelerating up to 60 mph (97 kmh), and good at romping up hills
in top or fourth gears, even loaded.
It takes time to reach 80 mph (128 kmh) but holds it on an autoroute without
sounding frantic. On a windy day - or when overtaking speeding container
lorries - you are aware it has higher sides than a car.
There are seven Serena variants offering four or five doors (including the
huge tailgate); six, seven or eight seats; and 1.6 or two-litre petrol
engines plus a two-litre diesel. The one I drove had six separate and
plumply comfortable seats, two normal front doors, and a single sliding door
on the near side.
Having six seats is useful, but only when the rear pair are folded away is
there a large amount of luggage space. One of the optional layouts with
seven seats (converting to five with a vast boot) would be more useful to a
family with three children and a dog who do not want to travel long
distances with all the luggage on the roof.
Prices range from Pounds 12,950 for the 1.6-litre LX to Pounds 17,750 for
the two-litre SGX which comes with ABS brakes, two power-operated sun-roofs
and air-conditioning as standard.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Travel: Just don't mention Crusaders - Emma Tucker upsets a
film crew but still feels relaxed in Syria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WHY DID you decide to come to Syria this winter?'
'Because I thought it would be interesting to spend Christmas in a Moslem
country.'
Ahmed, our guide, looks uncomfortable, then translates into the microphone.
'Cut]'
The strong television light clicks off, the microphone is lowered and Ahmed
sighs.
'This is a free country,' he shrugs. 'You are not supposed to talk about
religion.'
The Syrian TV news crew that has sought us out in the ice-cold bar of a
hotel in Latakia is ready to try again.
'Why did you decide to come to Syria this winter?'
'There are many beautiful sites in Syria,' I say cautiously, 'and I've
always wanted to visit the Crusader castles.'
'Cut]'
We go through the same sequence. 'No crusaders,' says Ahmed while the other
travellers in the bar, now high on the local aniseed arak, fall about
laughing.
Eventually we come up with a suitable response. 'Syria is a beautiful
country; there are many beautiful things to see and the Syrians are very
friendly people.' None of this I would dispute: it just isn't my idea of an
interesting answer.
Six days later, in the hotel Zenobia at Palmyra, we watch the result. I
appear after a string of singing children and a floating love-heart from
which Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian president, waves benignly.
Only Ahmed is upset. His wife, at home in Damascus, had hired two video
cassette recorders to capture his moment of glory, but he is cut out of the
film and another, female, voice is used for the translation into Arabic.
In Palmyra it is even colder than in Latakia. Outside, snow drifts around
the columns lining the great colonnade of the ancient oasis city. The
Zenobia hotel, built inside the ruins, looks out across the Temple of Bel
with its massive courtyard and sacrificial altar.
Palmyra, which dates from the 2nd century AD, is the highlight of any trip
to Syria. The spectacular remains of the city and its funerary towers are
all the more impressive because Tadmor, as the Syrians call it, after the
Arabic for date, is in the middle of nowhere, at the very end of the
anti-Lebanon mountains, 150km from the River Orontes in the west and 200km
from the Euphrates in the east.
But then most historic sites in Syria are deserted. Many of the places we
visited were empty, apart from in and around Damascus where busloads of
Iranians swarmed around Shi'a shrines. At the Omayyed mosque in Damascus
they were gathered beneath the Dome of the Eagle, the women weeping loudly
as an Iranian imam, swearing revenge on the Sunnis, recounted the split in
Islam. Never mind that most Syrians are Sunnis - they did not appear to
mind. The 2,000 or so Iranians that visit every week go home laden with the
imported electrical goods now swelling Syria's shops.
At Crac des Chevaliers, the most picture-book of the Crusader castles, there
was a party of German visitors. But further up the coast, at the castles of
Sahyun and Qalaat Marqab, old men had to be roused to open the doors for us.
Much of the time we could have been in Scotland. Fog and drizzle masked Crac
so that the bus almost crashed into its daunting outer wall. Inside, mist
rolled out of doorways and around the ramparts like special effects for a
hammy stage set. But at Sahyun, a prettier, airier castle built by the
Arabs, the sun came out to light eucalyptus-lined paths and views across
Syria's only forests.
'You are welcome in Syria,' said the man who opened the door, warming
himself at an oil stove. We heard the same words everywhere we went, whether
from the stall holders in the souk at Aleppo, a flamboyantly moustachioed
singer at a nightclub in Damascus, or the Syrian orthodox priest in
Malullah, a mountain village where Aramaic is still spoken. At the national
museum in Damascus a guardian sidled up to thrust a pocketful of fat, sweet
raisins into my hand. Never, on any travels, had I felt more at ease than I
did during my two weeks in Syria.
Accommodation was cheap, food and transport even cheaper. At the Aleppo souk
you can buy silver jewellery cheaply and easily. The cosy atmosphere of the
packed alleyways was heightened by daily power cuts - Syrians blamed the
Turks for building a damn on the Euphrates, but cynics told us that the
government was selling the power to Jordan to earn foreign currency.
At some stalls generators grumbled into life, but in most the owners turned
on oil lamps and lit braziers to keep business going into the evening.
On Christmas Day we stopped at the ruins of a Byzantine monastery high up in
a Druze village. Hundreds of brightly clothed children with blue lips and
finger tips gathered to watch us eat humous and boiled eggs on the floor of
a villager's house.
In the evening, in Aleppo, we toured the churches. The Armenian church was
closed, but around the corner a Catholic cathedral was packed with wealthy
Syrians.
It will not be long before someone brings out a satisfactory, up-to-date
guidebook to the country. There is much to be discovered in Syria, and
precious few tourists to get in the way.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Travel: Night walks in winter - Practical Traveller
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGELA WIGGLESWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MY FIRST experience of winter walking was in the mountains above the small
Swiss town of Lenzerheide, 17 kilometres south of Chur, where the tourist
office has produced a map of the 35km of forest paths kept open during
winter months. The sun shone and the air was crisp.
The only sound was our own footsteps. There were stops for hot chocolate in
mountain cafes and, in the evenings, the spectacle of 'full moon skiing' -
instructors skiing down the mountains carrying flaming torches.
Several companies are offering UK winter walking holidays. Some, involving
small groups, offer guides; others allow you to walk independently but have
accommodation arranged.
Acorn Activities (tel: 0432-357335), in Hereford, offers guided walks in the
Wye valley and the Black mountains. Prices vary according to farmhouse or
hotel accommodation.
Alternative Cornish Holidays (tel: 0841-540147) runs independent walking
holidays along the north Cornish coast from Bude to Bedruthan Steps, where
huge breakers come crashing up the wide beaches (Pounds 255 a week).
Several local councils have produced books listing guided walks in their
areas. Some of the walks are free, for others you pay a charge of Pounds 1
or Pounds 2. Exploring Sussex (Pounds 1), for example, from East Sussex
County Council (tel: 0273-481654) lists 336 circular weekday and weekend
walks and cycle rides.
For those who like to walk on their own and return to the comfort of a
luxury country house hotel and a gourmet meal, there is Congham Hall, a
Georgian manor house near Kings Lynn, Norfolk (0485-600250). Maps for local
walks are supplied and the owners are happy to pick up exhausted walkers at
the end of the day and return them to the same spot the next.
The 17th century, 15-bedroomed Cotswold House Hotel in Chipping Campden
(0386-84033) has the Cotswold Way (90 miles to Bath) starting on its
doorstep. And Seckford Hall at Woodbridge in Suffolk (0394-785678), where
Queen Elizabeth I is said to have held court, has beautiful panelled rooms,
low-beamed ceilings, carved doors and a swimming pool in a courtyard barn.
Further afield, Explore (0252-319448) takes walkers to the Taurus mountains
and the Berber villages of Morocco; the Ramblers Association (0707-331133)
visits Madeira, the Himalayas and the Hawaiian islands; and you can explore
Argentina with Waymark Holidays (0753-516477).
If you fancy walking by night rather than day, Bavaria has the answer: take
a guided walk in the snow with torches to light the way and mulled wine at
the end of the journey. Details from the German Tourist Office
(071-495-3990).

FT  06 FEB 93 / Travel: Where the Buddha's image takes shape - Justin Wintle
discovers one man's Thai treasure trove
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUSTIN WINTLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN Phitsanulok, a crossroads town 375 kilometres north of Bangkok, on the
periphery of the mighty Menam basin, I had the good fortune to meet
Sergeant-Major Dr Thawi-Pim Buranakhet, owner of the Buranathai Buddha Image
Foundry. This came about because I had the good sense to visit the Sgt-Major
Dr Thawi-Pim Buranakhet Folklore Museum, on the opposite side of the
Wisutkasat Road.
Sgt-Major Dr Thawi-Pim Buranakhet, one might say, is a man of many hats. He
is also, given his many achievements and his status of national cultural
treasure (human category), astonishingly modest.
The museum, opened in 1982, is an old(ish) wooden house with just
half-a-dozen rooms, although the 4,000-piece collection will soon be
transferred to a modern purpose-designed concrete job which Thawi-Pim is
funding from his own pocket and which will be opened to the public free of
charge.
It contains a wide variety of artefacts, including cooking utensils, clay
pots, ceramics, handmade toys, simple weaving looms, puppets and, a little
incongruously, an array of rusting phonographs. But the room Thawi-Pim takes
most pride in is the room full of traps and snares, each designed for its
specific prey and usually constructed out of bamboo.
There is a bamboo funnel for placing over snake-holes, which the snake
cannot wriggle out of; a bamboo pot that cockroaches fall into, prior to
being boiled, and a very nasty iron thing for putting paid to porcupines.
There is also a simple anti-ant device to thread on the hanging strings of
cooking pots.
How each of these contraptions works Thawi-Pim demonstrated with skill and
measured glee. For some reason I was reminded of Q in the James Bond films,
and his infernal instruments. The difference, though, lay not so much in the
degree of ingenuity, which was controlled by the required task, but by the
laboratory conditions in which Thawi-Pim's gadgets had been created, for
they were all machines he had found in jungle villages.
He told me that the collection represents a lifetime's search for the
homespun expedients that Thawi-Pim believes embody the spirit and creative
heritage of Thailand's peasantry - a heritage evolved over many centuries
and now threatened by the spread of mechanisation. It is his aim, he said,
to save what can be preserved of forgotten ancestors.
Thawi-Pim was born into a poor family deep in the forests of Phitsanulok
province. As a child, one of 12, he had to learn to hunt and forage. His
farmer father, however, was also a painter, and from him Thawi-Pim acquired
the rudiments of sculpture and drawing. When he joined the army, his
commanding officer became aware of his talent and arranged for him to go to
college.
That education was eventually put to use across the road. When Thawi-Pim
quit the military he began a Buddha image-making factory, now the largest
and probably most respected in Thailand. His inspiration was the great
Chinnarat Buddha, at the Mahathat Temple in Phitsanulok, a hugely venerated,
somewhat austere bronze statue cast in 1357. In 1984 Thawi-Pim was awarded
an honorary PhD by the local university.
The foundry consists of a cluster of sheds in which the several stages of
Buddha-making are carried out. With Thawi-Pim's help, I was inducted in the
process. Each image is first modelled, under the Sgt-Major's supervision, in
a dull maroon beeswax mixed with animal fats or coconut oil and tree resins.
The model is then covered with a mixture of clay, sand and water to form the
cast, and left to dry in the sun. Next, the encased image is oven-baked.
After the re-usable wax has run out, the cast is left to cool before being
fired in a kiln for 12 hours. It is now ready to be filled with molten
bronze.
Again, the ensemble is left to cool before the cast is chipped off. But the
resultant statuette is nowhere near finished. Instead, it must be
laboriously filed down and sometimes beaten. It is at this stage that much
of the fine ornamentation is added, either with a chisel or from pre-moulded
parts - such as the flame of enlightenment that adorns the top of the
Buddha's head.
Even so, the surfaces are not yet smooth enough. To achieve the desired
finish, red and black lacquers are carefully painted on. Finally, the whole
is dressed in gold-leaf. Only then is the image ready to be transported to a
temple, where, in a ceremony that involves breaking lacquer seals added over
the eyes, it will be blessed by saffron-robed monks.
Each image takes up to a month to complete. Depending on the state of its
order books, Thawi-Pim's foundry, employing 25 skilled craftspeople,
produces between 100 and 300 a month. The average size, costing Dollars
1,200, is around 2ft high, with a pyramidical base. The largest, made in two
main segments, reaches 12ft, while the smallest, at 4ins, sits comfortably
in the hand. They are commissioned or bought by temples and private
individuals, although Thawi-Pim's most regular customer is the Fourth Army,
stationed on the city's outskirts.
It is a technique that, in its essentials, has remained unchanged since the
middle ages. The Chinnarat Buddha was created by the same process. To watch
it in action is to discover how metallic ores found in rocks can become the
objects of profound devotion - species-specific traps for the human mind.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Travel: Crocodile awareness syndrome - Practical Traveller
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR years ago I spent a couple of days at Nkamba Bay Lodge, by the shore of
Lake Tanganyika, within Zambia's Sumbu national park. I could have gone
fishing. I did go for game walks, escorted by a guide, Olvitti Chasaya, and
his supremely ancient rifle. What I did not attempt, because of the
crocodiles, was to walk near the lake.
The reason I respect crocodiles is my awareness of the number of people
grabbed in recent years by the fearsome estuarine saltwater crocodiles -
'salties' - of northern Australia. Mainly, estuarine crocs range from
southern China and the Malay archipelago to India and Sri Lanka, taking in
Australia, New Guinea, the Philippines and the Solomons. In Papua New Guinea
once I asked a tribal chief what to do if chased by a croc. 'Jump in the
river,' he said brusquely. It is possible he was joking.
For a rundown on crocs, alligators and other animal (and insect) hazards
when travelling in tropical parts, you need the latest edition of The
Tropical Traveller by John Hatt (Penguin, Pounds 6.99).
The writer insists that you should never run from a wild cat. 'Although
terrifying, it is much safer to face them. One acquaintance was charged by a
tiger in Nepal. His guide rushed at the tiger, shouting and yelling. The
tiger retreated.' Other tips:
Buffalo and hippopotamus are far more dangerous than lions. On South
Africa's Natal coast a cow hippo was once seen to plunge into the sea, seize
a 300lb shark from the surf, haul it on to the beach and trample it to
death.
Piranhas' ferocity, on the other hand, is much exaggerated (says Hatt),
though the red-bellied piranha, common in savanna ponds, can inflict
terrible bites. It is likely that most piranha wounds are caused out of
water. Landed piranhas (fishing boat or river bank) flop about and gnash
their teeth.
Sharks: you are in greatest danger when near a wriggling fish, as
spear-fishermen will confirm. Avoid night-time swimming: some of the most
dangerous species, including the tiger shark, come into the shallows at
night.
Good news about snakes: there are no dangerously venomous snakes in Ireland,
Iceland, New Zealand, most of Polynesia and Micronesia, the Galapagos, the
Canaries, Malta, the Orkneys, Shetlands, Madagascar and numerous other
islands. A South African survey showed that 74 per cent of snakebites are
inflicted below the knee, and 67 per cent below the ankle. Lesson: wear
boots and thick trousers. The snake's fangs may penetrate the trousers, but
the amount of venom delivered will be greatly reduced.
Dogs: again, do not run away. Face the dog, look fierce and bend down as if
to pick up a stone. If the dog still threatens, throw a stone at the dog's
(dogs') head(s). Dogs are not only a problem in undeveloped countries. In
the US, more than 1m dog-bites a year require hospital attention.
Mosquitoes: about 1m people a year die of malaria, but mosquitoes also carry
some 80 other diseases. Insect repellants last far longer on material
(clothes, sheets) than on your skin. Many mosquito species like to bite
ankles, so wear socks doused in repellant. 'This may deter mosquitoes more
than you think,' says John Hatt, 'because many of them begin their
investigations as close to the ground as possible.'
Hatt covers a broad range of subject matter: travel preparations, money
(carrying it, keeping hold of it), equipment, flying, health, transport and
accommodation, culture shock and so forth. There is even an index.
I especially liked his disclaimer: 'The author and publisher have tried to
make the advice and information as accurate as possible, but they accept no
responsibility for loss, injury, inconvenience or other liability arising
from any person using this book.'
Another worthwhile paperback, recently updated, is Europe By Train, by Katie
Wood and George McDonald (Fontana, Pounds 7.99). It is packed with
information, some of it otiose, some of it twee, but all of it well
marshalled.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Travel: Gulliver meets an Asian goddess - David Pilling
visits Khatmandu and learns about the rigorous process of selecting a
Kumari, a child worshipped as a living goddess by the Nepalese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAKE one three-year-old girl with the eyelashes of a cow and a neck like a
conch shell. Lead her into a darkened room filled with freshly-severed
buffalo heads. If she remains calm, you may have a goddess on your hands.
The selection process for the Kumari - a prepubescent girl worshipped in
Nepal as a living goddess - is a rigorous affair. Girls must be born into
the goldsmith caste and display 32 characteristics including spiralling
lines on the soles of the feet; long and well-formed toes; cheeks like a
lion; small and well-recessed sexual organs, and a body shaped like a banyan
tree.
Any child so anatomically blessed, one might imagine, would automatically
win the right to be worshipped. Not at all. The contestants are then put
through a trial of bravery, their nerve tested at the dead of night with
bloody animal heads and men in demon masks.
The victorious girl, untroubled by such foolish pranks, must then have her
horoscope scrutinised. Assuming that her astral inheritance does not clash
with that of the king, she is proclaimed a living goddess and taken to a
house in Khatmandu to live out her prepubescent years.
I set off one afternoon in search of this diminutive deity. Flagging down a
cycle rickshaw in Thamel, the part of Khatmandu favoured by budget
travellers, I asked the boyish cyclist to pedal me to the Kumari's palace.
As we creaked and sloshed through the narrow, medieval streets of old
Khatmandu, hot drops of monsoon rain slid from the heavy air. The rickshaw
driver struggled to maintain speed and a patch of perspiration spread
steadily across his back.
Old Khatmandu is like a large city shoehorned into a confined space where
tumbledown brick buildings, as well as people, seem to jostle for position.
Houses, temples and roads have a hunched, bundled, slightly distorted
appearance as though reflected in the back of a spoon. As I rattled by, I
felt positively Gulliverian, thrust into an Asian Lilliput.
The toy-town feel is exacerbated by Khatmandu's architecture, which features
intricately-carved wooden balconies, gilded roofs, cascading multi-tiered
pagodas, Buddhist stupas like inverted ice-cream cones, and doll-house shops
crammed with sacks of spices, household goods and religious paraphernalia.
We progressed through the warren-like streets, forcing a swathe through the
press of people. Many were carrying black umbrellas which they whisked from
our path as the rickshaw rattled by. Eventually we clattered to a halt near
the Kumari's palace. I settled my fare with a dog-eared note and approached
the home of the living goddess.
The imposing gate at the palace threshold was flanked by two shoulder-high
stone lions, painted in primary colours. Just inside was a small anteroom
where a watchman lay asleep in a dusty alcove. Passing into the 18th century
courtyard, I looked up at the decaying copper-coloured brickwork and the
dark wood of the ornate windows. Behind one of these carved marvels, the
living goddess was now hidden.
The Kumari's life is not that of a regular child. Once taken into the palace
she does not emerge again, save for the odd religious festival, until she
becomes 'impure' - either at menstruation, or after bleeding heavily from
the loss of a tooth.
On the rare occasions she leaves the palace, the little goddess's feet must
not touch the ground for fear of pollution, a stipulation that obliges her
to walk on cloth or be carried in a wooden chariot.
The Kumari's daily routine includes sitting patiently on a throne while she
is worshipped by a stream of devotees, playing with her nurse's
grandchildren, and appearing at her window for the benefit of tourists. Her
appearances at the balcony must on no account be photographed.
Once a year the king comes to worship. The Kumari bestows upon him authority
to rule the nation by placing the red tika mark on his forehead. On one
occasion, a rather disobedient little goddess ignored the king and placed
the tika instead on the smooth forehead of his son. The king, needless to
say, died within a few months and power passed to the prince.
The goddess's most riotous time comes during the festival of Bhadra Kumari
when thousands gather in the square outside her house. Three huge chariots,
one for her and two for her male attendants, wait outside. Bands play and
masked dancers leap about.
As the king and queen appear on a balcony opposite, the Kumari emerges
decked from head to toe - not a great distance in a five-year-old - in
fabulous jewellery. A goat is sacrificed on the yoke of her chariot which
then moves off slowly through Khatmandu as guns fire and the king bows in
respect.
The next day, the procession again trundles through the streets, pausing
before a demon-like mask with white fangs and staring red eyes. Beer spews
from the mask's mouth, arching into the crowd and precipitating a frenzied
struggle for the holy liquid. The Kumari, too, partakes.
For one accustomed to being the centre of such grand events, puberty must
come as quite a shock. On this day the young girl's godlike powers desert
her and she must leave the palace forever, never again to be worshipped or
revered.
From being a living deity whose every whim is answered, she is transformed
overnight into a rather awkward teenager with few friends, a rudimentary
education and next to no experience of the world beyond her palace walls.
Former Kumaris receive a state pension, but some ex-goddesses have had
difficulty adapting to the daily slog. Many find it hard to secure a husband
since a Kumari must overcome the widely held belief that any man who marries
her is doomed to an early grave.
I was lost in thought - thinking how strange it was that a few hours in a
jet plane had brought me to a country where such beliefs were common
currency - when I suddenly became aware of movement at the balcony above. I
looked up to see a young and slender woman with a small child in her arms.
It took me a second to realise that this small child was the goddess
herself.
Her tiny body was swathed in red silk and a red bow nestled in her hair. The
goddess's face was painted extravagantly with coal-black makeup which curved
from her piercing eyes to the tips of her ears.
Suddenly she was gone. As she was looking down on me - I was alone in the
courtyard - she had begun to squirm impatiently, evidently on the verge of a
tantrum. Her attendant had quickly whisked her away before she could begin
to cry.
This little girl, who had looked upon bloodied buffalo heads with
equanimity, had reacted to my face with rather less composure. I headed back
to my hotel feeling all-too-mortal, avoiding mirrors all the way.
David Pilling travelled c/o London-based Promotion Nepal (3 Wellington
Terrace, Bayswater Rd, W2 4LW; tel: 071-229-3528) and local operator Temple
Tiger. Nepal has three main attractions: Khatmandu for temples and culture;
the mountains for trekking; and Chitwan national park for tigers. Promotion
Nepal offers tours combining some or all of these elements. For example, the
'Complete Picture' tour incorporates Khatmandu, the classic Annapurna
sanctuary trek and a stay at Chitwan with white-water rafting and an
elephant safari. This 21-day tour starts at Pounds 1,600. More modest trips
begin at around Pounds 1,000. Flights from the UK are with Royal Nepal
Airlines which operates the only direct route to Khatmandu, twice weekly
from Gatwick.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Property: Where white is wrong - A look at Mediterranean
developments that blend into the environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PICTURE of the Mediterranean leisure estate is changing. Fewer
stark-white colonies of second homes are appearing on coastlines and a look
at the latest developments on two Mediterranean islands, the French Corsica
and the Spanish Majorca, is instructive.
On Corsica, you find timber homes merging into the maquis - the scented,
grey-green undergrowth that covers much of the island - but designs are
sophisticated and the wood well-crafted. On Majorca, deep shades of ochre
take the place of the dazzling white walls now out of favour
environmentally.
Unusual shapes take over from the 'boxes' of the past. And standard designs
are altering, with larger properties being included to accommodate European
families whose different generations like to holiday together. Another
change is that the British no longer predominate as buyers - often, it is
the Germans.
The Domaine de Sperone is a rare new development on Corsica. It is a
350-acre private estate on the southern tip of the island where all
properties are clad in Canadian red cedar and stone to blend with the rugged
moorland. There is an 18-hole Robert Trent Jones golf course (to which a
further nine holes may be added) and a sizeable clubhouse with restaurant
and bar.
Work is concentrating on Le Hameau de Piantarella, the village that will be
the centre of the estate. It will have 80 apartments and 11 villas. The
apartments, in low blocks, range from studios to five-room duplexes and are
priced between Pounds 150,000 and Pounds 400,000. About half will be ready
for occupation this spring and will have communal swimming pools.
The villas, from Pounds 320,000 to Pounds 450,000, will have up to five
rooms, linked gardens and private pools. Interiors are light and spacious,
with high ceilings of exposed timber. Floors may be of wood or tiles (but
not the chilling marble of many Mediterranean holiday homes).
With ownership comes a share in the Golf de Sperone company and membership
of the club. And from the hilltop site of the village, there are views down
to the beach and sea and across to neighbouring islands; Sardinia, eight
miles distant, is visible on clear days. When the village is finished, there
may be a few large individual houses available above a lake. The properties
will offer possibilities for renting, too. Jacques Dewez - who heads the
Paris-based developer, the Societe Anonyme du Domaine de Sperone - says: 'We
have a strong demand for this.'
Below the village, a 105-bedroom, four-star hotel with a sea-water therapy
centre is being built. Tennis and wind-surfing are available and there is
unlimited walking in the maquis, while an hour's drive takes keener walkers
into the mountains. For the less adventurous, the little tourist port of
Bonifacio, with its cliff-top walled town, is only 10 minutes away.
While the estate is geared to all-round sportsmen, sailing will be the
attraction for many residents. Bonifacio harbour has 300 deep-water moorings
and there will be facilities for small boats at Sperone.
Those with homes at Sperone already include two French government ministers;
an assortment of French bankers, company chairmen and people in advertising;
a number of Italians; and a few British. Their properties range from
broad-leaved, shingle-roofed, low colonial styles with wide terraces to
tall, rectangular buildings that seem to owe more to commercial than
residential design. With land, pools and other amenities, they will have
cost their owners between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 1.5m.
Dewez, who has a Russian wife and a son who breeds horses in Wales, is a
former pilot who created an international charter company. When this was
bought out by Air France. he moved into property development.
In the south-west corner of Majorca, meanwhile, a partly pine-clad
3,000-acre estate, Santa Ponsa Nova, is being developed for leisure with a
strong emphasis on integrating architecture with landscape. It is being
promoted by IMISA, a subsidiary of Banco de Credito Balear.
There are two 18-hole golf courses, with others planned; three marinas, with
another to be built; a 21-court international tennis centre; a riding
centre, and hotels. Work begins shortly on a beach club and flats.
Two housing developments at Santa Ponsa Nova are offering property on the
British market. They make strong claims for harmony with the environment,
although they approach this in contrasting ways. One is Los Pampanos (young
vine branches), 15 minutes from Palma, Majorca's principal town.
The first phase will comprise 57 apartments in 10 blocks and the first
should be completed by May. It has two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartments from
Pounds 158,300 with larger types from Pounds 213,800. Interiors are equipped
expensively. The properties have broad, room-like terraces, sometimes
L-shaped, looking across to the sea and some have roof-top pools. All come
with a family golf share.
While interiors follow today's up-market pattern, Spanish architect Melvin
Villarroel has allowed his interest in garden architecture a free hand with
the outer scene. All buildings are to be the same terracotta colour: he
believes surrounding greenery will give sufficient variation. And his
pitched roofs are of different heights.
Efforts are made with plastering to avoid sharp angles and even soften the
straight lines of outer walls, while balconies and terraces are of differing
shapes; some walls look as though buttressed. The blocks will be set around
swimming pool areas, with fountains and pathways. and hundreds of palms are
being brought in to create a sub-tropical setting.
There will also be a few four-bedroom villas, from Pounds 498,800. In total,
there may be 180 properties on the 25-acre site, but the developer is
playing it by ear and will keep step with demand. So far, most purchasers
have been German, followed by the Swedish, Spanish and British.
The development partnership comprises IMISA, a German bank and construction
company, and the architect.
Still at Santa Ponsa Nova, Las Abubillas is a development of more
conventional style, although even this estate has abandoned dazzling white
walls for shades of ochre and cream. Detached villas with tiled roofs echo
the typical Spanish holiday home. The properties have one or two storeys
with two to five bedrooms.
They are in low-walled gardens with terraces, pergolas, sometimes plunge
pools - all the trimmings for summer living - plus salons with fireplaces
for winter evenings. Each has a parking space in its garden and there is a
communal pool, while a village street winds through the estate. Prices range
from Pounds 220,000 to Pounds 280,000.
Las Abubillas takes its name from the hoopoes that fly around the golf
course it overlooks. Eventually, there may be 116 homes on its 17 acres. And
typical of the mingling nationalities involved in Mediterranean leisure
homes, the developer here is a British company, Ryde Properties, while the
designer is the Russian-born Pedro Otzoup.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Gardening: Not so scary seeds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHY ARE so many gardeners still scared of sowing seeds? I know they are
scared because when I am showing a visitor a plant, they put up their
defences as soon as they are told that it grows like a weed from seed. 'I
like your Erodium daucoides' means 'Can I have a chunk of it to put in the
car boot?' And 'Have a seed pod' means 'I dare you.'
These fears are absurd because many seeds germinate with childish ease.
People are scared, wrongly, by the more difficult varieties. And anyone who
is gardening abroad ought to bless the explosion of varieties in some of the
best seed lists: there is much less of an excuse nowadays for people who
complain that they are denied a wide range of plants grown in Britain
because they garden outside the country.
My favourites range from bulbs to border plants through annuals and
spreading things for pots. From Scotland to the east Mediterranean, the next
fortnight is the moment to place an order among the unknown.
Each year, my mind's eye fastens on one particular image in the darkness of
January. This year, once again, it starts with a haze of white cosmos
daisies. It is no use saying they are too much of a bother, for they are
absurdly easy to raise. I am not fond of the usual purple forms - in my
garden, cosmos is white only. Seedsmen now offer two varieties: the older
Purity and the newer Sonata. Purity is taller, larger-flowered, much more
impressive - and cheaper.
White cosmos does not need to be sown until late March but immediate sowing
is needed for two of my other front-runners. If you start seeds of the
electric-blue salvia patens under heat within the next fortnight, the plants
will grow on to be potted individually, planted out late in May, and trusted
for their stems of brilliant blue flowers when the rest of the garden starts
to look exhausted. Plants of this half hardy perennial will turn up at
Pounds 2 each on plant stalls early in summer - one reason why a packet or
two of seed from Thompson and Morgan of London Road, Ipswich, are one of the
year's better gambles.
The other star turns require you to transfer to the rising star among
British seed catalogues, the list from Chiltern Seeds, Bortree Stile,
Ulverston, Cumbria LA12. The service includes shopping by credit card, a
24-hour answering service, and a fax on 0229-54549: this amazing list is
within anyone's easy reach world-wide.
Expats who are losing their home roots will be astonished at how much more
is available now. All of us might like to try a new hybrid from Japan,
lilium formosan Snow Trumpet. Usually, this white lily would flower in a
scramble if sown early during its first year, but Snow Trumpet is much
quicker, more vigorous and need not be sown until February. It is pretty
reliable and produces big, white, trumpet-shaped flowers from August
onwards. Seed is Pounds 1.70 a packet, but it germinates easily in heat
indoors (and I need hardly remind you what an individual bulb would cost).
Up among the perennials, you have a cheap chance of two of my lesser-known
favourites: apricot foxgloves (Thompson and Morgan's are the best) or the
tall, thin, late-flowering verbena bonariensis. Much less usual are the
white-flowered gillenia and the small, sky-blue adenophora tashiroi.
Chiltern sells seeds of both - the easiest method of propagation.
The adenophora looks like a small bell flower with stems about 1 1/2 ft
high, but I decided that it had such charm last summer that I have majored
on it in a sunny corner. Few nurseries stock it and most books exaggerate
its preference for shade. While the gillenia is not cheap as a pot-grown
plant, it is even easier to raise from seed. It has delicacy, strong
colouring and a willingness to grow in semi-shade. If I could take only one
white-flowered perennial from late June, this wildflower from North America
would be my choice. It is as tough as nails, about 2ft high and, at Pounds
1.15 a packet, it ought to give you at least a dozen plants for less than
the price of a single one off a stall.

FT  06 FEB 93 / A head-on clash of the lucky number-crunchers: As Britain
gears up for a national lottery, Keith Wheatley meets two Australians who
aim to profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Britain's lottery is going to be huge. The biggest in the world,' predicts
Peter Gillooly from his office in Melbourne.
GILLOOLY heads Tattersalls, the world's biggest private operator of public
lotteries. 'Tatts,' as every Australian knows it, has already had an advance
team in the UK sniffing out the possibilities of an operator's licence. The
second reading of the parliamentary bill setting up the lottery has only
increased his interest.
'The only other thing you can be certain of is that every schemer in the
world will have plans to crack it. They'll be selling software, syndicated
investment plans - everything you can think of.'
In an adjacent suburb, barely 10 minutes distant on one of Melbourne's
charming trams, Stefan Mandel sits in an equally palatial office. Among
other business activities he describes himself as a lottery 'investor'. A
year ago his team won the USDollars 27m (Pounds 17.8m) jackpot in the
Virginia State Lottery after spending about USDollars 6m on tickets. This is
not hearsay. America's taxman took Mandel to court (unsuccessfully), hoping
to garner 30 per cent of the prize.
'I don't predict at present that we will be investing in the British
lottery,' says Mandel, somewhat airily. The prizes will not be big enough to
justify the risk. However, he does admit that his team has been invited to
do a little 'consulting' on the forthcoming British operation for parties he
is unwilling to name.
On the Australian lotteries scene, Gillooly and Mandel have become Punch &amp;
Judy, each man a nemesis for the other. Stefan Mandel and his team are now
precluded by state law from placing 'block' and 'syndicate' entries anywhere
in Victoria. Tattersalls needed legislation to protect itself from this
self-styled numbers genius who fled his native Romania in 1964 on the
proceeds (then equivalent to 100 months' average salary) of a national
lottery.
Throughout the 1980s Mandel staged betting coups against the various state
lotteries in Australia. So far he has documentary proof that his teams have
won or shared in 14 first prizes. There is no attempt to manipulate the
result, simply to wait for a situation where an accumulating jackpot has
reached the size where it will repay the formidable logistical effort of
buying tickets to cover every possible combination of numbers.
Although these winnings look like a just reward for formidable hard work,
authorities the world over make Mandel and his legmen unwelcome. 'We believe
the game is for the man in the street. What you're really selling is hope.
These syndicates destroy the game, eat into the pleasure of believing you
can win,' says Gillooly. His private remarks on the subject of Mandel are
unprintable.
'It's an unwritten law of lotteries that you've got to protect the innocent.
Since Adam was a boy these people have come out into the market place with
their get-rich-quick schemes. We've made a heap of material available to the
authorities in London and they have a real chance to avoid some of the
events that can destroy the credibility of a game.'
Mandel is still unwilling to explain the exact details of how his syndicate
pulled off the Virginia win - since he hopes to repeat it elsewhere in the
world - but the broad picture is known. Two coordinators worked with a team
of 35 couriers from three rented offices in Norfolk, Virginia. A firm of
accountants was hired to oversee the process.
Armed with scores of certified cheques for USDollars 10,000 the couriers
tried to buy - in the three days before the lottery closed - up to 1.4m
tickets from over 60 shops so that all 7,059,052 winning combinations were
covered. Lottery organisers said that Mandel's team managed 5m combinations.
Like most big-money lotteries in the organised world, in Virginia punters
choose combinations of six two-digit numbers. Tattersalls operates Lotto
this way, and the British scheme is likely to be similar. So, unlike the
raffle at the church fete, there may be not one single winning ticket but
several or many.
This led Mandel to deny his involvement in the days immediately after the
big win. 'I had to keep quiet,' said Mandel, who was subsequently
investigated by both the FBI and the American Secret Service as well as the
revenue service. 'People's lives depended on secrecy. We had winning tickets
worth Dollars 27m to the bearer and we were very concerned about being
robbed.'
Tell this bearded sophisticate from Transylvania that Tattersalls portrays
him as some sort of moral robber baron and he becomes highly agitated.
'Those people have no more business running a lottery than I have to be
Pope,' he says. 'Lotto is voluntary taxation, and a huge industry. Let us
not pretend anything else about it.'
Squabbling aside, the figures that Gillooly provides for the Tattersalls
operation are impressive. It is the fourth biggest provider of funds to the
state of Victoria, with ADollars 330m passing to the state government last
year in taxes and share of profit.
Each week about 52 per cent of the population buy a ticket. Gillooly usually
buys one on his way home. 'It's primarily a blue-collar audience but
widening all the time. Making it easy to buy tickets is the key.'
In Australia, Lotto tickets are bought at special electronic terminals
installed at newsagents and corner shops - exactly the kind of 8-till-late
stores becoming so common in Britain. Terminals are linked to the central
Tattersalls computer by a dedicated landline. It gives the company a secure
data network stretching huge distances, the equivalent of Glasgow to
Palermo.
Electronic security is going to be crucial in a European environment full of
bright technocrats, believes Gillooly - at least as important as barring
syndicate buyers such as Mandel.
'A few years ago we became worried about this aspect,' he recalls. 'We gave
some money and equipment to graduate computer students at the University of
Melbourne and asked them to crack our system. They hacked into damn near
everything else, including the foreign exchange dealings of one of the major
banks, and caused trouble that's still crashing around - but they didn't get
into Lotto. The key is to allow no modem access to the main computer and no
packet switching, or line sharing.'
Asked how he thought Britain's football pools promoters, already twitchy
about the coming UK lottery, would fare, Gillooly was downbeat. 'We've had
Vernons running pools against us here for the past 20 years; in fact they've
just given up and handed in their licences.'
Football pools are a traditional product that will always have a market in a
society like Britain, he reckoned. But in terms of ease of play,
accessability and understandibility, he claimed that the Liverpool pools
giants were still 'in the quill pen era', their cries of mass unemployment
if the pools were to suffer competition spurious.
'You'll be amazed when you see how much employment the start of Lotto in
Britain creates,' said Gillooly. 'The terminals have to be built, installed,
serviced and I'd expect to see a network of thousands. The printing alone
each week is a huge item.'
That Britain's lottery is going to be large beyond belief must be the first
item that Mandel and Gillooly have agreed on in a decade.

FT  06 FEB 93 / As they say in Europe: Why we are what we eat - A vexing
question of taxonomy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE QUESTION you were trying to deal with is one of taxonomy,' said a
colleague the other day. Now, I had thought that taxonomy was a cross
between fiscal policy and getting stuffed. An FT editorial might say: 'The
beleaguered chancellor of the exchequer faces numerous problems of
taxonomy.' However, readers will know that it is mainly, but not
exclusively, the biological science of classification, of getting the
categories right.
The comment that led to my discovery was the result of my casual musings of
a month ago on the destruction of English traditions. I took as an example
the plastic pub with bars named after television series where 'villagers'
(mostly from London) would eat Indian food assembled in Huddersfield and
reheated by synthetic methods. (The taxonomic aspect is to be seen in the
overlapping of once entirely separate categories.)
I now find that in Germany the same process is at work: traces of
authenticity are being systematically uprooted in what the headline in Die
Zeit called 'Multikulti-Kuche.' Multicultural cuisine has arrived. Ulrich
Stock recounted the pleasures of a Hamburg Greek restaurant staffed entirely
by Tamils; an Indian cook at an Italian restaurant gave his specialities a
curry flavour.
The best tale was of 'another Italian' where pasta was certainly advertised,
but the owner, speaking no European language, gesticulated his disapproval.
He pointed instead to a dish on an Arabic menu which the customer then
consumed in total ignorance of what it was, because the waiter was unable to
communicate the relevant information. Stock thought he might in future go to
a typical German restaurant to sit between Scandinavians and Americans and
eat tinned cabbage.
The division between northern and southern Europe is based on consumer
categories, mainly food. In Latin countries you can scour the typical
country town and find the occasional McDonald's and Pizza Hut but no
tandoori restaurant or Chinese takeaway. When the French go out to eat they
eat French food, the Italians eat Italian and the Spanish, Spanish.
Not only that, regional specialities still hold sway, however foul. I once
sweated on the banks of the Dordogne as the mercury touched 40`C and watched
a heavily-clad workman eat a mique, a kind of gigantic dumpling stuffed with
pig's liver. That would be washed down with half a litre of wine. In the
evening the fellow would stumble home to a plateful of cassoulet swamped in
goose fat and perhaps pick at a bit of pate de foie before sleeping a full
eight hours. No wonder the burger chains find this region hard to conquer.
In local supermarkets one cannot find those special, healthy,
easy-to-prepare foods that supposedly originate from remote regions of the
sub-continent and the jungles of southeast Asia. Indeed, so un-enterprising
are these companies that even in areas infested by the British you cannot
pick up a decent piece of cheddar cheese. In Italy it is no use going to a
Tuscan store hoping to find even a Friuli wine. So limited are the clothes
shops of Perigueux and Arezzo that they offer garments made only in France
and Italy.
I scour the newspapers of these countries and fail to find the food and wine
pages that make the British papers such a joy. But then it just would not
work. Imagine reading in El Heraldo de Vizcaya: 'The barbecued besugo at
Jose's bodega is really excellent, matching as it does the exciting flock
wallpaper. My lunch partner washed her paella down with the spicy white
rioja that tops the wine list.' The next week only the name of the
restaurant would change.
So it seems that the erosion of ancient categories is primarily a northern
and Anglo-Saxon phenomenon. In this world of fluid identities it is no
wonder that many try to construct new categories into which they can fit and
thereby assert themselves; the need for recognition in a world in taxonomic
crisis becomes an overriding demand.
Thus President William Clinton, commander-in-chief of the armed forces of
the US, is compelled by political pressures to seek an increase in the
number of avowed homosexuals to throw into the fray. The Germans keep
careful count of this same group in its forces - 13,000 at the last count,
which should mean there are enough lesbians in the Luftwaffe to form their
own squadron.
In Britain it is now possible to pay Pounds 650 to choose the sex of one's
child. Even now there is a couple investing such a sum to secure a male
heir, unaware that in 20 years the said offspring will undergo a sex change
operation in order to become a woman priest in the Church of England. Will
the parents sue the child or the child the parents? If ever the world cried
out for a taxonomic genius it is now.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Collecting: Sick patient stirs into life - The statistics
seem to confirm that the worst is over in the UK art market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH art market is showing the first tentative signs of recovery. The
two specialist fairs of late January - Art 93, the leading, if not the only,
national showcase for contemporary art; and the World of Watercolours - both
provided some encouragement.
Art 93 had its highest attendance ever, with more than 21,000 people
trekking up to Islington, north London, and those dealers that exhibited
works that were priced reasonably - Pounds 5,000 seemed to be the buying
barrier - did well.
Anthony Hepworth of Bath made 46 sales, including works by Roger Hilton and
Keith Vaughan, and brought in more than Pounds 40,000. Another Bath gallery,
Cleveland Bridge, sold 'Still Life - Fish' by Mark Gertler for around Pounds
20,000.
The highest price paid was the Pounds 26,500 at the Anneley Juda stand in
the opening minutes for an Anthony Caro sculpture.
Nicola Hicks, John Bellany, Ken Howard, Peter Howson, Harry Holland - these
were the artists in favour, familiar British names working in figurative or
colourfully abstract fields.
The jokey sculptures of David Mach also found buyers, including two works
(from the limited edition of 11) of his scaled-down version of even
larger-than-life sumo wrestlers lifting a container; these sold for Pounds
5,500 each.
Helped by the overflow from the Royal Academy's major exhibition of English
watercolours, the World of Watercolours attracted 10,000 visitors, a slight
increase on 1992, and 850 works were sold, a rise of 50 on a year ago.
Abbott &amp; Holder disposed of 62 pictures and Christopher Wood had his best
fair ever, selling a George Apperley self-portrait for around Pounds 25,000
to a private English collector.
Although the art market has been optimistic about a revival for more than a
year now, it does seem that business has picked up slightly in the past few
months.
Furniture, which is practical, never suffered as badly as pictures, which
are only decorative; and fields with committed collectors, like ceramics and
Old Master drawings, survived quite well.
The weakest area has been 20th century art, as a recent survey by the
British Antiques Dealers' Association confirms. This found that two-thirds
of the dealers quizzed saw sales fall in 1991-92, but only slightly: their
collective turnover was just Pounds 40m lower, at Pounds 430m.
The statistics seem to confirm that the worst is over. Art consultants
Poensgen Sokolow suggest that international auction turnover in paintings,
drawings and watercolours fell by 20 per cent last year, to Pounds 503m.
This compares well with the 65 per cent decline in turnover between 1990 and
1991. They expect the market will bottom out this year.
Those dealers that got out and started marketing themselves, either by
attending more fairs or opening their shops at flexible times, are reaping
the benefit.
Spink has taken advantage of the undoubted revival in the American economy,
and American art buying, and returned from the winter antiques show in New
York this week with six sales in the Dollars 30,000-50,000 range.
Leslie Waddington has planned a hectic schedule of international fairs this
year, and did Dollars 2m worth of business in Miami last month.
Like other top contemporary dealers, who sell mainly to non-British clients,
the devaluation of sterling has provided a great boost. After the successful
Cork Street weekend in November, most of the dealers in this high street of
the art world are planning to stay open on Saturday afternoons.
The main auction houses, Sotheby's and Christie's, are locked in a
mid-winter hibernation which seems to get longer every year. Sellers have
become street-wise and want to commit their works to the major auctions in
the big selling months, which means that the really good stuff does not come
under the hammer until late March.
Christie's is, however, encouraged by the fact that sales of lots at its
South Kensington offshoot, which concentrates on collectables, are running
at 90 per cent so far this year, a rise of 5 per cent on 1992, while
Sotheby's two 1993 sales - the contents of Robert Maxwell's Headington home,
and of marine pictures - both exceeded estimate.
It would have been surprising if the sale of the late tycoon's belongings,
and one devoted to a popular collecting market, had failed - but at least
they suggested that the increased charge to buyers (another 5 per cent on
the hammer price, to 15 per cent) was not going to cause a boycott by
bidders.
The revival of American buying could have a quick impact on the UK trade.
Americans account for almost half the sales of the top London dealers, and
the prices paid at Christie's in New York last weekend for English furniture
must have brought a smile to the face of many a dealer in the Fulham Road or
the Cotswolds.
For instance, a pair of William and Mary oak bookcases sold for Dollars
385,000 (Pounds 258,000) compared with Dollars 90,000 top estimate; while a
set of 12 George II mahogany dining chairs, estimated at up to Dollars
10,000, were bought by a New York dealer for Dollars 46,200 (Pounds 31,000).
But there are still traps to be avoided if 1993 is to stabilise the market
and achieve modest growth. The financial losses at Lloyds have dealt a major
blow to many dealers who could bank on some of the Names converting their
bonuses into pictures or furniture.
Agnew's hopes that the quality of the work on offer at its 120th watercolour
exhibition (which opens on March 8) will make good any absence of regular
Names. It includes nine works by Samuel Palmer, the largest group to arrive
on the market in 25 years, as well as good watercolours by Turner,
Gainsborough and Lear.
The loss of the Names is a minor matter compared with the dangers from
European Community legislation.
So far, the British government has warded off the imposition of 5 per cent
VAT on works of art coming from non-EC sources into the UK (these account
for Pounds 700m, or 50 per cent of all art imports, each year); but there is
another meeting on the matter in the middle of this month, and this threat
to the UK's status as the great unfettered market for buying and selling art
is still very potent.
In addition, the government has made no progress in changing the ludicrous
situation in which contemporary artists in the UK must pay 17.5 per cent VAT
on their works while artists in France pay 5 per cent. Unless this anomaly
is corrected, dealers like Leslie Waddington will be tempted to move to
Paris.
The market is still weak and convalescent. The auction houses are advising
sellers to keep reserves low and dealers will usually offer good discounts
to make a sale. But sentiment is improving.
This month, the Original Print Fair, at the Royal Academy from February 25,
should confirm that a connoisseur market can ride out the recession. Then,
in March, the big and glitzy gathering at the Maastricht fair in Holland
should confirm the improvement in the international art world - or cast
everyone back into misery.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Collecting: Old Masters fail to make an impression -
Optimism gives way to disappointment at New York sales - and buyers must now
face the deterrent effect of a new 15 per cent premium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HOMAN POTTERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE RUMOUR last year in the New York art market
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
fanned assiduously by auction houses and dealers alike - was that Old
Masters, traditionally a subdued market in the United States, were about to
come into their own. Both Sotheby's and Christie's had successful sales
which featured a range of quality paintings - well above the New York
auction average - and shoals of Italian dealers, outbidding their London and
New York rivals, jostled with each other to snap up bargains.
At The Art Show (showcase of the Art Dealers' Association of America) this
time last year, Colnaghi, Rosenberg and Stiebel, Otto Naumann and other
dealers exhibited some very serious pictures, while the International
Antique Dealers' Show in October re-christened itself the International Fine
Art and Antique Dealers' Show. This was intended to stress that there was to
be a stronger emphasis on paintings: the fabulous Bellotto exhibited at the
show by Bruno Meissner was evidence that the new title was justified fully.
A certain optimism prevailed, therefore, when it came to last month's Old
Master sales in New York. Alas, results proved disappointing. At Christie's,
40 per cent of the 176 lots on offer were bought in; and at Sotheby's, where
quantity (almost 300 lots) was the order of the day, 36 per cent of the
paintings remained on the block.
The high point at Sotheby's was a late-15th century portrait of the Flemish
composer Jacob Obrecht. This was catalogued as 'School of Bruges' (although
the catalogue pointed out it could be by Memlinc) and its pre-sale estimate
was Dollars 400,000-600,000. There was some surprise when the hammer came
down at Dollars 2.4m. The purchaser turned out to be the wealthy Kimbell
museum in Fort Worth, Texas - an institution which appears more regularly in
the New York salerooms as vendor than purchaser.
In the same Sotheby's sale, a Dutch 17th century still life by Jan Davidsz
de Heem went well above its estimate of Dollars 350,000-450,000 to reach
Dollars 1.5m; and an early-16th century Netherlandish crucifixion (by Jacob
van Amsterdam) went for Dollars 607,000 (estimated Dollars 250,000-350,000).
These results, however, represented the good news. The bad was that
published pictures by Isenbrant, Breughel, van Goyen, Flinck, Gentileschi,
Guardi, Vernet and others - all with high estimates - failed to sell.
Apart from the usual sprinkling of American museums, the principal vendor at
Christie's Old Master sale was a Neapolitan medical doctor, Carlo Corce. who
lives in Philadelphia, His collection of about 60 Italian baroque pictures
seemed to have been assembled fairly recently, and most were bought on the
open market in New York and in London. Although the catalogue covered the
collection in a cloak of scholarship, this turned out to be a shroud and
quantities of the pictures were bought in. Those that did sell just scraped
above the low end of the pre-sale estimate. As there was hardly a really
good picture among the group, their rejection by the market was heartening.
Sales of Old Master drawings the same week - traditionally a much stronger
market in New York - fared much better. Although neither auction house
managed to sell more than 75 per cent of the total lots on offer, the items
left on the block were, with one or two exceptions, very minor.
Among the top prices for the day at Sotheby's were three separate sheets by
Guercino (which descended from the artist's heirs), while a finished Guardi
rendering of the Grand Canal also did well (Dollars 77,000). Christie's had
success with Fragonard when a wash and chalk view of a garden with figures
went for Dollars 343,500 (estimate Dollars 150,000-200,000). Other French
drawings in this sale, notably by Greuze, also brought strong prices, with
American private collectors active in the bidding.
The next hurdle for the New York market is 19th century European paintings:
the big sales are at Sotheby's on February 17 and Christie's the following
day. The steamy nudes of Bouguereau were among the first pictures in this
area to attract attention early in the 1980s - when prices began to soar
above the Dollars 1m mark - but they were soon followed into the limelight
by the works of painters like Tissot, Alfred Stevens, Gerome, Jean Beraud
and, occasionally, the English artists Albert Moore, Lord Leighton and Alma
Tadema.
As in other areas of collecting, the mood of late has been more cautious
when it comes to these Salon pictures - which at least have the merit of
being well-made and entertaining - and prices have dipped accordingly. In
the coming auctions, Christie's is hoping for the best with Bouguereau and
Tissot; but an indication of the present state of affairs is that all of the
works by these artists included in the sale (three by Bouguereau, two by
Tissot) were bought by their vendors in the past decade. Only one, a saucy
Tissot of a woman singing in church, went through the saleroom (rather than
the trade) when it fetched Dollars 165,000 in 1987: it is now estimated at
Dollars 300,000-500,000.
Gerome, whose record is above Dollars 2m, is nowhere to be found in
Christie's sale but a painting by his contemporary, Cabanel, of Cleopatra
practicing poisoning is the next best thing. It is estimated at Dollars
500,000-700,000. Meanwhile, Sotheby's is auctioning four major works by
Tissot from the well-known Toronto collection of Joey and Toby Tannenbaum.
All were bought in the 1970s and each carries an estimate of about Dollars
1.5m.
The effect of the new 15 per cent buyer's premium at both Sotheby's and
Christie's might not yet have registered with collectors who, latterly, have
favoured auctions above dealers when it comes to buying. But it is very
unlikely to go unnoticed and is almost certain to act as a deterrent fairly
soon. From this point of view, the fifth annual Art Show (February 25-March
1) in New York - more than 60 dealers showing paintings, drawings, prints,
sculpture and photography - will be monitored closely.
While the variety of works on offer always appears bewilderingly
wide-ranging - this year, a 16th century Italian Madonna and Child at
Richard Feigen; Matisse and Warhol elsewhere; and video installations at
Carl Solway's booth - the show has an excitement of its own. Joining the
fray this time round will be Agnew's with a display of (what else?) Old
Masters. There could be no further confirmation that all has changed with
the New York art market.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A bubbly time at last - Champagne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN we are all belt-tightening, and Lent is just around the corner,
February may seem an odd month to recommend champagne. But it is a good time
to buy and drink it - and not just the cheap brands promoted by
supermarkets.
Overall it is likely to be superior in quality compared with a few years
ago. Moreover, sterling devaluation and likely Budget duty rises may
increase retail prices of new imports by up to 20 per cent.
Quality should be better for two reasons. The sharp fall in sales since 1989
has resulted in an accumulation of merchants' stocks.
Many firms have five years' stock in their cellars. One leading merchant
described his Epernay cellars as almost full to the roof. All but the
immature champagnes, dumped on the market mostly by cash-hungry growers who
market their own brands, will have the benefit of increased bottle-age - an
important factor for champagne.
Secondly, non-vintage blends, which account for 85 per cent of production,
will include wines from the particularly fine and prolific 1989 and 1990
vintages.
The high quality of these years and a still optimistic market partly led to
excessive rises in official prices. However, at the last vintage, the price
of grapes per kilo fell sharply to FFr24 plus a premium of FFr2.50 for the
top villages and FFr19 for the bottom-rated communes.
With 1.3 kilos of grapes needed per bottle, and a basic production cost
without overheads, depreciation or interest charges of FFr15, this means a
minimum of FFr45 per bottle for the top level and FFr39 at the bottom.
However, the French supermarkets have been selling champagne at FFr45 to
FFr50 a bottle and one big one, LeClerc, at less than FFr40 - in all cases
including 18.6 per cent VAT. So they have presumbly been selling at a heavy
loss.
This has rebounded on the big co-ops which market their own brands and the
4500 growers who do the same. They have been undercut in a slice of the
French domestic market that accounted for nearly half French domestic sales.
It is mostly these too-young brands from low-level sources that have
attracted criticism for their lack of quality.
However, in the 1992 vintage, significant improvements were made.
Apprehensive growers sold more grapes to the merchants than for 20 years.
The third pressing (the deuxieme taille) was eliminated. For each 100 litres
of pressed juice 160 kilos of grapes were required, instead of 150, thus
raising quality.
The maximum yield per ha was reduced to 10,400 kilos, but this year
everything above 9,000 kilos was put into a blocked reserve of still wine,
denied second fermentation - or payment - until its probable release in two
years' time.
This year the minimum bottle-age allowed before sale is expected to be
increased from 12 to 15 months, with 18 on the horizon. This will certainly
improve quality, but not affect the Grandes Marques which sell their NV when
2 1/2 to three years old.
Future developments in prices will depend on the state of the market and the
size and quality of the next vintage, likely to be large in designated
vineyard areas; unless, hit by natural disasters.
Top prices may drop again to FFr20 per kilo, and growers may demand a return
to modified inter-professional contracts, guaranteeing their sale. But the
merchants are nearly all firmly against this.
However, Champagne is the best organised wine region in France, with close
collaboration between growers and merchants and with both dedicated to
higher quality in order to compete with other sparkling wines. Good
champagne can never be cheap but, increasingly, it should be good value as
the best wine of celebration.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Sorry, we're all out to lunch - Nicholas
Lander considers the lessons learned from the FT's Lunch for a Fiver scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MATCHMAKER rather than dealmaker may seem an unlikely epithet for the
Financial Times but it is perhaps the most suitable after the enormous
success of 'Lunch for a Fiver.'
For the 17-year-old son of one reader, Lunch for a Fiver made it possible
for him to take his girlfriend to their first lunch in a top restaurant.
Another reader, sadly made redundant the week before the scheme started,
minimised his spending by courting prospective employers to a succession of
Pounds 5 lunches, while finance directors pinned the list of 130
participating restaurants to noticeboards in an effort to control expenses.
At the other end of the age spectrum, one woman wrote to say that, having
drawn her pension that morning, she went to London for a lunch which she had
thought beyond her budget forever.
It also stretched some readers' ingenuity. When senior Home Office employees
tried to book a table for 37 at Simpsons-in-the-Strand they were politely
refused. Four of them then phoned separately to book three tables of 10 and
one of seven which they confirmed by four different fax machines. Then they
turned up en masse. During the fortnight, Simpsons served 2,387 Pounds 5
lunches. The average spend was Pounds 15.50; it extended the promotion for a
third week.
Some spin-offs could not have been foreseen. Alastair Little and Antony
Worrall-Thompson, chefs used to media attention, could not believe the
response: Little saw queues forming at 11.45am; Worrall-Thompson describing
the effect on his business as 'mega'.
Within the FT there was unprecedented interest in the food and drink page.
The newspaper's foreign correspondents sent a stream of messages detailing
what they could obtain for the equivalent of Pounds 5 in their cities. In
New York it was a big pastrami-on-rye sandwich from the Carnegie Deli; in
Brussels, a bowl of sweetcorn soup and a sandwich; in Bonn, dry bread,
water, bangers and sauerkraut.
Nor was I prepared for the number of enthusiastic calls, letters and faxes
from readers. Examples: Mr and Mrs Turner in Dunstable, Somerset, who are
now converted back to eating-out at lunchtime after a meal at the King's
Head, Ivinghoe; Mrs Dalton of Hartfield, Sussex, whose Pounds 5 meal at
Pierre Victoire, Edinburgh, satisfied the appetite of her 6ft 5in student
son; and Suzanne L'Estrange, of Wandsworth, London, who booked nine lunches
 -the last at Mijanou, in Ebury Street, London, which she described as
blissful - and sent a detailed review of her gastronomic holiday.
There have also been letters of complaint. The most vociferous and indignant
were levied at the managements of Sheekeys and Drones for the Pounds 1.75
cover charge they imposed on top of the Pounds 5 menu. Those restaurants
which offered a no-choice menu and segregated those on the Pounds 5 menu
from other diners generated less goodwill than their more expansive rivals.
But those restaurateurs who entered into the spirit of the scheme, offering
wide choices and generous portions, have won many new customers. This
attitude was most neatly summed up by Denis Blais, co-owner of Belgo, in
north London, which discounted its Pounds 8.95 lunch to Pounds 5 and
included a glass of Belgian beer. Blais said: 'For new customers it is a
great introduction. For our regulars, it is a reward.'
But things were not one-sided. Most restaurateurs and chefs asked me if I
would like to see a Pounds 10 bill from a table of two customers who had
eaten the FT menu, ordered tap water - and left. Some customers asked if
bread and horseradish were included in the price. And, sadly, even at Pounds
5 a head, there were the occasional customers who failed to turn up.
Risks are inherent in any promotion, but the success of Lunch for a Fiver
has justified the FT's decision not to lay down too many rules.
If you were at all disappointed in your Pounds 5 lunch, you still had the
right to complain to the restaurateur; but please remember that the 130
restaurants that took part were those prepared to make a financial sacrifice
and take a culinary risk to join a scheme that had never been put to the
test in the UK. Many declined.
For those that took part, Lunch for a Fiver proved a salutary marketing
lesson. As Lou Segal, proprietor of Frederick's and a restaurateur for 23
years, put it: 'When I was working in the menswear clothing business, we had
the answer to January and February - we would hold a sale. It has taken the
FT to show us that this is what we have to do in the restaurant trade.'
At Newtons, in south London, a busy lunchtime used to be 30 covers. Its
owner, Tsu Newton, said she did not believe there was a market for lunch in
her neighbourhood. However, during the scheme's two weeks she served more
than 80 customers a day and last month her turnover was 30 per cent up on
January last year.
Rebecca Mascarenhas, of Sonny's, in London SW13, saw her lunchtime trade
increase from an average of 30 to 102 covers on the last Friday of the
scheme. Extra costs were involved and she had to top up her waiting staff's
lunchtime rate but, in the end, Lunch for a Fiver proved financially
rewarding.
John Zarmit, an FT reader who managed to eat Lunch for a Fiver every day of
the fortnight, says he was surprised that restaurateurs did not capitalise
on this goodwill. None of the restaurants he visited offered wine specials,
pinned the FT menu to their a la carte menu or offered a business card on
the way out to entice him back.
What Lunch for a Fiver did was create an atmosphere in the participating
restaurants: a buzz normally associated with the busiest restaurants, of
which there are usually only a handful.
For Patrick Gwynn-Jones, Brian Turner, Stephen and Judy Markwick,
restaurateurs of long standing, the fortnight invoked memories of 'the good
old days'; for waiting staff who had to disappoint callers with the line: 'I
am sorry we are booked until February', there was a sense of excitement.
For customers that buzz is necessary. Quiet restaurants are just not
exciting. One restaurateur rang me at 5pm last Friday afternoon, to tell me:
'Lunch for a Fiver has certainly worked with one table of 10. Six of them
are still here and their bill is Pounds 410.'
To those readers who were not able to enjoy Lunch for a Fiver because there
was not a participating restaurant nearby, we apologise. For readers in the
Exeter area, in south-west England, the St Olaves Court Hotel (tel:
0392-217736) has listed nine restaurants and hotels offering a Pounds 5
lunch during February.
No sooner had Lunch for a Fiver been launched than Patrick Valetta was on
the fax from his home in the south of France pointing out that there were no
restaurants on the list convenient for him. Next year's FT Lunch hopes to
rectify that. It will be bigger, better and, almost certainly,
international.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Trimming fat for the food
industry - A man who makes his living selling food for thought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VISITORS TO Verner Wheelock's office come face to face with a large,
grumpy-looking gorilla staring from a poster. 'Try telling him fruit 'n' veg
are for wimps,' the legend says.
Since 1990, Wheelock has run a small company which earns most of its income
advising big food suppliers how to dish up healthier nourishment. In 1990,
he left Bradford university - where he was a lecturer in the department of
science and society and head of its food policy research unit - to make his
living in the private sector.
In particular, Wheelock is grappling with the government's
recently-published targets for cutting the fat content of the sticky bun and
pork pie diet of the average Briton. This would lower the UK's chronic
incidence of heart disease.
'Unless there is a positive drive on the part of the food industry, I don't
think we'll get there,' he says. 'Food companies have had a fairly rigid
viewpoint that dietary recommendations don't really have any impact on them,
that it's none of their business, and that it's up to individuals to choose.
But their mental block is gradually being eroded.'
Wheelock, 54, does not spend all his time worrying about fat. 'I see my
function as operating somewhere between technology and science on the one
hand, and marketing and public relations on the other, with food safety and
healthy eating as specialist interests.
'I'm basically in the information business,' he says. 'I understand
nutrition issues but I also understand how the food industry works. That is
a difference to most academics, who do not understand the pressures and
constraints on industry.'
He says his role is to provide 'input, some factual information,
interpretation and insight.' He says food companies often are too insular
and too short of staff to monitor legislation and trends.
Verner Wheelock Associates was set up in 1990. It has a yearly turnover of
Pounds 140,000, with Pounds 100,000 coming from fees. A handful of
companies, including McDonald's, the Danish Bacon and Meat Council and
Marlow Foods, an ICI subsidiary, pay fixed retainers. Training seminars on
food hygiene bring in Pounds 25,000, and conferences on food safety and
legislation Pounds 10,000. Wheelock publishes a ten-issues-a-year magazine,
Food Policy Update, which attracts a further Pounds 10,000. His three-room
premises in Bradford cost just Pounds 5,000 a year to rent.
When he set up his business, Wheelock chose to form a co-partnership with a
well-established group, Moy Park, a Northern Ireland food maker. Moy Park
injected more than half of the Pounds 20,000 start-up capital, retains a
majority interest in the company, and has two people on Wheelock Associates'
board. Wheelock says this relationship has provided invaluable aid in
managing day-to-day finances. Moy Park does not interfere with its work, and
all reports Wheelock prepares for other companies remain confidential.
He had fancied running his own business for years and took the chance
offered by the university's early retirement package to realise the
ambition. He concedes that the food scares of the late 1980s - eggs,
listeria, a few outbreaks of botulism - were a 'bonus' for his business.
They pushed the government into introducing the Food Safety Act in 1991;
this included many proposals made in the mid-1980s but shelved by ministers.
'Food wasn't a political issue then.'
A white paper on the health of England (there are separate ones for other
parts of the UK) calls for reductions in total fat in the average diet by 12
per cent, and by 35 per cent for saturated fat. The government wants to cut
the death rate from heart disease and related illnesses in people under 60
by 40 per cent by the end of the century.
Wheelock says some companies are responding. He lists Heinz, Nestle and
Tesco, the supermarket chain. A recent survey said the basic McDonald's
'burger had the least fat of 'burgers tested. 'There used to be 4.5 per cent
lard in McDonald's buns but now it is 3 per cent vegetable oil.'
The wider issue of health and the food industry is Wheelock's most fruitful
area. Cases of food poisoning rose through the 1980s from 10,000 to 30,000
and, in spite of the furore of the late '80s, have jumped by another 50 per
cent since 1988. But Wheelock views some worries with scepticism. 'One in
two deaths are due to diseases of the heart and arteries - yet, we worry
about listeria and additives. I mean, who has died from additives?'
He believes the thrust of the government's proposals on healthy eating are
sound. But he insists that moves towards healthy eating are hindered by the
growth of what has been termed Britain's 'underclass'.
Wheelock says: 'It is a big problem for the rest of society. A family's
over-riding consideration is often getting enough food to fill bellies. It
is often the food part of their budget that is necessarily squeezed. Cheap
food that provides bulk is high in fat and sugars.'
He is interested in the whole food chain. 'There has been a shift in the
balance of power away from agriculture and food manufacturing towards
retailers and consumers.'
Even so, 'farmers remain producer rather than consumer orientated. The EC
acts as a form of insulation that prevents them from being exposed to the
market. In the long run, that will make it worse for them.'

FT  06 FEB 93 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Bequests to reduce IHT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU WILL be aware that when spouses contemplate making reciprocal wills, it
is advocated that they should first bequeath to their offspring as much as
they can afford up to the (present) exempt figure of Pounds 150,000 in order
to keep inheritance tax to a minimum.
If such a bequest is worded 'cash, or shares in public companies or other
securities' and such shares are transferred to beneficiaries, can you
confirm:
(a) that the acquisition cost for that person(s) is the probate value of the
shares transferred.
(b) that no CGT is payable at the time of transfer either by the estate, or
the beneficiary, on any appreciation which may have accrued to that date.
(c) CGT will be payable by the beneficiary on any future sale by him based
on the probate value.
We confirm that the acquisition cost would be the probate value. No capital
gains tax is payable upon the death of the transferor.
However, if the assets increase in value in the future, then there will be
CGT payable by the beneficiary on the difference between the sales proceeds
and the base cost of the shares.
The base cost would comprise the probate value as increased by the
indexation allowance, and the capital gain would be reduced by the annual
CGT exemption in the normal way.
The last two replies were provided by Barry Stillerman of Stoy Hayward.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY HUSBAND and I are joint tenants of our house and I wish to convert it
into a tenants-in-common ownership. In the event of my husband pre-deceasing
me and not leaving a will, would relatives have a claim on his share of the
house and in what proportion?
We have a married daughter. I have brothers and sisters and nephews. My
husband has one sister - who is well provided-for - and two nieces. If I die
first, would my daughter be able to claim on my husband's property?
We note that you wish to change the ownership of your house from a joint
tenancy into tenants-in-common so that you can leave your share of the house
as you wish.
If your husband does not make a will, then your estate would be left in
accordance with the rules of intestacy.
These provide that the first Pounds 75,000 and any personal possessions
would pass to you, and the balance held as to 50 per cent by way of a life
interest for you and 50 per cent for your married daughter.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Tax on interest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I GET a company pension paid monthly into my bank account and taxed under
the PAYE regulations. In addition, I receive gross interest payments from
government stocks purchased on the National Savings stock register.
In the past, such interest payments were the subject of a separate
assessment payable on January 1.
In recent years, though, the estimated interest for the current tax year has
been included in my PAYE coding notice so that I am paying tax, via my
pension payments, on such estimated interest before I receive it.
Does the Inland Revenue have the right to exercise this method of securing
payment of the tax due, or could I insist on the interest payments being the
subject of a separate assessment?
Many (perhaps most) people seem to prefer to have their untaxed interest
taken into account in their PAYE coding in order to spread the tax burden
evenly over the year.
So, your tax inspector acted reasonably in assuming you had no objection to
his proposal since you apparently did not object when you got the first
coding notice advising you of the proposed change a few years ago.
If you have received a coding notice for 1993-94 (which is unlikely), you
should write to the inspector giving notice of objection to the proposed
code number, in accordance with regulation 10 (1) of the Income tax
(Employments) Regulations 1973: 'If the employee is aggrieved by the
inspector's determination, he may give notice of objection to the inspector,
stating the grounds of his objection.'
If, on the other hand, no coding notice has yet been sent to you for
1993-94, you should simply write to the tax office and tell them that you
want all your allowances to be taken into account in your PAYE coding, and
that no allowances should be set against your Schedule D (III/VI)
assessments for 1993-94 and subsequently.
Incidentally, if you have not already seen one, you might like to ask your
tax office for a copy of the free pamphlet IR68 (accrued-income scheme:
taxing securities on transfer).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I LET the ground floor and basement of my house as an art gallery. The last
tenants occupied these premises on a five year lease which expired on August
22.
By virtue of a court order, this lease was excluded from the Landlord and
Tenants Act 1954, sections 24-28 inclusive. The tenants did not vacate the
property at the end of the lease but remained in occupation until October 5,
when the keys were handed over.
In fact, their builders were there, carrying out repairs and decorations
which were the tenants' liability under the lease terms.
Am I entitled to claim rent until October 5, when the premises were handed
back, or until the next quarter day, December 24?
You can claim a sum for use and occupation for the period from August 23 to
October 5.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Minding Your Own Business: How I cut my rates - Stephen
Halliday on how he wrested a reduction from his district valuer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN HALLIDAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RATES ARE one of the largest overheads for many small businesses,
particularly retailers, yet they are often regarded as untouchable. My
recent experience suggests that, with a little determination and the right
advice, they can be reduced.
Business rates are determined by two separate elements, neither of which is
controlled by the local authority. The first is the rateable value of the
property. This is established by the district valuer, an official of the
Inland Revenue who has no connection with the local authority. The rateable
value supposedly reflects the rent at which the property could have been let
on a normal commercial basis at the valuation date, April 1 1988.
The district valuer will take into account many factors. These include the
position of the property in relation to other traders; the shape, since a
retail unit with a long frontage is regarded as more desirable, and the
current rents paid by the property and by nearby premises.
The rates are then calculated by applying the uniform business rate to the
rateable value. This is set annually by the government and is 40.2p in the
Pounds 1, but the chancellor has proposed a rise to 41.6p from April. At the
current rate property with a rateable value of Pounds 10,000 would be paying
Pounds 4,020 in rates.
Rateable values are supposed to be revised every five years but the last
revaluation before 1988 was in 1973. Rents in the south of England had
outstripped those in the north, while retail rents had risen more quickly
than those for industrial properties. When the rateable values for 1988 were
published retailers in the south had some unpleasant surprises.
An appeals procedure exists so traders who believe their rateable values
have been incorrectly assessed can take their case to an independent
tribunal. My experience of this procedure was initially discouraging but
ultimately successful.
When the new rateable values were published in 1990, I wrote to the district
valuer saying that I considered the values he had established were excessive
because we had recently negotiated a new rent which was considerably lower
than the rateable value he had proposed. We received a prompt reply which
said:
'On the information presently available to me, I do not consider your
proposal to be well founded and I do not intend to alter the rating list.'
Some months later, we vacated part of the premises. I wrote again to the
valuer explaining this and asked for a reassessment. Again, we received a
prompt reply but it contained the same discouraging (and this time
extraordinary) statement.
I wrote again explaining that our former storerooms had been occupied by
another trader. Was the valuer proposing that we should pay the rates for
the new tenant? Or did he intend to collect rates from both of us? Five
weeks passed. I telephoned the office, and was told that the letter was a
standard one, generated by a computer, and was sent to all applicants
regardless of the merit of a particular case.
The letter did not mean what it said. What it meant was that my perfectly
sensible request was being dealt with and that the rateable value would
shortly be reduced.
The official said the letter was a standard one and had been drafted by
their legal department. He also told me that my original objection to the
rateable values would be receiving further consideration and that I would be
hearing from them in due course.
In July 1992, two years after my original objection, I was notified that a
valuation tribunal would take place within the month. I was invited to
contact the district valuation officer in an attempt to resolve our
differences without recourse to the tribunal.
At the same time, I was contacted by a local chartered surveyor. He said he
would be putting the cases of a number of local traders and offered to take
my case, arguing that a knowledge of valuation principles and local rental
agreements would enable him to present a stronger case than I could. If he
failed to secure a cut in the rateable value I would not have to pay him. If
he succeeded he would invoice me for the equivalent of six months' rates
saved. I asked him to act on my behalf.
He based his case on the actual rent that we were paying, backed up with
evidence of rents of surrounding properties, and won a reduction. He secured
a further significant reduction on a technical point: the availability of
toilet facilities within the building which apparently do not bear rates.
The combined effect was to reduce the rateable value (and consequently the
rates) by more than 20 per cent.
I have this morning received a cheque for nearly Pounds 1,500 from my local
authority in compensation for rates I have over-paid since April 1 1990,
including over Pounds 100 in interest.
My affairs had been settled 'out of court' but I went to the tribunal anyway
out of curiosity. The tribunal consisted of three lay people who had
received training in valuation principles but had no connection with the
local authority or the valuer. They received evidence in an informal way
from each side in turn. Of 64 objections lodged with the district valuer
only two appeared before the tribunal. All the others were either withdrawn
or settled beforehand.
I was left with two strong impressions. The first was that the valuer was
well prepared. He argued his case clearly and produced evidence to support
his arguments. The chartered surveyor who acted for the appellant was not so
well prepared. It emerged that he was not a local man. He came from a
practice in London and was unfamiliar with rents and rates in the small town
under discussion. Almost all of the cases which had been settled beforehand
had been handled by local firms.
The next re-valuation is due to take place on April 1 1993 and will take
effect in April 1995. If you feel you have a case for a lower valuation,
collect evidence now.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS MACDONALD, Directus Ltd
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST WEEK, we noted the tendency of directors to sell shares in spite of the
rising market. This week, the situation is little changed. While the
monetary value of some transactions can be high, in many cases directors
still retain sizeable holdings. Such sales should not be viewed as an
indication of lack of confidence in a company.
James Hartnett, director of Eurotherm, has sold 120,000 shares at 508p. His
residual holding remains in excess of 8 per cent of ordinary shares.
Adrian Wallis, chief executive of Vistec Group, sold more than 600,000
shares, raising in excess of Pounds 167,000. He retains almost 1.5 per cent
of the company. Shares in Gresham Telecomputing have out-performed the
market over the past 12 months. Michael Whitaker, a non-executive director,
sold 100,000 shares at 56p, retaining a big stake in the company.
Three board members at Stylo, including the chairman and managing director,
bought 151,000 limited voting shares at 90.25p, following the sale of
Control Securities' stake. At Alexon Group, finance director David Cohen
increased his stake to 1m shares following his purchase at 66p. He also
bought 150,000 cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares at 60p.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Wanted: smaller firms' exchange - The
new SEATS system for share trading / Diary of a Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR SOME years, I have complained about the difficulties of trading in the
shares of some small companies. I found it was either impossible to buy any
of their shares immediately, or that shares could be acquired only in small
amounts of perhaps 250 at a time.
This made dealing costs, based on a minimum commission charge per deal,
rather expensive. To sell the shares might also mean waiting some
considerable time for a buyer to appear, or having to let them go in small
parcels.
In a Weekend FT article last year, I welcomed the stock exchange's
introduction of a Bulletin Board service with details of around 120
UK-listed and USM small companies. Brokers were able to use its screen pages
to display details of their clients' requirements.
In November, the exchange replaced Bulletin Board with something even
better: SEATS (the Stock Exchange Alternative Trading Service). Sadly, this
has not received all the publicity it deserves.
While Bulletin Board improved dealings in the shares of companies included
on it, concerns were expressed that the lack of competing limit orders for
certain shares sometimes meant there was no two-way price available. This
affected brokers' ability to deal and to place an effective valuation on the
shares concerned.
With SEATS, the Bulletin Board type of display continues, with brokers being
able to act on a 'matched bargain' basis. But where a company has a single
market-maker, it must now display a bid-to-offer price at all times. Brokers
wishing to deal in those shares must disclose what they want to do and allow
the market-maker first refusal of it.
With various other incentives for market-makers, SEATS should encourage a
more active market (although there are still some companies without a
market-maker at all). But the success of the system will depend on the
number of people buying and selling shares in companies displayed on it. The
more who trade, the better the service.
One broking firm seeking to alert private investors to its advantages is
Dunbar Boyle &amp; Kingsley. It has sent letters to a number of people
(including myself) with shares in SEATS companies, enclosing a brief
research report on the company in which the investor has a holding and
inviting him to request similar reports on a further 14.
DB &amp; K's Robin Boyle explains in his letter that his firm has made a
particular point of researching the SEATS market. He says he is 'worried
about the way the larger firms are working more and more for the big
institutions' and, in his opinion, 'ignoring the needs of the private
investor.'
Boyle claims that 'a number of the large financial concerns have stopped
being market-makers to a selection of interesting smaller companies, simply
because they can no longer see their way to making a suitably large profit
from working in that particular line of business.'
He continues: 'Smaller companies are the life blood of the British economy:
it is unfortunate that the larger financial institutions are simply walking
away from their responsibility, leaving the crucial task of research and
dealing to smaller firms such as ourselves.'
The 15 companies mentioned by DB&amp;K include Fortnum &amp; Mason (the up-market
London department store); John Swann &amp; Sons (a Scottish livestock
auctioneer); British &amp; American Film Holdings (an investment company); and
Toye &amp; Co (a maker of badges and other insignia, and uniforms).
I requested all the available reports written by Mark Wheeler, the firm's
smaller companies research analyst, and found them very interesting although
I am not seeking to increase my exposure to SEATS companies just now as I
already have direct, or personal pension scheme, holdings in three of them.
But anyone wishing to receive copies of Wheeler's reports, and details of
the firm's broking services, can write to Boyle at Gun House, 1/4 Artillery
Passage, London E1 7LJ.
In my view, there should be a rival to the stock exchange specialising in
smaller companies. After all, in Canada (with a smaller population than the
UK) there is a main stock exchange plus the Vancouver exchange specialising
in smaller issues.
In the US, the American Stock Exchange enjoys enormous success trading
largely in shares of small to medium size concerns, while the New York Stock
Exchange concentrates mainly on the larger companies. Why should the UK
Stock Exchange enjoy a monopoly of trading - especially as the traumas of
the coming Taurus system are likely to make a non-Taurus-based stock market
even more appealing to the private investor and to smaller companies?
In the absence of such a second exchange, though, SEATS is the next best
thing.
I have long believed that more money can be made over the long term by
investing in small companies than in giant corporations. As recent events
have shown, yet again, it is easier for a small company to increase its
profits by, say, 25-50 per cent in a year than it is for a company the size
of IBM.
It should always be remembered, however, that not all SEATS companies have
shares worth buying: their future prospects may be dismal. And even well-run
SEATS companies with good prospects can sometimes find their shares subject
to sharp variations in price. So, the private investor has to be
particularly careful when spending his money.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Fimbra loophole - Investor protection
fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LOOPHOLE in investor protection is affecting investors who have dealt with
members of Fimbra - the Financial Intermediaries, Managers and Brokers
Regulatory Association - since the Financial Services Act came into force in
1988.
Some are finding that although the investments they bought were long term,
the protection offered by Fimbra was not. In many cases protection ended
when the firm left Fimbra, or, at most, 12 months after its departure.
The result is that an investors with a complaint against a former Fimbra
member may have only the costly option of suing for redress. Fimbra says it
cannot compel former members to submit to the free Consumer Arbitration
Scheme even if they have since become appointed representatives of another
Fimbra member.
If the former Fimbra member becomes a tied agent of an insurance or unit
trust company, the regulator Lautro, the Life assurance and Unit Trust
Regulatory Organisation, has no responsibility for dealing with complaints
about business conducted under Fimbra banner.
Investors have no recourse to the Investors Compensation Scheme, which only
handles claims against firms declared insolvent officially. The regulatory
gap appears primarily to have snared investors who bought home income plans
from a number of Fimbra members in the late 1980s. The plans were packaged
investments combining a mortgage and an equity-linked bond, sold as capable
of simultaneously financing the loan and providing an income.
Real life departed from the sales scripts when house prices fell against a
background of rising interest rates. By the time problems became acute and
investors complained - often that risk warnings had been inadequate - Fimbra
said it was too late.
This message was repeatedly conveyed to about 20 investors who had dealt
with Findley Insurance Brokers.
John Kirby, Fimbra complaints manager, wrote to one couple last July: ' . .
.investors (in dispute with Findley) do not have a right to refer their
dispute to the Fimbra Consumer Arbitration Scheme as an alternative to court
action, because Findley ceased to be a member of Fimbra on May 1 1991.
'The firm's membership of Fimbra ceased prior to the amendment in December
1991 of the Consumer Arbitration Scheme rules which enabled the referral of
disputes for up to twelve months post-membership. You will understand that
the association is not empowered to retrospectively impose obligations on
firms which have ceased to be members in their won right.'
Sympathising with the investors' problem, Kirby said they must rely on their
'normal legal rights' in order to establish a claim.
Writing to another Findley client, in October, to reject a June request for
arbitration, Iris Baker, of the Fimbra complaints department, explained that
Fimbra's rules were binding in contract only, so that when Findley resigned
on May 1, 1991 it immediately ceased to have any obligation under the
Arbitration Scheme in respect of claims made after that date.
'As a matter of contract law, it is not open to Fimbra to impose on a
unilateral basis, a new obligation or a new duty on a former member after
mutual contractual duties have become non-existent by resignation.'
Baker wrote: 'It follows that the amended 1991 Arbitration schemes rules
against Findley, a non-member, but could only operate prospectively in
respect of actual and future members as at December 1, 1991.'
Although Fimbra could 'invite co-operation' from Findley, Baker said that it
could not, as a matter of law, compel submission to arbitration.
'You will no doubt wish to consider the merits of pursuing the claim through
the courts,' she concluded.
The investors were highly dissatisfied, feeling that Fimbra could have taken
a much tougher line with Findley: the firm had effectively remained under
its regulation, having joined the Fimbra-member network Countrywide
Independent Advisers as an appointed representative.
Last November, Countrywide's compliance officer Andrew Ruff informed an
accountant representing some of the investors that the network had 'advised'
Findley to submit to arbitration. But it was not until last week that he was
able to confirm Findley's agreement.
'Our role has been to act as an honest broker, to see if we can't assist
with a sensible solution', said Countrywide managing director Peter Tamm,
who joined the firm in October. He said the network had not been aware of
any disputes with investors when Findley became an appointed agent in 1990.
These only came to light in March 1992.
Tamm said the network prided itself on vetting both agents and products  -
it had never approved the sale of home income plans. He conceded some
surprise at Fimbra's assertion that it could only 'invite' co-operation:
'I would have thought they did have some sort of suasion, especially since
the membership of Fimbra is not entirely severed - it is at one remove,'
Tamm said. 'Nevertheless, Fimbra makes its own rules so I guess they know.'
At Lautro, Colin Hawtin said the organisation would want to be aware of any
complaints against Fimbra members becoming tied agents in case of any impact
on their fit and proper status.
He added: 'There is a weakness there: as an investor you bought from an
independent financial adviser when the Financial Services Act existed,
something is wrong but he is a tied agent and you don't have any recourse.
You are on your own and there is nothing Lautro can do about it.'
However, Hawtin said information about complaints passed among regulators
would lead member companies to keep former independent tied agents under
special scrutiny. Meanwhile, the committee setting up the Personal
Investment Authority is looking at ways of ending the 12-month limitation on
responsibility for Fimbra quitters.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Where there's a will . . . - . . .
there's a way to appoint executors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APPOINTING a friend as executor to your will might mean one friend less. So,
considerate people often choose to give this onerous responsibility to a
bank or solicitor. But they would be making a mistake according to Which?,
the Consumer's Association's monthly magazine.
Simon Hinde, the editor, says: 'Banks and solicitors can take years to
administer a will and charge enormous sums for the privilege. Over-charging
and incompetence can result in years of wrangling and cost thousands of
pounds.'
Which? quotes one case where the Midland bank mis-read a will and paid
almost Pounds 50,000 too much in inheritance tax. A beneficiary spotted the
mistake. It took two years to wind up the estate and the bank charged Pounds
11,000.
One solicitor charged almost Pounds 6,000 and took nearly five years to deal
with a Pounds 120,000 will. He also retained a further Pounds 4,673 against
potential charges.
In another case, Barclays bank charged more than Pounds 5,000 to close six
bank accounts, wind up a pension and distribute the money among three
people. It took seven months to do the work.
Which? estimates total bank charges for administering a simple will as:
Barclays Pounds 6,072, Lloyds Pounds 5,776, Midland Pounds 4,629 and
National Westminster Pounds 6,497. It advises people to appoint a
professional as executor only as a last resort.
Anyone making a will has to appoint an executor to administer it after their
death. The work involves paying taxes and debts, selling property, and
ensuring that the beneficiaries receive their entitlements.
It is common to appoint a spouse or trusted relative and it is often a good
idea for two people to share the responsibility, particularly if one is a
beneficiary. Lay executors can then appoint professionals to carry out the
work and will be able to exert more control over them.
Before appointing a friend or relative, their approval should be sought
because there is little that beneficiaries can do if a lay executor does a
bad job. They can be taken to court but negligence may be difficult to
prove, quite apart from the expense.
People who use the will-writing service of a bank will find that a condition
of the service is that the bank be made executor. But if you have to appoint
a professional, Which? advises people to avoid banks in favour of a good
solicitor.
The professional's charges should be established and there should be a
clause in the will to arrange payment of these.
If you have grounds for complaint against a bank as executor, you should
write to the Banking Ombudsman, Citadel House, 5-10 Fetter Lane, London EC4
1BR.
If your cause for grievance is a solicitor, write to the Solicitors'
Complaints Bureau, Portland House, Stag Place, London SW1E 5BL. If you are
dissatisfied with the outcome, you can take the matter further to the Legal
Services Ombudsman, 22 Oxford Court, Oxford Street, Manchester M2 3WQ.
Anyone who has made a will should make sure that it is kept up to date.
Mintel, the market research group, found that one in six is out of date,
often because of remarriage or having children.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Top annuity rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST table of annuity rates reflects the falls which have taken place
since the base rate cut. Since 1990, according to William Burrows of Annuity
Direct, base rates have fallen by 60 per cent and annuity rates by 20 per
cent.
These figures for annual payments are made on the assumption that annuities
grow by 5 per cent each year. Last month's table quotes level annuities,
which remain unchanged and offer a higher initial annual pay-out.
Readers should also note that the Royal National Pension Fund for Nurses
(RNPFN) provides annuities only for the medical profession.
All annuities are payable monthly in advance, and have no guarantee. The
figures are supplied by the Annuity Bureau Limited, 11-12 Hanover Square,
London W1R 9HD. Tel. 071-495 1495.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: F&amp;C; achievement with a touch of
adventure - Investment Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a reassuring solidity about the Foreign and Colonial investment
trust. It is both the largest trust - with gross assets of Pounds 1,405m -
and the oldest.
Its name conjures up its Victorian origins. Founded in 1868, it was designed
to offer investors a better return than that available on gilts (then
yielding 3 per cent). The original portfolio contained such exotica as
Danubian bonds and Egyptian railway loans.
Michael Hart, its joint manager, joined Foreign &amp; Colonial in 1953 and has
been running the trust since 1969. Along the way, he passed his company
secretary examinations and studied at night school to get a degree from the
London School of Economics.
The trust has an excellent long-term record - in terms of net asset
performance, it was second in the international general sector over the 10
years to end-1992, according to the Association of Investment Trust
Companies.
Someone who invested Pounds 1,000 in 1945, and then re-invested all the
dividends, would now have more than Pounds 635,000; the same sum invested in
a building society would have grown to just under Pounds 14,000.
It all sounds respectable and solid but Foreign &amp; Colonial actually does
some quite racy things. It speculates in currencies - at the end of 1992,
for example, 40 per cent of its assets were in the UK stock market but only
31 per cent were in sterling.
The trust is prepared to 'gear up' by borrowing to invest in shares, as
witnessed by its Pounds 110m debenture issue in November 1989. It is also
willing to venture into unusual areas, being one of the first British
investors to buy Japanese stocks - in 1961 - and moving into Brazil early in
the 1970s.
Foreign &amp; Colonial also tries to take a contrarian approach and buys into
markets when they are unfashionable. This approach does not always work -
the trust was too optimistic about the Japanese market in 1992, for instance
 -but the strategy is crucial to long-term success.
Such a large trust, covering such a wide area, cannot be run by one man
alone. Eric Elstob is the other joint manager, while Andrew Barker looks at
the American market, Ian Wright at the Far East, and Stephen White at
Europe.
At the end of 1992, the spread of assets was UK (40 per cent), Europe (15
per cent), US (30 per cent), Japan (9 per cent), other Far East (4 per cent)
and Latin America (2 per cent). The list of 10 biggest stocks has an
international flavour: BTR, Shell, BAT, Robert Fleming, Glaxo, Cable &amp;
Wireless and BT are all British but Home Depot, Great Lakes and Sysco are
from the US.
It is Foreign &amp; Colonial's international spread that appeals so much to
private investors, who would find it very costly to construct such a
diversified portfolio on their own. The global spread also explains its
success, as the long-term fall in sterling has boosted the value of the
group's international stocks.
It does mean, though, that the trust can offer only a lowish yield - of 2
per cent - and does not qualify for full Pep status (see below). So, it is
most suitable for those seeking long-term capital growth.
Large general investment trusts fell out of favour in the 1980s, and some -
like Globe, once the largest trust of all - disappeared via takeover. But
Foreign &amp; Colonial has been nimble enough to avoid this fate; it was the
first trust to launch a savings scheme in 1984.
Since then, the number of shareholders has almost quintupled - to 56,751 -
which has helped to narrow the discount considerably.
The trust owns 30.5 per cent of its management company, Foreign &amp; Colonial
Management, which has around Pounds 7.5bn of assets under management. Hypo
Bank of Bavaria owns a 50 per cent stake in F&amp;C Management.
In 1991, the trust announced its 21st consecutive annual increase in
dividend. That sort of consistency has been the key to its success; and
although Hart, who is 59, must retire some day, it is hard to see any reason
why the trust should slip from its previous high standards.
Key facts. The trust had gross assets of Pounds 1,405m and net assets of
Pounds 1,223m as of February 3. At the close of business that day, the net
asset value per share was 237p and the shares were trading at 219p, a
discount of 7.7 per cent. The dividend yield was 2 per cent and the annual
management fee is 0.3 per cent.
Board. The trust has a large and diverse board. Apart from Hart, Elstob,
Barker, Oliver Dawson and James Oglivy, all from the management group, there
is also Sir Timothy Bevan (a former Barclays chairman); Sir John Egan, the
chief executive of BAA; Haruko Fukuda, a director of Nikko Europe; Lord
Lennox, a former ambassador to Spain; and Lord Rockley, vice-chairman of
Kleinwort Benson. The chairman of the trust is John Sclater, also chairman
of Berisford International.
Savings scheme and Pep details.
The minimum investment in the savings scheme is Pounds 25 a month. The only
charges are brokers' commission of 0.2 per cent and government stamp duty of
0.5 per cent.
Because Foreign &amp; Colonial has more than 50 per cent of its assets outside
the European Community, it does not qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 annual
Pep allowance. Instead, you can invest Pounds 1,500 into the main trust and
top up with one of the other trusts run by the group.
On a lump sum Pep, there is an initial charge of Pounds 50 plus VAT (Pounds
5 plus VAT a month for regular savings); there is also an annual
administration charge of Pounds 5 plus VAT a month. There is a top-up charge
of Pounds 25 plus VAT and dealing charges within the Pep are 0.2 per cent.
The minimum lump sum Pep investment is Pounds 2,000, or Pounds 100 a month.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Finance &amp; The Family (Getting an Income): Small savers start
here . . .
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TAX-EXEMPT special savings accounts (Tessas) are aimed at the small saver.
They allow tax-free interest to be earned on bank and building society
deposits so long as the account has been kept open for five years. The
maximum amount that can be deposited in the first year is Pounds 3,000, with
limits of Pounds 1,800 in each subsequent year up to a maximum of Pounds
9,000 over five years.
Most Tessas pay interest annually, but those with a monthly income option
include Alliance &amp; Leicester, Coventry, National &amp; Provincial and Northern
Rock.
Pros. Tax-exempt interest is the main attraction of a Tessa, but many people
forget they can draw the net interest without losing the tax advantage. The
capital must be untouched for five years to obtain the tax benefit.
If interest is withdrawn, it will be paid net of basic-rate tax. The amount
withdrawn must not exceed the net amount that would have been paid if tax
had been deducted. For example, a basic-rate taxpayer getting Pounds 400 in
gross interest can withdraw only Pounds 300. The 'tax' will remain in the
Tessa, to be included in the overall return. Rates of interest tend to be
higher than on other savings accounts.
Cons. Few institutions have penalties for withdrawing interest but check
this. Confederation Bank's fixed-rate Tessa With a Plus requires six months'
notice for interest withdrawal; there is also 180 days' loss of interest.
There have been some fixed-rate Tessas but most pay variable rates.
Rates. In the range of 5.5 to 8.75 per cent gross, depending on whether the
institution has cut its charges following the recent base rate drop.
GILT-EDGED STOCKS
BONDS issued by the UK government are known as gilt-edged stocks, or gilts,
because of their unimpeachable security. They offer a fixed return for a
fixed period (except for those that are index-linked). Payment normally is
made semi-annually. The cheapest way of buying them is through the National
Savings stock register at the post office.
Pros. The return is fixed and cannot fall once bought. Investors are sure
what the repayment value will be and, short of revolution, it is certain.
Dealing costs are cheap and the market is very liquid, making gilts easy to
sell. Any profits are free of capital gains tax.
Cons. Many gilts are trading at above face value; thus, investors are
'locking in' a capital loss on purchase which cannot be offset, for CGT
purposes, against gains elsewhere. If interest rates rise generally, the
price of gilts probably will fall; inflation will, in any case, eat into the
value of the investment. Short-term gilts are offering returns which are
little better than those available from building societies.
Rates. Redemption yields vary from 5.5 per cent on short-term issues to 8.8
per cent at the longer end. These figures take account of both income and
the capital gain/loss to maturity.
PERSONAL EQUITY PLANS
SHARE DIVIDENDS have always been a useful source of income but rarely have
their attractions been so apparent as now. With the stock market yielding
around 4.3 per cent and base rates at 6 per cent, the gap between dividend
and cash returns is very small
What is more, the existence of the personal equity plan means that investors
can receive dividends gross. All income and gains within a Pep are tax-free.
Pros. There is no time limit on holding a Pep, and investors can put in
Pounds 9,000 a year, via a general and single company plan. Dividends tend
to grow in line with the economy over the long term, so there is more scope
for income growth than with a building society.
Cons. The value of a Pep can fall and dividends can be cut. These
investments are best held for the long term. Charges can outweight the tax
benefits on many plans, especially for a low-rate taxpayer or for those who
cannot afford to invest the full allowance.
Rates. The income yields of Peps vary widely. Three income plans launched
this week (see page II) yield between 5 and 7 per cent. But look carefully
at the investments which the Pep will hold; a very high yield can mean very
high risk or not much prospect for growth. The lower the charges, the
better.
NATIONAL SAVINGS
NATIONAL Savings Income bonds are government-issued and sold at post
offices. They pay taxable monthly income at variable rates. The minimum
purchase is Pounds 2,000, with additional purchases in Pounds 1,000 lumps.
The maximum is Pounds 50,000 for an individual.
Pros. Safe and simple way to receive monthly income. Interest is paid gross
which is convenient for non-taxpayers.
Cons. Only half the advertised rate of interest will be paid if the bond is
encashed in the first year. Three months' notice is required for encashment.
The rate is variable and can often be beaten by the best building societies.
Rates. Currently 7 per cent gross. NS gives six weeks notice of rate
changes.
PIBS
PERMANENT interest-bearing shares (Pibs) are issued by building societies to
raise capital. They will not be redeemed - there is no repayment date - so
the fixed interest they pay is for life. The first issues, in 1991, were
aimed mainly at institutions but several building societies, including
Bristol &amp; West and Britannia, have put them within reach of private
investors by making the minimum investment Pounds 1,000.
Pros. Pibs offer high yields compared with other fixed-rate investments. The
fixed income is paid twice a year net of basic-rate tax. A number of
companies have packaged them, so they pay out income more often during the
year. Pibs are exempt from capital gains tax.
Cons. Since Pibs are issued by a building society, they are riskier than,
say, government-issued gilts; this is why their yields are higher. There is
no compensation available if the society collapses and it can skip interest
payments if it gets into difficulty without having to pay them later.
The only way of getting back capital is to sell the shares, but you risk
making a capital loss if you do that. The market for dealing in Pibs is
illiquid, which might make them hard to sell in troubled times.
Rates. Present gross yields range from 10.3 to 11.9 per cent, depending on
the issue.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE results season springs to life next Thursday with a handful of the UK's
largest companies reporting. British
Petroleum's figures should show it has begun to recover from its recent
nadir. With historical cost profits of Pounds 100m forecast for the final
quarter, losses for the year are expected to be Pounds 487m (profits Pounds
1.2bn).
Last year, BP heavily restructured management and operations. After several
quarters of negative cashflow, it is expected to have been cash neutral in
the final quarter.
Lloyds Bank, which has been the most profitable of the clearing banks in
recent years, announces its full-year results for 1992 on Friday. It is the
first big clearing bank to report after bringing forward its announcement by
two weeks. Analysts anticipate pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 650m after
last year's Pounds 645m, but one estimate is of Pounds 745m. Provisions for
bad and doubtful debts are estimated at between Pounds 650m and Pounds 870m,
against Pounds 918m in 1991.
Reuters, the international news and information group, is expected on
Tuesday to reveal an increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 340m to Pounds
380m for the year to December.
British Telecommunications unveils its third quarter results on Thursday,
these are expected to show its resilience. Pre-tax profits are expected to
be Pounds 720m-Pounds 750m (Pounds 759m a year earlier).

FT  06 FEB 93 / Finance &amp; The Family (Getting an income): How to make money
when interest rates fall - John Authers, Philip Coggan and Scheherazade
Daneshkhu examine options beyond the building society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS, PHILIP COGGAN and SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAVERS ARE finding it harder and harder to find products that offer them a
decent income. Too many have relied on the building society for too long.
Many people are chasing from one building society to another in search of
higher rates, but this game is frustrating.
Rates which are ahead of the market one week are cut the next, and
attractive accounts can quickly be closed to new business.
Savers need to explore other options. Some of these can be complex, even
bewildering; so, on this page and the next, we outline some of the main
income-producing products and indicate their pros, their cons, and the rates
available.
Product providers are getting ever more ingenious in their efforts to
attract investors. As in the US, money market funds are becoming more
popular; these invest in short-term debt of banks and other companies, and
offer returns which are close to the level of base rates.
They are never the top payers in the market but they should always be
competitive and may save the investor the bother of switching constantly
between building societies. Fidelity and M &amp; G now offer money market funds
which give cheque books to those who deposit more than Pounds 5,000.
Another cash-based option is offshore accounts. These pay income gross,
which is useful for non-taxpayers. However, quite often, they pay rates that
are higher than those on domestic accounts, even after allowing for tax.
Going offshore can prove risky, but there are some well-known names offering
such accounts.
With all these products, you need to remember that there is a relationship
between risk and reward.  Normally, the higher the return, the higher the
risk.
Any exceptions to this common-sense maxim relate usually to charges on the
fund. The lower these charges are, the more the manager can pass on (in the
form of income) to the investor. Cazenove has a low-charging, high-yielding
personal equity plan on offer this week (see Page II).
The investor needs also to make a choice between flexibility and return.
Some products offer higher rates by tying-up your money for a set period.
But a few pounds of extra income may not be worth the loss of easy access.
We can give only the outlines of these products on our pages; those who want
more information should consult an independent financial adviser.
ANNUITY ATTRACTIONS
NO INVESTMENT will give you bigger 'income' pay-outs than an annuity.
However, it does so by repaying all your initial capital at the same time,
so annuities are inappropriate as the sole investment for anyone who needs
to preserve their capital.
When you buy an annuity, from a life office or friendly society, you pay a
lump sum in return for a guaranteed income for the rest of your life (or for
a fixed period in the case of a temporary annuity). The life office holds on
to any remaining capital after your death, and invests in gilts to ensure
that it can meet its guarantees.
Payments are governed by two factors - your age (and hence your life
expectancy), and the rates available on gilts.
Pros. Annuities offer better value the older you are and the higher gilt
yields are. For the elderly (as a rule, men over 70 and women over 75), this
can make an annuity a powerful income-producing tool.
Annuities bought with funds not derived from a pension scheme have
relatively favourable tax treatment. Payments are divided for tax purposes
into capital repayment and income; you are taxed only on the income element.
Those who need to retain capital could combine a temporary annuity with a
lump sum investment for growth, such as a Pep. If this goes well, you may be
able to repay the capital by the time the annuity stops paying out. This
lessens the risk to your capital, but it could still be eroded.
Cons. If you die shortly after buying an annuity, your capital will be lost
to your heirs, so this may not be a good investment for those in poor
health. Returns may also be poor for those who buy when gilt yields are low.
Rates. Temporary annuities can produce a high yield. A woman aged 70 paying
Pounds 20,000 would receive a gross income of Pounds 4,931.16 (Pounds 4,736
net) for five years from Equitable Life, according to the Annuity Bureau.
For a woman aged 80 the top rate is Pounds 5,365.20, from Standard Life.
Men have a lower life expectancy, which is reflected in higher rates - a
70-year-old would receive Pounds 5,124.84 each year from Equitable Life (net
Pounds 4,913.40), while the top rate for an 80-year-old is Pounds 5,758.80
(net Pounds 5,497.20), according to the Annuity Bureau. (See table on Page V
for other rates).
GUARANTEE OF GIBS
GUARANTEED income bonds (Gibs) allow investors to lock into prevailing
interest rates for up to five years. They are a variant of single-premium
life assurance bonds, offered mainly by the smaller life assurance
companies. Their income is fixed at the outset and cannot be revised. This
rate is determined primarily by the yields on gilts.
Basic-rate tax is paid within the fund. Top-rate taxpayers will be liable to
pay the difference between basic and top rates on their income.
Most companies offer the bonds over periods of one, two, three, four and
five years. Interest rates will vary according to the time and the amount of
money put in.
Sums as low as Pounds 1,000 are not encouraged by many companies and most
will offer a higher percentage income for a large lump sum. Income can be
paid monthly or yearly.
Pros. Because the rate is set at the start, it is guaranteed for the period
of the bond. This gives the investor certainty and protection if interest
rates fall. If the life company offering a Gib goes bust, the Policyholders
Protection Act will pay out 90 per cent of the original amount invested,
making the bonds more secure than many other options.
Cons. If interest rates rise, investors may find themselves 'locked in' at
uncompetitive returns. Since basic-rate tax is deducted and cannot be
reclaimed, these products are unsuitable for non-taxpayers.
Rates. Returns have fallen substantially in recent years. Over one year, the
best rate on Pounds 5,000 at the moment is 4.75 per cent annually and 3.93
per cent monthly, according to Baronworth Investment Services. Over five
years, the best rate on Pounds 5,000 is 6.74 per cent annually and 6 per
cent monthly.
FIXED-RATE BONDS
BANK AND building society fixed-rate bonds are a way of fixing the return on
a deposit over 12, 24 or 36 months. You pay a lump sum and interest is added
annually, monthly or on maturity. The minimum balance is usually Pounds
5,000 but could be as low as Pounds 1,000 in some cases. Like any other
fixed-rate product, you buy the bond to protect your income if you think
that interest rates will fall further.
Pros. By fixing the rate of interest, you know your total return in advance.
The bonds are easy to acquire and are a secure investment so long as the
bank or society is sound.
Cons. Interest rates could rise, in which case you will have made a bad
decision to fix when rates were lower. In most cases, you cannot redeem the
bond earlier than the prescribed term.
Rates. These depend on the amount paid and the term of the bond. Interest
rates on monthly income bonds will usually be lower than those paying
interest annually or on maturity.
One-year bonds requiring a Pounds 1,000 to Pounds 2,000 minimum are paying
about 5.75 per cent gross. Interest on larger amounts is in the 6 to 7 per
cent range. Two- and three-year bonds are paying up to 7 per cent.
Bristol &amp; West has just launched a five-year 'escalator bond.' The interest
rate is fixed at 7 per cent gross in the first year (April 1993 to March
1994) and increases by a fixed 0.5 of a percentage point for each subsequent
year. In the fifth year, therefore, it will pay a fixed rate of 9 per cent.
Minimum investment is Pounds 5,000.
INVESTMENT BONDS
SINGLE-PREMIUM investment bonds are sold by insurance companies and come in
several types - investing in equities, gilts, properties or a combination of
the three. Investors can withdraw 5 per cent of the original value of their
money each year without any basic-rate tax liability; higher-rate taxpayers
can postpone their liability until the bond is cashed in.
Bonds are either mainly 'unit-linked' - which allows investors the freedom
to switch between funds without paying entry charges - or 'with-profits,'
where non-reversible bonuses are added on each year.
Pros. Being able to withdraw 5 per cent a year can be handy and competes
with net rates from building societies. There is also the opportunity for
capital growth. As the bonds are classified as insurance policies, some life
assurance is included.
Cons. Care must be taken over the timing of cashing them in since the gain
could push a basic-rate taxpayer into the higher-rate band. Similarly, an
investor's age allowance could be endangered.
The bonds have charges which will eat into your investment. Levies are
similar to unit trusts - 5 per cent initial with a 1 per cent annual
management charge. If the capital fails to grow, you could be consuming your
capital every time you take your 5 per cent income. The performance of
managed insurance funds has not been as good as unit trusts over the long
term.
A BOND FUND PORTFOLIO
BOND FUNDS - unit trusts which invest in gilts and other fixed-interest
securities - have arrived in the past year. This could be an example of the
investment community leaving yesterday's bright idea until today, following
two years of strong performance by gilts. Prices are now higher;
accordingly, yields have dropped.
Income on these funds tend to be paid twice a year, so you will need to
construct a portfolio of funds if you want a monthly income.
Pros. Yields on gilts with medium- and long-term maturities are now above
base rates, so investors can increase their income by buying the right fund.
Doing this saves them the worry of choosing the right gilt for their needs
(see Page IV item on gilts). The manager will try to use his skill to get
income or capital growth (or a bit of both).
Some funds have reduced their initial charges (the two Aberdeen gilt funds
have no initial charge at all), while the risks facing private investors who
play the gilts market on their own have grown.
Cons. Charges on some funds can be high; this can take a dent out of the
income return. Other funds have such high yields that they are eating up the
capital, which could provide investors with a shock when they come to cash
in their units. In any case, if interest rates rise, gilt prices could fall,
leaving the investor with a loss.
Any profits on a gilt unit trust are liable to capital gains tax, while
gilts bought directly are not. If you buy a gilt directly, the yield is
fixed till maturity; but yields on bond funds can fall.
If bond funds invest in debt issued by companies, rather than the
government, there is a credit risk if the company fails.
Rates. The biggest yield at the end of January came from Abtrust Fixed
Interest, with 9.23 per cent. Yields above 9 per cent also were available
from Aberdeen Gilt Income, Aetna Preference, Guinness Flight Premium Fixed
Interest, Henderson Preference &amp; Gilt, and M&amp;G Gilt &amp; Fixed Interest Income.
But remember that the fund with the biggest yield is not necessarily the
best; it might involve the risk of capital loss.
International bond funds, which offer broader diversification, have
generally lower yields of around 5 or 6 per cent. They involve a currency
risk but the possibility of a currency gain if sterling declines.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Markets: There is life beyond gilts - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU are feeling disgruntled with the low returns available on building
society and bank deposits, what are the options?
Many investors already hold equities, and should be careful not to
concentrate all their investments in one area. For investors who are
prepared to look beyond the gilts market, there are other options.
The success of permanent interest bearing shares (Pibs) issued by building
societies proves that there is a willingness to get to grips with new
products, if the potential rewards - 13 per cent interest rates on the first
Pibs issues - are sufficiently attractive.
The fact that capital is never repaid, and the building society can pass up
interest payments did not dent enthusiasm for the product.
The latest debt instruments issued by building societies - called collared
floating-rate notes - have a rather more complex structure, but also offer
some clear advantages.
The main attraction of collared floating-rate notes is that they offer a
guaranteed minimum return which is higher than current money market rates.
Three building societies, the Leeds Permanent, Bradford &amp; Bingley, and
Halifax Building Societies, have so far used the structure, issuing notes to
the value of Pounds 300m. Leeds Permanent, the first building society to
make use of the structure, offers investors a minimum Interest rate of 7 per
cent and a maximum of 11 per cent.
In effect, the investor opts to sacrifice any potential interest rate
increase above, say, 11 per cent, in return for a guaranteed minimum income
of around 7 per cent.
'It is quite a nice move for someone coming out of a building society
account, who wants to have their money reasonably close at hand,' said Paul
Killik, a partner of stockbroking firm Killik &amp; Co.
With money market rates at around 6 per cent, the prospect of a 7 per cent
minimum interest rate, or floor, appears rather attractive. In theory,
floating-rate notes should hold their value better than fixed-rate bonds.
Because the interest rate is re-set in line with prevailing money-market
rates every six months, the market price of the notes should be protected.
However, since the interest on these collared floating-rate notes is capped
at 11 per cent, if base rates shoot up rapidly, the price of the notes could
tumble.
Of course, fixed-rate bonds provide even less protection against possible
interest rates rises, since any relative decline in the interest rate
compared to market rates must be reflected in the price.
So the question is whether the potential capital loss - which would not be
built into conventional floating rate notes or deposit accounts - is reward
by the higher immediate income.
'It is not a first step into the market, but could make sense as a small
part of a sensibly balanced portfolio', said David Barker, a director of
Hoare Govett.
The minimum investment for collared floating-rate notes so far has been
Pounds 1,000 or Pounds 10,000, but these issues are targeted at
institutional investors as well as retail investors. The notes can be
purchased through any reasonably sized stockbroker; Killik charges
commission of Pounds 40 on the first Pounds 10,000.
Richard Boath, a director of Salomon Brothers who worked on the structure,
believes that the next step is for building societies or banks themselves to
offer deposit accounts with minimum and maximum interest rate levels, but
with the principal guaranteed. An interesting option for retail investors
but one that is still some way off.
Another new structure is the so-called reverse floating-rate note. Although
not designed for retail investors, some brokers have been looking at the
product as a potentially interesting investment. However, the structure is
extremely risky.
Essentially, it is a bet that interest rates will fall, since the amount of
interest paid increases as the benchmark interest rate falls. However,
should interest rates move in the wrong direction, not only will the return
on the notes decline swiftly, but the price of the notes is likely to
collapse.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Markets: Dow breaks through to brave new heights - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BULLS were firmly in command of Wall Street this week, and many analysts
think their charge is far from over.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finally broke through to an all-time peak
on Thursday, topping the record 3,413.21 reached on June 1 last year, when
it closed at 3416.74.
However, the Dow was only playing catch-up with two broader market indices,
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and Nasdaq index of smaller stocks, which have
been setting records.
The Nasdaq index has risen more than 20 per cent since early October,
underlining Wall Street's traditional enthusiasm for small stocks in the
early stages of an economic recovery.
The Dow, which tracks 30 of the country's largest companies, has risen by
only around 9 per cent since, held back by the large representation in its
ranks of cyclical stocks. Their performance tends to track the rise and fall
of the economy, and the problems facing some of its best-known constituents,
notably International Business Machines and General Motors.
The Dow's move into new territory this week was sparked by good economic
news both at home and abroad. The overseas contribution came on Thursday
when both the the German Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan lowered interest
rates, raising hopes of a revival in the flagging global economy.
In the US, a string of statistics bolstered the belief that the economy is
headed for much more robust growth.
January retail sales were stronger than expected as the Christmas consumer
splurge continued into the New Year. The index of leading economic
indicators jumped 1.9 per cent in December, the biggest rise since 1983.
Yesterday's employment report for January was reasonably positive, with
non-farm jobs rising by 106,000, in line with Wall Street expectations, but
not good enough for it to cause appreciable inflationary anxiety in the bond
market.
The most positive statistic of the week was the 2.7 per cent jump in US
productivity in 1992, the largest gain in 20 years.
This followed five years in which productivity growth averaged some 0.5 per
cent and provides further evidence that the US economy is emerging from
recession much leaner and more competitive, which bodes well for
profitability.
This new vigour has also shown through in the financial reporting season,
which is nearly over. Based on results so far, analysts say operating
earnings were up 20 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1992, compared with
the same period of 1991, and they expect further strong rises as companies
benefit from the recovering economy.
All this helped the Dow's great leap forward this week. Other factors may
have included greater overseas interest in US stocks, caused by the economic
revival and the strengthening dollar.
Furthermore, long bond yields have at last started moving strongly
downwards. This week yields rose a little in response to the economic news,
but this was offset by an announcement from the federal government that it
will cut the volume of new 30-year bonds it sells next week, and is weighing
a more permanent reduction in long-bond sales.
The stock market's rally may take a pause now, but many analysts believe the
extremely heavy volume of the past week, coupled with the movement by
investors into big, cyclical stocks, shows an underlying momentum that could
carry the Dow 200 or more points higher over the next few months.
A substantial change in the interest rate cycle to tighter money could choke
the rally, but this still seems a long way off, and for now the US markets
are enjoying a benign world of low interest rates, low inflation and healthy
economic growth.
That said, there are still plenty of companies facing huge problems, and
none more so than General Motors, which is struggling to return its
loss-making north American operations to the black.
This week it suffered a further spate of bad news, including a ruling by an
Atlanta court that it had to pay Dollars 105m in accident damages because of
the design of a controversial truck. GM is appealing, but the case could
lead to even heavier financial liabilities for the company.
Standard &amp; Poor's, a leading credit information agency, also downgraded GM's
debt rating, while giving a boost to that of its once-ailing Detroit rival
Chrysler. However, even GM's bad news had a positive side. S&amp;P said the
company's new top management would return GM's north American operations at
least to break-even and said further downgradings were 'unlikely' over the
next few years.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Markets: Giving a pep to savers' incomes - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Philip Coggan, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANNUAL income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen nineteen six,
result happiness.  Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty
pounds ought and six, result misery.
MR MICAWBER'S words in David Copperfield ring specially true for savers at
the moment, with returns falling and spending still rising. How do they get
a decent income now base rates have dropped to 6 per cent?
We devote two pages to the issue this week (see opposite); meanwhile, three
well-known financial companies have launched similar products which attempt
to meet this income need. All combine shares and bonds within a personal
equity plan to offer a decent, tax-free income.
The Cazenove Bond &amp; Utility fund yields 7 per cent by investing in utility
companies such as water, electricity and gas, and in bonds. That yield
allows for the annual charge (a very reasonable 0.5 per cent).
The initial charge of 0.2 per cent is extremely low by industry standards
and means the bid-offer spread on the trust will be around 2 per cent. But
those who want to hold the fund in Pep form must pay a further initial
charge of Pounds 35.
What does this mean in real money? On an investment of Pounds 6,000, the
annual tax-free income will be Pounds 420. The tax saving for a basic-rate
payer will be Pounds 105, and Pounds 168 for the top-rate payer. So, the tax
benefit will outweigh the initial charge in the first year and, for top-rate
payers, the bid-offer spread as well.
The Cazenove fund pays dividends twice a year. The two other new products,
although higher-charging, offer a monthly income facility. This will
undoubtedly increase their appeal to investors although the amount paid each
month will be small in early years.
Fidelity's tax-free income plan is based on a new unit trust called the High
Income fund. This will invest in high-yielding equities and fixed-interest
stocks and will have a yield of 6 per cent. Again, this yield allows for the
effect of the annual management charge (a rather more hefty 1.25 per cent).
The initial charge on the Pep is 2 per cent (4 per cent for those who invest
in the unit trust alone). This should mean the bid-offer spread for Pep
investors is around 3 per cent. As with its other Peps, Fidelity is making
withdrawal charges which fall from 3 per cent in year one to 1 per cent in
year three and zero thereafter.
To turn this into pounds and pence, an investment of Pounds 6,000 would get
an income of Pounds 360, or Pounds 30 a month. The tax saving for a
basic-rate payer would be Pounds 90, and Pounds 144 for the top-rate payer.
The initial charge of Pounds 120 would, thus, be reclaimed by the top-rate
payer in the first year (although not if he withdrew his funds); it would
take part of another year to reclaim the spread as well.
The minimum lump sum investment into the Fidelity fund is Pounds 1,000, or
Pounds 50 for monthly savings.
The M &amp; G Managed Income fund offers, at around 5 per cent, the lowest yield
of the three. It will invest in a variety of M &amp; G's trusts, with up to 40
per cent in the group's Treasury bill fund and in its Gilt &amp; Fixed Interest
fund.
The initial and annual charges of 4.5 and 1.5 per cent respectively are
higher than those made by Fidelity (although M &amp; G imposes no withdrawal
charges). There will be no 'double charging' - that is, investors do not
have to pay the fees of the underlying trusts as well. The minimum
investment will be Pounds 1,000.
On a Pounds 6,000 M&amp;G Pep investment, the annual income would be Pounds 300.
The tax saving for a basic-rate payer would be Pounds 75, and Pounds 120 for
a top-rate payer. Thus, it would take around four years for a basic-rate
payer to earn back the initial charge of Pounds 270, and longer if one
accounts for the 6 per cent bid-offer spread.
Why do the Fidelity and M &amp; G plans have higher charges than the Cazenove
fund? The simple answer is that they are paying commission to intermediaries
to sell the fund and have to reclaim the cost from the investor.
Herein lies the paradox. Advisers and intermediaries are supposed to offer
'best advice.' The Cazenove fund has the highest yield and the lowest
charges and is offered by a blue-chip name; it might seem an obvious piece
of 'best advice' to recommend it for those who need income. But it will
probably raise less money than either of the other two.
Could there be a good reason for recommending any of the M &amp; G and Fidelity
funds ahead of Cazenove? One could argue that the lower the yield, the
greater the potential for capital growth. But only up to a point. If two
portfolios own exactly the same stocks, the one with the lowest charges will
have the highest yield. Then there is the monthly income facility. But would
you rather have Pounds 25 a month from M &amp; G or Pounds 210 every half-year
from Cazenove?
It would be wrong to suggest that all advisers are commission-hungry; many
work very hard to do their best for their clients. But these three funds
will provide a good test case to see if the words 'best advice' mean
anything at all.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Markets: Helmut, the charge is 'adventurism' - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ADVENTURISM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the charge levelled against the Russian central bank this week by President
Boris Yeltsin - was also the theme of an attack on the Bundesbank by the
German chambers of commerce.
For most European businessmen, Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president,
has been the architect of an intolerably high level of interest rates. For
them, the cut in German rates on Thursday came not a moment too soon.
Even the London stock market, less sensitive to the level of German interest
rates since sterling's departure from the ERM, rejoiced. It rose to a new
intra-day high after the cut, with the FT-SE 100 index passing briefly
through 2,900 for the first time.
Yet the German chambers of commerce felt impelled to criticise the
Bundesbank not for tightness but for excessive laxity. The eventual,
essential conquest of inflation was threatened by the cut in rates, they
argued.
Prof. Mervyn King, the economics boss at the Bank of England, has argued in
the past that merely making a central bank independent does not deliver
truly independent monetary policy; you also need a consensus about the
importance of monetary stability. That comment from the German chambers of
commerce gives you some idea what such a consensus means - and just how far
Britain is away from achieving it.
Indeed, to judge from the behaviour of the UK stock market all this week you
would think inflation was a new wonder-drug. On Monday, the market seized on
a report in the press that John Major had personally taken control of
monetary policy and planned to cut base rates by two more percentage points
by the summer.
Even though Downing Street went out of its way to deny this story, the
markets decided it was basically correct. Sterling fell sharply. In spite of
the threat of higher prices on imported goods, the FT-SE 100 index rose 1.6
per cent, to close at 2,851.6. Interest-rate sensitive stocks were among the
big gainers.
Tuesday was calmer, and the index dropped back slightly. But by Wednesday,
with fresh pressure on weaker European currencies and a growing expectation
that the Bundesbank would ease rates the next day, the onward advance of
equities resumed. Blue chips did particularly well, and the FT-SE index more
than made up the previous day's losses, closing at a new high of 2,873.8. On
Thursday, when the German announcement finally came, equities moved up
again, then dropped back. They fell further on Friday, with the index
closing the week at 2,862.9, for a total rise of 55.7. Volume was high - on
Thursday, trading by clients was over Pounds 2bn, its highest since the day
sterling left the ERM.
This enthusiasm for equities came against a steady rumble of worrying
comment from analysts. One theme was the fact that British companies are
paying out a higher proportion of their earnings than at any time since the
mid 1960s.
For the market as a whole, dividend cover - the ratio of companies'
dividends to after-tax earnings per share - has fallen below 1.8 times in
recent weeks. For most of the 1970s and 1980s, it ranged between 2.2 and
3.0.
The figure highlights the extent to which companies have been prepared to
keep dividend payouts high despite the impact of the recession on earnings -
a fact that will be rammed home when the results season gets under way next
Thursday.
The low level of dividend cover is ominous for equities, some analysts
argue, because it implies that companies will be keen to rebuild cover as
their earnings recover in the next few years.
A recent survey of company finance directors by James Capel showed that they
hoped to rebuild cover over time to 2.3 times. To do this, says Capel's Paul
Walton, 'earnings have got to be growing a little bit faster than dividends
for a considerable period of time.'
Dividend growth is particularly important to the actuaries who calculate the
adequacy of pension funds. Slow dividend growth will lower the likely return
from equities relative to bonds, making institutions keener to buy gilts.
Such a trend would be good news for the Treasury and the Bank of England,
faced with the task of selling record amounts of gilts this year. But it
would be bad news for equities. Sushil Wadhwani and Mustaq Shah of Goldman
Sachs reinforced this theme with a weighty piece of research examining the
relative attractions of gilts and equities.
They concluded that equities are likely to outperform gilts by less than in
the past; and that pension funds are likely to regard equity investment as
'riskier' because of a need for steady income flows to pay the pensions of
the growing proportion of retired members.
Equities would still remain the preferred investment, but would form a
smaller proportion of assets than in the past, say the authors. This could
be a medium-term drag on the performance of the stock market; shares would
rise by less than would be warranted by improvements in earnings and
interest rates.
Such thinking failed to influence institutional investors this week. Private
clients have been bullish for months, according to David Jones, chief
executive of the Sharelink dealing service. His figures show that trading by
private clients has been high, and biased towards buying, ever since
October. 'We've only had one or two days in the last few months when we've
had a 'normal' ratio of buys to sells,' he says. For private clients, buying
is now stronger than ever in the past five years, and it is widely spread:
'They're buying everything, right across the market.' In Russia, they would
probably call that adventurism.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Still plenty of North Sea life . . .: The outlook for
British hydro-carbon output is by no means drear, though it depends on who
you talk to. David Lascelles makes a helicopter tour of oil rigs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
OIL BEGAN to flow from the North Sea 25 years ago, providing Britain with a
timely means to gild its fading fortunes. But, as the present row over coal
has shown, oil is a resource over which the average Briton frets as much as
he gloats. The nation must be mad to shut collieries, he says, when it
measures its coal reserves in centuries but oil and gas only in years.
What is the truth? It depends who you talk to.
Unst is Britain's most northerly settlement, clustered round a windswept
inlet of the Shetland islands - an area that drew unwelcome headlines last
month when the tanker Braer ran on to rocks and spilled its entire cargo.
Unst is where you board a helicopter for the 45-minute flight to the Ninian
Central platform, one of those gigantic structures poking out of the sea,
bristling with cranes and pipes.
Ninian is a grand-daddy of the North Sea. It has been braving storms for 24
years, and it shows. Weather-beaten, man-battered, already it is a monument
to Britain's oil age. It is like a small village, with 200 inhabitants and a
huge factory attached. Its generators can produce enough electricity to
power Edinburgh. Migrating birds have made it a staging post.
But it belongs to the past. When Ninian started, it sat astride one of the
most productive fields yet found. The natural pressure in its vast
reservoirs forced out 315,000 barrels of oil a day, enough to supply more
than a fifth of Britain's needs on its own.
Today, liquid still gushes out of Ninian, but more than three-quarters of it
is sea water which has to be pumped into the well to keep up the pressure.
Ninian's workers now spend most of their time removing that water. They pipe
the liquid into huge settling tanks where the oil separates out, rather like
salad dressing left to stand.
To date, 1bn of Ninian's estimated 3bn barrels have been sucked out and
Derek Smith, the Chevron platform manager, thinks they may be able to get
1bn more. But you can never suck an oil well completely dry. Ninian's future
depends on whether they dream up more sophisticated ways of extracting oil,
and whether its price rises enough to justify extra investment. But the
future is inescapable. Ninian is dying, slowly. 'The field could last until
2004 or 2005,' says Smith.
Many people have claimed that Britain's oil wealth has been squandered. That
is not the case at Ninian. Its glory days in the early 1980s also were the
days of sky-high prices. It cashed in at the top of the market and provided
the UK with a bonanza. Now, Ninian is having to adjust to other realities of
the North Sea: declining returns, rising costs, and the tougher regulations
brought on by the 1988 Piper Alpha disaster. To boost its earnings and make
full use of its 110-mile pipeline to the Shetlands, Ninian is developing a
new role for itself as a collecting point for oil from neighbouring fields.
Ninian typifies a passing era. Britain's oil and gas production peaked in
1986 with 166m tonnes of oil equivalent, vastly more than its own needs of
127m tonnes. In 1991, output was down to 139m tonnes, barely meeting demand
of 136m. Over the past 10 years, UK earnings from oil and gas have nearly
halved - from more than Pounds 20bn to Pounds 11bn  - and revenues from
taxes and royalties have plummeted from Pounds 12bn to Pounds 1bn. In 1991,
the oil and gas industry, with all the onshore jobs it sustains, accounted
for a mere 1.5 per cent of Britain's gross national product.
Oilmen will tell you that all the big North Sea fields probably have been
found. In future, it is a matter of developing the smaller ones in between
and finding ways to squeeze extra barrels out of the old ones. This decline
has a lot to do with the weakness of the oil price, which is at a 20-year
low in real terms. This is putting enormous pressure on the North Sea's
traditionally high operating costs, and obliging the government to take a
more lenient line on taxation and regulation. There is talk of some of the
big US companies moving out.
The squeeze is apparent onshore as well. The great sea lochs of Scotland are
packed with idle rigs; others are being towed thousands of miles to the new
oil frontiers, such as Vietnam. Some months ago, Ben Line, one of the few
British-owned rig operators, pulled out of the business because of slack
demand. People in Aberdeen, Britain's oil capital, worry if the UK will
preserve enough of its stock of equipment and know-how to sustain an
indigenous industry.
'UK-based industry is doing 80 per cent of the North Sea work but maybe only
5 per cent of the world market,' says Ian Wood, chairman of John Wood Group,
an Aberdeen-based energy service company. 'We've made very little impact on
the world scene. There's nothing like a Division 1 company in the UK.' He is
urging the government to help transform Aberdeen into an oil centre of world
stature: a European Houston.
Two hundred miles south of Ninian is the Nelson rig. On the flight, you
notice the multitude of platforms all around: to the east is Brent, another
grand-daddy; to the south, Alwyn; to the west, Heather - all producing oil
and gas. Gas flares create bright spots in the leaden sea. It does not look
like an industry in decline.
Approaching Nelson, we pass the platforms of the Forties' field, British
Petroleum's biggest find. The helicopter circles, testing the wind currents.
On the helipad, heavily-kitted emergency teams stand by. The machine settles
on to a patchwork of thick rope, to stop the wheels sliding.
The story on Nelson is rather different from Ninian. This is not a
production platform with its feet on the sea floor; it is a floating drill
rig, and it is looking for new oil rather than sucking out old. At its heart
is a huge drill stem capable of reaching five miles under the ocean floor.
Below us lies the Nelson field, as yet untapped but with upwards of 500m
barrels of oil. There is a buzz in the air.
'That's Forties' sand,' says John Shute, the project director at Enterprise
Oil, a part-owner of the field. In his hand is a pile of wet sand which has
been drawn up by the drill. He holds it under an ultra-violet light. It
glows yellow, meaning that it is moist with oil. Nelson's proximity to the
BP field is the reason for the excitement. It is small by comparison - about
a fifth of Forties' size - but is one of the largest being developed, so it
represents a chunk of the North Sea's future.
Nelson is typical of the advances made in 25 years of North Sea exploration.
In the old days, individual rigs moved expensively around the surface,
drilling a string of vertical holes in the seabed. Nelson can do it all from
one spot. Using steerable drill bits, it will bore 32 separate wells,
splaying out in all directions. So sophisticated has directional drilling
become that Nelson's operators are able to aim a well more than two miles
deep with an accuracy of 10ft.
The drill bit has an electronic black box which sends back pulses. These are
picked up by sensors, which measure precisely its position and make course
corrections if needed. Oilmen can even go past a reservoir and bore into it
from underneath if their geologists reckon that will yield more oil.
All this has slashed costs. Gordon Culloch, a burly Mississippian with the
Santa Fe company, which operates the rig, says drilling innovations have
halved the average time taken to bore a North Sea well to 30 days. 'What
it's all about is productivity,' he says. 'Fields are going to get smaller,
and we just have to be more efficient. There's no future for guys who can't
do that.'
About a dozen oilfields continue to be found each year. Most of them are
much smaller than Nelson, but they help to preserve Britain's
reserves-to-production ratio - a key measure of how long the oil will last.
In fact, the present gloom might be deceptive. Most forecasters believe UK
oil and gas output will surge to a new peak during the late 1990s as the
Nelson generation of wells comes on stream.
And oil companies have far from exhausted the search. 'There's 10 years of
healthy exploration left in the North Sea,' says John Hogan, North Sea
managing director of Lasmo, which part-owns Ninian's waning resources. But
Lasmo has several other projects going and expects to double its output of
oil, and treble its gas output, by 1997.
Just as important as the rate of discovery is the advance in extraction
technology. A striking example is Brent, where Shell and Esso are spending
Pounds 1bn rejuvenating one of the UK's earliest and largest fields. As oil
output declines, the field is being switched gradually to extract the huge
bubble of gas which has accumulated at the top of the reservoir. Shell's
engineers reckon they can give Brent new life as a gasfield producing 500m
cubic feet a day - 5-10 per cent of Britain's needs.
Oil seldom runs out completely. Man either finds new ways of extracting it
or the threat of shortage drives prices up to levels that trigger fresh
investment. 'We went to Brunei in 1921 thinking the oil would last until
1935,' says Jerry Saville, until recently Shell's personnel director in
Aberdeen. 'We're still there.'
Although oilmen complain about the UK's high costs, they still see the North
Sea as one of the world's most attractive exploration areas because of the
high quality of the oilfields and the hospitable political environment.
'It's the centre stage,' says Santa Fe's Culloch. 'In the US, oil is seen as
a sunset industry. Here, it's still exciting and glamorous.'
So, what does our swing through the rigs tell us? All the big fields have
been found, and some are tailing off already. But the high level of activity
and technological advance gives grounds for hope. Estimating the life of
reserves is a notoriously inexact science. The department of trade and
industry has calculated that, at the very least, the UK still has 555m
tonnes of recoverable oil. At the present production rate of 91m tonnes
annually, that is enough for a mere six years. Nobody believes things are
that bad, though.
The DTI's maximum estimate is 1,960m tonnes, enough for just over 20 years,
which is the sort of figure you hear more often in the oil industry. But the
big change that will occur during the 1990s is foreshadowed by developments
at Brent. Gas will become much more important: BP estimates it will account
for as much as 40 per cent of North Sea hydrocarbon output by 2000, and that
this share will go on rising into the next century. This is what underlies
the 'dash for gas' which has been blamed for squeezing coal out of the power
generation market.
The DTI's estimates of known gas reserves would last up to 36 years at
present consumption rates. True, gas consumption will rise sharply in the
years ahead - but we may have discovered only half the gas that exists.
So, the North Sea is at something of a turning point. 'We've left the
pioneering age behind us,' says Jan Veldwijk, a Dutchman who heads the local
operations of Rockwater, a specialist in underwater contracting. 'We mature
all the time. We're harvesting experience.'
The old image of gigantic platforms pouring out oil needs to be discarded.
In its place, think of high-tech rigs sucking out oil from dark corners, and
gas hissing out of valves plugged into the sea floor. There could even be
enough hydrocarbon and gas to last half a century. By then, who knows what
amazing new fuel source might have been invented.

<TEXT>
IT IS TIME to look again at the battle of the generations, the fluctuating
economic struggle between young and old. For some years, the British
wrinklies were doing remarkably well. You can't keep the young folk down for
long, though, and they are hitting back hard with their penetrating weapons,
cheap money and inflation. But have they been booby-trapped by debt?
The European exchange rate mechanism, as run by a beleaguered Bundesbank,
has turned into a geriatric charter. Soft-hearted Helmut Schlesinger may at
last have relented but French, Danish and Spanish short-term interest rates
have been well in double figures this week.
In the UK, money market rates stayed at 10 per cent until September and
generated a huge flow of net interest payments, from young borrowers to old
investors.
Only 16 per cent of people taking out new building society mortgages are 45
or older. The total annual servicing cost of some Pounds 330bn of mortgage
debt was Pounds 27bn after tax relief. But that is now tumbling by Pounds
7bn, money lost in the main by the largely elderly savers who speak for the
bulk of the Pounds 250bn-odd deposited in personal savings accounts at
building societies and banks.
To make matters worse, pensions in payment will not be protected properly
against inflation in the near future. This is because the retail price index
is being reduced by the fall in mortgage rates, whereas the rise in the
pensioners' price index (which excludes housing costs) is likely to
accelerate from 3 per cent in the latter part of 1992 to 4 or 5 per cent
this year.
Capital transfers within the housing market are also looking much healthier
for the young. In the late 1980s, older owner-occupiers were selling out or
trading down at extraordinary prices, and young people were assuming
enormous debt burdens.
But the number of house market transactions has dropped from 2.1m in 1988 to
about 1m a year at present, while the average house price has dropped by 11
per cent in two years (and by 30 per cent in four years in the south-east).
For first-time buyers, the improvement in affordability has been remarkable
(so long as they can find a job). In 1989, the average first-timer's
mortgage interest payments was 26 per cent of income; now, the proportion is
14 per cent.
Of course, youngsters have to be confident that there will not be another
U-turn in policy to propel interest rates smartly up again. But it seems
they now have so much buying power that they can, in many cases, afford to
buy decent houses, leapfrogging their counterparts of five years ago who,
burdened by Pounds 10,000 or more of negative equity, are stuck indefinitely
in bottom-rung-of-the-ladder homes.
This is the nub of the problem. The fall in interest rates has addressed the
imbalance in young people's income and expenditure accounts, but it has done
nothing for their balance sheets.
Personal sector debt has eased by only a few percentage points from a 1991
peak of 115 per cent of disposable income; until 1980, the ratio was
consistently close to 60 per cent. The Amex Bank Review has just calculated
some implications should this ratio fall back by 1995 - not to 60 per cent
but, less ambitiously, to the average of the 1980s (financial deregulation
may have led to a long-term increase in debt tolerance).
Either the savings ratio will have to rise from its present 12 per cent or
so to more like 18 per cent, implying years of still more terrible
depression; or incomes must rise by nearly 50 per cent (or, presumably, some
combination of the two). Incidentally, if it is any consolation, Amex Bank
finds that Japan's fix over personal indebtedness is almost as bad as as the
UK.
The danger for Britain's wrinklies is that, having lost much of their
investment income, they could forfeit part of the real value of their
capital, too. Events in the foreign exchange markets this week have shown
once again that weak governments are driven towards inflation. As sterling
crashed on Wednesday, the Treasury insisted that the exchange rate was being
given 'full weight' in its monetary assessment.
Since there is no credible hint of any move to protect the pound with higher
interest rates, the implication is that the devaluation is deliberate. Has
somebody in the Treasury also calculated that 50 per cent pay inflation in
three years (cumulative, not annual) would eliminate the suffocating effect
of the huge financial claims by the older generation on the young? Retail
price inflation would have to be even higher, because real UK incomes must
fall.
Just take a look, if you dare, at the wealth-preserving manifesto of the
woopies (well-off older people). Pay (and social security benefits) must be
cut to preserve Britain's trade competitiveness at a higher exchange rate
than now; the state must take responsibility for Pounds 50bn-plus of the
mortgage debt of overstretched individuals; and taxes must rise by Pounds
20bn. There might be votes for this in Eastbourne but not in East Grinstead,
let alone East Kilbride.
There is one last tantalising pot of gold for the oldies. Their stock market
investments are jumping in value - and, more importantly, so are those of
their pension funds, which have a commitment of nearly 85 per cent to UK and
overseas equities.
But the actuaries who value company pension schemes are behaving like
spoil-sports. The funds are puffed up by higher share ratings, but the
dividend income they generate is, if anything, falling. So, on the basis of
actuarial valuations, pension funds have failed to keep pace with their
pay-linked liabilities during 1992.
Youth, said George Bernard Shaw, is wasted on the young. But the economic
curse of young people is that the world is already owned by the previous
generation, which is trying to charge rents. Still, they may decide that
wealth is wasted on the old.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Bonn and Paris 'now considering fast track to Emu'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE and Germany are ready to step up monetary co-operation, including
possible fixing of the franc-D-Mark rate, if the European exchange rate
mechanism is threatened with collapse, according to a growing consensus in
Brussels.
Senior diplomats from France, Germany, Britain and other EC member states
have come round to the view that a Franco-German initiative is inevitable if
instability in the foreign exchange markets leaves the survival of the ERM
in doubt.
The Bundesbank's decision to shave half a percentage point off the Lombard
rate and a quarter point off the discount rate helped to relieve tensions in
the ERM on Thursday. But EC officials are looking for at least one full
point off the discount rate within three months to revive the European
economy and bolster confidence in the ERM as the vehicle to European
monetary union.
Reports that France and Germany have drawn up plans for a 'fast-track' move
to monetary union have been circulating in Europe for several months, only
to be denied vigorously in Paris and Bonn. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank
president, dismissed the idea last week as incompatible with the Maastricht
treaty.
But instability inside the ERM - and fears about a devaluation of the franc
against the D-Mark - have persuaded a growing number of diplomats and
officials in Brussels that a 'fast track' to Emu is now a serious political
option which would be justified as saving the ERM and Emu.
A senior French official in Brussels yesterday raised the prospect of an
inner group of 'hard-core' currency countries moving to 'something
resembling monetary union' outside the Maastricht treaty.
The official said the emergence of a 'fast-track' grouping would most likely
take the form of a fixing of exchange rates, not a single European currency.
Even such a move would pose political difficulties, notably how to keep the
door open for EC countries with weaker currencies such as Spain with the
peseta. The most serious obstacle lies in the Bundesbank's long-standing
scepticism about Emu and a single currency.
But the French official pointed out that, while Germany's central bank was
in charge of day-to-day economic decisions, 'the politi-cians have the last
word'.
This week, Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, said if the ERM
collapsed, 'something would emerge from the wreckage'. Observers believe his
comments contain a warning to UK Euro-sceptics that they must not assume
foreign exchange instability spells Emu's end.
The increasingly public debate about a 'fast track' to Emu may also be
driven by tactical considerations in Paris and Bonn to bolster the franc in
the run-up to the French parliamentary elections.
As one senior EC official pointed out, the more the currency markets believe
there will be a Franco-German initiative to create fixed exchange rates, the
less likely they are to attack the franc-D-Mark parity and the less likely
the need therefore for a politically controversial move to a 'fast-track'
Emu.

FT  06 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo is not the only drugs company being dragged through the mud by the
market. Its performance over the past two months is not markedly worse than
Wellcome. The US health sector fell by 8 per cent relative to Wall Street
during January. On both sides of the Atlantic, investors are more interested
in recovery than the defensive qualities of healthcare. Sterling's slide has
made UK drugs stocks doubly unattractive. Since around a quarter of Glaxo's
shares were held in the US, it has borne the brunt of the selling. But Glaxo
cannot expect to find firm support until its ambitions in over-the-counter
medicines are clear.
The company's conversion to the OTC cause was poorly explained from the
outset. A perfunctory paragraph in last year's chairman's statement is
hardly sufficient after the best part of a decade preaching the opposite. A
rights issue to fund an OTC acquisition looks unlikely, especially since
Glaxo has lost its premium rating. Given the dizzy multiple commanded by OTC
businesses, funding any large move by selling paper would be uncomfortably
dilutive. Without a clear statement of intent, the market might be forgiven
for worrying.
A cautious move into OTC - perhaps on the model of last year's joint venture
between SmithKline Beecham and Marion Merrell Dow - might secure a future
for Zantac, the ulcer drug which accounts for 40 per cent of sales.
Regardless of whether Glaxo defends Zantac's US patent this year,
competition from generic versions of SmithKline's Tagamet is looming. Zantac
is more effective, but with the US healthcare system in a penny-pinching
mood, that will not count for much. A break into consumer markets makes
sense, but not at any price.

FT  06 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: UK accounting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rank Organisation's annual report showed this week why investors should be
on their toes. Even though Rank was adhering to the letter of the law in its
restatement of last year's figures under the new accounting rules, it also
included a deft Pounds 57m property revaluation provision that would not
otherwise have appeared in the profit and loss.
It hardly helps that half the market will still be reporting under the old
system during the coming results season. The City could ease the confusion
by agreeing some standard definitions of normalised earnings, although that
goes against the spirit of the reforms. There is merit in adjusting the
volatile new earnings figure by subtracting disposals, closures and other
one-off costs. That should leave a rump of sustainable earnings. But BZW
wants to deduct preference dividends, too, while NatWest Markets will put
costs relating to failed bids above the line.
The onus is clearly on companies to be as transparent as possible. The
Accounting Standards Board has already read the riot act to companies
bending the new rules. The new legal status of accounting standards should
encourage company directors and auditors to stick to the rules. The ASB's
victory over Trafalgar House last year showed it has real teeth. But even
companies with a clean record on compliance may use the opportunity to slip
bad news into the market under the cover of confusion.

FT  06 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: British Airways
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
By doing the noble thing and bowing out early, Lord King has helped dispel
the lingering anxieties caused by the Virgin imbroglio. The market nodded
its approval yesterday by lifting BA's shares 3 per cent. It was obviously
also pleased to see Sir Colin Marshall retain his dominant role by
effectively combining the two top jobs in one.
Strict adherence to the principles of good corporate governance would have
required the appointment of a non-executive chairman and a chief executive.
But, given the City's admiration for Sir Colin, it has been prepared to
settle for a compromise which, in the wake of the Virgin affair, looks a
trifle lame.
The most important consideration is whether effective checks and balances
have been restored. BA tried to reassure by giving the deputy chairman, Sir
Michael Angus, specific responsibility for monitoring executive directors.
That rather begs the question of what he thought he was doing before. One
hopes the promised appointment of another non-executive director will mark a
further step towards credible supervision.
That leaves BA's ambiguous trading outlook. Margin gains from sterling's
depreciation may offset sticky traffic figures for premium seats. But, by
aggressively increasing capacity by 14 per cent this summer, BA threatens to
dilute its yields. Coincidentally or not, this move will severely squeeze
Virgin.

FT  06 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: On high ground
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investment gurus who never expected the FT-SE index to rise much above 2,900
this year must have had a twinge of anxiety this week. The index briefly
rose above that level on Thursday and, though it has since fallen back, the
market is still within spitting distance of many year-end targets. There is
a difference, of course, between the background now and the way it was when
the forecasts were made. Both interest rates and the exchange rate have
fallen much faster than was generally assumed. After such a monetary
relaxation, equity valuations do not look stretched, even with an historic
market multiple approaching 18.
But further advance does depend on companies actually delivering higher
earnings. Trading statements will be scrutinised particularly closely during
the coming reporting season. A few nasty surprises on earnings or on
dividends could set the market back. So could opportunistic rights issues,
though the market may be over-doing worries on that score. Banks, the latest
sector to be marked down on the prospect of large cash calls, are most
unlikely candidates.
The biggest imponderable remains the impact of government borrowing when
heavy PSBR funding gets under way. Assuming it is followed through, the
Bundesbank's rate cut may have changed the equation slightly by allowing
sterling to stabilise, limiting the inflationary threat from lower
short-term rates. Gilt investors might thus not require such high yields.
But easier German money is also boosting continental equity markets, which
could lessen the relative attraction of UK shares.

FT  06 FEB 93 / US jobless rate falls as economy gains strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FALL in US unemployment to 7.1 per cent, the lowest level in a year,
yesterday indicated that faster growth in the economy is beginning to dent
high levels of joblessness.
A White House spokeswoman welcomed the figures but noted that the jobless
rate was still higher than at the end of the recession in the first half of
1991. President Bill Clinton believed it was still necessary to 'kick-start'
the economy because of the relatively slow pace of job creation, she said.
On Wall Street, the figures and residual bullishness from the cut in German
rates pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 25.4 points to another
record high of 3,442.14.
The January unemployment rate compares with levels of 7.3 per cent in
December and a peak of 7.7 per cent last June, the labour department
reported. Adult male unemployment fell particularly sharply last month, to
6.4 per cent against 6.8 per cent in December. In another sign of economic
strength, the length of the average working week in manufacturing industry
rose from 41.2 to 41.4 hours - the highest level in more than 25 years.
The pace of job creation, however, is still relatively subdued. Non-farm
employment rose by 106,000 to 108.8m last month, roughly in line with
analysts' projections, but only about a third to a half of the monthly
increase registered in previous recoveries.
The sluggish job creation is occurring in spite of a clutch of economic
indicators pointing to an acceleration of economic growth. The discrepancy
reflects rapid increases in output per worker. US productivity rose 2.7 per
cent last year, the biggest increase for 20 years.
Mr Richard Berner, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said the
employment report was stronger than it looked. The proportion of industrial
sectors reporting higher employment had risen sharply in the past three
months, suggesting that the recovery was becoming more firmly established.
There had also been an encouraging decline in the numbers of workers forced
to work part-time as opposed to full-time.
Sectors registering employment gains last month included manufacturing,
transport and the retail and wholesale trades. However, construction
employment fell 37,000 last month.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Iveco Ford urges no bail-out for Daf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IVECO FORD, the truck maker, urged the government yesterday not to 'bail
out' Daf, its Anglo-Dutch rival, which collapsed into administrative
receivership earlier this week.
Mr Alan Fox, Iveco Ford chief executive, claimed in a letter to Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, that Pounds 750m of debts had been
written off by the government when Daf took over Leyland Vehicles in 1987.
'Surely there can be no further government-funded financial support for a
company with such a track record,' he wrote. 'We think it right that you do
not intend to bail out Leyland Daf because clearly there is too much truck
manufacturing capacity available even for an annual market of 50,000 new
trucks.'
UK new truck sales were only 31,398 last year, 55 per cent down on the peak
of 69,234 in 1989.
'Should there be any change in government policy in respect of direct or
indirect support to Leyland Daf, then Iveco Ford Truck would look to receive
an equal benefit and opportunity,' Mr Fox said in his letter.
Iveco Ford, a joint venture between Iveco, commercial vehicle subsidiary of
Fiat of Italy, and Ford, the US vehicle maker, lost the leadership of the UK
new truck market to Daf two years ago.
Iveco Ford itself continued to lose Pounds 500,000 a week 'due to the
parlous state of the British truck market,' Mr Fox said. The Iveco Ford
truck plant at Langley, Berks, could make 15,000 trucks a year, but was
currently 'screwed down to just 6,000. This is why we are losing money'.
Iveco Ford Truck incurred losses in 1992 of Pounds 25m-Pounds 30m, Mr Fox
disclosed.
Leyland Daf Finance, the truck maker's hire purchase and leasing arm,
yesterday closed its five UK regional offices.

FT  06 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris 7.7% better on week as
bourses celebrate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST-rate sensitive bourses, particularly Paris, Frankfurt and a partly
obscured Brussels, continued to reflect the cut in German interest rates
yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS closed with the CAC-40 index above 1,900 for the first time since June
30: up 53.80, or 2.9 per cent on the day at 1,908.18, and 7.7 per cent
better on the week after a fall of 4.6 per cent in January.
Turnover stayed unusually strong, climbing again to over FFr5bn as
financials, and shares in heavily indebted companies extended Thursday's
gains.
Poliet, the building materials group controlled by Paribas, gained FFr21 or
9.1 per cent to FFr251; Paribas itself put on FFr22.40 or 5.7 per cent to
FFr414.90 in 324,000 shares and Credit Local, the municipal finance bank,
ended FFr22, or 6.4 per cent higher at FFr367.
Suez rose FFr8.50 to FFr283 in 766,000 and the deeply indebted Eurotunnel
picked up FFr1.25, or 3.5 per cent to FFr37.65 in very heavy volume of 3.5m
shares.
FRANKFURT left the DAX index up 4.4 per cent on the week. Turnover, on a
rising trend all week, rose from DM7.1bn to DM9.9bn.
Domestic investors, particularly, were attracted to financials, said Mr
Hans-Peter Wodniok of James Capel in Frankfurt. They liked their
interest-rate sensitivity, the bonus to the banks in the release of DM32bn
of interest fee reserves, and the implied improvement in German banking
competitiveness.
Steels and some engineers were relatively, or actually depressed. Krupp
Hoesch, closing one of its blast furnaces temporarily because of weak
demand, fell DM1 to DM112.
MILAN's Comit index rose 6.07 to 504.21, a 3.5 per cent rise on the week.
Confirmation that Prime Minister Giuliano Amato's coalition government had
won yesterday's confidence vote was the cue for renewed foreign buying in a
market already well supported by domestic investors.
Trading continued to be buoyed by this week's interest rate cuts, and hopes
of another in Italy soon. Telecoms found strong support after the postal
minister, Mr Maurizio Pagani, reaffirmed plans to reorganise the sector and
cut the state's stake below 50 per cent. Stet fixed L60 higher at L2,270 and
rose to L2,290 after hours while SIP put on L73 to L1,685.
AMSTERDAM finished broadly firmer after the traumas of recent days, buoyed
by the higher dollar, lower interest rates and firmer overseas stock
markets.
The CBS Tendency index rose 1.80 to 97.70 for a half per cent rise on the
week.
Daf rose 55 cents to Fl 2.50 as it resumed unofficial trading after its
suspension late on Thursday. But very high volume surprised some analysts
who suggested that speculators were having a final fling.
There was also better news for Fokker, Fl 1.90 cents ahead at Fl 10.60, as
the Dutch government put compromise proposals for the takeover of the
aircraft maker to Deutsche Aerospace. KLM rose Fl 2.70 to Fl 28 with
investors apparently more impressed by its plans to cut costs than concerned
about the airline's sharply higher third quarter losses.
ZURICH was firmer, but off the day's high after an easier dollar and a
weaker start on Wall Street left blue chips slightly lower. The market had
earlier profited from the positive tone in other European bourses and the
SMI index finished 9.9 higher at 2,133.6, 2 per cent ahead on the week.
Some switching was seen out of Swiss bank shares into industrials or German
bank shares, on the assumption that lower interest rates were already
discounted in current Swiss bank share prices. Beneficiaries included Roche
certificates, up SFr30 at SFr4,160.
BRUSSELS had to contend with Petrofina's 72 per cent drop in profits, and a
2.1 per cent drop in the oil group's shares which closed BFr160 lower at
BFr7,370.
However, the Bel-20 index still rose 6.67 to 1,226.91, 3.3 per cent up on
the week as Belgium's holding companies improved their standing, and
Kredietbank put on BFr250, or 4.1 per cent to BFr6,400.
COPENHAGEN suffered foreign selling and profit-taking that took the KFX
index down 2.47 to 83.70. STOCKHOLM rose on hopes of lower interest rates.
The Affarsvarlden General index added 19.4 to 928.2.

Wall Street
BLUE CHIP shares rallied yesterday, lifted by an encouraging January
employment report and residual bullishness from the cut in German rates,
writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average scored yet another record high, climbing
25.40 to 3,442.14, but declines led rises by 1,017 to 890 on the NYSE. Other
market indices failed to keep pace with the Dow's muscular performance.
The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 eased 0.63 to 448.93 and the
Nasdaq composite dropped 7.87 to 700.98. The Amex composite moved higher,
rising 1.07 to 416.58. Trading volume on the NYSE was heavy at more than
324m shares.
The Dow, which surged more than 106 points in the first four days of the
week, was up by 42.95 on Thursday to 3,216.74.
Investors took heart from the January employment report, which showed a
106,000 addition to non-farm payrolls and a decline in the unemployment rate
from 7.3 per cent to 7.1 per cent. December non-farm payrolls were adjusted
up to 90,000 from 64,000.
Chrysler, which has moved steadily higher since the successful completion of
its huge new stock offering earlier this week, firmed by Dollars 1 1/8 to
Dollars 40 7/8 . Among the other big three auto manufacturers, General
Motors rose by Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 38 and Ford slipped by Dollars  3/8
to Dollars 49 5/8 . Shares in cellular telephone companies, which rallied
earlier this week on reports that there was no evidence of a link between
cellular phone use and cancer, were mixed through the day. Motorola fell
Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 53 1/4 , GTE added Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 35 3/8
and McCaw Cellular was Dollars  5/8 lower at Dollars 33 3/4 .
Cyclical stocks once more contributed to the Dow's rally. Minnesota Mining &amp;
Manufacturing gained Dollars 3 to Dollars 108 3/4 , Aluminum Company of
America advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 77 5/8 and International Paper
improved Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 69 1/4 .
Drug stocks, which have been particularly vulnerable in recent months, ended
the day on a mixed note. Merck was quoted Dollars  3/8 higher at Dollars 38
3/8 after edging towards a 52-week low earlier in the day. Pfizer dropped
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 63 1/4 , Upjohn held steady at Dollars 29 3/8 and
Bristol-Myers Squibb rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 58 1/2 .
Barr Laboratories plummeted Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 9 after the company was
ordered by a federal district court to suspend, temporarily, 24 products.
The court denied a request by the Food and Drug Administration to shut down
the company altogether. The company has denied FDA allegations that it
committed unsafe practices.
In Nasdaq trading, shares in Amgen plunged Dollars 5 7/8 to Dollars 53 7/8 .
The biotechnology company's investment rating was cut by Mabon Securities
amid concern that Amgen's sales were slowing.
Canada
TORONTO shares ended the week on a winning note in extremely heavy trading.
The 300 composite gained 11.51 points, or 0.34 per cent, to 3,377.91. OverOn
the week, the index was up about 73 points.
Advances led declines 379 to 294, volume rose to 61.46m 5,000 shares from
54.43m shares on Thursday, and trading value was CDollars 564.3m compared
with CDollars 512.7m.

The cut in German interest rates and Thursday's rally on Wall Street
encouraged investors, and equities rebounded on futures led buying, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei issue average rose 142.27 to 17,332.90, 1.8 per cent up on the
week, after moving between 17,223.64 and 17,413.67. Volume rose from 284m to
320m shares on active cross-trading, as investors tried to realise profits
without changing their portfolios.
Gainers led losers by 694 to 256 with 178 unchanged, and the Topix index of
all first section stocks rose 7.64 to 1,308.47. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50
index was up 1.59 to 1,062.12.
After Thursday's cut in the discount rate by the Bank of Japan, investors
shifted their attention to fiscal policy. 'The effects of the rate cut will
come into the market slowly, but the market is waiting for an income tax cut
or another supplementary budget,' said an official at Nippon Life.
Individual and foreign investors were seen buying large-capital blue chip
shares in small-lots. Nippon Steel gained Y2 to Y290 while Hitachi Zosen
gained Y9 to Y522.
Regional bank shares were actively traded on cross activity. Joyo Bank was
the second most active issue of the day, falling Y10 to Y850, Bank of
Yokohama remained unchanged at Y995 and Shizuoka Bank fell Y10 to Y1,300.
Hopes of a recovery in the US semiconductor market boosted Tokyo Electron, a
trading company specialising in semiconductor manufacturing equipment, by
Y100 to Y2,130. NGK Spark Plug, which makes ceramic packages for
semiconductors, gained Y23 to Y950.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 96.12 to 18,672.98 in volume of 44.9m shares.
Roundup
Wall Street's strong performance also provided a lead in some Pacific Rim
markets.
AUSTRALIAN investors took a lead from the US to push prices higher and the
All Ordinaries index climbed 11.9 to 1,543.3, a 1 per cent rise on the week,
in turnover of ADollars 224,5m.
Biscuit maker Arnotts was a focus of trade ahead of Campbell Soup's takeover
deadline. Arnotts closed steady at ADollars 9.51, 1 cent above the US
company's offer.
HONG KONG opened strongly but turned down on profit-taking. The Hang Seng
index finished 30.80 easier at 5,747.21, little changed on the week.
Turnover totalled HKDollars 2.08bn against HKDollars 1.86bn on Thursday.
Cheung Kong slipped 10 cents to HKDollars 20.2 and Hutchison Whampoa fell 40
cents to HKDollars 16. But Sun Hung Kai Properties and Henderson Land gained
10 cents and 20 cents to HKDollars 27.3 and HKDollars 15.8 respectively.
SINGAPORE was also lower on profit-taking among blue chip stocks as the
market continued to consolidate after its recent highs. The Straits Times
Industrial index fell 8.44 to 1,618.64 in volume of 104.14m shares. This
left the index little changed on the week, having risen to an all-time high
of 1,645.68 on Tuesday.
DBS Foreign lost 40 cents to SDollars 14.40, UOB Foreign 25 cents to
SDollars 9.15, and Singapore Press Foreign 20 cents to SDollars 16.
KUALA LUMPUR was higher on selective buying with the mood underpinned by the
prospect of lower local interest rates. The composite index rose 1.88 to
644.83, 1 per cent higher on the week,in turnover that swelled to 193.9m
shares.
Idris was the most active counter with 50.2m shares traded, adding 5.5 cents
to 88.5 cents amid talk that the company would be given part of the project
to build Malaysia's new international airport.
SEOUL saw profit-taking in reaction to the rises of the previous three days.
The composite stock index lost 6.73 to 677.31, little changed on the week.
MANILA settled firmer as with buyers encouraged by the overnight gains in
the US. The composite index closed 4.97 higher at 1,342.01, virtually
unchanged on the week.

FT  06 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: German financials climb on Buba
initiative - But from now on, there will be contradictory factors at work on
Frankfurt stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At last, action from the Bundesbank]
Thursday's cuts in key German interest rates were no surprise in themselves;
but the timing of the move certainly was, especially in the wake of hawkish
comments from members of the Bundesbank's council last week which led many
economists to believe that rates would not start falling until March or even
April.
Expectations of a cut had fuelled a January rally in the German stock
market, which palled a little in the last week of the month, and which has
since revived. The DAX blue chip index of 30 shares was up 1.2 per cent last
month, and the wider FAZ general index by 3.2 per cent.
The cut itself prompted a strong rally. The DAX climbed yesterday by 39.76
to 1,641.37, a record high for the year. Financial shares - particularly
sensitive to interest rate movements - showed impressive gains. Allianz, the
big insurance company, climbed 2.7 per cent, Dresdner Bank rose by 5.7 per
cent, Deutsche Bank by 5 per cent and Commerzbank by 4.5 per cent.
From now on, the German equity market is likely to be influenced by two
contradictory factors.
On the one hand, interest rates are definitely, unequivocally on the way
down. The detailed timing and scope of further cuts is not clear but
economists expect lead rates to fall by 200 basis points by the end of the
year. This is positive for equities, in principle.
'All other asset classes are unattractive,' says Mr Sy Schluter at CSFB
First Boston in Frankurt. 'Cash has lost its appeal and bund market yields
have already discounted further rate cuts. The yield on 10-year bunds is
likely to be at the same level at the end of the year as it is now (around 7
per cent).'
Working against this is the fact that the downturn in the German economy has
by no means reached a low point. There is plenty of bad news still to come
from the corporate sector and the latest interest rate cut is not going to
lead to a sudden reversal in the outlook for corporate earnings this year.
This outlook is bleak: Mr Reinhard Fischer, head of German equity research
at Paribas Capital Markets in London, calculates that earnings on the DAX
companies will drop by 14.5 per cent in 1992 and by a further 7.4 per cent
in 1993. This puts the market as a whole on a multiple of some 17.6 times
current year earnings, higher than the average in recent years.
'The danger is that the current rally may prove to be no more than a
bubble,' says Mr Fischer, who is predicting that in the next two to three
months the DAX will climb to 1,700 before dropping back again. 'The market
is not at all supported by fundamentals.'
Under these conditions, the choice of stocks becomes especially important.
Mr Schluter at CSFB divides his recommendations into two categories:
companies which are likely to outperform over the short-term, irrespective
of fundamentals, and those which offer fundamental value over the longer
term as well.
He believes that clients interested in making trading profits should buy
Daimler Benz and Volkswagen, in spite of the problems afflicting the German
car manufacturing sector. Siemens also should be bought on a short-term view
but rates only as a hold for the medium to long-term.
These stocks have high beta values, traditionally outperforming when the
market is rising, and doing worse than the market when share prices are
sinking. Other companies with high beta values include Allianz, Deutsche
Bank and Munich Re, the large reinsurance company.
Of these, Mr Schluter likes Deutsche and Munich Re as short and long-term
investments. Allianz is seen as attractive in the short term, but the
discount of the share price to asset value is far less pronounced than at
Munich Re, where the asset value is DM3,500 per share compared to
yesterday's share price of DM2,850. Allianz, traditionally viewed as a proxy
for the market, closed up DM58 yesterday at DM2,200, compared with an
estimated asset value of DM2,500.
The choice of Deutsche Bank among the big banks is not shared by all
analysts: Mr Paul Brunker at Robert Fleming in London recommends buying
Dresdner instead. Deutsche traditionally has the highest rating of the three
large banks and for the last year its earnings are likely to slip back from
DM49.50 per share to DM49, climbing back up to DM53 for 1993 according to
Paribas estimates.
Analysts also point to the two large Bavarian banks (Hypo Bank and
Bayerische Vereinsbank) where business is traditionally weighted towards
mortgage business rather than risk-prone commercial lending. DePfa, the
Wiesbaden-based mortgage bank which was one of last year's star performers
with a share price rise of nearly 50 per cent, is still favoured.
Among the more cyclical stocks, Bayer is preferred to the other large
chemical companies simply on the grounds that its high proportion of
pharmaceutical sales leaves it less exposed to the downturn in the world
chemicals markets.
Mr Fischer predicts that it will cut its dividend for 1992 from DM13 to
DM10, but that BASF's dividend will fall from DM12 to DM8 and Hoechst's from
DM12 to DM9.

FT  06 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Banks under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FEARS that NatWest Bank was planning to call on investors for extra cash set
nerves jangling in the banking sector. The rumours came at a time when,
according to merchant bank Robert Fleming, the sector had hit an 17-year
relative high against the market and gave an ideal opportunity to take
profits.
Mr Nick Dobby of Flemings said there was talk that NatWest could be
considering a rights issue in the region of Pounds 1bn. But he added; 'There
is no loan growth at the moment, the bank's capital ratios are well in
excess of the regulatory minimum and investors would be likely to focus on
Barclay's Pounds 921m cash call in 1988 which did not prove a very efficient
investment.'
NatWest shares fell 12 to to 448p with 14m traded. However, it was also
suggested that, if NatWest needs to raise cash, Barclays needs it more and
the latter's shares fell 16 to 429p. Meanwhile, Lloyds fell 11 to 537p
hampered by speculation that it was lining up a bid for one of three old
candidates, TSB, Royal Bank of Scotland or Standard Chartered. One might
have expected the bid candidates to improve but the whole sector was held
back by a feeling that base rates will not be cut any further in the
short-term.
Queens Moat deal
The sale by the joint managing director of Queens Moat Houses of half his
equity holding in the hotel group was followed by a heavy fall in the share
price. The sale came just ahead of the closed period, during which company
officers are prohibited from dealing in the stock market. Queens Moat, whose
shares have traced an erratic path recently, will announce results at the
beginning of April.
The shares were marked back sharply in August. They hit a low of 27 1/2 p
when the board revealed an unexpected jump in debt, in spite of improved
profits and increased dividend.
Yesterday, Mr Martin Marcus sold 500,000 shares at 57 1/2 p and a further
600,000 at 57p, a slight discount to the prevailing market price. The shares
fell heavily but later rallied to close at 53 1/2 p, a fall of 4 1/2 .
Turnover was a chunky 4.8m.
Clifford approach
An announcement from Clifford Foods that it had been approached by a
potential suitor prompted excitement in the food manufacturing sector.
Market fingers pointed at Unigate, with analysts close to the company
hinting that the two may have held discussions recently. Others which might
be interested could include Avonmore, the Irish dairy group, Northern Foods,
French concern BSN and MD Foods of Denmark.
Clifford is family-controlled and any offer would have to be agreed. Its
concentration in the south-eastern liquid milk market would fit into
Unigate's acquisitive milk-orientated strategy. Analysts put a price tag of
around Pounds 50m on Clifford, a sum easily affordable by Unigate without
resorting to issuing paper. Clifford ordinary voting shares jumped 85 to
505p, with the 'A' shares up 32 at 216p. Unigate slipped 5 to 325p and
Northern a penny to 262p.
Merchant bank Hambros had a volatile share performance ahead of an
announcement that it had won a court case brought it in Oslo by the
Norwegian Guarantee Institute. The shares were down 58 earlier as investors
thought Hambros had lost the case but they finished a net 15 up on the day
at 313p.
Water utility shares lifted as analysts said their average dividend growth
was likely to outpace that of the market and stressed the companies'
defensive qualities. Thames Water was up 10 at 497p, Severn Trent 8 at 474p
and Anglian Water 7 at 488p. Panmure Gordon's Mr Angelos Anastasiou
estimates real dividend growth for the market at nine per cent over the next
five years compared with 19 per cent for the water sector.
Fisons lifted 6 to 233p following an announcement from the company that it
has signed a marketing deal. The deal is not significant in itself but lends
growing support to the growing view that the company is more viable. There
was also a return of lingering bid speculation.
Croda International jumped 13 to 263p on hopes for a new multiple sclerosis
treatment. However, the company sought to temper optimism saying clinical
trials had net begun yet.
Worries over the possibility of VAT being imposed on food in the Budget
again put food retail stocks under a cloud. Argyll Group declined 6 to 374p,
J Sainsbury 10 to 558p and Tesco 4 to 250p.
Rank Organisation was hit by two sets of switch advice, with Goldman Sachs
advising a move into Ladbroke and Hoare Govett preferring Thorn EMI. Shares
in the latter added 8 to 861p, while Ladbroke rose 3 to 203p and Rank
recovered to close a penny adrift at 713p.
Analysts declared themselves little better off after a visit to a WH Smith's
Do It All facility. Speculation had been rife that the retailer may have
taken the opportunity to announce a restructuring of the loss-making
venture. Smith shares rose but then retreated to close a penny off at 425p.
Confirmation that Lord King had relinquished his role as chairman of British
Airways was well received in the market and the shares jumped 5 to 293p. One
analyst said; 'What we were looking for was minimum disruption of a good
management.' The shares closed 8 up at 296p, with volume reaching 5.5m.
Shares in freight container and trailer rental company Tiphook fell 17 to
336p after several brokers downgraded profit expectations. The company's
broker UBS Phillips &amp; Drew reduced its current-year estimate by Pounds 5m to
Pounds 75m, and the following year's figure by the same amount to Pounds
85m. NatWest Securities went from Pounds 80m to Pounds 72.5m, for this year
and shaved the 1994 figure by Pounds 10m to Pounds 85m.
Yield buying, greater confidence over the dividend and and improved outlook
for the property sector all helped P&amp;O buck the market trend to add 5 at
570p.
Profit-taking in ERF Holdings saw the shares fall 23 to 232p. It was also
profit-takers in British Aerospace which saw the shares fall 8 to 270p at
the day's worst. But bargain hunters later in the day helped it close 2
lighter at 276p. Dealers said recent currency movements would benefit Siebe
and the shares gained 10 to 489p.
Royal Insurance added 6 at 282p on talk that SG Warburg Securities was
recommending the stock.

AN EXCITING, and largely successful week for the UK equity market ended
yesterday with share prices rallying strongly at the close of an erratic
session, helped by renewed strength on Wall Street. Thursday's cut in rates
by the Bundesbank was identified as positive for the UK stock market
although most strategists agreed that any further reduction in domestic
rates will probably be withheld until Budget day, early in March.
Initial trading saw some good buying from the institutions but it was soon
clear that their attention was focused on the utilities, conventionally seen
as defensive stocks. A gain of 17.7 to 2,883.5 on the Footsie was steadily
eroded and had been replaced early in the afternoon by a loss of 12.3. The
Footsie has advanced nearly 2 per cent this week, edging above Footsie 2,900
briefly on Thursday afternoon. Support for the second-line stocks yesterday
was disclosed in the gain of 7.7 in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index to 3,050.5.
Later in the session, the UK stock market lay low until Wall Street
responded with an early gain of 20 Dow points to improved US jobless totals
for January.
London reacted vigorously as the mood improved and, by the close of trading,
the FT-SE Index was only 3.0 down at 2,862.9. Seaq volume of 691.9m shares,
of which around 61 per cent were non-Footsie stocks, compared with 949.5m on
Thursday.
Retail volume of Pounds 2.14bn on Thursday was the highest daily total since
September 18 last year when the market was celebrating sterling's departure
from the ERM.
High volume in the past two sessions has indicated the weight of trading
activity in London as international institutions first anticipated and then
responded to the Bundesbank's interest rate cut.
Profit-takers moved heavily against bank shares yesterday, with some
analysts fearing that the impending season of profits statements may bring a
spate of rights issues. Properties, which, according to SG Warburg
Securities, the UK investment bank and securities house, have outperformed
the rest of the stock market by 22 per cent over the past two weeks, gave
back a tiny proportion of their gains yesterday. Engineering and aerospace
shares were also targets for profit-taking.
Longer-term worries about inflation prospects surfaced in the gilt edged
market where long-dated conventional issues closed a shade off on the day
but index-linked gilts, the prime inflation hedge instruments, extended
early gains to finish around 1/4 higher.

FEARS of a rights issue in the banking sector led to a decline in stock
index futures that was only curbed by a strong opening on Wall Street,
writes Joel Kibazo.
The March contract on the FT-SE started firmly at 2,877 and advanced on good
buying, reaching 2,897 by around 10am. The contract had been expected to
continue moving forward but around mid-morning speculation of a rights issue
in the banking sector surfaced.
This caused a retreat in March with sentiment also hurt by continuing
worries in the food sector of an imposition of VAT on food.
The early gains in New York, however, helped the contract claw back some of
the earlier falls and March finished at 2,871, just ahead of Thursday's
close, with turnover reaching 11,251 lots.
The traded options saw business of 32,639 lots, down on Thursday's 43,859
lots. Some 7,027 lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and among the stock
options, GEC traded 4,118 contracts with Trafalgar House and Barclays also
busy.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Money Markets: Hope never dies

<TEXT>
DESPITE repeated claims by UK officials that there would be no base rate
cuts in the near-term, dealers in the sterling markets ended the week
looking for 5 per cent rates sooner rather than later, writes James Blitz.
The last five days have brought the most volatile trading in the sterling
cash and futures markets since the run-up to sterling's devaluation on
September 16 last year.
As speculation intensified on Monday that Mr John Major would ease monetary
policy willy-nilly, the March short sterling contract rocketed to 94.50, a
level that would be consistent with 5 per cent rates at budget time. The
rate for 1-year cash was also bid as low as 5 5/8 per cent.
Since then, the UK authorities have carried out a damage limitation
operation. On Thursday, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer,
said there was little immediate prospect that he would follow the
Bundesbank's lead and cut UK rates again.
The government's comments have manged to restrain the earlier enthusiasm of
the market. Yesterday, the March contract closed at 94.26, a level that
prices 3-month money at 5.74 per cent next month.
If that price is taken at face value, the market would appear to be only
fishing for a 50 basis cut in the next few weeks.
But, according to one dealer, the market will be bought again before too
long, and futures will go up. 'There is every chance of dealers building up
another bout of enthusisasm in the next two weeks,' he said.
One discount house dealer argued yesterday that the Bundesbank's decision to
cut its discount rate by 0.25 per cent on Thursday made a UK base rate cut
at budget time even more likely.
If the Bundesbank's cuts were a precursor to more easing in the next two
months, then the UK could ease policy without this adversely affecting the
value of the pound.
However, if the Bundesbank cuts rates too slowly, tensions in the exchange
rate mechanism could explode, allowing France and other ERM countries to cut
rates freely. This would ease pressure on the pound.
Enthusiasm for a cut would be checked altogether if foreign exchange dealers
were to ignore the chancellor's words of caution, triggering another run on
the pound.

THE DOLLAR failed to break above Thursday's peak of DM1.6670 against the
D-Mark yesterday, after the January non-farm payroll figure in the US came
through as the market had expected, writes James Blitz.
The payroll figure rose by 106,000 on the month, slightly less than the
market estimate of 109,000. The dollar, which opened at about DM1.6605 in
New York, initially climbed  1/3 pfennig on the news, peaked at DM1.6655,
but later fell back to close in London at DM1.6545, virtually unchanged on
the day.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, an economist at Citibank in London, said that the payroll
figure had not diverted him from his belief that the dollar will touch
DM1.75 or DM1.80 this year.
However, he warned that the dollar had gained only 1 pfennigs in the 24
hours between the Bundesbank cutting rates and the payroll figure being
issued in the US - and that this should strike a note of caution for dollar
bulls.
The uncertain note struck by the US data was not dissimilar to the one
created by the Bundesbank on Thursday, when it eased monetary policy.
The satisfaction that followed the 25 basis point cut in the Discount rate
has eased the strains in European exchange mechanism.
But there were several indications yesterday that the Bundesbank had, at
best, beaten off the speculators for only a few weeks.
The Danish krone hovered around its ERM parity of DKr3.814 to the D-Mark, a
remarkable jump from Thursday morning when it was trading at the floor.
However, 3-month krones continued to be quoted at the remarkably high level
of 14 1/2 per cent.
If the Danish authorities fail to cut rates soon, they may be putting in
jeopardy a Yes vote in the second Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty
on May 18 - the prospect of which would undermine the ERM yet again.
The French authorities eased money market tensions by announcing a cut in
the overnight rate by  5/16 per cent. This, in turn, brought down 1 month
French francs to 11 1/2 per cent from 15 per cent it touched earlier in the
week.
But the cost of the D-Mark/French parity is not getting cheaper. Last
August, 3-month French francs and 3-month D-Marks were both at around 9.75
per cent.
In the last 5 months, the D-Marks have come down 140 basis points, while the
francs have gone up 175 basis points.
Anyone who believes the ERM tensions are over must explain why and when that
divergence will stop being a problem for the French.

FT  06 FEB 93 / International Company News: Ciments Francais confirms
full-year loss of FFr1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
CIMENTS Francais, the ailing French cement group that has been clouded by
controversy since the discovery last autumn of FFr1.05bn (Dollars 192m)
off-balance sheet dealings, yesterday confirmed that it made a net loss of
FFr1bn last year.
The group, which made net profits of FFr401m on turnover of FFr16.45bn in
1991 and has disclosed a deficit of FFr740m for the first half of last year,
will publish its full 1992 results on March 19.
However, it verified yesterday, following a French press report, that it
made a net loss of about FFr260m in the second half, bringing the total loss
for the year to FFr1bn.
Ciments Francais would not comment on the likely level of provisions for the
second half. The off-balance sheet dealings produced exceptional losses of
FFr655m during the first half, when it was affected by the sluggish state of
the European construction industry.
The French cement group, which fired its chairman, Mr Pierre Conso, when the
off-balance sheet dealings came to light, is still waiting for the
completion of an investigation by the Spanish stock market authorities into
its investment in Cementos Molinos, the Spanish cement company.
The Ciments Francais scandal has implications for Paribas, the prominent
French investment bank which still holds a significant stake in the company
and was, until last spring, its controlling shareholder. Paribas has been
forced to repay FFr500m of the FFr6bn it received last year for a
controlling holding in Ciments Francais from Italcementi, the Italian cement
group.
This reduced its profit on the sale to FFr500m excluding its share of
Ciments Francais's 1992 losses.
In the first half, Paribas's share of the cement company's losses amounted
to FFr400m. Its share of losses in the second half is expected to be about
FFr100m, making the full-year losses roughly equal to its potential profit
on the renegotiated deal.
Mr Andre Levy-Lang, Paribas' chairman, last week announced that the group
had made a net profit of about FFr900m in 1992.

FT  06 FEB 93 / International Company News: Petrofina tumbles 72% to
BFr4.6bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONSOLIDATED profits at Petrofina, one of Belgium's largest industrial
groups, fell by 72 per cent last year, to BFr4.6bn (Dollars 135.3m) from
BFr16.3bn in 1991.
Petrofina halved its dividend - the first pay-out reduction since 1959  - to
a net BFr210 per share. Though the group warned of the cut in mid-December,
Petrofina shares fell 2.1 per cent to BFr7,370 yesterday, accounting for
about a tenth of high turnover on the Brussels bourse as Belgian investors
celebrated Thursday's fall in German interest rates by hoisting the Bel 20
index 0.54 per cent.
The results reflected low crude prices, sharp pressure on basic refining
profit margins, falling margins in petrochemicals because of overcapacity in
the industry, and losses at Fina, the group's US sub-sidiary.
Industry analysts said the drop in refining margins - of between Dollars 1
and Dollars 2 a barrel - could account for two-thirds of the fall in income.
Petrofina stressed that consolidated profit before extraordinary items,
mainly new US accounting standards to cover post-retirement health care
benefits, was estimated at BFr7.9bn, against BFr15.8bn in 1991.
One brokerage firm read this emphasis as anxiety to demonstrate that even
the halved dividend payment, worth about BFr6.5bn, was covered by current
earnings.
The group's investment budget this year has been set at BFr38bn, down from
BFr42bn last year.
The investment will be centred on modernising its Antwerp refining
facilities.
Net debt to equity in its 1991 balance sheet was 66 per cent, up from 34 per
cent in 1989, one market analyst underlined. In spite of some disposals and
pulling back from projects, this ratio was expected to have crept up; full
1992 results are not due until May.
Fina, the US arm, turned in a loss for the full year of Dollars 10.2m,
against net earnings of Dollars 42m in 1991 and Dollars 125m in 1990.
A decision is still awaited on three-year long negotiations with Arabian
Petroleum, the private Saudi Arabian company on a joint venture involving
Fina selling APC its downstream assets for about Dollars 500m. The Saudi
government is believed still not to have made up its mind whether to bless
the deal.

FT  06 FEB 93 / International Company News: Renault just breaks even in
final quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENAULT, the state-controlled French car company yesterday added to the
gloomy mood of the European motor industry, when it announced that it just
managed to break even in the final quarter of 1992 having made a healthy
profit in the first three quarters of the year.
The Renault announcement, which came only a few days after the collapse of
Daf, the Dutch commercial vehicle manufacturer, reflects the cost of
rationalising the French group's operations and the problems of Volvo, its
Swedish partner.
Renault doubled pre-tax profits to FFr7.43bn (Dollars 1.38bn) in the first
nine months of 1992, from FFr2.93bn in the corresponding period of the
previous year.
The group also achieved a healthy increase in sales to FFr135.26bn from
FFr122.22bn over the same period.
Last year was Renault's most successful year in terms of volume sales since
1983. The group sold 2m cars and 1.87m light commercial vehicles, thanks to
strong growth in France and gains in market share within the declining
European market.
Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault's chairman, had previously warned that its
performance had deteriorated in the final quarter of the year.
This was partly due to the problems at the Volvo group. Renault's share of
the Swedish company's losses in the first three quarters of last year
amounted to FFr40m.
However, Renault was also hit by the cost of its ongoing rationalisation
which has reduced its workforce by a quarter in the past five years. The
group plans to cut the workforce by another 2,249 people in 1993.
Moreover, it suffered from the impact of the September currency crisis which
strengthened the French franc against other European currencies thereby
reducing Renault's reported profits and making it more difficult for the
French company to remain cost-competitive in its export markets.

postpones ruling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE US Federal Trade Commission yesterday delayed a decision on what action,
if any, to take against Microsoft, the world's largest computer software
company, following a two-and-a-half year anti-trust investigation.
The stock market reacted positively to the news that the FTC had failed to
decide on how to proceed with the anti-trust case. Microsoft's share price
jumped to close at Dollars 89 for a net gain of Dollars 4 1/4 on the day.
The commission will reconvene 'in the near future' to continue its
deliberations over the case.
The outcome of the anti-trust probe has been closely watched because it
could have a broad impact throughout the computer industry. Microsoft is the
premier supplier of software for use on personal computers.
The delay, announced after a four-hour meeting of the commission in a
statement that referred to 'a non-public matter' and did not name Microsoft,
may suggest Microsoft is attempting to fend off any FTC action against the
company.
Microsoft has denied any wrongdoing and said yesterday that it is
'continuing to co-operate fully with the non-public FTC investigation. Mr
Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief executive, is said to have met with
FTC officials earlier this week.
However, investigators from the FTC's Bureau of Competition are believed to
have recommended that the commission seek court injunctions against
Microsoft to halt allegedly unfair practices.
According to Microsoft competitors, many of whom have provided information
to the FTC, these practices include the way the company sells and prices its
personal computer operating system, MS-DOS. Microsoft offers discounts to PC
manufacturers who agree to pay Microsoft a royalty fee for every PC they
sell, whether or not the buyer chooses to use the program.
Since MS-DOS is the standard PC operating system it is used by the vast
majority of PC buyers. However, companies that offer alternative programs
argue that they do not have an opportunity to compete.
Another issue said to have been investigated by the FTC involves the alleged
'tying' of sales of applications programs to those of operating systems in
which Microsoft holds a virtual monopoly.
Microsoft competitors have also expressed concerns to FTC investigators
about the company's alleged practice of favouring its own applications
programs developers by giving them early access to new versions of operating
system software, thus putting competitors at a disadvantage.
While the FTC could in theory file anti-trust charges against Microsoft
demanding that the company be broken apart, this is not expected. There is
also a possibility that the FTC could decide that no action should be taken
against the company .
According to industry analysts, however, a middle course is more likely. The
FTC might, for example, seek a court order prohibiting Microsoft's operating
system and applications divisions from sharing information. Or the company
might be ordered to halt its current operating system licensing practices.
Any such action would not have a significant impact upon Microsoft's sales,
industry analysts said.
To limit the effects of the FTC's decision, Microsoft could circumvent a
potentially lengthy trial by entering a consent degree, agreeing to the
FTC's demands. Mr Gates is said to favour bringing the matter to a close as
quickly as possible.
The 'non-public' anti-trust investigation has been common knowledge in the
computer industry since soon after it began and the potential for some form
of punitive action against Microsoft has cast a cloud over the company's
otherwise bright future.
For fiscal 1992, to end-June, Microsoft earned Dollars 708m , up 53 per cent
from the previous year, on revenues of Dollars 2.76bn, a 50 per cent
increase.

FT  06 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Fisons licenses heart drug rights to Porton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FISONS, the pharmaceutical and scientific instruments group, which is
focusing its efforts on a core group of drugs, has licensed the rights to
develop and market its Dopacard heart drug to Porton Products.
Dopacard is used in the treatment of heart failure associated with cardiac
surgery, and currently has annual sales of about Pounds 1m, mostly in the UK
and Ireland. The financial details of the licensing agreement were not
disclosed.
The agreement marks another step in Fisons' restructuring programme. Mr
Cedric Scroggs, Fisons' chief executive, said it reflected Fisons' drive to
focus its development and marketing programmes on core areas where returns
could be maximised.
Commenting on the deal Mr Alan Barcock, managing director of Porton
Products, said: 'Porton is continuing to develop high quality medicines for
specialist indications worldwide. Dopacard is a natural extension to our
product portfolio which gives us the chance to make available another
valuable product with unique patient benefits to hospital-based physicians.'
The group has signed a number of licensing agreements in the last few years
including a deal with Enzon of the US.
Porton Products is a wholly owned subsidiary of Porton International, the
London-based privately owned pharmaceuticals and healthcare company which
claims Pounds 7m profits on turnover of Pounds 52m for 1991.

Lord Bernstein of Leigh - who died yesterday, aged 94, was one of the most

More than any other individual in that industry, he proved by example after
example that there is nothing incompatible about the simultaneous pursuit of
profits, excellence and popularity.
Born in 1899, by the early 1920s he had inherited eight 'kinemas' and music
halls which he ran as variety theatres. Instinctively he pursued both
popularity and quality: Albert Chevalier, Gracie Fields, Will Hay, and Marie
Lloyd appeared regularly on his bills.
Before the second world war he began to concentrate on cinema, building the
Granada chain. In the 1950s he created Granada Television.
Quality and popularity were always the watchwords. Granada Television
produced Coronation Street, which has been Britain's most popular television
programme for more than 25 years and a serial of notable quality; and also
such masterpieces of television drama as Brideshead Revisited and Jewel In
The Crown.
Today Granada is a multi-million pound group with interests in TV and video
rental, cable, satellite, bingo clubs, discotheques, casinos, motorway
services, property, insurance, computers and publishing.
Like the Winogradskys (or Grades, as we now know the family name), the
Bernsteins emerged from the 19th century pogroms of eastern Europe. Sidney's
father, Alexander, fled first to Sweden as a young man, then to Britain,
where he married Jane Lazarus and settled in Ilford.
He was a successful and lucky businessman whose early interests - in a Welsh
quarry and in London property - led him into show business, when he built
the Edmonton Empire as a means of popularising a shopping site. Sidney was
the fourth of nine Bernstein children.
Always strong-willed, he insisted on leaving school at 15, wanting to go
straight into his father's business. Alexander demanded that his son become
an engineering apprentice, but within four years Sidney was in the family
company (arguing passionately with his father), and when Alexander Bernstein
died in 1922 Sidney inherited the theatres. He was then 23.
Though he spent his early career in live entertainment, Sidney Bernstein had
other passions, notably film, travelling - which he did on foot, all over
Europe, with a rucksack on his back - and liberal politics. Having joined
the Labour Party, he served as an independent Labour county councillor for
Willesden between 1925 and 1930.
All these interests can be discerned in his cinema policies during the
1930s. He was one of the leaders of the move to turn mere cinemas into
'picture palaces': vast extravaganzas of Moorish and renaissance
architecture, where working class families could be royally entertained with
films, music from Wurlitzer organs, and a novelty called 'snacks'.
Taking on Komisarjevsky, the expatriate Russian architect and theatrical
impressario, to develop the first of these elaborate people's palaces, in
Dover, he then cast round to find a name for it.
In the winter of 1929, posters appeared all over the town instructing the
public to 'Start saying Granada'. Fond memories of a walking tour in Spain,
especially its architecture, caused Bernstein to light on this.
In 1930 he opened the Phoenix Theatre in London, with Noel Coward, Laurence
Olivier and Gertrude Lawrence starring in Private Lives (quality and
popularity combined, again), but cinemas continued as the centre of the
family business.
They were converted for 'talkies.' A battle was fought over Sunday opening:
in Dover, this seemed to have been won by the Lord's Day Observance Society
until the Bernsteins arranged for all Dover cinemas and theatres to be lit
up on a Sunday, with staff on hand to turn away the expectant public with
the explanation that these were Dover council's orders. The rules about
Sunday showings soon changed.
Sidney started children's matinees, and the company kept building cinemas;
in 1935 a new Granada opened every three months. Eventually there were 57.
In 1936, to the surprise of his friends - Sidney Bernstein tended to keep
his private life as secret as his business dealings - he married Zoe Farmer,
a journalist, but the marriage did not long survive the second world war.
During that war Bernstein served as films adviser to the Ministry of
Information, then as chief of film selection at Allied HQ in North Africa
and at SHAEF.
In 1945 he went into Belsen. What he saw made him determined to make a film
for showing to the German public, proving what had been done in its name. He
persuaded Alfred Hitchcock - a fellow Londoner, by then working in the US -
to cross the Atlantic and act as director. Thanks to the politicians the
film was not shown. It was buried in the vaults of the Imperial War Museum
and screened for the first time on British television in 1985.
But the Bernstein-Hitchcock partnership bore fruit: Sidney Bernstein went to
Hollywood and produced Hitchcock's next three films, Rope, Under Capricorn,
and I Confess. During this time he met a Canadian girl, Sandra Malone, whom
he married in 1954. They had a son and two daughters.
Back in the UK in the 1950s, with all his experience of wartime propaganda
behind him, Bernstein opposed the campaign for commercial television on the
grounds that the right to broadcast into millions of homes bore 'such a
great propaganda power that it could not be entrusted to any bodies other
than a public corporation'. Yet he campaigned for the right to compete with
the BBC's increasingly popular television service by operating a
large-screen commercial television system in his cinemas.
When the law permitting commercial television was passed, however, Bernstein
was one of the first to apply for a licence. His was one of the first three
awarded.
Today Granada is the only original franchise holder to have survived
throughout the history of British commercial television. The story goes that
Sidney Bernstein, in deciding on a particular UK region for his franchise
application, studied population densities and annual rainfall and reasoned
that what he needed was an area full of people obliged to stay at home in
the evenings - hence his choice of the Liverpool-Manchester area.
From the outset Granada Television was unlike what many had feared from
'Plug TV,' as the Beaverbrook newspapers called it. On the opening evening
the new company offered - of all things - a tribute to the BBC.
It was soon doing more to push out the boundaries of television journalism
than the BBC had done in a decade. Apart from party political broadcasts,
the BBC pretty well pretended, then, that politics did not exist.
At Bernstein's urging, Granada challenged the law by putting on screen all
the candidates in the Rochdale by-election of 1958. Then it started covering
the TUC congress and the annual party conferences, which had hitherto
received television attention except in post hoc reports.
What journalists at Granada found was that Sidney Bernstein, who had always
gone to law to protect his own or his company's reputation, would stand
unflinchingly beside them if he was convinced they had their facts right; he
would take on the Independent Television Authority, the British Steel
Corporation, or even the UK government if necessary. In Granada's first 25
years, he locked antlers with all three - and others. (He invariably won).
His staff also found that, as an immaculate dresser himself, he loathed
untidiness in others (he was, so it was said, especially opposed to beards,
suede shoes and earrings). He also acquired a reputation for meanness - yet
no other ITV company has generated such loyalty in its staff; many
broadcasters have spent their entire careers with Granada.
In 1969 Sidney Bernstein became Baron Bernstein of Leigh. 15 years later,
that honour was almost equalled when the leading American television
magazine Channels, devoting an entire issue to a 'search for excellence,'
declared Granada 'the best television company in the world'.
The magazine backed up this seemingly grandiose claim by quoting chapter and
verse on Granada's television journalism (World In Action to Seven Up);
drama (Sherlock Holmes to King Lear, starring Laurence Olivier); even its
staff structure ('Granada executives have almost all been programme makers
and generally still are').
Throughout his life Sidney Bernstein urged his colleagues not to
underestimate the intelligence of the public. Although he worked always in
the mass entertainment business, his own interests were refined. He took a
lively interest in the avant garde. He was a founder of the Film Society,
which attracted people such as HG Wells, Augustus John and Bernard Shaw, and
caused much controversy in the late-1920s by showing uncensored versions of
foreign films.
For one such occasion Sidney Bernstein got Nancy Cunard to bring a print of
Bunuel's notorious surrealist work Un Chien Andalou into the UK - and past
the UK customs officers - in her hatbox.

FT  06 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Tension grows over Heron restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADVISERS TO some creditors of Heron, the property and trading group
negotiating a Pounds 1.4bn debt refinancing, are complaining about Heron's
decision to stop paying fees it regards as not essential to the
restructuring.
Heron said it could not comment on individual fee arrangements, but that its
action had been taken in the interest of creditors. Fees involved so far
amount to nearly Pounds 40m.
Tension is mounting between the parties to the restructuring plan which is
due to be put to the banks by the end of this month.
'It is all coming to a head now,' one said, adding that in such cases it was
only when negotiations became fraught that progress was made.
Without a refinancing Heron would go into receivership - an outcome the
group believes would realise less for credit-ors.
The depths of Heron's problems are revealed in a letter sent to the advisers
by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, Heron's merchant bank. This, says the group, 'will
only have cash funds available to pay fees up to January 31'.
The steering committee of banks, the letter says, is considering providing
new money of Pounds 1.6m to meet in part the company's cash requirements for
February.
Heron's advisers and those of the banks have agreed to 'defer a substantial
proportion of their fees for a year' and make payment of those fees,
amounting to Pounds 1.2m, 'contingent on the restructuring being
implemented'.
The letter proposes that fees for the advisers to the bond holders 'will be
paid contingent upon, and immediately after, implementation of the
restructuring proposals'.
Some advisers say that if they recommend bond holders to accept the
restructuring plan, the holders will say their advice is biased by the
prospect of a fee.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Coffee
prices shrug off pact blues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE TRADERS were not unduly dismayed this week as the International
Coffee Organisation's two-week negotiating session made negligible progress
towards a new price-supporting international agreement - they had expected
nothing better.
About all producer and consumer negotiators at the ICO could claim to have
achieved as the meeting drew to a close yesterday was the identification and
clarification of their differences.
While they have agreed to meet again at the the end of March, they will have
an uphill task to meet the March 31 deadline for renewing the agreement.
Brazil, the biggest producer, yesterday accused some important consumer
countries of lacking the political will to reach an understanding. Its
delegation issued a statement stressing its 'disappointment and frustration
at the lack of progress in what was to be the decisive phase in the
negotiation of a new international coffee agreement'.
No attempt has been made so far to tackle crucial points such as how to
determine the size of export quotas or the price range to be defended; and
significant divisions remain on 'selectivity' between different coffee types
within the quota system and 'automaticity', the rolling forward of quotas
from the end of one coffee year to the beginning of the next.
If the market was disturbed at the negotiators' performance it did not show
it. The May robustas price at the London Futures and Options Exchange closed
yesterday at Dollars 922 a tonne, up Dollars 27 on the week and Dollars 18
higher than the level ruling before the ICO talks began.
Initial disappointment as early hopes for the negotiations evaporated had
sent the price down to Dollars 801 a tonne at one stage last week, but that
fall was quickly recovered. Since then the market, while keeping a jaundiced
eye on the ICO session, has been more interested in the tightening
fundamental supply/demand situation and the activities of the powerful New
York investment funds. Mass movements of investment fund money have been
largely responsible for the wide fluctuations in coffee prices in recent
months and expectations of lower production in Brazil have recently been
inclining the fund managers to the side of the bulls.
The cocoa market has no such fundamental factors to prop it up. With
oversupply continuing and talk circulating that recent arrivals from the
Ivory Coast, the biggest producer, have been higher than was expected the
market came under further pressure this week. The May futures position in
London closed yesterday at Pounds 708 a tonne, down an apparently modest
Pounds 8 on the week; but the fall would have been more than Pounds 20 a
tonne had it not been for the decline in sterling against the dollar. On the
New York market May cocoa futures, which ended last week at Dollars 941 a
tonne, were quoted at Dollars 906 a tonne in late trading yesterday.
World sugar prices continued the recent slide, the May futures price in New
York reaching 8.46 cents a lb in late trading yesterday, down 11 cents on
the week. The bearish mood of the market did not appear to be materially
affected by news yesterday that ED F. Man, the London trade house, had cut
its estimate of the 1992-93 world supply surplus from 3.44m tonnes to 1.47m
tonnes.
At the London Metal Exchange most attention was directed at the zinc market,
which had moved up sharply late last week on news of a production cut at
Pasminco of Australia and this week was presented with further output
reduction announcements by Cominco of Canada and Metallgesellschaft's
Ruhr-Zinc of Germany.
Any hopes that a law of accumulating returns might apply as the output cuts
mounted were quickly dashed. The Pasminco cut (25,000 tonnes this year)
helped the LME's zinc price up to Dollars 1,137 a tonne initially; Cominco's
(50,000 tonnes) did only marginally better than that at Dollars 1,140 a
tonne; and the peak inspired yesterday by Ruhr-Zinc's (30,000 tonnes) was a
decidedly disappointing Dollars 1,135. At the close three months zinc was
quoted at Dollars 1,128 a tonne, up Dollars 10 on the week.
While the latest round of cuts has more than tripled this year's expected
zinc deficit dealers point out that they still look pretty modest in
comparison with the 1m tonnes in western world stocks.
Copper prices were firm, ending about Dollars 9 a tonne higher on the week.
But once again the pound's weakness made the sterling-denominated market
look stronger than it was, with three months metal showing a Pounds 40 gain
to Pounds 1,555.75 a tonne. The underlying steadiness was a reflection of
concern over strike worries in Mexico and Chile, dealers said.
Platinum group metals finished the week with their tails up as the outlook
seemed to improve for world industry in general and motor manufacturers in
particular. Platinum, the biggest outlet for which is the automotive
catalyst market, rallied by Dollars 2.25 yesterday to Dollars 360.75 a troy
ounce, down Dollars 3.75 on the week, as buyers were encouraged by German
and Japanese interest rate cuts and improving US economic indicators. But it
was outrun by its sister metal palladium, another catalyst metal, which was
fixed in London at a 30-month high of Dollars 114.90 an ounce, up Dollars
2.55 on the week. Palladium's extra strength was prompted by concern over
supplies from the former Soviet Union, dealers said.
The London gold price, having been under pressure throughout the week, ended
yesterday at the bottom of the range, pressing against support at Dollars
328 an ounce.

FT  06 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Northumbrian incurs loss and sells Lees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHUMBRIAN Fine Foods, the biscuit and snacks maker, yesterday announced
interim losses and said it had sold Lees of Scotland, the confectionery
subsidiary which it bought in September 1991.
Negotiations on the sale delayed publication of Northumbrian's results, due
on Wednesday. The company's shares, which were suspended on the USM pending
the announcement, resumed trading yesterday and fell 2p to 15p.
For the half year to September 30 losses within Lees and price competition
in the biscuit industry led to pre-tax losses at Northumbrian of Pounds
1.06m, compared with profits of Pounds 252,800 last time.
Continuing activities went from profits of Pounds 252,800 to losses of
Pounds 180,400, before exceptional costs of Pounds 215,000 on restructuring.
Turnover more than doubled to Pounds 11.1m, because of the Lees
contribution. Turnover on continuing activities increased 43 per cent to
Pounds 6.99m. But margin pressure saw operating profits on continuing
activities collapse from Pounds 353,600 to Pounds 37,600.
Losses per share amounted to 2.96p (earnings 0.7p) and the interim dividend
is being passed - 0.75p was paid previously but the final was omitted.
Northumbrian paid Pounds 4.8m for Lees but the acquisition had performed
poorly. The company admitted it paid too much for Lees, which made pre-tax
losses of Pounds 262,200 in the six months to September 30.
Lees was sold to the Claymore Group, a private company led by Mr Raymond
Miquel, who chaired Arthur Bell before it was acquired by Guinness.
Northumbrian will receive Pounds 1.15m in cash, payable between 1994 and
1998. The Lees brandnames will be retained by Northumbrian but Claymore has
an option to acquire the brands for Pounds 1m.
Most importantly for Northumbrian, Claymore will assume Lees's borrowings of
nearly Pounds 3m. That will reduce Northumbrian's net debt to Pounds 4.4m,
compared with Pounds 5.8m in March.

Govett American Smaller Companies Trust, formed from the reconstruction last
year of Govett Atlantic, had a net asset value per share at December 31 of
137.9p against 100p when it commenced business on May 28.
The fund aims to achieve capital gains through investment in North American
smaller companies.
Revenue after tax for the period totalled Pounds 24,000. Earnings per share
amounted to 0.1p and, and as foreshadowed in the listing particulars, no
interim dividend has been declared.
The directors said it was too early to forecast whether it would be able to
recommend a modest year end dividend.

FT  06 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Armour falls 8% to Pounds 0.83m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE OF an 8 per cent downturn in half year pre-tax profits to Pounds
830,000, Armour Trust, the confectionery and automotive group, is lifting
its interim dividend from 0.315p to 0.3465p.
The news accompanied a statement revealing that Grand Central Investment
Holdings, the chocolate maker with interests in the Asia-Pacific region, had
increased its shareholding in Armour from 4.85m ordinary to 6.57m ordinary,
representing 24.1 per cent of the issued share capital.
The figures for the half year to October 31 reflected a sharp downturn in
trade following the pound's devaluation in September. That affected trade in
October and November, the key trading months for the group.
Turnover rose to Pounds 12.34m, an improvement of 9 per cent over last
time's Pounds 11.34m.
Sales for December and January were above last year's levels and February
had started 'very positively'. Business had 'definitely improved' in export
markets.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAS THE ghost of Hilmar Reksten, the 'Norwegian Onassis' whose bankruptcy in
the 1970s nearly broke Hambros, the merchant bank, finally been laid? 'I
sincerely hope so,' said Mr Christopher Sporborg, deputy chairman of
Hambros, with some feeling.
Yesterday Hambros won a court case in Oslo which it hopes will mark the end
of an affair dating back to the 1973-74 oil shock and the shipping crisis
that followed.
Hambros was being sued for Pounds 200m, plus interest on that amount since
1989, by the Norwegian Guarantee Institute, which had guaranteed Mr
Reksten's loans, and by the trustees of Mr Reksten's estate. Mr Reksten died
in 1980.
The plaintiffs had claimed that Hambros had known about a fortune Mr Reksten
had allegedly secretly salted away in overseas tax havens to avoid Norwegian
tax. Mr Sporborg said yesterday, 'if he had, we never got our hands on it'.
As though Mr Reksten's shade could not resist a last laugh, Hambros shares
were in turmoil yesterday as news of the bank's legal triumph took more than
half an hour to filter through to the stock market.
Hambros shares opened at 298p and moved little until at 12.01 the bank
announced that judgment in the case had been issued in Oslo and a further
announcement would be made.
Fearing the worst, and that the bank might be made to pay the Pounds 200m
plus sum, the shares plunged to 240p in the next few minutes. It was 12.34
before a statement saying the court found in Hambros' favour appeared on the
Stock Exchange screens.
The problem was that the 200-page judgment was in Norwegian. As soon as
Hambros' lawyer in Oslo reached the word 'acquitted' in the document the
message was passed to Hambros and on to the Stock Exchange.
After that Hambros shares rapidly returned to the opening level and then
gained another 15p to close at 313p.
Mr Sporborg said that he expected another claim against the bank to be
dropped now. Hambros has had to bear its own costs in the case.
Hambros had lent 'hundreds of millions' to Mr Reksten, who owned a fleet of
oil tankers, and Norwegian shipping owners generally in the 1970s, Mr
Sporborg said. After the oil shock the tanker market collapsed and the
Norwegian government set up the Guarantee Institute to help Norwegian
shipping companies by guaranteeing their loans.
After Mr Reksten's death Hambros came to a 'full and final settlement' in
1982 with the Institute and the trustees, which involved Hambros paying a
substantial sum.
Hambros had thought that was the end of the matter, but in 1989 the
plaintiffs started proceedings against Hambros, saying new evidence had come
to light that Hambros had concealed information. The court yesterday found
that there was no new evidence and the 1982 agreement should stand.

FT  06 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Allied Dunbar new business fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED Dunbar Assurance, the financial services subsidiary of BAT
Industries, yesterday announced a fall of 8 per cent in new business for
1992.
Regular premiums declined, roughly in line with a marked trend for the
industry, by 9 per cent from Pounds 178.7m to Pounds 162.1m. Single premium
products, however, also fell by 8 per cent from Pounds 683m to Pounds 631m.
Single premium life and pension business both registered increases, of 26
per cent and 10 per cent respectively, however, and the company attributed
the poor overall results for single premiums to its withdrawal from
guaranteed income bonds and home income plans, which in 1991 accounted for
Pounds 110m.
The company has also been reluctant to accept transfers from occupational
pension schemes which have been lucrative for other companies.
Business placed through independent financial advisers, measured in terms of
commission paid, rose by 9 per cent. Sales through the Allied Dunbar direct
sales force fell, partly thanks to a fall in numbers from 4,800 to 4,500.
Several salesmen were recruited by J Rothschild Assurance, set up by former
Allied Dunbar executives, which started at the beginning of last year.
Allied Dunbar does not have a 'with-profits' life fund, and was unable to
boost single premiums by offering with-profits bonds, which proved to be the
highest selling products launched by the industry last year.
Total funds under management, buoyed by strong market performance during the
year, rose by 18 per cent to Pounds 11bn compared with Pounds 9.3bn, while
new sums assured rose by 14 per cent to Pounds 7.5bn.

FT  06 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Birse runs up Pounds 2.7m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIRSE GROUP yesterday announced details of a refinancing of its bank loans
which it said should put to rest rumours that it was about to join other
construction companies which had failed.
Mr Peter Birse, chairman, said that all of the company's short-term
borrowings had been rescheduled on 'a committed three-year basis to May
1996' reflecting the banks' confidence in the group's long-term future.
At the same time Birse announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.7m for the six
months to the end of October compared with profits of Pounds 1.8m.
The company, in which Bilfinger Berger, the German contractor, has a 15 per
cent stake, has decided not to pay an interim dividend (1.65p). This is
after making a loss per share of 3.6p (1.8p earnings). Turnover fell from
Pounds 189m to Pounds 164m.
Operating loses amounted to Pounds 429,000 (Pounds 3.25m profits) and the
pre-tax result was after a jump in interest charges from Pounds 1.45m to
Pounds 2.28m.
Mr Birse, commenting on the results and the refinancing, said: 'There have
been a lot of rumours lately, mostly spread by competitors, that we were
about to go down the same route as Budge and Lilley, which recently went
into receivership. We have been very successful in winning work and
increasing our market share, because we offer customers a very competitive
price. This has prompted envy from competitors which have been trying to
undermine our business.'
Mr Birse said that the banks had agreed to reschedule all of the group's
debts with any extra cost in borrowing 'which they would not have done if
they had any doubts about our future.'
The switch from short-term to medium-term borrowings also means that the
company will find it easier to satisfy financial criteria demanded by some
utilities before they will allow companies to tender for work.
Nonetheless, Birse remains highly geared. Net debt of approaching Pounds 40m
at the end of October compared with shareholders funds of Pounds 25m. Debt
is expected to fall to Pounds 30m by the end of the financial year at April
30, leaving gearing still in excess of 100 per cent.
The company said that trading conditions continued to be very harsh. It
remained determined, however, to maintain its high level of business and
keep its construction team together, even if it meant continuing to bid very
competitive prices and upsetting competitors.
The shares closed 2 1/2 p down at 30 1/2 p.
COMMENT
The good news for shareholders is that Birse's bankers have taken the view
that the company is worth supporting and will survive. Having said that, the
trading outlook, in the company's own words, remains harsh. Contracting at
best will break even for the year while commercial property is likely to
remain a tough market for at least another 18 months. The company, however,
is no longer under any immediate pressure to sell property at distressed
prices to reduce borrowings. Losses for the year could total Pounds 5m to
Pounds 6m say analysts. The shares are unlikely to attract new buyers.

FT  06 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Stake sale knocks 4 1/2 p off Queens Moat
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Queens Moat Houses, the hotels group, fell 4 1/2 p to 53 1/2 p
yesterday after an announcement that Mr Martin Marcus, deputy chairman, had
sold 1.1m shares for Pounds 629,500.
Mr Marcus said he had sold the shares to fulfil personal obligations and
that the transaction was not related to any aspect of the group's
performance.
He sold 500,000 shares at 57.5p and 600,000 for 57p. He still holds an
additional 1.16m Queens Moat shares.
Mr Marcus said the group's close season began on Monday and he would not
have been able to deal in the company's shares until after the annual
general meeting at the end of May.
He said: 'One has to look to one's personal commitments.' The sale did not
reflect a lack of confidence in the company. 'The fact that I have a pretty
large holding goes to confirm that,' he said.
Mr Marcus said Queens Moat hoped to make an announcement in 'the not too
distant future' on the use of an international hotel brand. Rumours have
circulated for several months that Queens Moat intends to broaden its link
with Holiday Inn.
Queens Moat is already a Holiday Inn franchisee on the Continent and in the
UK. Holiday Inn is thought, however, to want to increase its UK presence.
Last year, Scott's Hospitality, a Canadian company, changed the franchise of
15 of the UK hotels it owns and operates from Holiday Inn to Marriott.

FT  06 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Clifford shares leap on approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Clifford Foods, the dairy products, fruit juice and food group,
yesterday soared 93p to 513p before settling back to 505p on news that it
had received an approach that might lead to an offer for the company.
Analysts speculated last night that a hostile bid would have to find support
among the family, board members and their associates who control some 56 per
cent of the shares. However, the news of the approach comes at a time of
much activity in the dairy sector in the run-up to the abolition of the Milk
Marketing Board in 1994. Also, Clifford announced in October a 60 per cent
decline in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.03m (Pounds 2.55m) for the first half
of 1992.
According to analysts, there are several companies which could be courting
Clifford. The favourite appears to be Unigate: the dairy products and food
group is said to have made little secret of its desire to expand its liquid
milk manufacturing operations. Clifford's Home Counties base would
strengthen Unigate's underweight position in the market in the south-east of
Eng-land.
Other names being suggested in the London market yesterday included Avonmore
Foods, the acquisitive Irish dairy group, and the Danish concern MD Foods.
Other UK companies mentioned included Northern Foods, although such a move
would probably trigger monopoly problems.
Analysts suggested a price tag of about Pounds 50m for Clifford.

FT  06 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Board shuffle at BA as Lord King steps down
 -Chairman denies departure connected to Virgin affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD KING stepped down yesterday as chairman of British Airways, six months
ahead of schedule, in an attempt to bring to an end the continuing
controversy over the airline's 'dirty tricks' campaign against Virgin
Atlantic.
Lord King, who angrily denied that his departure was connected to Virgin's
recent High Court libel victory, said he was going early, after nearly 12
years as chairman, to 'remove uncertainty and speculation' about the future
leadership of BA.
He described his time at BA as 'the crowning achievement of my life'.
Sir Colin Marshall, chief executive for 10 years, becomes executive chairman
of the airline. Mr Robert Ayling, head of marketing and operations, takes up
the new post of group managing director.
Lord King's election as president of BA, for an initial three-year period,
was accompanied by a decision to enlist one extra non-executive director -
yet to be appointed - and to enhance the role of non-executive board members
in monitoring the performance of executive directors.
Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of British Industry, who
until yesterday was joint deputy chairman with Sir Colin, becomes the sole
deputy chairman, with responsibility for leading the non-executive directors
and heading the monitoring process.
Sir Colin said Sir Michael would be 'a sounding board for the executive and
a focal point for the non-executives as well'. Sir Michael said Lord King
had left behind him 'the strongest possible senior management team'.
Together with the recent implementation of a code of conduct for all
employees, to be overseen by a special committee of non-executive directors,
the moves are intended to ensure that BA does not again make itself liable
to Virgin-type allegations.
It was also announced yesterday that Mr David Burnside, BA's director of
corporate affairs, was leaving immediately.
BA is hoping that the fall-out from the Virgin affair will now subside,
though it is still in peace talks with Virgin, which will continue next
week. Failure to agree new ground rules for competition between the two
airlines could yet re-open the controversy.
Sir Colin paid tribute to Lord King, with whom he had enjoyed 'a remarkably
successful partnership'. He said his departure represented 'the end of an
era' during which he had made an outstanding contribution to BA's conversion
from a loss-making, state enterprise to one of the world's most profitable
airlines.
He added: 'It was his decision to go and it was a generous gesture. He took
it to ensure the organisation is better able to settle down and does not
have to endure continued speculation'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Airtours has received valid acceptances of its hostile bid for Owners
Abroad, its rival holiday company, from shareholders representing 0.37 per
cent of the capital.
Acceptances were likely to be low at the first closing date given that the
Office of Fair Trading is still considering a referral to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad chairman, called the level of acceptances

FT  06 FEB 93 / Letter: Poor compensation for living in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir PETER BOWNESS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was not surprised to read that some local authorities in other parts
of the country feel that London does too well out of the area cost
adjustment ('A north-south council divide widens', February 3). In the
famous phrase, they would say that, wouldn't they?
The true position is that London boroughs do very poorly out of the
adjustment. A conservative estimate is that the capital's 33 authorities are
being deprived of more than Pounds 200m a year precisely because the area
cost adjustment does not take London's higher costs into sufficient account.
These should include full allowance for salaries and wages, rents and
business rates, the costs of homelessness, caring for the very high numbers
of refugees, and the London-wide concessionary fares scheme.
Further, it is clear that Londoners subsidise those living in other areas of
the country. Some Pounds 2bn flows out of London through uniform business
rate, and London councils will lose a further Pounds 220m in grant under the
council tax, as a result of higher property values.
Cleveland, Shropshire and others can complain, but they won't find much
sympathy from London's council leaders and chief executives, nor from their
council tax payers who consistently face higher bills than householders
outside London, irrespective of their local authority's political colour.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Letter: Daf never big enough to absorb Leyland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From DENIS A I WRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'Driven to a grinding halt' (February 3) with respect
fails to address itself to the real problems within Daf. The dream to become
an important player in the European truck league was fraught with problems
from the outset. The company may have posted record profits in 1989, but so
they should have, when truck sales throughout Europe were at record levels.
I suggest that Daf was never a big enough company (in every sense) to have
absorbed Leyland in the beginning. Being the market leader in the UK, on the
one hand, and losing money on the other, is pure vanity; surely their
priorities should have been rationalisation, model integration and
restructuring, thus enabling them to have a better chance of competing in a
European market that has been suffering with overcapacity for years.
Is this the golden opportunity for Hino to take over Leyland in the UK?

FT  06 FEB 93 / Farewell to the bargain basement: Sterling's fall is
shifting the balance of power between US and UK consumers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Richard McBrien, a London freelance author, published Buying Direct
from the USA last June, it seemed a guaranteed best-seller. The booklet told
British consumers how they could order by mail from the US products from
jeans to computer software for two-thirds or less of the price at home -
even after carriage, excise taxes and Vat.
But the publication's popularity proved short-lived. After sterling fell out
of the European exchange rate mechanism in the autumn, sales - which had
been as high as 200 copies a day - dwindled rapidly. Although Mr McBrien
still gets some inquiries, most concern items unobtainable in Britain, such
as spare parts for American classic cars.
For British tourists and shoppers, the great American fire sale is over.
Since its 1992 peak of Dollars 2.004 in early September, the pound has lost
almost 30 per cent of its value against the dollar, largely erasing the
differential in transatlantic prices which last year turned the US into a
vast bargain basement.
Yet, though the US no longer offers outstanding value, it is still far from
prohibitively expensive. An FT survey this week of a sample of goods and
services found that, at a working exchange rate of Dollars 1.45 to the
pound, relatively few goods cost much more in New York than in London - and
many were still cheaper.
Compared with a similar survey last July, among the most striking shifts in
London's favour were car prices. The list price of a Japanese-made Toyota
Lexus luxury saloon, which eight months ago was 29 per cent less in New York
(including taxes), is 8 per cent higher there today. The US-made Jeep
Cherokee, recently launched in the UK, costs 15 per cent more on its home
turf.
Sex with Madonna (the book) can be had in London for barely two-thirds its
New York price, while those with more orthodox tastes in popular
entertainment can make a similar-sized saving between the two cities on a
front-stalls ticket for Phantom of the Opera. A Sony videocamera, which cost
39 per cent less than in London in July, is now priced at 6 per cent more -
though the US version is, admittedly, a newer model.
However, recently issued compact discs are still about a sixth cheaper in
New York, as are Nintendo Gameboys. A Japanese-made Pentax zoom camera sells
for a third less than in Britain, and the difference in the price of Levi
Strauss jeans is even bigger.
Such savings may no longer be enough to tempt shoppers across the Atlantic.
But unless sterling plunges much further, living costs for British visitors
should still be affordable once they get there - even on Manhattan, probably
the most expensive destination in the US.
At Dollars 3.34, a Big Mac hamburger and large fries is 17 per cent cheaper
than in central London. At the other end of the scale, the discreetly
luxurious Carlyle Hotel offers a Dollars 29 three-course set lunch. Even
after the near-obligatory 20 per cent service charge, that compares well
with the Pounds 25 table d'hote meal at the Connaught, the Carlyle's nearest
London equivalent. The cheapest double room at the Plaza on Fifth Avenue is
Dollars 246, about Pounds 170 at recent exchange rates. By contrast,
London's Savoy charges Pounds 211.
Partly for these reasons, the travel industry is far from despondent about
prospects for British tourist traffic to the US. The Plaza says it had 50
per cent more UK guests staying last month than a year before. Thomson,
Britain's biggest travel company, says the falling pound has not affected
the group's US bookings.
Many British tour operators have insulated themselves against sterling's
fall by taking out foreign exchange cover. Thomson, which bought dollars
forward at a rate of about Dollars 1.90, is guaranteeing to meet its current
brochure prices until the end of the summer.
For those yearning to see Mickey Mouse in his natural habitat, BA currently
charges Pounds 2,322 for a one-week, all-in trip to Florida's Disney World
for a family of four, compared with just Pounds 706 for two nights at
Eurodisney. But on a per night basis the cost is comparable. In any case,
who wants to visit northern France in February?
The omens are mixed as to how many transatlantic tourists will be drawn to
Britain this year. Travel agents and airlines in New York say sterling's
fall has not yet given bookings a fillip, while the Savoy hotel group say
signs of an increase in American guests are no more than a 'glimmer of
light'.
But at London's Inn on the Park hotel, Americans contributed two-thirds of a
12-point rise in the room occupancy rate last month, compared with a year
previously. 'It will take time for the new value of the pound to filter
through,' says Mr Ramon Pajares, general manager. 'If the pound stays at
this level, we will see a substantial increase in Americans by April.'
Mr Bill Melly, director of the Oxford Street Trad-ers' Association, which
represents many West End stores, is also cautiously optimistic that his
members will see more transatlantic customers this summer - provided there
are no more serious bomb explosions in the area.
However, he warns that the benefits of devaluation may be strictly
temporary: 'Eventually, the merchandise which British retailers buy abroad
gets more expensive, and that has to be passed through to the consumer.'
That may mean retail prices across the Atlantic will again become a bargain.
Such a differential has, in any case, long been normal for many
internationally traded consumer products.
For instance, British retailers say most Japanese consumer electronics
companies have persistently charged them trade prices 20 per cent higher
than in the US, even though the manufacturing cost of the products concerned
was the same. Equally, car prices have long been lower in the US than on the
other side of the Atlantic.
However, the pattern may be changing. Timberland, the Maine producer of
leisurewear, and Lands' End, a mail order clothing company based in
Wisconsin which began selling in Britain two years ago, say they are holding
their UK prices. Both companies are also pushing ahead with plans to expand
their British sales.
Lands' End says it can afford such a price freeze because it buys more
products from suppliers based in the UK than it sells there. Timberland says
it is ready to accept lower margins to increase market share.
But there would also seem quite a lot of margin to cut. Six months ago,
Timberland shoes cost a third more in Britain than in the US, while the
price of the same shirt in Lands' End's US catalogue was half that in the UK
version.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Letter: Encouraging development for local policymaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL GARDINER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Hurrah for Mr Martin Easteal, the chief executive of the Local
Government Commission for England, in his Personal View ('Power must return
to the provinces', February 4). All power to his elbow.
The opportunity for citizens to participate in meaningful decisions
affecting their communities is being extended in this part of the country by
the use of 'consultative committees'.
These allow elected representatives to receive advice from specialists
working within the local community and is helping to improve policymaking.
It is a development that should be encouraged.
Many people will agree with Martin Easteal's final sentence - if the
principle of 'subsidiarity' is right for Europe, why is it not also right
for Britain? Let us hope that the work of his commission will result in
power returning to the provinces.

FT  06 FEB 93 / A dearer year in Provence: For the British, holidays in
France will cost a lot more
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FT Reporters
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last September Mr Kevin O'Sullivan, a British businessman, agreed to buy a
small property adjoining his holiday home in Provence. Though full payment
did not have to be made until the end of this month, he decided to play safe
by immediately converting enough money into francs to cover the purchase
price.
But he was too late. His instructions reached his London bank the day after
Black Wednesday. After waiting in vain for sterling to rally, Mr O'Sullivan
has finally decided to take out a short-term loan in francs - despite a
swingeing 15 per cent interest rate - in the hope that a favourable change
in exchange rates will enable him to pay it off some time in the future.
Meanwhile, he is facing up to the painful prospect that his next French
holiday will be a lot more expensive than his last one. 'Even when the pound
was at FFr9.70, when you went to the supermarket you could round out the
exchange rate and pretend it was actually worth FFr10,' he says. 'But now
that it's at FFr8, you can't kid yourself any longer.'
During the boom years of the late 1980s, tens of thousands of Britons
decided to consummate a love affair with France by buying a bit of it. Many
were attracted by low prices, as little as Pounds 25,000 for a cottage,
though Mrs Philip Hawkes, an estate agent in Paris, says that of the 30
chateaux she sold in 1989, a third were to British purchasers.
As these expatriate owners watch the pound sink on the foreign exchanges,
they may be consoling themselves with the thought that devaluation has, at
least, created a substantial capital gain on their investments. But they may
be deprived even of that compensation. Mr Vivian Bridge of Northern France
Properties estimates that the value of the type of rural property most
favoured by British buyers has dropped by about 30 per cent in the past
year, mostly since Black Wednesday. The number of sales has fallen by about
40 per cent.
Mrs Sarah Francis of Sifex, another London-based agent, says the market has
been particularly weak for properties worth between Pounds 30,000 and Pounds
100,000. Many agents report a sharp rise in the number of expatriate owners
seeking to sell. The problem is the British have come to dominate the market
in many remote parts of the country, as the native population has moved to
big cities. As a consequence, the best hope of selling is to another Briton.
But of those who are still interested in buying, many are said to be holding
back in the hope that the market will sink further, or the franc will be
devalued.
France has traditionally vied with Spain as the most popular foreign
destination for British tourists since long before they started buying
second homes there. According to the British Tourist Authority, 7.4m of them
took holidays there in 1991.
Though official figures are not yet available, some in the travel industry
believe bookings in December for French holidays this summer were well down
on the previous year. However, the picture is patchy. Gites de France, an
organisation which rents French holiday cottages, says that though bookings
from the UK were weak before Christmas, last month they were 7 per cent up
on the previous year.
French Country Cruises, which sells canal boat holidays in France, says
summer bookings are similar to a year ago, but only because of one large
group booking. It has raised prices by 15 per cent since Black Wednesday and
is considering a further currency surcharge.
P&amp;O European Ferries, the largest cross-Channel carrier, plans no increase
in fares to France, though devaluation is forcing it to absorb sizeable cost
increases. It hopes the pound's reduced purchasing power will not affect
business too badly, arguing that even at the current exchange rate the
average cost of food and lodging is lower in France than in Britain.
By all accounts, sterling's weakness has not deterred Britons from taking
advantage of the big increase since the start of the year in the value of
the duty-paid purchases which they may legally bring back from other parts
of the EC. At the Mammouth hypermarket in Calais, sales of alcoholic drinks
to British customers was up 20 per cent last month. 'There are still a lot
of bargains for the day tripper,' says Mr Bill Simpson of Courage, the
brewing and retailing group, who visited Calais last weekend to see the
competitive threat for himself.
Anxieties on this score, along with the depressed state of the British
economy, are likely to restrain price rises on French wine and spirits
imports. 'I expect prices to move broadly in line with inflation, rather
than make up for the devaluation,' says Mr Chris Banks, marketing director
of JR Philips, a wine and spirits distributor.
Though French wine prices rose by between 5 and 10 per cent after Black
Wednesday, they face increasing competition from 'new world' producers in
countries such as Australia and South Africa. 'Concern about losing market
share is likely to ensure a cautious approach to any further increases,'
says a spokeswoman for Oddbins, the UK retail chain.
A similar line is being taken by champagne houses such as Bollinger, which
has not raised UK prices for two years, and by French cognac producers,
which saw their British sales fall 12 per cent last year. Remy Martin, one
of the leading marques, says it has no price increases planned.
Meanwhile, devaluation has prompted some British companies to capitalise on
opportunities for import substitution. Northern Foods, Marks &amp; Spencer's
biggest food supplier, is considering producing in the UK popular delicacies
such as fromage frais, most of which is currently shipped in from France.
Whether or not such plans lead to fewer French products being sold in
Britain, stand by for more visits by the French themselves. The BTA's Paris
office says inquiries through the Minitel electronic information system
about holidays in Britain trebled to 75,000 last year. Mr Pierre Bergasse,
deputy director, attributes some of the increase to the cheap pound. But he
also concedes that another explanation may be that more people have
discovered how to use Minitel.

FT  06 FEB 93 / That terrible tap on the shoulder: Japan's middle management
is losing its identity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When 35 managers at Pioneer Electronic, the video and audio equipment maker,
were given the 'shoulder tap', as compulsory retirement is known in Japan,
the collective disbelief of middle management echoed through the country's
business magazines, which concluded unanimously that the salaryman warrior
faces an 'identity crisis'.
The number of redundancies pales in comparison with the large-scale lay-offs
at IBM or General Motors or DAF, the truck maker, but the outrage and the
insecurity prompted by Pioneer's pruning reflects a deep disillusionment
among the middle-aged men popularly believed to have rebuilt Japan since the
second world war.
Pioneer has extended the deadline for the 35 'samurai', who were supposed to
have cleared their desks by January 31. But the decision still stands and
most of the group have already accepted that they have no future at the
struggling company, and are coming to terms with a role as a 'wet autumn
leaf', clinging uncomfortably to their wives at home.
A 56-year-old among those to be made redundant complained that no
explanation was given as to why he was chosen: 'All they told me was that I
was not of use - what does that mean, not of use?' The sense of uselessness
undermines the self-image of his generation, which began careers in the late
1950s, when the semi-spiritual drive to build a strong Japan provided a
well-defined role for the selfless salaryman.
Managers are not alone in their confusion. Japan as a country now longs for
a well-defined role. The clear targets of post-war economic revival have
been met, and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, now talks curiously of
making the nation a 'lifestyle superpower'.
The country is searching for a new role in Asia, a new relationship with the
US, and a new international identity.
The Pioneer case also emphasised to workers that past loyalties are up for
renegotiation in a period of corporate restructuring. Cost-cutting
programmes have generally targeted women and part-time workers, who are not
thought to be party to lifetime employment agreements and whose retrenchment
does not cause controversy.
Companies other than Pioneer have already told middle managers to move on,
but less bluntly. Managers working in head office may be told that they will
be transferred to a remote sales branch, meaning that there is no place for
them within the company. The verdict is often delivered in obscure language,
though a lack of explanation is considered to be the 'Japanese way'.
The 59-year-old wife of one of the Pioneer 35 argued that this vagueness is
unacceptable to a worker faithful for four decades, singing the company
song, eating in the canteen, and devoting most of his 'quality time' to the
office and not the family: 'He's been with them for 40 years. I guess
there's no point in being angry, but things should be clearer. It's really
very difficult to accept.'
It's also difficult for the same generation to accept that their corporate
devotion no longer inspires younger Japanese, who have more pity than
respect for the Burberry-coated men half-asleep on the late train home. Over
the past month, several Japanese researchers have concluded that the average
middle-aged manager is abrasive in handling his juniors, prompts women to
turn the other way on train platforms, and tends to forget his wife's
birthday.
Another survey, by the prime minister's office, found that middle management
attitudes are themselves shifting. About 48.4 per cent of employees in their
40s now believe that job-hopping is acceptable compared with a mere 17.1 per
cent in 1983. The result gives the impression that workers are becoming less
loyal just as companies are unable to afford loyalty. But Japanese workers
are yet to be 'empowered'. They may be in favour of job-hopping, but the
risks of moving daunt individuals still unclear where obligations end and
rights begin.
The afternoon tabloid newpapers, aimed at the middle-aged male worker,
provide a clue to the image this generation finds appealing. Each day, the
papers are dominated by the name and an action photograph of Mr Shigeo
Nagashima, 56, a legendary slugger who has returned from a 12-year
retirement to coach the country's best-known baseball team, the Yomiuri
Giants.
The well-dressed Mr Nagashima's training tips are plastered across the news
pages, giving the impression that he is a modern-day oracle. He is taken far
more seriously than the country's politicians, who are keen to be
photographed in his presence.
A youth magazine surveyed its readers on the man they would most like to
have as the department head in their office, and Mr Nagashima came out on
top. At least in one respect, some of the younger generation still share the
ideals of their superiors.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Letter: Arrangement fees that inflate interest charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From S R HUNTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have read your recent articles on banking charges for small business
with interest. My wife is a partner in a small retail business with an
unblemished financial record in the seven years since start-up. Loans have
been paid back punctually and the account has never been in the red.
A few months ago it was offered an opportunity to buy stock in bulk at a
very attractive price. On inquiring about an overdraft at its high street
bank, it found that, if it had used the overdraft fully for the maximum
three-month period of the arrangement, the effective interest rate would
have been more than 30 per cent per annum owing to arrangement fees. It
would in fact have been cheaper to borrow on her credit card.
Anyone who had borrowed from the bank on the basis that it suggested would
have been stupid. Maybe it was a customer intelligence test?

FT  06 FEB 93 / Letter: Consumer loses if monopoly question not resolved in
Post Office privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr L PATRICK LUPO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You correctly state in your leader, 'Parcelling up the post' (February
3), that 'the issues of monopoly power should be resolved before
privatisation is begun, not tackled as an afterthought'.
Private express operators have responded to customer demand for cross-border
service by investing heavily in infrastructure over the last 10 years and
have provided through a large and stable workforce a high level of
innovation and customer service in an intensely competitive market.
Investment decisions made by these companies relying upon past government
policy need to be protected as rigorously as those of the private investor
taking up shares in a government privatisation. For international express
carriers such as DHL, this means not only the freedom to compete, but to do
so on completely fair and equal terms in services which are not, for genuine
social need, reserved to the Post Office.
Not only should the Royal Mail's monopoly be narrowly construed, but it,
like every other post office in Europe, should not enjoy any advantage in
the adjacent and supposedly unregulated private express market. It would be
an affront to both consumer and competitor to confer monopoly rights which
will ensure the success of a share flotation at the expense of distorting
competition.
If the question of monopoly power is not resolved before privatisation, the
gains of investors will be at the expense of the consumer.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Man in the news: This is your captain speaking . . . - The
career and character of the next executive chairman of British Airways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FT writers
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Colin Marshall yesterday assumed complete command of the flight deck at
British Airways almost 10 years to the day after climbing aboard as first
officer. It is the job he has always wanted, though one which, in the final
countdown, could have eluded him.
As the 'dirty tricks' row with Virgin Atlantic escalated, there seemed a
chance that Sir Colin - too often second-in-command in previous jobs  -
could be deprived of total control as pressure mounted for a separation of
the chairman's and chief executive's responsibilities. Having apparently
made clear to colleagues his determination to have full executive
responsibility, or none at all, he has won the prize and the challenge of
leading 'the world's favourite airline' into its next, ambitious phase of
development.
His victory means that after a decade of loyal allegiance alongside Lord
King, who steps down in the wake of the damaging dog-fight with Virgin, the
responsibility is finally his. It is one he will relish.
Unlike Lord King, Sir Colin has never been the flamboyant type. The
Marshall-King partnership, perceived as a successful duo in the airline
industry, will not be repeated now that Mr Robert Ayling becomes group
managing director.
Mr Ayling, with initially a legal then civil service background as a former
under-secretary at the Department of Trade and Industry, is, if anything,
even more understated than Sir Colin.
There will be no doubt about who is in charge. Mr Ayling is more likely to
play the role of consigliere, or chief adviser. His legal experience and
familiarity with civil aviation's regulatory background, his DTI background
and his willingness to promote bold marketing manoeuvres such as last year's
'World's Biggest Offer', confirmed him as front-runner for number two.
If Sir Colin is not a showman he has demonstrated that he is at least a
'mucker-in'. He looked slightly uncomfortable on the cat-walk last week,
surrounded by stewardesses and sun-tanned flight attendants, as he presided
over the launch of new uniforms for BA staff.
Up early in the morning and working sometimes an 18-hour day, a stickler for
detail, and performing all the necessary public functions to further his
airline's cause, Sir Colin is clearly more at ease inside a corporate
executive suite than mingling with models.
He is the image of the hard-nosed, US-style businessman. But although he
sets high standards, he is also informal and is known throughout the airline
as Colin.
Lord King recruited him as chief executive in February 1983. He was plucked
from Sears after a recommendation by Mr Miles Broadbent of Norman Broadbent,
the headhunters. 'Colin has got customer service ingrained into him in the
shipping business, in the car business, and working for Sears. Service,
service, service, service, that's what he's all about,' says Mr Broadbent.
His US corporate experience and concentration on the customer could be one
reason why he was considered by American Express to run its travel-related
services division two years ago. More recently, he was contacted by Amex and
sounded out about the job of group chief executive. Executives at the travel
and financial services company say he was a leading outside contender for
the job, but the Virgin episode is understood to have cast a cloud over his
candidacy.
His career had started humbly enough. When he left University College
School, Hampstead, Sir Colin joined the Orient Steam Navigation Company as a
cadet purser. He became deputy purser of the SS Orsova, voyaging between
England and Australia; 'like running a big hotel', he said later.
It was in the US, however, that his career took off, when he joined the car
rental business of Hertz Corporation in Chicago as assistant to the
vice-president of administration. In six years of managing Hertz operations
in various parts of the world, the company remained unchallenged as Europe's
leading car rental company.
He was to change all that, however, when he was poached by Avis and began to
transform its service image. Male staff were given red jackets and badges
saying 'We Try Harder'. Within eight years, under Sir Colin's leadership,
Avis passed Hertz in European sales and earnings.
It was during his stint at Avis that Sir Colin forged what was then a valued
relationship, but which later at BA became a potential Achilles heal. He
prized the qualities of Mr Michael Levin so highly that he brought him in as
a personal consultant when he joined BA from Sears.
Mr Levin, who died in late 1991, has been described by some observers as the
architect of a new aggressiveness at BA that was ultimately to cost its
reputation dearly amid the accusations of 'dirty tricks' which led to the
Virgin Atlantic fiasco.
One observer went so far as to describe Mr Levin as 'the dark side to
Colin's moon'. If such a dark side exists, some light may soon be shed on
this enigmatic figure. He was an avid note taker and his BA files are
reported to have been put up for auction by a New York lawyer.
Mr Levin, who once occupied an adjoining office to Sir Colin, was dismissed
from BA in late 1989 after a secretary brought a sexual harassment suit in
the US. BA eventually settled the Dollars 5m court action. His name could
have emerged again had the Virgin libel action continued, since it appeared
in notes compiled by Mr Branson in his personal notebook. The spectre of his
former adviser has proved an irritant not only to Sir Colin, but to other
directors, some of whom seem at a loss to explain his apparent influence
during his time at BA.
Leaving aside the legacy of Levin's management style and the Virgin debacle
 -and it is far from clear yet whether BA has put both behind it - Sir Colin
needs to restore morale quickly. BA is currently engaged on several
international fronts, pursuing its globalisation strategy as well as having
to cope with the current airline industry recession.
Global expansion has been the second phase of Sir Colin's overall strategy.
The first priority when he joined Lord King was to transform BA's
essentially engineering and operational culture into a market-driven one.
The real problem with BA, he once wrote, was that the airline 'had forgotten
that it was a service industry'. One of the first things he did at BA was to
put everyone, starting with himself, through customer service training. 'He
leads by example,' observed one former BA consultant.
While taking a lead among European carriers in restructuring the airline,
with sweeping job cuts and strong emphasis on holding down costs, Sir Colin
sought to tailor its operations to its different markets.
With retailing experience gleaned as deputy chief executive of Sears, the
company he joined after Avis, he brought the concept of branding to BA with
the launch of products like Club World and Club Europe. The emphasis was on
detail. 'One of the most important tasks in any service business is to keep
the shine on the product day in and day out,' he once said.
With BA transformed from the airline universally known as 'Bloody Awful' to
what is generally acknowledged as one of the world's most efficient
airlines, Sir Colin turned his attention to forging international
partnerships and investments.
BA's record in this respect has met with mixed fortunes, winning stakes in
some airlines, like Qantas, but failing to buy into operators like KLM and
Sabena. It now believes it has clinched a USAir partnership despite some US
opposition to the deal.
Though fiercely ambitious, Sir Colin is quietly spoken, controls his
emotions and rarely gives anything away. He is a tough negotiator with a
knack for remembering people's names. Those who work with him describe him
as 'a very straight man who plays it down the middle'.
He is essentially a private man who keeps his family life separate from that
of his business, though his daughter, Joanna, did gain her pilot's licence
at the BA flying school.
Away from work, he is also a sports enthusiast, fond of tennis and ski-ing
and a supporter of Arsenal football club. Surprisingly, for a man born and
educated in London, he retains a love of Rugby League, the gritty northern
professional game, that he developed while spending time with his father in
Wigan.
Back in the boardroom, the quest is on for a restoration of normality. The
board acted swiftly yesterday to secure the succession to Lord King, and to
put into place checks and balances to ensure further misdemeanours are
avoided or rooted out.
In the meantime, peace talks between BA and Virgin continue, and both sides
hope for an early and successful conclusion. Another falling-out could spell
more trouble, with Virgin pursuing in the US and European courts its
allegations of unfair treatment at BA's hands.
Virgin was not the first airline to feel the hot breath of BA. It happened
to Sir Freddie Laker, who was compensated in the courts in 1985 only after
his business collapsed in 1982.
The lesson was not lost on Mr Branson when Sir Freddie warned him: 'For
God's sake sue them before they put you out of business rather than
afterwards.' Though some people might have forgotten the Sky Train battle,
Mr Branson has not. He christened one of his aircraft the Spirit of Sir
Freddie. He will invoke that spirit to haunt Sir Colin wherever he can.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Shoot-out at the currency corral: A week of acrimony has
fuelled doubts about European integration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even by the crisis-prone standards of Europe's exchange rate mechanism, it
has been a week of extraordinary turbulence. As politicians argue about who
is to blame, monetary gun-smoke has been swirling through ministries and
financial markets across the continent.
Ireland started the acrimony with complaints against the UK and Germany over
the punt's devaluation. As the pound slumped in mid-week to record lows,
France intensified an anti-British assault - taking aim at the UK's
aggressive interest rate cuts and alleged job poaching through 'social
dumping'.
Hostilities subsided on Thursday with the Bundesbank's unexpected interest
rate cuts, intended above all to support the franc ahead of next month's
French elections. The vote is expected to bring in a right-wing government
which might be tempted to sever the franc's D-Mark link as a way of
cheapening French credit and regenerating growth. This would torpedo the
already-faltering plan in the Maastricht treaty for economic and monetary
union (Emu) by the end of the 1990s.
After Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, said he hoped
domino-like speculation against weaker currencies would cease, calm returned
yesterday to the foreign exchanges.
But, following four realignments since September, in which countries
accounting for 45 per cent of EC gross national product have devalued or
left the ERM, currency unrest is unlikely to have been completely quelled.
The ERM, set up in 1979 as the nucleus of the European Monetary System of
stable exchange rates, has become a hotbed of instability. The scale of
speculative flows across a continent now freed of exchange controls is
bigger than ever before. The inflation-adjusted value of the 'hot money'
streaming into the D-Mark in September was triple the size of the inflows
into Germany generated in 1973 by the break-up of the fixed exchange rate
Bretton Woods system. Combined with overall European economic strains caused
by the shock of German reunification, the ERM upsets have put the EC on a
knife-edge.
Advocates of EC integration fear a breakdown in European economic
co-operation, similar to the experience after the 1973 oil price rise. 'We
are in a crisis,' Mr Jacques Delors, the EC Commission president, said on
Thursday.
He welcomed the Bundesbank rate cut as a 'good political signal'. But Mr
Delors pointed to the risk that the European recession, aggravated by
Germany's fiscal imbalances and high interest rates, could scupper monetary
union. 'If there is no growth between now and 1997, there will be no Emu,'
he said.
Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner, sounded an implicit
warning that 'competitive devaluations' could wreck the EC's barrier-free
single market which started on January 1.
At least the Bundesbank has now signalled it cares about the ERM's fate. Emu
supporters in Brussels are looking for further cuts of at least 1 percentage
point in the German discount rate - now at 8 per cent - during the next few
months.
Assuming - as seems likely - the system survives the French elections, EC
governments and central banks during the next few weeks must make crucial
decisions on its future.
There are two main alternatives. The ERM could either revert to its original
design of providing no more than a semi-fixed exchange rate framework which
would be sporadically adjusted in line with EC economic divergences. Or the
Maastricht transition to Emu could be accelerated by the Bonn and Paris
governments - creating a 'mini-Emu' around a Franco-German core, including
the Benelux countries but leaving out Britain and Italy.
The first idea - a return to a more flexible ERM - is favoured by the
Bundesbank. Germany's central bank has long been suspicious of the
Maastricht Emu plan since it would spell the demise of the D-Mark.
Additionally, the Bundesbank argues that the lack of ERM currency
realignments between 1987 and 1992 was the main cause of last autumn's
upsets.
Indeed, Germany's reunification problems may make a less ambitious ERM
inevitable. Because recession has increased budget deficits, most countries,
including Germany, are overshooting the Maastricht fiscal targets set as
conditions for Emu.
After sterling was forced to quit the ERM in September, Mr John Major, the
UK prime minister, announced Britain would not rejoin unless the system's
'fault-lines' were reformed. But the Bundesbank's support for a return to
the former ERM arrangements is backed by Denmark, whose krone this week has
come under heavy speculative attack.
Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, governor of the Danish National Bank, which was forced to
increase its discount rate by 2 points on Thursday, says: 'We are not
advocating reform of the EMS.'
Countries running policies which were not in line with stable exchange rates
would have to 'stick to the rules' of either adjusting these policies or
devaluing, Mr Hoffmeyer says. 'You cannot wait and wait and wait (for a
realignment). Otherwise, the system explodes.'
The second ERM alternative, discussed increasingly in Brussels, is more
ambitious. Under this plan, the Bonn and Paris governments could speed up
the Maastricht timetable to transform the ERM into Emu - establishing a
'mini' monetary union.
Officials in Brussels doubt whether the present ERM, including the French
franc, can survive intact until 1997 or 1999 when, under the Maastricht
plan, the EC is supposed to make an irrevocable move towards a single
currency.
There is a growing belief that the so-called 'second stage' of Emu, planned
to start next year, is simply too long - an invitation to the foreign
exchange markets to attack vulnerable currencies before Emu takes place.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl recently hinted at the possibility of a mini-Emu
outside the Maastricht treaty. The idea is fraught with political risk, and
has attracted opposition from the Bundesbank.
Nonetheless, there seems to be greater support from French and German
politicians. One senior French official in Brussels yesterday predicted
that, if the EMS broke down completely, Bonn and Paris would still rescue
monetary union. 'If the EMS collapsed, I'm sure France and Germany would
take an initiative to ensure monetary union. They would be obliged to do
it.'
Mr Helmut Schmidt, the former West German chancellor, who with French
President Valery Giscard d'Estaing was the chief EMS architect in 1978-79,
says he favours a Franco-German 'fast track'.
'I could imagine Europe going forward with a central bank system and a
single currency linking France, the Benelux countries and Germany. This
might in time become very attractive for other countries to join - not, in
the first place, Britain, but maybe Austria, Switzerland and the
Scandinavian countries.'
Mr Schmidt, who believes last autumn's currency upheavals could have been
avoided if governments had made 'timely adjustments', says the 'fast track'
plan, although desirable, is unlikely.
'I don't give it (the plan) much of a chance. The Bundesbank is against it,
as always. They are fighting for the stability of the currency. But they are
also fighting to retain their own turf.'
Mr Karl Otto Pohl, former president of the Bundesbank, who resigned in 1991
because of disagreement over the government's reunification policies, also
supports a 'multi-speed' path to Emu. 'A large monetary union (grouping all
EC countries) will never come,' says Mr Pohl, now a partner in the
Cologne-based Oppenheim bank.
Mr Pohl, like Mr Schmidt, says he is 'under no illusions' over the
difficulties of realising a smaller monetary union with a central bank
established by Germany, France and the Benelux countries. Late last month,
Mr Schlesinger ruled out accelerated monetary union on the grounds that the
Maastricht treaty stipulates that Emu cannot start before 1997.
Mr Pohl says this illustrates the Bundesbank's adroit tactics. Although the
central bank opposes the treaty's Emu timetable, Maastricht has also become
the 'main hurdle' faced by advocates of accelerated Emu, Mr Pohl points out.
Whatever the difficulties in realising 'fast track' Emu, Britain's economic
policies since September may have increased the willingness of France, in
particular, to countenance European integration without the UK.
For its part, Britain recognises that Franco-German Emu would harm its
interests.
Lord Jenkins, EC commission president between 1977 and 1981, says that, from
the viewpoint of continental Europe, 'there is a lot to be said for the fast
speed idea'. He adds: 'It would cause enormous problems for Britain . . .
Sterling would be an offshore currency caught between the dollar and the
European bloc. We would be more bullyable.'
The main factor heightening antipathy towards Britain in Brussels and Paris
is suspicion that the UK is practising benign currency neglect in a dash for
growth - ignoring the cost for others in the EC. 'Britain,' says one EC
official, 'is drifting off into the Atlantic.'
Antagonism has been fuelled by the decision by Hoover, the US appliance
maker, to close its Dijon plant and shift production to Scotland.
All this has revived complaints in Brussels about Britain's failure to sign
the Maastricht social chapter - as well as about the UK delay in ratifying
the treaty.
If British MPs performed the unexpected and voted down Maastricht
ratification this spring, this would greatly increase the likelihood of a
drive to Emu by Paris and Bonn. As the battle for Europe's money rumbles on,
the risk that a Maastricht No would strengthen still further Franco-German
monetary entente must be the factor most likely to guarantee the treaty's
passage in the House of Commons.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Leading Article: The right G7 agenda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BE WARNED. Global co-ordination of economic policy, long out of vogue, is
back on the agenda. The Clinton administration wants an early meeting of
ministers from the Group of Seven industrialised countries to reinvigorate
the G7 consultation process. European Commission president Mr Jacques Delors
called on Monday for the G7 to put the world back on a growth tack. And at
the World Economic Forum in Davos, a talk shop for the fat cats of
international economics and business, the corridors were abuzz this week
with talk of global growth initiatives.
If policy co-ordination is making a comeback, it is not hard to see why.
Yesterday's figures for the Japanese current account make the point all too
plainly. With the surplus up by more than 60 per cent to a record Dollars
117.6bn for 1992, there are justifiable fears that the re-emergence of trade
imbalances in the G7 will inflame the protectionist instinct of hawkish
elements in the new US administration. Yet experience suggests that G7
initiatives are, to put it kindly, something less than a panacea.
The case for co-ordination rests on increasing economic inter-dependence. In
a typical OECD country, between a quarter and a half of the impact of
domestic policy on economic activity falls not at home, but in other
economies. Hence the suggestion that a better collective economic outcome
can be achieved through co-operative policy setting; and that the perceived
loss of sovereignty involved is more apparent than real.
Perverse results
It sounds sensible enough, but the results have been perverse. The locus
classicus of such co-ordinated global growthmanship was the Bonn summit in
1978, at which the US called on Germany and Japan to act as locomotives to
pull the world towards a faster recovery. The US attacked the Japanese
current account surplus - there is nothing new in global economics - and
argued that Japan and Germany, with their low inflation and strong external
accounts, were failing to do enough to boost global demand. The two surplus
countries then embarked on a fiscal expansion, which coincided with the
second oil shock. Inflation was the result, especially in hypersensitive
Germany, where it topped 5 per cent in 1979 - even higher than its present
post-unification level. Despite some benefits, such as the decontrol of US
energy prices, the Bonn summit gave co-ordination a bad name.
Subsequent attempts have been less ambitious, but arguably more damaging. In
the 1980s the US, with a savings shortage, and Japan with a mirror-image
surplus, became interdependent to an unprecedented degree. Seemingly logical
policy co-ordination, first in the Plaza accord, then in the Louvre
agreement, ended up by imposing an excessively lax monetary policy on Japan.
There followed in Tokyo the biggest speculative bubble since 1929. The
aftermath threatens to leave Japan with nil or negative growth this year.
For its part, the US failed to deliver on its promises to address its
structural budget deficit, which now plagues the Clinton administration.
Monetary strains
In Europe, meantime, the ambitious attempt to turn the semi-fixed exchange
rate mechanism into something more rigid has foundered, largely because
co-operation was confined to monetary policy and exchange rates. The
monetary mixture was incompatible with the loose fiscal policy adopted by
Germany after unification. Hence the monetary strains that caused Britain,
with a more heavily indebted economy than most other ERM members, to leave
the system.
It is possible to be too downbeat about concerted economic action. The early
economic summits after the first oil crisis almost certainly helped avert a
rapid move to protectionism. But the subsequent lessons suggest that any
return to economic co-ordination should focus on limited and attainable
objectives.
The most important issue on the agenda remains the preservation of the
multilateral trading system. The overwhelming priority should be the
completion of the Uruguay round. Equally pressing is the stabilisation of
the Russian economy, where loans, technical assistance and improved market
access need further attention.
But where the big issues of fiscal and monetary policy are concerned, it
would be foolish to expect very much. The experience in the ERM amply
demonstrates the problems of defining and addressing exchange rate
disequilibria. Where fiscal policy is concerned, the Japanese could be
excused, after their experience in the late 1980s, for inserting ear plugs
before the siren call comes for more co-operative policymaking. Domestic
recession is anyway prompting further fiscal and monetary relaxation, which
holds the key to reducing the trade surplus.
What is needed from the Clinton administration, before a more ambitious
programme is contemplated, is a demonstration that it really does have the
will to put its own house in order before jawboning the rest of the world.
On past form, that self-denying ordinance seems unlikely to be observed.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Tory party sheds staff to curb debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHAKE-UP of Conservative organisation including 61 job losses was
announced yesterday by Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman. The losses
will include 42 compulsory redundancies.
The move comes as the party's debts approach Pounds 20m and after widespread
internal criticism of its management.
Sir Norman's action followed a rapid increase in spending by the party in
the run-up to last year's general election. Conservative MPs, constituencies
and staff had complained of weak financial control, no clear lines of
authority, a Byzantine management structure, and poor co-ordination and
communications.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, said: 'We are rationalising, as are many
companies around the country.'
The deficit is expected to reach Pounds 19m this year. Spending last year
was Pounds 28m compared with an income of Pounds 22m. Recent refurbishment
of Conservative Central Office cost about Pounds 4m.
Sir Norman, who described the package as 'the most comprehensive set of
reforms for the last 60 years', said he wanted to eliminate the deficit by
1996 and to cut expenditure to Pounds 7m this year.
Sir Norman appeared yesterday to rule himself out as a possible replacement
for Mr Norman Lamont, as chancellor. He said he wanted to see through
reforms at Conservative Central Office.
About half the job losses will be at Central Office in London and the rest
in area offices. Some staff will leave voluntarily or on early retirement.
By the end of this year the number of employees will have fallen to 228 from
more than 350 at the time of the general election. Separately, a 'board of
treasurers' will launch an appeal to tackle the deficit. Ten areas offices
will be reduced to six.
However, Sir Norman has not responded to calls from the 'Charter Group'
within the party which wants more elected posts. He promised to release more
financial information but had no specific proposals at this stage.
The main management reform is the setting up of a board of management,
chaired by Sir Norman, and bringing together representatives from the
parliamentary party, the European parliamentary party, local government and
the National Union - which represents the constituency associations.
Sir Norman emphasised how the European party would be drawn closer into the
central organisation.
Sir Norman wants a greater proportion of funds to come from constituency
associations, which account for only about 10 per cent of income. They will
have to produce annual reports, but will remain largely autonomous of
Central Office.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Barclays escapes action over data: Banks may face code on
approaches to customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE office of the Data Protection Registrar yesterday said it had no
immediate plan to take legal action against Barclays Bank over the bank's
policy of putting personal and account details of new customers on a central
database.
The announcement followed a meeting between officials and senior legal
advisers of the bank over Barclays' insistence that all new customers give
consent for its subsidiaries to have access to account details for marketing
purposes.
Mr John Lamidey, the assistant data protection registrar responsible for
financial services, said the office had no immediate intention of seeking an
enforcement order against the bank under the 1984 Data Protection Act.
However, Mr Lamidey said he would raise his concerns over with the British
Bankers' Association, and might produce guidance for banks on the methods
they could use to persuade customers to give consent for the use of data.
Barclays said that it had been assured that the registrar was not
contemplating action against it, and that it was neither breaking the Data
Protection Act nor the banks' code of practice for personal customers.
Barclays said it would in future have discussions with the registrar to
ensure that it complied with the act and the code of practice in its policy
on internal disclosure of personal data held on computers.
The bank said it had previously sought approval from the data protection
registrar for clauses in application forms for its products such as
Barclaycard credit cards saying that customers would have to give consent
for the use of data.
However, it wanted to ensure that its future policy on the use of customer
data was approved by the registrar. It would also comply with any future
guidance on consent issued through the British Bankers' Association.
The meeting was arranged this week after Mr Lamidey expressed public concern
that banks might be evading their code of practice and breaking the act by
insisting that new customers gave consent for internal disclosure of data.
The code of banking practice, which was introduced by the banks last March,
says that customers should give consent for their bank to disclose details
of accounts to third parties, even if the third party is a subsidiary of the
bank.
However, banks are keen to gain permission for the internal disclosure of
information because their subsidiaries selling products such as life
insurance want to to market products to bank customers who are most likely
to buy them.
Banks are currently reviewing rules on the confidentiality of customer
information in a British Bankers' Association working party. The association
promoted the establishment of a voluntary code of practice last year.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Labour will consider elected mayors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Labour party is to examine the case for elected mayors of councils, and
its leadership has accepted the principle of the council tax and compulsory
competitive tendering for local services, after strenuously opposing both.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow local government minister, announced the policy shifts
as Labour councillors met in Bournemouth for their annual conference.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, hailed them as 'the latest
humiliat-ing climbdown by Labour.' Although Mr Straw limited his acceptance
of compulsory tendering to blue-collar services such as refuse collection,
his announcement will be controversial among Labour councils and local
government unions, which wish to protect direct labour organisations. At the
last general election Labour proposed to abolish compulsory tendering and
the council tax.
In an interview published in yesterday's Tribune magazine, Mr Straw said:
'There is wide acceptance that the division between contractor and provider
that compulsory competitive tendering has produced has been sensible. It has
meant that in areas of basic services there are now clear definitions of
what services should be provided.'
On the council tax, he said: 'The underlying principle of council tax is OK
 -it's a property tax. But some of the practice is bad. We'll be working out
how it can be changed so that it becomes much more like what we wanted in
the fair rates system.'
Addressing the conference, Mr Straw emphasised that 'the model council
should be an enabling council', aiming to 'help people to organise for
themselves'.
Although he said that he was 'not in favour of following the Tories'
agenda', hitherto the case for both competitive tendering and 'enabling
councils' - as opposed to councils directly providing services - has been
argued mainly by the Conservatives.
Mr Straw commended 'looking at the idea' of elected mayors as a way of
giving councils 'a political focus'.
He added: 'We must also look at the idea of having fewer council committees
and perhaps fewer councillors, alongside an extension of community and
parish councils to the whole country.'
Elected mayors were last raised as a serious possibility by Mr Michael
Heseltine, on becoming environment secretary in 1990. The cabinet gave no
encouragement, with other ministers concerned that they might strengthen
local government.
Mr Heseltine got no further than establishing a review of local authority
internal management, which is due to report soon.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Blair points crime finger at the shires
</HEADLINE>

CRIME IS rising more rapidly in the affluent suburbs and shires than in
rundown areas under the control of Labour councils, Mr Tony Blair, shadow
home secretary, said yesterday.
He accused Mr John Major, the prime minister, of debasing a serious issue by
his recent statement that socialism was to blame for inner-city crime.
Mr Blair backed his claim with evidence from 10 police authorities covering
areas in East Anglia and the Midlands to the south-west of England showing
the rise in burglaries since 1979 when the Conservatives came to office.
Leicester headed the list with a 452 per cent increase, followed by
Gloucestershire (444 per cent), with Bedfordshire and Suffolk (both 290 per
cent) and Devon and Cornwall (274 per cent).
Mr Blair said crime had more than doubled in the 14 years of continuous
Conservative government - and had risen by 50 per cent in the past three
years. Calling for a fresh approach to combating the crime wave, he refused
to accept that in many cases it could be attributed to social deprivation.
He said: 'Those who commit crimes should be caught and punished. There are
no excuses for crime and it is some of the poorest and most vulnerable in
our society that suffer its worst effects.'
He made clear that Labour would oppose any move by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
home secretary, to replace elected councillors serving on police authorities
with local businessmen. Mr Blair said: 'By all means let local businesses
and others be involved in policing and policing priorities, but removing a
local say through local representatives would be a foolish and regressive
step.'
Mr Blair was addressing the Labour local government conference in
Bournemouth. Mr John Smith, the party leader, will speak tomorrow. Britain
will become the 'environmental dustbin of Europe' because the government is
making a 'bonfire' of 'green' rules, Mr Chris Smith, shadow environmental
protection spokesman, told the conference. He said offshore oil-drilling
regulations were being loosened to speed development regardless of the
'green' cost, and the government had signalled its intention to relax air
pollution controls and to allow industry to self-monitor its pollution
discharges.
'This is alarming in the extreme. It's like telling burglars to police
themselves,' he said.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Teachers to vote on banning tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEACHERS in England and Wales yesterday neared outright conflict with the
government over controversial national curriculum tests.
The executive of the NASUWT, the second-largest teachers' union, voted to
ballot its 127,000 members on a boycott of all tests this year. The tests
are due to be sat by seven and 14-year-olds in state schools from April.
The union will seek next Tuesday the support of the other five teachers'
unions. All have expressed serious reservations about this year's tests for
14-year-olds, which are to be compulsory for the first time.
The tests in English, to take place in June, have caused particular
controversy. The last of the prescribed texts have only recently been
received by schools, and sample questions have still to reach many teachers.
Teachers say this has left insufficient time to prepare pupils.
There is also opposition to the publication of test results, which may lead
to school league tables like those issued by the government for this year's
tests for seven-year-olds.
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, NASUWT general secretary, said: 'Teachers know their
pupils are being used by the government. They know that the tests have not
been properly piloted, that set texts have been announced piecemeal after
the year has begun and spending decisions have been made.'
Of the other unions, the National Union of Teachers, the largest, is most
likely to join the NASUWT in pressing for a boycott. An NUT survey of
teachers involved in the English tests, released earlier this week, showed
nine out of 10 respondents in favour of a boycott.
Baroness Blatch, schools minister, described claims that the tests had not
been properly prepared as 'ridiculous', and pointed to pilots 'involving
hundreds of schools and thousands of pupils' over the past 2 1/2 years.
Mr de Gruchy said the boycott would 'definitely go ahead' if he secured a
'clear-cut majority'. It would probably start in April. Possible courses of
government action in response are unclear - particularly when education
authorities, headteachers and governors are all sympathetic.
In spite of threatened boycotts, the introduction of tests for
seven-year-olds in 1991 proceeded without disruption.
Mr de Gruchy said his union was not opposed to 'sensible testing and
assessment'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE newspaper industry yesterday added a clause to its code of practice to
limit the use of eavesdropping equipment and the recording of private
telephone calls.
An industry committee which reviews the code of practice for journalists
annually has added a new clause which will form the basis for adjudications
by the Press Complaints Commission.
The clause says journalists should not obtain or publish material 'obtained
by using clandestine listening devices or by intercepting private telephone
calls' unless justified by the public interest.
Public interest is defined as detecting or exposing crime or serious
misdemeanour and seriously anti-social conduct; protecting public health and
safety; and preventing the public being misled by statements or actions of
an individual or organisation.
The committee is also consulting the newspaper industry on a further
proposal which would try to regulate the use of long-lens cameras on private
property.
The government has made clear it wants to change the criminal law to make
eavesdropping and telephone tapping criminal offences.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Private housing starts down 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of new homes started by private housebuilders last year fell to
the lowest level for more than a decade, according to figures published
yesterday by the Environment Department.
Private housing starts fell by a further 10 per cent last year to just under
121,000, compared with a peak of 221,000 private starts in 1988.
The latest decline in private sector starts was partially offset last year
by an increase in new construction by housing associations, which the
government expects to take over from local authorities the responsibility
for providing rented accommodation for poor and disadvantaged people.
The department says the number of new housing starts made by associations
jumped by 50 per cent last year from 21,600 to 32,600 - more than double the
number of starts by associations in 1988. Over the same period the number of
starts made by local authorities fell by more than three-quarters from
16,300 to 2,700 last year.
Overall the number of private and public sector housing starts declined from
160,500 in 1991 to 156,300 last year.
The latest figures from the department have been published as signs emerged
that house sales have started to recover after the low reached last autumn
during the sterling crisis.
Building societies, estate agents and housebuilders have reported a marked
improvement in mortgage applications from offers to buy and enquiries from
potential purchasers since just before Christmas, although this has still to
flow through in increased construction of homes.
The department said private sector starts during the final three months of
last year were 5 per cent lower than during the previous three months.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Personal insolvencies up 44%: Incidence of company failures
showed decline in final months of last year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of personal insolvencies jumped 44 per cent to 36,794 last year
compared with 1991, government figures showed yesterday.
In a further indication of the effects of the recession on the British
economy, company insolvencies grew 12 per cent during the year to 24,424.
That meant 2.6 per cent of active companies became insolvent in the final
quarter of last year, compared with 2.3 per cent in the same period of 1991.
The figures showed a seasonally adjusted decline of 10 per cent in company
insolvencies between the third and fourth quarters last year.
Mr Richard Brown of the British Chambers of Commerce, which produces the
statistics for the Department of Trade and Industry, said: 'It is good news
that the figures have gone down in the largest quarterly fall for five
years.'
But he warned against drawing optimistic conclusions from the short-term
downward trend. 'We are not becoming too sanguine,' he said. 'This may
reflect the banks taking something of a more realistic attitude.' He said he
was pessimistic given that fewer than 20 per cent of manufacturing companies
and 10 per cent of service companies were working to full capacity.
He said the rate of insolvencies typically rose during economic recovery as
companies suffered a shortage of working capital which their bankers did not
make good.
Seasonally adjusted personal insolvencies rose 4 per cent to 9,795, compared
with 9,391 in the third quarter of 1992. They were up 25 per cent from 7,831
in the final quarter of 1991.
Separate statistics released yesterday by the Lord Chancellors' Office
showed a substantial rise for the full year for corporate winding-up and
personal bankruptcy petitions.
Debtor petitions to the courts - presented by individuals rather than their
creditors - leapt by nearly two thirds during the year. Creditors' petitions
rose 22 per cent and company winding-up petitions grew 2 per cent.
The petitions are not directly comparable with the Chambers of Commerce
insolvency statistics because not all petitions are granted by the courts,
and there is a delay before they are reflected in recorded insolvencies. The
figures for the final quarter of 1992 were all up on the final quarter of
1991. Company winding-up petitions rose slightly from 4,112 to 4,121 between
the periods.
Creditors' petitions rose 16 per cent from 6,322 to 7,339 between the final
quarters of last year and the year before, while debtors' petitions jumped
42 per cent from 2,911 to 4,140.
Insolvency practitioners have attributed the rise in debtor petitions to the
declining stigma attached to bankruptcy during the present recession.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Nine reach shortlist for editorship of Economist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NINE OF Britain's brightest rising media stars have gone into serious
training. Over the next month they will do battle for one of the biggest
jobs in their trade - editor of The Economist, the world's most influential
business weekly.
The shortlist of candidates will be interviewed on March 4. But a wrong word
at the interview, and the chance of editing the 150-year-old weekly,
half-owned by the Financial Times, could be lost.
Past performance suggests that the job is a reliable springboard for
ambitious types intent on making their mark in business life.
Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, 45, the current editor, has been appointed deputy
governor of the Bank of England. His predecessor, Mr Andrew Knight, is
executive chairman of New International, Mr Rupert Murdoch's UK newspaper
empire.
All the current candidates, with the exception of Mr Matt Ridley, work for
the magazine and the majority are in their 40s - Ms Frances Cairncross, Mr
Nico Colchester, Mr Johnny Grimond, Mr Jim Rohwer and Mr Mike Elliott. Mr
Bill Emmott, Mr Clive Crook and Mr Daniel Franklin are 37, and Mr Ridley
will be 35 tomorrow.
The shortlist includes several with powerful connections. Mr Grimond, the
magazine's foreign editor, is heir to Lord Grimond, the former Liberal
leader, and Mr Ridley is the eldest son of Viscount Ridley. Ms Cairncross,
the environment editor, is daughter of Sir Alec Cairncross, a former head of
the government economic service and married to Mr Hamish McRae, associate
editor of The Independent.
The final selection will be on March 9.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Motor town recalls days before Daf: The impact of the
company's collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHOTOGRAPHS and mementoes of a lifetime in engineering decorate the walls of
a small bedroom which is part office, part glory hole at the home of Mr Les
Southworth, a former director at Leyland Motors.
Mr Southworth, who belongs to a long line of boardroom engineers at Leyland,
is recalling the day in 1965 when Sir Donald Stokes, then managing director,
decided to present a gold watch to everyone who had more than 25 years
service with the company.
'They had to hire the Winter Gardens at Blackpool. There were 1,750 workers
from the Leyland and Chorley factories who qualified. Many had 30 or 40
years service.
'People at Leyland had pride and spirit in their work. They still do. They
have accepted new working practices. Production levels are equal to any in
Europe and vehicles are coming off the lines with zero defects,' he says.
The town gave its name to the company. Many of the townspeople gave their
working lives. Mr Southworth almost ran out of fingers counting his family
connections in the company. 'I worked at Leyland, my son worked there, my
brother did, daughter-in-law, uncle and nephew,' he said. 'They all worked
there but they're all gone now.'
They left the company as it shrank during the 1980s. Doors have been closing
on Leyland's factory floors since the early 1980s when 12,500 people were
employed locally.
Once many workers were bussed in from surrounding areas. Today the
employment pattern is reversed as increasing numbers of Leyland people
commute to adjoining areas. The threat to the remaining 2,500 jobs at the
Leyland Daf plants in the town, with a possible 7,000 more due to knock-on
factors, is exacerbating an erosion of local trade that has happened
throughout the past decade.
The demise of Leyland is not so much the death of a town as the end of a way
of life where a community lived, worked and shopped around the main
employers. In its heyday, the truck company exerted a powerful influence in
Leyland.
Roads such as Churchill, Cromwell and Centurion were named after the battle
tanks that were built there and Leyland people retain a strong emotional
attachment to the company.
According to South Ribble Borough Council, Leyland is far from dying. It is
in Lancashire's wealthiest borough, topping a league table based on
information gleaned from census returns.
The town of 36,000 is to the north-west of the traditional Lancashire
industrial belt. Beyond the urban centre is rich farmland.
Three industries dominated the town after the second world war - trucks,
paint and rubber manufacturing. All have declined, consolidated or moved
operations to the peripheries of the town. Today a third of South Ribble's
workforce is employed at seven companies. Only last week the town had been
heartened by the news that British Aerospace, which employs about 3,500
people in the borough, had secured Tornado aircraft orders for Saudi Arabia.
However, the jobless trend is worrying the council. By November 1992 it was
running at 6.8 per cent, up from 3.6 per cent in June 1990 - a trend which
worries the council.
Mr Jim Breakell, the mayor, is a staunch supporter of the plant. He says it
is far removed from the pre-Daf merger days of industrial strife.
'I don't believe the government is looking at it with an entrepreneurial
eye,' says Mr Breakell, who believes a financial lifebelt from the
government would make economic sense.
He criticised some of the 'camouflage, facelift schemes' in industrial areas
which he said left little to show for the outlay. He said: 'They put money
into short-term things that don't do the economy any long-term good.'
About 5,000 demonstrators marched from the Leyland Daf assembly plant in
Leyland to the town centre yesterday in support of 2,200 local employees of
the company whose jobs are at risk.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Council seeks to to save van plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIRMINGHAM City Council is trying to turn local expressions of support for
Leyland Daf's operations at Washwood Heath into a scheme that would secure
the future of the long-established van production plant.
Council officials plan to meet the local Leyland Daf management on Tuesday.
The officials said they had stated their interests when they saw the
administrative receivers - Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop of
accountants Arthur Andersen.
Yesterday the two receivers met their Dutch counterparts at DAF's Eindhoven
headquarters and 'agreed to co-operate together to meet their mutual supply
requirements'.
In a statement afterwards Mr Talbot added that meanwhile 'steps have been
taken to ensure that production is continuing at all the UK sites'.
Mr Will Rogers, head of Birmingham council's investment services, said:
'Tremendous support locally has been gathering about the future of this
business.' He cited dealers, suppliers and organisations such as the
Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, Birmingham Heartlands Development
Corporation and the West Midlands Development Agency.
'We have to establish the facts, what the realistic options are and how we
can translate this support into action,' Mr Rogers added.
He also noted that the council had in the past supported management buy-outs
and had taken a minority interest in them. A management buy-out has already
been proposed for the Leyland Daf plant at Leyland, Lancashire.
The West Midlands Development Agency, responsible for securing inward
investment, is interested in assisting any potential overseas buyer.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Oil tanker operators endorse new code
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL TANKER operators yesterday welcomed new proposals to keep tankers
farther away from sensitive UK coastlines, but warned that freight rates
could rise and that it would be hard to find safe new shipping routes.
The oil industry has agreed with the Department of Transport to draw up a
voluntary code to ban tankers from some coastal waters including the Fair
Isle Strait near the Shetland Islands, where the tanker Braer was wrecked
last month.
Also covered are the Scilly Isles, the Minches between Scotland's west coast
and the Outer Hebrides, and the Pentland Firth between Scotland and Orkney.
The new routes will be endorsed in May.
One oil industry representative who attended this week's meeting with the
department said 'there was not a lot of resistance to the proposals  - the
industry would rather do this on a voluntary basis than have regulation
slapped on it'.
Waters up to 500m around the wreck of the Braer were declared a prohibited
area yesterday.
The department made an order under the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973
designating the remains of the ship a dangerous wreck.

FT  06 FEB 93 / US duties on British steel plate attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US ACTION to impose heavy anti-dumping duties on British exports of steel
plate was 'unwarranted and wholly disproportionate,' Mr Richard Needham,
trade minister, said yesterday.
He said the provisional 109.22 per cent levy was in addition to the earlier
duties imposed on UK exports of plate and bar.
Mr Needham told the Commons: 'To penalise genuinely privatised companies
which have not received subsidies for over six years is unfair and
economically unsound.'
He said the action had been initiated by the 'highly protected US steel
industry' and would not help efforts to secure an international settlement
in the multi-lateral steel agreement negotiations.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Teachers to ballot on test boycott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEACHERS in England and Wales yesterday neared outright conflict with the
government over controversial national curriculum tests.
The executive of the NASUWT, the second largest teachers' union, voted to
ballot its 127,000 members on a boycott of all tests this year. The tests
are due to be sat by seven and 14 year olds in state schools from April.
The union will seek next Tuesday the support of the other five teachers'
unions. All have expressed serious reservations about this year's tests for
14 year olds, which are to be compulsory for the first time.
The tests in English, set to take place in June, have caused particular
controversy. The last of the prescribed texts have only recently been
received by schools, and sample questions have still to reach many teachers.
Teachers say this has left insufficient time to prepare pupils.
There is also widespread opposition to the publication of test results,
which may lead to school league tables like those issued by the government
for this year's tests for seven year olds.
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, NASUWT general secretary, said: 'Teachers know their
pupils are being used by the government. They know that the tests have not
been properly piloted, that set texts have been announced piecemeal after
the year has begun and spending decisions have been made.'
Of the other unions, the National Union of Teachers, the largest, is most
likely to join the NASUWT in pressing for a boycott.
An NUT survey of teachers involved in the English tests, released earlier
this week, showed nine out 10 respondents in favour of a boycott.
Baroness Blatch, schools minister, described claims that the tests had not
been properly prepared as 'ridiculous', and pointed to pilots 'involving
hundreds of schools and thousands of pupils' over the past 2 1/2 years.
Mr de Gruchy said the boycott would 'definitely go ahead' if he secured a
'clear-cut majority'. It would probably start in April but possible courses
of government action are unclear - particularly when education authorities,
headteachers and governors are all sympathetic.
Despite threatened boycotts, the introduction of tests for seven year olds
in 1991 proceeded without disruption.
Mr de Gruchy said his union was not opposed to 'sensible testing and
assessment', and hoped Mr John Patten, education secretary, would think
again and 'engage in genuine consultation' over the tests.
A GROUP of headteachers has set up the National Co-ordinating Committee on
Learning and Assessment to campaign on the issue of pupil testing in England
and Wales, Bethan Hutton writes.
Mr David Martin, headmaster of Chenderit School in Middleton Cheney,
Northamptonshire, organised the committee after headteachers in the county
recommended that schools should not proceed with testing, and received
approaches from other areas where similar decisions had been taken.
'It is a groundswell,' he said, adding that members were united by the
strength of their feelings on the subject, not by any union affiliation.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Patchy recovery for steel industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE recession-hit world steel industry can expect to see slow and patchy
recovery, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
forecast yesterday.
Overall output and consumption should rise slightly this year, reversing two
years of decline, according to the OECD's steel outlook for 1993. It
forecasts a 0.5 per cent rise in OECD-wide production this year, a
significant turnround from a 3 per cent per cent fall in 1992. It forsees an
even sharper improvement in consumption to 1.5 per cent from a 3.4 per cent
fall in 1992. Capacity was almost unchanged last year but will fall in 1993
thanks to cuts by several European steel makers.
The OECD thinks demand might rise sharply in the North American motor
industry, thanks to the upturn in consumer spending in the region, and in
construction in the US, Australia and Japan, helped by a rise in public
infrastructure spending there. Demand for consumer durables and domestic
appliances should also rise, especially in the US. Housing starts should
rise in North America, Australia and Japan.
By contrast, the OECD predicts that European Community steel demand will
fall by 2.5 per cent because of the low growth expected in the EC.
Stocks have been run down over the past year and US anti-dumping duties will
be a factor in curbing European steel production. This, plus the recovery in
US domestic steel demand should depress EC steel trade with the US by 3.5
per cent this year, says the report.
Japanese steel demand should also fall slightly, mainly due to falling sales
to manufacturing industry.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Battle to sell fighters to Malaysia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
By Kieran Cooke
in Kuala Lumpur
LEADING US executives are making a last ditch effort to persuade Malaysia to
buy US fighter aircraft.
McDonnell Douglas, led by Mr John McDonnell, the company's chief,is in Kuala
Lumpur trying to persuade Malaysia to buy F/A-18 multi-role fighters while
General Dynamics is trying to sell its F-16 fighters.
Executives from Northrop as well as officials from the Pentagon and US air
force were also involved in discussions with the Malaysian defence ministry
and air force.
The other contender for sales of up to Dollars 850m is the Commonwealth of
Independent States' Mig-29. The purchase of up to 30 Migs may be imminent.
This week Malaysia signed a memorandum of understanding with India on
defence co-operation. India has been using Migs for several years and has
offered Malaysia maintenance and training support.
US officials here insist that the Mig is inferior to both US made fighters.
But the CIS is believed to be willing to sell up to date avionics with its
fighters, whereas the US is not.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Rise and rise of Japan's trade surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S current account surplus rose 61 per cent last year to a record
Dollars 117bn (Pounds 77.4bn) prompting the government to suggest it may
further stimulate the economy in an attempt to increase demand for imports
and cut the highly sensitive trade surplus.
Tokyo fears the trade surplus, up 28 per cent to Dollars 132bn, will draw
criticism from the new US administration, which has indicated a tougher
approach to the trade deficit with Japan.
Exports rose 7.9 per cent and imports fell 2.6 per cent over the year, as
domestic demand fell with the slowing of the economy. The finance ministry
blamed the increase in exports on a stronger yen, but the figure also
reflected a shift to higher value-added exports and the sustained
international demand for Japanese quality.
For the month of December, the current account surplus was 10.4 per cent
higher at Dollars 11.45bn, a record for the month and the 21st consecutive
month of year-on-year increases. The trade surplus for the month rose 3.6
per cent to Dollars 13.08bn.
Balance of payments figures for the year showed that foreigners' net
purchases of Japanese stocks were Dollars 8.5bn, compared to Dollars 45.2bn
in the previous year, suggesting that international investors have yet to
regain confidence in the Tokyo stock market.
However, Japanese investors were net sellers of Dollars 3bn in foreign
stocks, against net purchases of Dollars 3.6bn in 1991. The turnaround
highlights the retreat of Japanese money from international equity markets,
though Japanese net purchases of foreign bonds were Dollars 35.6bn, down
from Dollars 68.2bn in the previous year.
The long-term capital account showed a deficit of Dollars 28.07bn for the
year, compared to a surplus of Dollars 37.06bn in 1991, while the overall
balance of payments had a surplus of Dollars 71.60bn, declining from the
Dollars 76.37bn recorded in the previous year.
Mr Mamoru Ozaki, the vice finance minister, said Japan did not deserve
criticism from trading partners because 'we are not flooding other countries
with exports' and destabilising the world economy. He said the reduction in
the official discount rate from 3.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent on Thursday
should rekindle economic growth.
But ministry officials admitted that the surplus will remain large for at
least this year, as a recovery in the economy is unlikely before the second
half.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICAN authorities have ruled that there were no irregularities in the
awarding of a Dollars 21m (Pounds 13.9m) air traffic control system to
Thomson of France and Alenia of Italy.
The awarding of the contract infuriated US and Canadian multinationals,
Raytheon Canada, IBM International Air Traffic, and Calmaquip (acting for
Westinghouse).
They believed that their original offers had been disqualified
unjustifiably, and that Thomson's technology was not in operation elsewhere,
and thus did not comply with the specifications in the second tender.
But Mexico's General Comptroller of the Federation has still to release the
report by the Canadian company Martin Marietta on the evaluation of the
contract, which is being demanded by the US and Canadian companies. They
consider the report necessary to assess the Comptroller's ruling.
The Comptroller briefed diplomats on where the bidding companies were not
compliant with the specifications on the first tender, and said that it was
not necessary that a winning bidder have its technology fully operational
elsewhere.
Mexico's ministry of transport and communication said it would seek damages
against IBM over allegations by its agent, Dr Kaveh Moussavi, that he was
asked to pay a Dollars 1m bribe to secure the contract. IBM Mexico
dissassociated itself on television news from Dr Moussavi's claims.
Dr Moussavi says he informed IBM in the US of the incident on November 9 -
ten days before the first tender offer was cancelled - and that an internal
record exists of his report.

FT  06 FEB 93 / BNL HQ 'knew of Iraq scandal'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIX separate intelligence reports that were widely distributed inside the
Bush administration suggested that the Rome headquarters of the Banca
Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) knew of billions of dollars of militarily-useful
loans made to Iraq by BNL's Atlanta branch, according to a Senate report
published yesterday.
The 160-page study by the Senate Intelligence Committee says that among the
CIA reports - issued between August 1989 and February 1991 - one concluded
that 'managers at BNL headquarters in Rome were involved in the scandal'.
The Senate report also reveals that none of the relevant CIA information was
provided to Department of Justice officials involved in the BNL case, nor to
the local prosecutors in Atlanta.
The prosecution of Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former BNL Atlanta manager,
is based on the premise that Rome was the victim of the scandal and that no
one in BNL Rome had any knowledge of Dollars 5bn of clandestine Iraqi loans
from Atlanta. A new BNL trial is expected next autumn.
The Senate committee blames the failure on 'breakdowns in the relationship
between intelligence agencies and law enforcement, combined with serious
errors of judgment by government officials.' It says this resulted in a
'highly misleading' statement by the CIA last year about its information on
the BNL case.
Senator Howard Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat who is a senior member of the
Senate Intelligence Committee, said a special prosecutor was still needed to
investigate the BNL loans scandal, which has been dubbed 'Iraqgate' in the
US media. Mr Metzenbaum criticised the report as 'too narrow' because it was
confined to what the CIA did with intelligence information.
The report, which makes recommendations on how to improve the use of
intelligence information in law enforcement cases, also discloses that the
CIA became aware in December 1987 that Matrix-Churchill, the UK machine
tools company then owned by Iraqi interests, was acting as an Iraqi front
company. It was not until September 1989 that the CIA obtained information
linking BNL-Atlanta to the Iraqi procurement network and reported it, the
report says.

</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE, Ireland and Sweden yesterday took advantage of Thursday's German
interest rate cuts to ease their own cost of borrowing.
The Bank of France yesterday made a slight reduction in its overnight
lending facility, to try to alleviate the financial pressure on the French
banks and defuse the threat of a rise in base rates.
The cut in the overnight rate - from 11.9375 per cent to 11.625 per cent -
was the second in French short-term rates in a week.
It was part of the central bank's efforts to cut the borrowing costs of the
commercial banks, hit hard by the discrepancy between market rates and their
own base rates.
Despite yesterday's cut in overnight rates, economists are sceptical about
the chances of a significant reduction in French official interest rates
until German rates have come down further and the Bank of France has had
time to replenish its reserves, run down last month during its battle to
protect the franc.
Tensions in the Dublin financial markets also eased yesterday as Ireland's
Central Bank restored its short-term lending facility of 13.75 per cent,
cutting its minimum lending rate by a quarter of a point.
The STF is the peg by which the banks and building societies fix their
commercial lending and mortgage rates. It was replaced last November by an
overnight advance facility, used by the bank as its main weapon to defend
the punt against speculative attacks during the currency crisis.
Its restoration is a signal that liquidity and stability are returning to
the market. The key one-month rate on the interbank market was down to 14
per cent yesterday, which building societies have said is the level needed
to avoid mortgage rate increases.
In Stockholm the Swedish Riksbank, the country's central bank, lowered its
key marginal overnight lending rate to 9.75 per cent from 10.5 per cent,
with effect from February 9. The marginal interest rate has now fallen by
2.75 percentage points since Sweden floated the krona in November.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Clinton sees end to gridlock: But the president's first law
was an easy one
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton signed his first act of Congress into law yesterday,
in a ceremony that he and his supporters said signalled an end to the
gridlock that has pitted a Republican White House against a Democratic
Congress for the past 12 years.
'Today marks the end of gridlock and a new beginning,' said Vice-President
Al Gore at a signing ceremony in the White House Rose Garden.
The Family Leave Act, which will require companies with more than 50
employees to allow workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for the birth of a
child or to take care of a sick relative, was twice vetoed by President
George Bush.
Washington gridlock, however, may prove harder to kill. The act was
relatively uncontroversial, supported by a quarter of the Republicans in
Congress; its real impact on business is expected to be slight, as most
people work for companies which are either too small to be covered by the
law or already offer similar leave.
'This one was a very easy one. It's going to get a lot tougher when we get
into health care and budget matters,' said Sen Christopher Bond of Missouri,
a leading Republican supporter of the family leave bill.
Mr Clinton and his wife Hillary, whom he has put in charge of the
administration's healthcare reform project, have spent the past two weeks
massaging Congress in a way that some observers say recalls President Lyndon
Johnson.
The passage of the Family Leave Act shows that the new administration may be
able to win Republican support for some of its agenda - despite efforts by
some Republicans to booby-trap the bill by linking it to Mr Clinton's
controversial efforts to end the ban on homosexuals in the armed services.
Under the Senate's procedural rules, which are very protective of the rights
of the minority, the 41 Republican senators ought to be able to block any
bill they object to. In practice, however, there are few issues on which
they will vote as a party.
Democrats, however, are no more likely to respect the party whip, and some
of Mr Clinton's toughest opposition may come from the conservatives in his
own party, such as Senator Sam Nunn. Mr Nunn has already made Mr Clinton
dilute his position on admitting homosexuals into the armed forces, and may
withhold support from his economic plans if they do not include a convincing
assault on the budget deficit.

FT  06 FEB 93 / US still doubtful on Bosnia peace plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton said yesterday he remains reluctant to back the
Bosnian peace proposals of Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, but asked for more
time to formulate a new US policy for the war-torn region.
'The United States at the present time is reluctant to impose an agreement
on the parties to which they do not agree, especially when the Bosnian
Moslems might be left at a severe disadvantage if the agreement is not
undertaken in good faith by the other parties and cannot be enforced
externally,' Mr Clinton said in Washington yesterday.
The new president and his foreign policy advisers promised to make Bosnia
their highest priority when they took office two weeks ago, but they have
since found it difficult to formulate a policy that lives up to Mr Clinton's
promises to take a tougher line against Serbian aggression in Bosnia.
US officials believe the Bosnian Moslem government will never accept the
Vance-Owen plan, which would divide Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous
provinces. Critics of the Clinton position say the main reason they will not
do so is because the US has led them to hope it will obtain a better deal
for them.
Mr Brian Mulroney, the Canadian prime minister, suggested to Mr Clinton at
the White House yesterday that the US could usefully back the 'hard and
constructive work' of Mr Vance and Lord Owen while adding substantial
improvements in the areas of human rights and war crimes.
Also in Washington, Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, added his
voice to those suggesting to the US that the Vance-Owen plan, while not
perfect, was 'the last chance we have of bringing about a solution by
peaceful means'.
Reuter adds: Fighting between Serbs, Moslems and Croats raged across Bosnia
yesterday before 11th-hour peace talks were due to open at the United
Nations.
AP adds: German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said yesterday he favours lifting a
UN weapons embargo on Bosnia-Hercegovina.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Money market reform is welcomed by banks
</HEADLINE>

THE long-awaited cut in interest rates which the Bundesbank delivered on
Thursday was less important than the accompanying measures to cut reserve
requirements and introduce new short-term money-market instruments, a
leading member of the German central bank's policy-making council said
yesterday.
Playing down the significance of the 0.5 percentage-point cut in the Lombard
rate and the 0.25 percentage cut in the discount rate to 9 and 8 per cent
respectively, Mr Johann Gaddum said relaxation of minimum reserves and the
restructuring of the money market would have profound consequences for the
German financial industry.
Mr Gaddum said the measures would help the competitive position of the
German banking community. It has long complained about the reserve
requirement which meant that for for every DM100 (Pounds 41.60) taken as a
customer deposit, between DM4.15 and DM12 had to be lodged interest-free
with the Bundesbank.
Under the new measures the Bundesbank has cut reserve requirements on time
deposits and savings deposits from an average of 4.5 per cent to 2 per cent.
Luxembourg, Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands have no reserve
requirements. They are just 1 per cent in France on most types of deposits
and 0.35 per cent in the UK.
Mr Hermann Remsperger, chief economist at the BHF-Bank in Frankfurt, said
the relaxation of reserve requirements was a 'tremendous' measure of support
for the German financial services industry. He said that upwards of DM200bn
(Pounds 83.3bn) in the European money markets could in future be deposited
in the German banking system.
Mr Hans-Georg Engel, vice-president of JP Morgan in Germany and president of
the Association of Foreign Banks in Germany, said the move was 'an enormous
step'.
Shares in German banks rose strongly yesterday, helping to send the DAX
index of 30 leading shares up 39.76 points to its year's high of 1,641.37,
up 2.5 per cent. Deutsche Bank shares rose 5 per cent, Commerzbank's 4.5 per
cent and Dresdner Bank's 5.7 per cent.
This in part reflected the interest rate cut. But investors were also
encouraged by the belief that the reserve relaxation could be a substantial
tonic to banks' profits.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Bundesbank hails German pay deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank yesterday welcomed the 3 per cent public sector pay deal
between the government and unions as a step in the right direction.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank vice president, said many Germans still had to
adjust to the changed economic situation since German unification. 'It is
indisputable that our country is now living beyond its means,' he said.
The deal was struck hours after the Bundesbank announced a surprise cut in
interest rates in an attempt to ease pressures on the economy and tensions
in the European exchange rate mechanism.
'It is even better news for the economy than the Bundesbank decision,' said
Mr Dieter Vogel, government spokesman.
But further evidence of the depth of the recession came with a sharp rise in
unemployment in both east and west. Joblessness rose by 10 per cent across
the country, up 232,200 in the west to 2.258m, and up 93,600 in the east to
1.194m - or almost 3.5m unemployed in the united economy.
The unemployment rate now stands at 7.4 per cent in the west, from 6.1 per
cent a year ago, and 14.7 per cent in the east - without including about
1.8m more workers in the east on job creation and retraining programmes.
The pay deal, struck late on Thursday night between the major public sector
unions and the government, will affect 2.3m workers. It will be backdated to
January 1 and is in line with the more optimistic expectations of economic
observers. It could save a further DM3.7bn (Pounds 1.5bn) from public
spending at all levels in 1993, according to the Finance Ministry.
In a television interview last night, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he
expected the next pay negotiations for 1.85m white-collar civil servants to
be settled at 'well under 3 per cent'.
At the cabinet meeting, summoned to consider the gloomy annual economic
report, which forecasts a decline in gross domestic product of up to 1 per
cent, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, warned against
excessive pessimism. He said the economy was facing a 'cyclical downturn
after 10 years of steady growth'. As for the public sector pay deal, he said
it was the 'beginning of a change for the better' in pay policy.
In a separate speech, Mr Tietmeyer dismissed criticism that the Bundesbank
move was either too premature - coming before any agreement in the
government's promised solidarity pact - or too little, too late.
Stressing the bank's moves not simply to cut its discount rate by 0.25
percentage points, and the Lombard rate by 0.5 points, but also to relax its
minimum reserve requirements, he said the decisions were a reaction to 'the
changed internal and world-wide economic conditions, without endangering our
stabilisation course. . . This was a necessary decision which neither
changes nor endangers the fundamental policy of (monetary) stability.'
Mr Tietmeyer gave firm support to the government's proposed savings package,
while stressing that changes could be made, if they did not reduce the total
volume of savings in the programme. It is intended to reduce public-sector
spending by some DM20bn a year by 1995.
'Monetary policy cannot indefinitely compensate for the necessary adjustment
in the public sector, without causing great damage both to our economy and
to our partners in the European Monetary System,' he warned.

FT  06 FEB 93 / BMW develops small city car for urban commuting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BMW has developed a small city car for urban commuting (pictured left),
which could go into production in the second half of the 1990s in a radical
departure from its traditional product policy, writes Kevin Done.
The German producer of high-performance executive and luxury cars plans to
unveil a concept city car, code-named Z13, at the Geneva motor show next
month, upstaging its arch domestic rival Mercedes-Benz, which last week said
it planned to develop such a car for the late 1990s.
The BMW city car has been designed and developed for a 'single' driver
travelling alone in city traffic. The driver would sit in the middle of the
car with a central steering wheel, but with two full-sized seats for
possible passengers seated half behind the driver in a clover-leaf
formation.
The planned city car is powered by a 1.1-litre BMW motorcycle engine mounted
at the rear with a continuously variable automatic transmission.
At just over 11 ft it would be smaller than current small cars, such as the
Ford Fiesta or the Renault Clio, but would have a top speed of 112 mph and
fuel consumption of 47-56 miles per gallon.
The car would have an aluminium frame and aluminium panels, and despite its
small size BMW said it could include an airbag, air-conditioning, a mobile
telephone, a computer controlled navigation system and a mobile fax machine.
The Z13 is a further sign that the German luxury car-makers are urgently
seeking to move into new segments of the world car market.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Milken judge set for top job in Justice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is reported to have selected Judge Kimba Wood to be
attorney general, subject to final checks by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation to make sure she does not create the same kind of problems
that forced his first choice for the position, Ms Zoe Baird, to withdraw.
Ms Wood, a 49 year old anti-trust lawyer who has been a federal district
judge in New York since 1988, is best known for presiding over the trial of
Mr Michael Milken, Drexel Burnham Lambert's junk bond specialist, for
securities fraud.
Before becoming a judge, she represented the Lloyd's insurance market as an
attorney for the New York firm of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby and MacRae.
Some more senior candidates for the position of attorney general, such as
Judge Patricia Wald of the federal appeals court in Washington, have
declined to make the move from the bench to the Justice Department.
Officials said Mr Clinton would not announce Ms Wood's nomination until FBI
background checks had been completed. The process is being conducted
carefully to ensure that no flaws, such as Ms Baird's admission that she had
hired an illegal alien as a nanny, emerge during her confirmation hearings.
Although a White House spokesman said the president was angered by leaks of
the candidates for the position, other officials indicated that Ms Wood's
name, along with those of Mr Charles Ruff, a Washington lawyer, and Mr
Gerald Baliles, a former governor of Virginia, was being widely circulated
to test for reactions.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD KING leaves his last British Airways board meeting to dismiss
suggestions he stepped down early as chairman because of the airline's
involvement in a 'dirty tricks' campaign against Virgin Atlantic.
Lord King, who is 75 and was yesterday elected BA president for an initial
three-year term, told waiting journalists: 'I have not resigned. If you want
to make what is a very happy and proper occasion for our board into
something different, go ahead.'
He said running BA had been the 'crowning achievement' of his working life
but that he was going in order to end uncertainty and speculation over BA's
future leadership. He said BA had 'a great team, a united and strong board.
We've got a proud company'.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Welfare state to face scrutiny in spending review: Ministers
will be able to float radical ideas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S planned review of public spending priorities will look at
all principles of the welfare state - however politically sacred - Whitehall
officials said yesterday.
Mr Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief secretary, is expected to launch
soon, probably next week, the most fundamental re-assessment of spending in
areas such as state benefits, health and housing since the early 1980s.
Ministers will be able to float radical ideas - such as the proposal gaining
attention in Westminster for 'contracting out' unemployment benefit for many
workers to private insurance.
Conservative manifesto commitments on preserving universal child benefit and
the basic state pension could also be re-thought by the next election.
Pledges will be honoured until then, however.
'It is an exercise in good house-keeping, asking awkward questions and
looking for value for money,' said one Treasury aide. 'The unthinkable can
be thought - but that doesn't mean you are going to do anything about it.'
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, last night warned that the Tories were
in danger of provoking 'a wave of anger' throughout the country if promises
made in 1992 'become the betrayals of 1993'.
Mr Portillo will hope that the announcement will help restore the confidence
of financial markets in government economic policy.
Public sector borrowing is widely forecast to reach Pounds 50bn in the next
financial year and rise even higher in subsequent years, severely curbing
the scope for tax cuts and perhaps forcing tax increases.
Eventually the review, expected to last the life of the current parliament,
will cover all Whitehall departments but Mr Portillo will focus initially on
the biggest spenders in a series of bilateral meetings with ministerial
colleagues.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, has said he is prepared to
listen to all ideas - although his department is at present preoccupied with
legislation to equalise male and female retirement ages and on pension
regulation.
The social security budget has grown by a quarter in real terms over the
past eight years. Contributory benefits, such as unemployment benefit, are
likely areas for study, along with fast-growing or expensive benefits such
as disability payments and child benefit.
Unlike the last review under Sir Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe, the former
chancellor, after the 1979 general election, there will be no target in
terms of expenditure cuts but the aim will be to keep downward pressure on
public spending. The Treasury believes many areas of government spending
have been largely ignored over the past decade.
Last year Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, ended the system of negotiating
public spending bilaterally with departments in favour of a system in which
a 'control total' is agreed by cabinet in advance - and then spending plans
trimmed to fit. The review is a logical development of that process, the
Treasury believes.
Since the Conservatives came to power in 1979, health spending in real terms
has risen 56 per cent, transport spending by 28 per cent, law and order by
96 per cent and education by 25.5 per cent.
Spending on housing has fallen in real terms but, at Pounds 6bn, is still
one of the larger budgets.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Heseltine laments oversupply of accountants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Heseltine last night took a swipe at the priority Britain gives
to accountants and lawyers - rather than encouraging craftsmen or
technicians in the wealth-creating manufacturing industry.
'There is more to life than financial accounts,' the trade and industry
secretary told the Scottish branch of the Institute of Directors in
Edinburgh.
Wealth creation meant encouraging engineers and scientists as well as
entrepreneurs, he said. 'I wonder, however, whether the UK economy has got
the balance right, between the teeth and tail of wealth creation. And among
those offering support services I would include, for example, accountants
and lawyers.'
The comments from Mr Heseltine, who failed his final accountancy exams,
prompted a response of weary indignation from Britain's bean counters, who
have long been reputed to be boring and unimaginative.
He said: 'In the UK we train only one third the number of craftsmen and
technicians as in France and one quarter of those in Germany. And German
industry is now worried that it cannot attract enough trainees.'
His speech marked the increasing emphasis being put by Whitehall, including
by Mr John Major, on a revival in manufacturing - a stark contrast to the
focus on services under Mrs Margaret (now Baroness) Thatcher, the former
prime minister.
He described manufacturing as offering 'a key to our future success' and to
international competitiveness. The bulk of world trade was in manufactured
goods. Financiers needed to understand businesses and 'to look for rewards
in the future, rather than the day after their investment'.
Accountants were not unnecessary, 'but in the UK the classic route to the
top has been via the City, parliament, and above all accountancy. The
result? One study in the mid-1980s suggested Britain had over 120,000
qualified accountants - 20 times more per head of population than Germany or
Japan.
'Valuable though the services of lawyers and accountants can be, they cannot
survive in a vacuum,' he said. 'They need clients; clients that are
successful.'
In fact, Mr Heseltine's number-crunching abilities fell short yesterday.
There are more than 200,000 accountants registered with the five principal
professional bodies in the UK and Ireland alone.
'So speaks a failed accountant,' said Mr Ian Brindle, senior partner of
Price Waterhouse, one of the UK's largest accountancy firms, referring to
the fact that the trade and industry secretary did not qualify in the 1950s.
Mr Andrew Colquhoun, secretary and chief executive of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, who spoke cautiously as the
institute reports to the DTI on regulatory matters, said comparisons with
other countries were difficult. He said accountants controlled many highly
successful companies such as BTR, Glaxo and Grand Metropolitan.

FT  06 FEB 93 / Assorted jets for sale in Ukraine's arms bazaar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KHARKOV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR EVGENI BLINKOV sits at his desk crowded with western-made computers, fax
machines and telephones, negotiating with three buyers.
He is offering for sale what brokers believe is the most extensive array of
Soviet-made military hardware to be sold by private dealers.
Mr Blinkov is director of the Ukrainian-Siberian Commodities Exchange which
used to sell commodities such as oil and grain. These days, the exchange has
fallen on hard times, which is why it has had to turn to less conventional
merchandise.
One buyer is from the Americas, another from Europe and there is a mystery
purchaser from within the former Soviet Union (but ostensibly representing
foreign interests).
Yesterday Mr Blinkov's list of wares included new Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jets
(one careful owner) offered for a mere Dollars 31m (Pounds 20.5m) each or,
for the budget-conscious, the more modest Su-25 model at Dollars 11.9m.
Twenty-seven older Mig-27s are also available for Dollars 16m apiece. For
naval powers, there are two new diesel-powered submarines, going for between
Dollars 130m and Dollars 150m each. Buyers interested in shooting down
aircraft can purchase a Zenith anti-aircraft system for Dollars 65m.
'If this sale is successful, then I think we can expect to receive further
offers,' Mr Blinkov said. 'There are 15 former Soviet republics and all of
them have weapons.' He said that an agent from the Baltic republics had
already contacted the exchange with a request to arrange another arms sale.
'For us, the more buyers, the better,' Mr Blinkov said. 'I think we will be
able to sell all of the weapons.'
The only conditions of sale are that the weapons should be sold outside the
Commonwealth of Independent States, that the buyer be licensed within his
own country to deal in arms and that the buyer present proof of his ability
to pay.
However, Mr Blinkov admits: 'I, of course, do not care who the buyers
actually represent.'
'This is enough to arm an entire nation,' a promotional leaflet cheerfully
proclaims about the hardware on offer. Officials at the exchange say more
than Dollars 2bn worth of weapons are up for sale.
The arms sale in Kharkov, which will accept bids until the end of the month
and has already conducted two smaller arms trades, is just one sign of the
growing availability of sophisticated Soviet military hardware to private
buyers.
A few smaller-scale arms sales have been held in the past few months in
Moscow. Western diplomats say they are even more concerned about murky arms
deals in the central Asian republics, which are suspected of providing
weapons to Iran.
But who supplies the weapons to the Ukrainian-Siberian Exchange? Mr Blinkov
says the weapons are being supplied by a private Russian source, which
claims to have the ability to manufacture arms to order as well as providing
older weapons.
According to specifications supplied by the seller, the weapons can be
delivered at various ports in Russia and the Baltics and at an airport in
the European region of the former Soviet Union.
The sole role of the exchange is to act as intermediary between buyers and
the seller, who will sign the final arms contract.
Why, then, choose the Ukrainian-Siberian exchange as a middleman which will
take a commission of up to 2 per cent?
'I think that they wanted the transaction to occur at some distance from
Moscow,' Mr Blinkov said. Because the seller claims the capacity to produce
weapons, he is convinced that 'this is the state acting under cover of
private business'.

FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Montedison close to stake sale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MONTEDISON, the lossmaking Italian chemicals and agro-industrial group
controlled by Ferruzzi, yesterday confirmed it was in the final phase of
talks to sell an important stake in its profitable Erbamont pharmaceuticals
subsidiary.
The likely buyer is Procordia, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, which was
rumoured to have been in talks on buying a stake last year.
Montedison gave no indication of the size of the stake for sale or the
potential price. However, analysts believe the group, which is struggling to
reduce its large debts by disposing of non-core activities, will give up
majority control.
Montedison said the aim was to create one of Europe's biggest
pharmaceuticals companies. Erbamont controls Farmitalia Carlo Erba, the
leading Italian producer of prescription drugs.
The group, which had sales of about L1,600bn (Dollars 1.1bn) and operating
profits of about L250bn last year, is active in the US through its Adria
Laboritories subsidiary.
Procordia's pharmaceuticals activities are conducted through its
Kabi-Pharmacia arm. The operation, which specialises in drugs for growth
problems, eye surgery and patient feeding problems, has annual sales of
about L2,600bn. Erbamont controls Antibioticos, a smaller bulk
pharmaceuticals business, with turnover of about L175bn, which is not
expected to be included in the transaction.
In spite of its profitable agro-industrial and energy businesses, Montedison
plunged into loss in the first half of last year as a result of the downturn
in the world chemicals business and heavy interest payments on its debts.
Apart from the sale proceeds, divesting a majority stake in Erbamont would
allow the group to take about L1,000bn in Erbamont debt off its balance
sheet.

SGS-THOMSON, the Franco-Italian state-owned semiconductor group, yesterday
revealed that it swung into a Dollars 3m net profit last year from a Dollars
102.6m loss in 1991, and forecast a substantial improvement in 1993.
Mr Pasquale Pistorio, group president, said the group, the world's
13th-largest chip maker, had increased its share of the global semiconductor
market slightly to 2.7 per cent from 2.5 per cent in 1991. The company,
which is in its fifth year, said it needed to nearly double that to ensure
long-term survival.
The world semiconductor market will nearly triple in size to Dollars 170bn
from Dollars 60bn over this period, the group estimated. That implied that
SGS-Thomson's sales needed to increase more than five-fold to Dollars 8.5bn
over the next seven years from last year's Dollars 1.6bn. Group sales rose
by 12 per cent last year, two points ahead of the market.

<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM headed by Thyssen and Veba, the German industrial groups, and
including BellSouth of the US and Vodafone of Britain, was yesterday awarded
the licence to develop and operate a new cellular telephone network in
Germany.
The new E1-network is described as the world's biggest digital cellular
network.
Total direct investment in it is estimated at DM4.8bn (Pounds 2bn), and
investments by suppliers may be worth a further DM3bn.
The network is expected to generate 8,000 jobs in Germany, of which 3,500
would be in the east, Mr Wolfgang Botsch, the newly-appointed minister of
posts and telecommunications, said yesterday.
The network will cater for 3m subscribers by the end of the decade, and
begin operations initially in eastern Germany, based in Berlin and Leipzig,
by the end of the year.
Mr Botsch said the group had won by a clear margin from the only other
competitor, the E-Star consortium headed by BMW, the Bavarian motor
manufacturer, and MAN, the engineering group.
The new system will be the third cellular telephone network to be developed
in Germany, and will compete directly with the C and D1 network operated by
Deutsche Telekom, and the D2 system operated by Mannesmann, respectively.
The key difference is that the new network will operate at 1800 megahertz,
instead of the traditional but overcrowded 900 megahertz used by the
existing systems. Germany will be only the second country, after Britain, to
use the higher frequency.
The consortium comprises Thyssen and Veba with a 28 per cent share each,
BellSouth, based in Atlanta, Georgia, has 21 per cent, and Vodafone, the
largest cellular telephone operator in Britain, has 16 per cent. Other
partners include several east German enterprises, among them Minol, the
petrol refining and distribution chain taken over by Elf and Thyssen, and
the French banking group Caisse des Depots et Consignation. The latter is
expected to help promote a European network based on the DCS 1800 standard.
Thyssen said the system would be built up initially in east Germany,
covering 88 per cent of that area by 1995, and 77 per cent of the west.
Vodafone said it hoped to be making an operating profit within four years.
One of the main requirements for the system was to put the initial emphasis
in east Germany where telephone density is only 20 per 100 inhabitants,
compared with 50 per 100 in the west.

A CONSORTIUM headed by Thyssen and Veba, the German industrial groups, and
including BellSouth of the US, and Vodafone of Britain, was yesterday
awarded the licence to develop and operate a new cellular telephone network
in Germany.
The new E1-network in Germany is described in the industry as the biggest

Total direct investment in the network is estimated at DM4.8bn (Pounds 2bn),
and further indirect investments by suppliers may be worth a further DM3bn.

The Thyssen-Veba consortium was an unsuccessful bidder to develop and
operate the D2 network, and there was a delighted reaction at the
consortium's Dusseldorf headquarters.
Thyssen and Veba have 28 per cent shares each, BellSouth, based in Atlanta,
Georgia, has 21 per cent, and Vodafone, the largest cellular telephone
operator in Britain, has 16 per cent. Other partners include several east

in east Germany where telephone density is only 20 per 100 inhabitants,
compared with 50 per 100 in the west.
The German cellular telephone market is seen as the European market with the
greatest untapped potential. Only 1 per cent of the population uses cellular
telephones whereas in Sweden, for example, market penetration is 8 per cent.

MARRIOTT the US hotel and food services group which has faced bondholder
anger over a plan to split its management operations and property assets
into two separately-quoted entities, yesterday reported static profits for
1992.
The company earned Dollars 85m after tax during the 12-month period, against
Dollars 82m in 1991, after a slip to Dollars 19m from Dollars 27m in the
fourth quarter.
Revenues for the year were Dollars 8.72bn, compared with Dollars 8.33bn
while fourth-quarter sales totalled Dollars 2.78bn against Dollars 2.73bn.
The full-year and final-quarter figures for 1992 were struck after a Dollars
21m pre-tax charge covering 'transaction costs associated with the plan to
divide Marriott into two separate companies'. Comparisons were muddied by
property sales and other factors. It claimed underlying operating had
increased by 11 per cent.
On the lodging side, Marriott said the underlying operating profit advance
was 14 per cent. Occupancy rates rose in all four main segments of the
lodging business, and average room rates improved in two segments.

<TEXT>
THE Indonesian government has approved a Dollars 100m (Pounds 66m) venture
to build a toxic waste processing plant 30km outside Jakarta in West Java.
The plant, expected to be working by the end of this year, will have
capacity for 85,000 tonnes of waste a year.
The plant will be owned 70 per cent by Waste Management International of the
US and 30 per cent by Indonesia's Bimantara Citra Group, run by Mr Bambang
Trihatmodjo, President Suharto's second son.
Mr Emil Salim, environment minister, said the plant had to process domestic
waste exclusively. Officials estimate factories in West Java produced 68,000
tonnes of toxic and hazardous waste last year and say plans for a second
plant in are being considered. The plant's approval coincides with a
tightening of the government's environmental policy.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Letter: Massey case an example to Hoover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J DENNIS HENRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In October 1978, when there was a different UK government,
Massey-Ferguson announced the closure of its Kilmarnock-based combine
harvester factory, which then employed 1,509 people. The reason was, to
quote Massey's president, Mr Victor Rice: 'We had little choice but to
concentrate all combine manufacture in Europe at M-F's other plant in
France.'
As a result, this factory of almost 1m square feet was closed and all
production was transferred to Marquette. I do not recollect any resistance
from France to accepting this work at the expense of workers in the west of
Scotland.
The closure of this plant was handled most responsibly because the
management went to the unprecedented length of paying for consultants to
advise the unions on how best to make their case; so that the disagreements
would be rationally based rather than emotional.
Massey Ferguson also paid for an international search for replacement
employment; I was privileged to lead this team and we had some success. The
union leaders appreciated that it was essential for the labour force to be
seen to be responsible and so not discourage potential new employers from
the area. We had none of the flag waving processions seen on TV which tend
only to satisfy the needs of the leaders and which do nothing towards
attracting new employment.
Now that the boot is on the other foot with Hoover, cannot the French unions
and others accept the swings and roundabouts? After all, they are still well
ahead on this basis.

FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Hongkong Land has 20.1% of Trafalgar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR and SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG LAND, the Jardine Matheson-controlled property company, confirmed
yesterday that it had exercised its option to acquire 36m shares in
Trafalgar House, lifting its stake in the UK-based construction, engineering
and shipping group to 20.1 per cent.
Hongkong Land acquired a 14.9 per cent stake in Trafalgar House in October
and launched an abortive tender offer in an attempt to lift its stake to
29.9 per cent. The following month it revealed that it had entered into an
option arrangement to buy the shares.
As part of the option deal, Hongkong Land may also be obliged to buy a
further 67m shares by May 3.
In both cases, it is paying no more than the 85p per share or 82p per A
share it offered in the tender. In practice it is only likely to be forced
to buy another 67m shares if the share price falls well below 85p.
By taking its stake above 20 per cent Hongkong Land will be able to
equity-account its holding, enabling it to book a share of Trafalgar's
profits. Trafalgar's ordinary and A shares yesterday closed down 1 1/2 p at
92p and down 1p at 90p respectively.
Trafalgar has already appointed Mr Rodney Leach, a director of Hongkong
Land, to its board, but has been less enthusiastic about a request to
appoint a second director from Hongkong Land, Sir Charles Powell.
Yesterday, however, both companies emphasised their 'good relationship,' and
Mr Leach said the two companies were 'working very closely together.' He
said he felt that Trafalgar was looking at the request for extra board
representation with 'increasing sympathy.'
Meanwhile, in the market, rumours resurfaced yesterday about a possible
Trafalgar House rights issue. The company said only that a rights issue 'had
not been ruled in or out.'
Hongkong Land reversed almost a decade of consolidation last year, by
selling an office block in central Hong Kong for HKDollars 3.8bn and making
its raid on Trafalgar House. That supported the widely-held assertion that
the company wants to cash in Hong Kong assets and reinvest the proceeds in
Britain.
The company, Hong Kong's largest owner of prime office property, has formed
a consortium which has won the right to develop Hong Kong's ninth container
terminal.
It has also expressed an interest in developing a new office complex to be
built on top of the terminus for the proposed airport rail link. However,
the current political impasse between Hong Kong and China over airport
financing, has put this project on hold.
The raid on Trafalgar House is regarded as largely opportunistic, but it
does present some opportunities for synergy with the Jardine Matheson group.

FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Lasmo sells Pounds 126.5m of assets - Sale
proceeds should reduce net debt to Pounds 900m by middle of year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LASMO, the North Sea oil exploration and production company, has sold two
packages of assets for Pounds 126.5m, bringing the total for upstream
disposals over the past year to Pounds 375m.
The company said it was continuing to sell peripheral assets in a bid to
reduce its debt and cut gearing.
The disposals reduce its debt to equity ratio to about 80 per cent. Net
debt, which was Pounds 1.1bn at the year-end, should come down to Pounds
900m by the middle of this year, after the sale proceeds have come through.
The first asset package, which includes shares in 17 North Sea blocks, has
been sold to Deminex, the German oil exploration company, for Pounds 105.8m.
In addition, Lasmo has sold its interests in the producing Balmoral and
Maureen fields to Pentex Oil for Dollars 30m (Pounds 20.7m).
Lasmo has been under extreme pressure following the slump in its share price
over the past year, the drop in earnings and its high level of debt
following the acquisition of Ultramar in late 1991.
Mr Chris Greentree recently stepped down as chief executive to be succeeded
by Mr Joe Darby who is likely to adopt a more conservative approach to the
business and could cut the dividend when the annual results are announced at
the end of March.
Mr Darby said yesterday that the company had achieved favourable prices for
the assets in spite of difficult market conditions. 'We are encouraged by
our progress and shareholders can expect to see this process continue,' he
said.
Part of the sale involves half of Lasmo's share in the Pine and Birch and
South Birch fields where it remains the operator. The sale should save Lasmo
about Pounds 250m in capital expenditure on these fields over the next five
years.
'It gives us cash in hand and saves on expenditure, but we've got to make
sure we don't give up the growth profile of the company,' said Mr Norman
Davidson-Kelly, corporate development director.
NatWest Securities estimates that the sale will boost Lasmo's pre-tax
profits in 1993 by Pounds 10m to Pounds 20m to some Pounds 49m, giving
earnings of 5.4p a share.
NatWest said yesterday that the asset sale did not resolve the issue of
whether Lasmo would be able to maintain the dividend, but it did give Mr
Darby some flexibility.

The risk in yesterday's Pounds 127m assets sale by Lasmo is that it might
give the company an excuse to maintain the dividend. The company has not
only obtained a price significantly above book; the cash will also reduce
Lasmo's interest bill and cut its gearing ratio to around 75 per cent. Had
the dollar held at the level prevailing at the time of the interims, gearing
would be even lower, possibly as little as 50 per cent.
That gives Mr Joe Darby, Lasmo's chief executive, room for flexibility, but
development expenditure requirements will be high over the next couple of
years. Production from Lasmo's existing assets will not peak until the
mid-1990s. The exploration budget has already been cut. The dividend costs
over Pounds 80m after allowing for unrelieved ACT. There is not an
indefinite supply of peripheral assets which can be sold to meet the
payment.
The relaxed performance of the shares since the resignation of Mr Chris
Greentree suggests a dividend cut is already largely discounted. Indeed,
investors might be happier with a strategy aimed at securing long-term
growth out of Lasmo's undoubtedly valuable assets than with one offering
them only short-term return. BP's share price is now higher than it was last
June when Mr Bob Horton's resignation made a dividend cut inevitable. That
partly reflects the higher sterling oil price, but it also shows the market
can respond positively to the establishment of a dividend level in line with
what the balance sheet will bear.

FT  05 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Kingfisher dives in
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If the misunderstandings surrounding the mere announcement of a possible
merger between Kingfisher and Darty are anything to go by, then the
consummation of such a deal could prove a marriage made in hell. Though
Kingfisher is being coy about the details, it appears embarked on a risky
course. It could end up staking Pounds 1bn or so for a company about which
it knows little, operating in a country of which it knows nothing.
A link-up with Darty would solve the strategic conundrum of what to do with
the weakly-placed Comet. Darty is an attractive business. It is the clear
market leader in France with operating margins that must embarrass Comet. In
time, considerable operating benefits could develop.
The worry lies in the financial structuring of any deal. It seems improbable
that Kingfisher would stage a heavy rights issue to fund the merger. It is
more likely to offer staggered payments to lock in Darty's management, which
owns most of the company. Darty's desire to secure its financial position is
easy to understand. The French retail market is heading for tough times as
the economy flirts with recession. Still laden with heavy debts from its
buy-out, Darty's management may not wish to struggle through unaided. A
stock market issue would be difficult. A merger with a deep-pocketed
retailer must appear attractive.
In his 10 years at the helm, Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy has developed a
near-legendary reputation for caution. It would be extraordinary indeed if
he were to jeopardise it now when the downside risks are so glaring.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the biggest problems for companies wanting to store their documents
electronically has been the time and manpower needed to scan paper records
into the computer.
Bell &amp; Howell believes it has overcome many of these problems with a machine
that scans up to 84 pages a minute at a consistent quality.
The Copiscan II scanner uses a technique called adaptive contrast
enhancement, which analyses each document as it is fed in for colour and
dirtiness and adjusts the image accordingly. It can also scan in both sides
of a document at once. Bell &amp; Howell: UK, 0784 51234.

<TEXT>
AMAX, North America's third largest aluminium producer and a diversified
mining company, yesterday reported a 1992 loss of Dollars 148m, or Dollars
1.71 a share, excluding Dollars 137m in charges for required pension and
accounting changes.
Including all special charges, Amax's loss for the year was Dollars 284m, or
Dollars 3.27 a share. It was the company's first full-year loss since 1985.
By comparison, Amax had earings of Dollars 30.2m, or 31 cents a share, in
1991. Amax's sales for 1992 were Dollars 3.7bn, slightly below 1991 levels.
In the fourth quarter Amax posted a loss of Dollars 151m, or Dollars 1.73 a
share, compared with a loss of Dollars 10m, or 12 cents, in 1991. The 1992
fourth-quarter loss included a previously announced Dollars 115m charge for
downsizing and restructuring. Sales were Dollars 945m, up from Dollars 897m
in 1991.
Amax said its 1992 operating loss came primarily from deteriorating market
conditions. Shipments of all of its businesses except aluminium were lower
than 1991 levels, and depressed metal prices reduced revenues.
The group's aluminium unit, Alumax, which usually provides two thirds of the
company's revenue, had its first-ever operating loss as a result of Dollars
51m in start-up expenses on its new Quebec smelter.
Mr Allen Born, Amax chairman, said he did not see significant improvement in
metal prices early in 1993, although recent upturns in the US economy could
improve demand and prices for Amax commodities later in the year.

Exxon
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EXXON, the largest US energy group, said Mr Lee Raymond, the president,
would be named this spring as the new chairman, succeeding Mr Lawrence Rawl,
who will reach the mandatory retirement age of 65.
Mr Raymond, who is 54 and first joined Exxon as a production research
engineer in 1963, will in turn be succeeded as president by Mr Charles
Sitter, a senior vice-president and director of Exxon.
The retirement of Mr Rawl, to take effect on April 28, the date of Exxon's
annual shareholders' meeting, may indicate a change of style at the top of
the big US oil and gas company.
Mr Rawl is best known in the US as the Exxon leader who was harshly
criticised by the media in 1989 for his attitude to the Exxon Valdez oil
spill in Alaska, one of the worst US environmental disasters.
Mr Raymond, also a director of J. P. Morgan, the blue-chip New York bank,
has held a wide variety of positions at Exxon and is active at the Council
on Foreign Relations.
In the 1960s and 1970s, he worked at Exxon's US company and was later
responsible for Exxon's international supply and transportation of petroleum
products and crude oil and for running former Exxon affiliates in Aruba and
Venezuela.
Between 1979 and 1981, Mr Raymond was president of Exxon Nuclear Company. He
later presided over Exxon's operations in the Caribbean, central and South
America, becoming president of the Exxon group in 1987.
Mr Sitter, who is 62, is responsible for Exxon's chemical business as well
as the treasury and tax functions of the group.

FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: US eye drug link-up for Fisons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW management at Fisons, the drugs and scientific instruments group,
yesterday broke with the company's tradition of complete independence by
announcing a strategic alliance in the US.
The link-up is with Allergan, one of the leading US medical ophthalmic
companies. It allows the two companies to co-promote Acular, a non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drug which Allergan has licensed from Syntex, the
California-based group.
Fisons and Allergan have also agreed to co-operate on the relaunch of
Opticrom, a Fisons eye product which was withdrawn in the US following
concerns by the Food and Drug Administration about its quality.
Fisons said yesterday the agreement did not indicate that the product, which
had US sales of about Dollars 11m (Pounds 7.2m) before its withdrawal, was
likely to be relaunched in the near future.
Allergan will also help Fisons develop and market Fisons' nedocromil sodium
ophthalmic solution, another eye product.
The British group said it had a sales force of about 300 in the US, while
Allergan had about 160 devoted to Acular. The product has just been licensed
by the FDA and is due to be launched soon.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GILLETTE, the US toiletries and shaving products company, yesterday
announced after-tax profits of Dollars 508.6m for 1992, up from Dollars
409.4m in the previous year. The Boston-based group said that there had been
improvements in its US business, but international operations were the main
driving force.
Sales for the year rose by about 10 per cent to Dollars 5.16bn.
The full-year result came after a fourth-quarter profit of Dollars 135.3m,
up from Dollars 114.3m in the same period of 1991. Sales in the final three
months of the year rose to Dollars 1.51bn from Dollars 1.34bn.
Gillette said that sales and profits from the core blade and razor business
increased significantly. Braun products were considerably ahead.
In the stationery division, where Gillette sells under the Paper Mate and
Waterman brand names, sales were up strongly, but profits were static.
On the toiletries and cosmetics front, sales edged ahead but profits fell
sharply. Gillette said that expenses to support established brands and the
launch of a new male toiletries line at the year-end overshadowed excellent
results elsewhere in the division.

FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Jury awards Dollars 105m in
damages against GM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and ALAN FRIEDMAN

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors, the embattled automobile company, yesterday suffered a blow
to its image and finances when an Atlanta jury ruled that it must pay over
Dollars 105m in damages to the parents of a teenager who died in the fiery
crash of a GM pick-up truck.
Some Dollars 101m of the award took the form of punitive damages, levied as
punishment on the company, while Dollars 4.25m was awarded for the life of
the youth.
GM said the verdict was incorrect and it intended to appeal.
The case is part of a major controversy over the safety of certain of GM's
full-sized pick-up trucks.
Critics claim that vehicles built between 1973 and 1987 are firetraps
because the fuel tanks are side-mounted, outside the frame of the vehicle,
and are likely to catch fire in side-impact collisions.
Numerous lawsuits have been filed against GM over truck accidents and last
month Federal regulators opened an inquiry into the safety of the vehicles.
GM insists the trucks are safe, but if the regulators decide otherwise it
could mean the recall of some 4.7m trucks, at a cost to the company of
millions of dollars.
The Atlanta case, which could encourage further costly legal action against
the company, gained celebrity status when a former GM engineer, who had
previously testified on behalf of the car company, took the witness stand
and alleged that GM had known for years that the trucks were firetraps.
GM said after the verdict that it was confident the inquiry by federal
regulators would bear out its contention that its trucks were safe. It was
not surprising that 'jurors sometimes can look past the complicated
technical facts and judge large companies on an emotional level in sympathy
with the plaintiff'.
GM said it did not intend to order a recall of its pick-up trucks.
General Motors yesterday stepped up its aggressive marketing of MasterCard
credit cards by launching a gold GM MasterCard, writes Alan Friedman in New
York.
The company also said its regular GM MasterCard, launched five months ago,
had already attracted 4.5m card-holders.

FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: US groups renew attack on BA
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BEHAVIOUR of British Airways towards Mr Richard Branson's Virgin
Atlantic is being cited by the 'big three' US carriers as a reason why the
US Department of Transportation should hold a full inquiry into BA's
proposed tie-up with USAir.
The Virgin affair surfaces in the latest letter from the chief executives of
American, United and Delta Air Lines to Mr Federico Pena, the new US
transportation secretary. It resulted in British Airways settling a 'dirty
tricks' libel action last month, and paying damages to Virgin.
'Given BA's campaign last year to gain control of USAir, the timing of last
month's transaction, BA's reference to potential additional investments in
USAir of up to Dollars 450m, and BA management's recent admissions of
anti-competitive behaviour against its largest UK competitor, the Department
cannot accept BA's claim of non-control without a full and public inquiry,'
they maintain.
The missive is the latest in a war of words which followed BA's announcement
last month that it had invested Dollars 300m in USAir in return for
potential 19.9 per cent voting interest.
This new agreement between BA and USAir also allows the UK carrier to invest
a further Dollars 450m over a five-year period if foreign control provisions
permit, and is accompanied by plans for code-sharing by the two airlines,
which they are seeking to implement from May 1.
BA and USAir have argued that the code-sharing arrangement, which would lead
to some integration of their operations, is authorised by the UK-US aviation
bilateral, following a revision in 1991 which allowed American and United
into Heathrow.
However, the US carriers complained to Mr Pena that the Heathrow agreement
did not address 'the issue of code-sharing with a US carrier in which a
British carrier holds a substantial equity interest'.
'Furthermore, BA's equity stake in USAir constitutes precisely the kind of
'changed circumstances' that the UK government invoked as a basis for
extracting significant concessions as a prerequisite to permitting United's
and American's entry into Heathrow.
'Since BA's proposal will have an 'undue effect' on US air carriers, US
denial of code-sharing authority is justified within the framework of the
existing bilateral agreement.'
The DoT, which is responsible for authorising the code-sharing agreement,
has yet to decide how to proceed on the new BA-USAir tie-up.
It said last year that it would not have BA's earlier Dollars 750m
investment plan for USAir.

<TEXT>
GREECE has adopted a new position on recognising the former Yugoslav
republic of Macedonia, saying the issue of its name should be resolved
through international arbitration and Athens would abide by any decision,
Reuter reports from Athens.
Athens had maintained it would never recognise the former Yugoslav republic
under the name Macedonia, arguing it implied territorial threats against
Greece's own Macedonian region.
It blocked the republic's recognition by the European Community.
Mr Vassilis Maginas, government spokesman, describing it as 'a new position
of the government', confirmed statements to Bulgarian television on
Wednesday by Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, who said
Athens was willing to accept any decision taken through international
arbitration.
The idea of arbitration between Greece and Macedonia was first suggested by
France in January. Athens then said it was willing to discuss the proposal
but Macedonia turned it down.
Meanwhile, Mr Branko Crvenkovski, Macedonian prime minister, said that
United Nations sanctions against the rump Yugoslavia and the dispute with
Greece were raising tensions and threatening the economy of his country.
'The block by Greece and by the United Nations against Serbia and Montenegro
has cost Macedonia Dollars 1.5bn,' Mr Crvenkovski said during a visit to
Rome yesterday.

Citroen is to lose more than 1,600 jobs this year, 5 per cent of its

This is the third round of job losses in the French car industry in recent

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM headed by Thyssen and Veba, the German industrial groups, and
including BellSouth of the US and Vodafone of Britain, was yesterday awarded
the licence to develop and operate a new cellular telephone network in
Germany.
The new E1-network is described as the world's biggest digital cellular
network.
Total direct investment in it is estimated at DM4.8bn (Pounds 2bn), and
investments by suppliers may be worth a further DM3bn.
The network is expected to generate 8,000 jobs in Germany, of which 3,500
would be in the east, Mr Wolfgang Botsch, the newly-appointed minister of
posts and telecommunications, said yesterday.
The network will cater for 3m subscribers by the end of the decade, and
begin operations initially in eastern Germany, based in Berlin and Leipzig,
by the end of the year.
Mr Botsch said the group had won by a clear margin from the only other
competitor, the E-Star consortium headed by BMW, the Bavarian motor
manufacturer, and MAN, the engineering group.
The new system will be the third cellular telephone network to be developed
in Germany, and will compete directly with the C and D1 network operated by
Deutsche Telekom, and the D2 system operated by Mannesmann, respectively.
The key difference is that the new network will operate at 1800 megahertz,
instead of the traditional but overcrowded 900 megahertz used by the
existing systems. Germany will be only the second country, after Britain, to
use the higher frequency.
The consortium comprises Thyssen and Veba with a 28 per cent share each,
BellSouth, based in Atlanta, Georgia, has 21 per cent, and Vodafone, the
largest cellular telephone operator in Britain, has 16 per cent. Other
partners include several east German enterprises, among them Minol, the
petrol refining and distribution chain taken over by Elf and Thyssen, and
the French banking group Caisse des Depots et Consignation. The latter is
expected to help promote a European network based on the DCS 1800 standard.
Thyssen said the system would be built up initially in east Germany,
covering 88 per cent of that area by 1995, and 77 per cent of the west.
Vodafone said it hoped to be making an operating profit within four years.
One of the main requirements for the system was to put the initial emphasis
in east Germany where telephone density is only 20 per 100 inhabitants,
compared with 50 per 100 in the west.

DENMARK will hold its second referendum on the Maastricht treaty on Tuesday
May 18, and will include a vote on the opt-out agreement negotiated by
Denmark and its European partners at the EC summit in Edinburgh in December.
Recent opinion polls have indicated a comfortable majority for the treaty,
narrowly rejected by Danes last June. The most recent showed a 53:31
majority in favour, with the rest undecided.
However, a couple of setbacks have hit pro-Maastricht forces this week.
For one thing, the Socialist People's party (SPP) has split over the
national compromise behind the Edinburgh deal, with three of the SPP's
parliamentary group now rejecting the agreement, claiming that party opinion
is against the leaders' decision to support the deal.
The other setback came when a big trade union, representing public-sector
office workers, defied its leaders and urged a No vote.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Delors condemns UK over Hoover 'job-poaching'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACQUES Delors, European Commission president, attacked Britain yesterday
for 'job-poaching', saying he was determined to get Brussels plans for
mandatory European works councils back on the EC agenda.
After meeting shop stewards from Hoover's Dijon and Cambuslang plants in an
attempt to solve the controversy over the vacuum-cleaner manufacturer's
relocation of jobs from France to Scotland, he said the Commission was
powerless to act. 'There is no infraction on competition grounds, it is a
case of differences in labour costs,' he declared.
The row over whether the UK was downgrading workers' rights and benefits so
as to secure investment might have been avoided if the works council
directive were law. The directive would oblige companies employing over
1,000 people in more than one member state to consult workers'
representatives on issues such as job cuts, new work practices and
technology.
It has been blocked in the Council of Ministers (of the 12) for over two
years by UK opposition. But the Danish government, present holder of the EC
presidency, says a directive on works councils is one of its main
priorities.
Mr Delors said he would ask the Council to set a new date for re-examining
the plan, which has strong backing in France and Germany, and the formal
support of all Britain's partners. A works council 'would not necessarily
have affected the outcome', had one been in place at Hoover.
Such works councils would not necessarily resolve conflicts of interests
between workers over the transfer of jobs, according to union officials in
Brussels and London, but would make it more difficult for multinationals to
play off workers in one country against those in another, as the unions
claim has happened in the Hoover case.
Mr Delors was addressing a European socialist conference on ways to create
jobs and growth. A 'social Europe. . . means at the very least implementing
the social charter,' which all member states except the UK have signed, he
declared.
Separately last night, Mr Karel van Miert, the Belgian socialist now in
charge of EC competition policy, said social policy had to be factored into
the barrier-free single market to ensure a 'level playing-field'.
Despite the tension between British and French unions over Hoover,
co-operation between European unions is growing.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Big German unions accept 3% pay rise

<TEXT>
THE two biggest public sector trade unions in Germany last night accepted a
pay deal of just 3 per cent for the current year, boosting hopes for wage
restraint throughout the German economy.
The deal, agreed after two days of negotiations with both central and state
governments, could open the way for further relaxation of interest rates by
the German Bundesbank in the coming weeks. The public sector workers,
numbering 3.2m, are seen as leaders in the current wage round.
The offer of a 3 per cent pay rise was made by the public sector employers,
led by Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister, after a day of rising hope
in the negotiations. It was immediately recommended by the negotiators for
the oTV, the main public sector union, and the DAG, the smaller,
white-collar union.
By 10.30 last night, the full wages commissions of both unions had voted in
favour.
The outcome, after just three full rounds of negotiations, is in sharp
contrast to the confrontation in the public sector last year, when an 11-day
strike, chaos in public transport and piles of rubbish on the streets were
resolved by grudging acceptance of a 5.4 per cent pay deal.
The new accord will be widely welcomed in governments - wages account for 40
per cent of the overburdened budgets at the level of the 16 state
governments - and in industry, where employers have been urging severe wage
restraint. Three per cent is clearly below the inflation rate, which
averaged 4.5 per cent last year and is forecast at 3.5 per cent in 1993.
The employers' offer yesterday was a significant improvement on the original
2.25 per cent on the table, but well short of the union demand for up to 5.5
per cent.
A deal of about 3 per cent was always regarded by economic observers as the
best possible outcome.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Van Miert warns energy utilities
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC competition commissioner Karel van Miert has warned European governments
and energy utilities that they should end monopolies on intra-EC imports and
exports of gas and electricity.
He told a Brussels conference on Wednesday evening that he favoured security
of energy supply - one argument put forward by energy utilities resisting
liberalisation - but attempting to define security of supply in purely
national terms was 'out of date'.
His comments echoed those of his predecessor, Sir Leon Brittan, now trade
commissioner, but Mr Van Miert's tone was much less confrontational.
For example, he did not threaten to use special Commission powers to attack
national monopolies. Draft legislation to allow consumers to buy electricity
and gas from any EC supplier is stalled at ministerial level because of
government opposition.
The conference - inspired by French utilities in the fields of water,
energy, telecommunications, road, rail and postal services - yesterday
launched a European charter aimed to promote benefits of the French model of
public utilities.
Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, welcomed the initiative as
the beginning of a new era for public service companies. Utilities had
suffered a series of unjustified 'frontal attacks' in recent years based on
'dogmatic and ideological' objections, he said.
French public monopolies believe the appointment of Mr Van Miert, a Belgian
Socialist, as competition commissioner will ease ideological pressure.
During the conference, Mr Jean-Louis Bianco, French housing, transport and
infrastructure minister, said he hoped Mr Van Miert would introduce a
'different spirit'.
Mr Van Miert said he did not consider the application of competition policy
alone would automatically make things better; he repeated his view that
other elements - like social and environment policy - should be taken into
account.
But he warned the audience: 'If you think I'm a sort of anti-Sir Leon,
forget it.'

FT  05 FEB 93 / US rejects imposition of Bosnia plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US will support the plan for a Bosnian peace settlement proposed by
international mediators Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord David Owen, if it is
accepted by all the warring parties. But it will reject any attempt to
impose it on the Bosnian Moslems if they continue to reject it, the White
House said yesterday.
However, White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said President Bill Clinton
still intended to put forward his own proposals, which would be aimed at
making a peace agreement more acceptable to Moslems.
Though it is clear the Clinton administration has not yet clarified its
policy on Bosnia and there are evidently considerable differences of opinion
between the president's advisers on how to handle the problem, the
prevailing view in Washington appears to be that the Moslems are getting a
bad deal.
Most US officials appear to be convinced that the Moslems will never agree
to a map dividing Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces because they
consider that these endorse at least some of the effects of the Serbs'
policy of so-called ethnic cleansing. That map has, so far, been endorsed
only by the Bosnian Croats.
Mr Vance and Lord Owen continue to deny vigorously that the Moslems come off
second best in their plan. Though the mediators admit that it is impossible
to return to the pre-conflict situation, they emphasise that the Serbs will
have to give up as much as 39 per cent of the territory they at present
occupy.
They also stress that they have gone out of their way to meet Moslem demands
that Bosnia should continue to have a central government, which will be
responsible for foreign affairs and will be able to veto any move by the
Serb provinces to join up with a greater Serbia.
The mediators further point out that their peace plan already has the
support of all the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council,
including Russia and China and the European Community.
However, they would be very happy to endorse any alternative proposals from
the US which were acceptable to all the warring parties and the Security
Council.
Reuter adds from Zagreb: The Croatian government and rebel Serbs agreed
yesterday to talks at the UN in New York to stop renewed fighting in
Croatia's Serb-held Krajina region, said Mr Cedric Thornberry, deputy chief
of the UN's military peacekeeping mission in former Yugoslavia.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Citroen to axe 1,600 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CITROEN is to lose more than 1,600 jobs this year, 5 per cent of its
national workforce, as part of its campaign to reduce capacity in line with
falling demand and to lift productivity closer to that of Japanese
competitors.
This is the third round of job losses in the French car industry in recent
months, following state-owned Renault's announcement that it is to shed
2,249 workers, and 2,597 job losses at Peugeot, part of the same group as
Citroen.
It comes at a politically sensitive time, when the government is trying to
curb industrial job losses, as shown by the outcry over the closure of a
Hoover plant near Dijon.
Citroen has prepared alternative work plans for those losing their jobs, in
line with a recent law obliging companies to produce plans for alternative
employment for surplus workers.
Unusually, most of the Citroen job losses will be among engineers,
technicians, and executives, rather than factory floor workers as in the
past.
Among the options to be offered are early retirement, phased retirement,
other jobs in or out of the company, training and job creation incentives,
part time working and a subsidised return home for immigrant workers. 'We
aim to avoid redundancies if possible,' said an official.
Citroen's comprehensive efforts to soften the blow contrast with previous
job losses in the Peugeot group, the terms of which which have caused
conflict between the chairman, Mr Jacques Calvet, and Mrs Martine Aubry, the
labour minister and backer of the tough new job rules.
Outline plans were presented yesterday to Citroen unions, who immediately
published them for discussion at a works council on February 12.

A CONSORTIUM headed by Thyssen and Veba, the German industrial groups, and
including BellSouth of the US, and Vodafone of Britain, was yesterday
awarded the licence to develop and operate a new cellular telephone network
in Germany.
The new E1-network in Germany is described in the industry as the biggest
digital cellular network to be built anywhere .
Total direct investment in the network is estimated at DM4.8bn (Pounds 2bn),
and further indirect investments by suppliers may be worth a further DM3bn.
The network is expected to generate 8,000 jobs in Germany, of which 3,500
would be in the east, Mr Wolfgang Botsch, the newly-appointed German
minister of posts and telecommunications, said yesterday.
The network is intended to cater for 3m subscribers by the end of the
decade, and to begin operation initially in eastern Germany, based in Berlin
and Leipzig, by the end of the year.
Mr Botsch said the group had won by a clear margin from the only other
competitor, the E-Star consortium headed by BMW, the Bavarian motor
manufacturer, and MAN, the engineering group.
The new system will be the third cellular telephone network to be developed
in Germany, and will compete directly with the C and D1 network operated by
Deutsche Telekom, and the D2 system operated by Mannesmann, respectively.
The key difference is that the new network will operate at 1800 megaherz,
instead of the traditional but overcrowded 900 megaherz used by the existing
systems. Germany will be only the second country, after Britain, to use the
higher frequency.
The Thyssen-Veba consortium was an unsuccessful bidder to develop and
operate the D2 network, and there was a delighted reaction at the
consortium's Dusseldorf headquarters.
Thyssen and Veba have 28 per cent shares each, BellSouth, based in Atlanta,
Georgia, has 21 per cent, and Vodafone, the largest cellular telephone
operator in Britain, has 16 per cent. Other partners include several east
German enterprises, among them Minol, the petrol refining and distribution
chain taken over by Elf and Thyssen, and the French banking group Caisse des
Depots et Consignation. The latter is expected to help promote a European
network based on the DCS 1800 standard, according to a consortium statement.
Thyssen said the system would be built up initially in east Germany,
covering 88 per cent of that area by 1995, and 77 per cent on the west.
Vodafone said it hoped to be making an operating profit within four years.
One of the main requirements for the system was to put the initial emphasis
in east Germany where telephone density is only 20 per 100 inhabitants,
compared with 50 per 100 in the west.
The German cellular telephone market is seen as the European market with the
greatest untapped potential. Only 1 per cent of the population uses cellular
telephones whereas in Sweden, for example, market penetration is 8 per cent.

FT  05 FEB 93 / The German Rate Cut: Schlesinger yields to pressure from all
sides - Why the Bundesbank acted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE package from the Bundesbank contained a little of something for
everyone. The most important, German economists said, was support for the
battered European exchange rate mechanism, within which the Danish krone was
yesterday singled out for speculative attack.
The cuts in key short-term lending rates - 50 basis points off the
internationally sensitive Lombard rate and 25 off the discount rate - sent
important psychological signals to struggling European economies.
Similar signals were also received within the German economy, where a welter
of black data has recently forced all but the most blinkered to acknowledge
that recession has struck at last.
By suggesting that more relaxation can be expected to help domestic recovery
and save jobs, if wages and inflation can be better controlled, Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, central bank president, offered a carrot to trade unions now
embroiled in pay negotiations.
Also, as Mr Schlesinger's laid-back, even genial manner suggested, the bank
itself might be able to enjoy a little respite from the weight of domestic
and international pressure bearing down on it.
But the operative word was 'little'. 'Markets are not getting much of a
signal on easing,' said Mr Richard Reid, economist at the Union Bank of
Switzerland in Frankfurt.
The Bundesbank's package appeared to be aimed primarily at aiding the
European exchange rate mechanism. 'It did not want to be put in a position
where it could be blamed for the krone leaving,' he added.
Mr Norbert Walter, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, described the move as a
'symbolic shift', following recent speeches by Mr Schlesinger in which he
had indicated that he was concerned about the ERM.
Mr Dietrich Beier of the Berliner Bank was one of the overwhelming majority
of economists surprised by the rate cuts. The January inflation figure of
4.4 per cent was 'still ringing in our ears', and no change had been
expected for at least another four weeks. But the decisive factor had been
renewed ERM turbulence and market pressure on the Danish currency which
threatened to spill on to the French franc.
At the same time, economists agreed, the Bundesbank had clearly taken on
board complaints from Bonn and industry that the rapidly deteriorating
internal economic climate demanded action sooner rather than later, if only
to bolster plummeting confidence. According to the central bank's own
rule-of-thumb reckonings, the impact of interest rate changes normally take
eight or nine months to filter down to frontline businesses.
Meanwhile, there was a consensus that, as Mr Schlesinger claimed, the rate
reductions yesterday did not reflect any basic change in the central bank's
commitment to D-Mark stability.
Western German inflation is still well above 4 per cent and is not expected
to come even close to the central bank's target of 2 per cent this year.
Most forecasts suggest an annual average rate of 3.5 per cent. The M3
measure of money supply growth showed a swelling still far beyond the target
range in December, and the government has still not delivered its promised
solidarity pact coupling wage restraints with sweeping public spending cuts.
By the Bundesbank's own rigorous standards, spelt out at length in recent
months, this is simply not good enough. There are hopeful signs that wages,
inflation and money supply growth are slackening - factors acknowledged by
Mr Schlesinger yesterday - but, as he said, they were not the real reasons
for the cuts. They were merely part of a process which had begun last
September, when the discount rate was cut by 50 basis points and the Lombard
by 25, and since when the bank has steadily steered down money market rates
to just under 8.6 per cent.
As the Bundesbank has striven to convince its critics, it considers these
rates, which are manipulated through its regular securities repurchase
arrangements with banks, are the ones which really matter. Mr Schlesinger
repeated yesterday that the so-called 'key' Lombard and discount rates apply
to only about 17 per cent of German borrowing.
The cuts yesterday were intended to retain equilibrium - the Lombard
reduction to prevent money market rates moving up again and the adjustment
in the discount rates, regarded as the 'floor' in money market rates, to
take account of the steady downward shift in 'repo' rates. In the light of
this, economists were disappointed that yesterday's announcement gave no
indication of further possible reductions in repo rates.
Tense negotiations with the public sector unions in Germany last night
showed all indications of producing a welcome result, with a wage settlement
possibly even lower than the 3.5 per cent considered tolerable by the
Bundesbank. Economists are also forecasting that the money supply explosion
is past and that the January figures for M3 expansion could be within the
new target range of 5.5 to 6.5 per cent. A stop on new defence orders
underlined the government's commitment to rein in spending.
It is not in the Bundesbank's rigid nature to deliver before payment, but it
has made an exception this time. For an institution which counts credibility
as its most important asset, it has taken a gamble for which all those
benefiting from yesterday's relaxation will have to pay if the promises are
not fulfilled.

FT  05 FEB 93 / The German Rate Cut: Ailing ERM handed a new lease of life -
Alarm subsides in Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE German interest rate cuts were greeted with relief yesterday in
Brussels, where senior European Community officials have been watching
helplessly at the build-up of pressure on the exchange rate mechanism - the
designated vehicle for European monetary union.
In the previous 24 hours, officials had grown increasingly alarmed as first
the Danish krone and then the Belgian franc came under pressure in the
foreign exchange markets. After the 10 per cent devaluation of the Irish
punt last weekend, the speculative attacks on these 'hard currencies'
threatened to rip the heart out of the ERM.
The Bundesbank action yesterday marks a decisive move to salvage the system,
a senior EC official said.
Further, it offers the long-awaited chance of lower interest rates across
the Continent, the single most important factor in bolstering economic
recovery - one day after the European Commission issued its gloomiest
economic forecast for 1993 in 20 years, with growth unlikely to reach 0.8
per cent this year and 1.8 per cent in 1994, and unemployment continuing to
rise.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, said yesterday the Bundesbank
decision offered a much-needed signal that it recognised it had a
responsibility not just to the German economy but to the rest of the
Community.
This message of mutual interdependence is something he has been preaching
ever since coming to Brussels in 1985. Yesterday's interest rate cut
underlines that the Bundesbank has nothing to gain from a 'free-for-all' of
competitive devaluations in which monetary stability is lost.
Just hours before Frankfurt's move, Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner,
raised the possibility of a collapse of the ERM, in which case a smaller
group of countries were likely to create new forms of monetary and exchange
rate co-operation. This was not the preferred option, he stressed; but
something would emerge from the wreckage.
Sir Leon was merely expressing publicly what has been said privately on the
diplomatic circuit in Brussels since the New Year: that the unabated foreign
exchange market assault on the ERM, and, crucially, on the French
franc-D-Mark parity, was making it more likely that a nucleus of 'hard core'
currencies would move on a fast track to create some kind of monetary union
ahead of schedule.
Mr Luis Angel Rojo, governor of the Bank of Spain, confirmed as much
yesterday. Moves to link the more stable currencies in the ERM were under
discussion, he said, but there should be a flexible interpretation of the
economic 'convergence' criteria for Emu to allow Spain to join as well.
But relaxing the 'convergence criteria' providing tough targets on budget
deficits, public debt as a proportion of GDP and inflation is precisely what
the Bundesbank fears most about a single European currency. Last week, Mr
Helmut Schlesinger, its president, made clear in a speech that the price of
giving up the D-Mark had to be adherence to the convergence criteria.
Viewed from this perspective, it is possible to put a slightly less
altruistic gloss on the Bundesbank's rate cuts. One EC official suggested
that by easing the strains inside the ERM, the Bundesbank had underlined its
commitment to the status quo, rather than signalling its willingness to
contemplate a 'fast track' approach to Emu.

FT  05 FEB 93 / The German Rate Cut: Acute strains forced action as krone
sank - Exchange Rate Mechanism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN exchange dealers saw the interest rate cuts as a clear signal that
the German central bank would do whatever was necessary keep the European
exchange rate mechanism intact.
But some said the moves could sow doubts about the credibility of the
Bundesbank's commitment to control inflation at home, while driving a wedge
between the remaining 'core countries' in the ERM and those on the periphery
such as Ireland, Spain and Portugal, which have been forced to devalue in
the past three months without the help of a Bundesbank interest rate cut.
Foreign exchange analysts said this week's acute strains inside the ERM,
following the weekend devaluation of the Irish punt, caused the Bundesbank
to ease policy yesterday.
On Wednesday, the Danish krone fell sharply to its floor against three ERM
currencies - the Irish punt, Dutch guilder and D-Mark - in a burst of
speculation. Yesterday morning's 2 percentage point rise in the Danish
deposit and discount rates to 11.5 per cent indicated that the krone was
looking increasingly like another devaluation candidate.
A worrying feature of the selling of the krone on Wednesday afternoon was
that much of it appeared to be by Danish investors. Selling by domestic
investors is often seen as an indication that a currency is particularly
weak.
There was growing speculation that a devaluation of the krone would result
in pressure on the French franc, whose parity with the D-Mark is seen as
pivotal to the ERM.
In the light of yesterday's events, some economists suggested that the
French authorities might have played a crucial part in behind-the-scenes
discussions leading up to the Bundesbank move. The Bank of France's decision
to re-introduce its 5-to-10 day short-term borrowing facility on Tuesday was
seen yesterday as indicating a prior awareness that Germany might be
prepared to ease its rates to protect the ERM.
The French authorities are thought to have put pressure on the Bundesbank to
ease monetary conditions, partly because high interest rates were causing
problems, for French banks. US rating agencies have already cast doubt on
the creditworthiness of French banks.
An unexpectedly weak performance by the Belgian franc, a currency which is
closely tied to the D-Mark, was also causing alarm on Wednesday night.
In recent months, 3-month Belgian francs have traded at a premium to 3-month
D-Marks on the assumption that the franc is in the hard core of European
currencies.
On Wednesday, however, the cost of 3-month Belgian francs soared some 20
basis points above 3-month D-Marks. According to Mr Avinash Persaud, a
currency economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London, the Belgian currency
was having to carry a premium against the possibility of the ERM collapsing.
Yesterday, both the Danish krone and Belgian franc were performing more
strongly.

FT  05 FEB 93 / The German Rate Cut: Rumours avert upheaval - Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY a forewarning, in the shape of a Reuters news flash at 2.15pm
announcing the Bundesbank news conference, prevented pandemonium on the
foreign exchange markets.
As one New York-based dealer put it: 'If they hadn't announced a press
conference, the news would have blown us all out of the water.'
As it was, dealers who had gone short of the Danish krone, in anticipation
of a weekend devaluation, acted to restore their positions as soon as
rumours of a German rate cut began to circulate.
'The market reacts so instantaneously now,' said Mr Jeremy Hawkins, of Bank
of America, in London. 'The announcement of the press conference made more
of an impact on currencies than the actual cuts,' he said.
Forty-five minutes before the announcement, the dollar rallied as investors
bought on the back of the rumour. But, once dealers took stock of the slight
cuts, it slipped. 'It's like it always is,' said the New York dealer, 'you
buy on the rumour, you sell on the facts.'
If anyone had their fingers burned, said traders, it was those short of
pounds.

FT  05 FEB 93 / The German Rate Cut: Smoke clears around the franc - France
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was almost audible relief in the government offices and banking halls
of Paris yesterday. French authorities have interpreted the German interest
rate as a long-awaited sign that their bruising battle to defend the franc
is over and that, sooner or later, the Bank of France should be able to
signal a cut in interest rates.
'This is the signal we've been waiting for,' said a spokesman for Prime
Minister Pierre Beregovoy. 'It's definitely a step in the right direction,'
commented an official at the Finance Ministry.
The rate cut's timing caught many in the government by surprise, but they
seemed convinced that the Bundesbank was on course for further reductions in
the cost of money. 'Germany and the rest of Europe are now in the same stage
of the cycle, with both inflation and economic activity weakening,' said
another official in the prime minister's office. Further German rate cuts
might be slow in coming, but 'at least the supertanker (the Bundesbank) has
now changed course', said an Elysee official.
The Paris stock market, which had been sluggish throughout the morning,
greeted the Bundesbank announcement with an afternoon surge. It ended the
day up by 1.66 per cent at 1,854. Meanwhile, the French franc closed at
3.379 against the D-Mark yesterday, against 3.391 on the previous day.
The news of the German rate reduction came in the nick of time for France.
The franc's resilience earlier this week after the devaluation of the Irish
punt was hailed by French ministers as evidence that the currency was out of
danger. But the battle for the franc has left France with high interest
rates which are squeezing the economy in the run-up to next month's
elections.
There is also the threat of a further rise in bank base rates. The
commercial banks are under intense pressure given that base rates at 10 per
cent have been around 2 percentage points lower than market rates - which
determine the banks' borrowing costs - since early January. Societe Generale
estimates that this costs the French banking system an extra FFr50m a week.
The German rate cut should give French officials the ammunition they need to
persuade the banks that the pain will soon be over. 'It has certainly given
France a breathing space,' said Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, chief French
economist at Salomon Brothers. 'It should stop the banks from raising base
rates, but the key question is whether it will be enough to produce a cut in
official interest rates.'
The reaction of the French markets yesterday suggested that there was no
expectation of an immediate cut in interest rates. Short-term market rates
remained steady with three-month money hovering between 11.75 and 12.25 per
cent.
On the political level, the Bundesbank move eases the pressure on Paris and
Bonn to find ways of bolstering Franco-German monetary co-operation. With
the Maastricht treaty still awaiting UK and Danish ratification, and with
its monetary underpinning, the European monetary system, under such strain,
experts in both capitals had been weighing new means of restoring impetus to
monetary union.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank action was greeted with cautious relief in political and
business circles in Germany yesterday.
The move caught most observers by surprise, because the central bank was
expected to wait for solid results from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's attempts to
negotiate a 'solidarity pact' with trade unions, employers, the opposition
Social Democrats and the 16 federal states, to settle future financing for
east Germany.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, who has made little secret of his
desire to see an early interest rate cut to revive the ailing German
economy, said the move would provide 'a positive impulse'.
There was relief in the Chancellor's office, where pressure from France had
been acutely felt. Mr Kohl's advisers had stressed the need to pay attention
to the international as well as domestic consequences of high interest
rates.
However, Mr Wolfgang Roth, of the opposition SPD, said the action was just
'a faltering step in the right direction'. And the German federation of
industry said lasting economic stimulus could hardly be expected from such a
modest step, but a bigger interest rate reduction would not have been a
responsible action.

FT  05 FEB 93 / The German Rate Cut: Reserve cut bonus for banks - Impact in
Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE cut in reserve requirements announced by the Bundesbank will bolster
German banks' profits this year, allowing them to earn interest on DM32bn
(Pounds 13.3bn) of their deposits for the first time.
The Bundesbank's move to replace the reserves with new short-term money
market instruments was also seen in some quarters as a boost to Germany's
underdeveloped money markets.
German banks have long complained that minimum reserves make Frankfurt
uncompetitive against other European financial centres. The Bundesbank said
the move was designed to increase the competitiveness of Finanzplatz
Deutschland, Germany as a financial centre.
The reserves require that for every DM100 a bank takes as a deposit from a
customer, it is obliged to deposit up to DM12 with the Bundesbank.
The banks are not paid interest on these holdings so the reserves act as a
brake on lending, liquidity and profitability.
Some other European financial centres have these reserves but they are
invariably lower. In Luxembourg, a source of strong competition to
Frankfurt, there are no reserve requirements.
Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands have no reserve requirements, while in
France they are just 1 per cent on most bank deposits and in the UK they are
0.35 per cent.
The Bundesbank said it would reduce reserve requirements on time liabilities
and savings deposits from an average of 4.5 per cent to 2 per cent. Other
types of deposits - namely sight liabilities where reserve requirements can
be as high as 12 per cent - are not affected.
Almost three quarters of deposits at German banks are affected by the
measure.
The immediate impact is that banks will be able to earn interest on about
DM32bn of cash for the first time. If customers do not require them to pass
on some of these reduced costs of making a loan, this means an increase of
several percentage points in banks' earnings this year.
The Bundesbank has arranged it so that the liquidity effects of the move
will be neutralised by the introduction of new short-term investment
instruments which are intended to absorb DM25bn of the cash. The net DM7bn
of new liquidity is too small to have any effect on money market interest
rates.
Although the Bundesbank has defended reserve requirements as an important
part of its anti-inflation armoury, the fact is that they have remained
unchanged since 1987. Far more important for monetary policy are the
Bundesbank's operations in the money markets, which allow it to fine-tune
interest rates through repurchase agreements and other instruments.
Despite the headline grabbing effect of the half point cut in the Lombard
rate yesterday, what is more important for was the quarter-point cut in the
discount rate, which acts as a floor to money market rates. All eyes are on
Wednesday's repo auction, when rates are likely to be up to 0.25 per cent
lower than the 8.57 per cent rate of earlier this week.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Kingfisher in merger talks with French retail chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KINGFISHER, the UK retailer, and Darty, the French electrical goods chain,
announced yesterday they were in merger talks.
A takeover by Kingfisher, which could value Darty at Pounds 1bn, would
create a significant Anglo-French alliance as Europe's retailers look
towards cross-border expansion.
Darty, with 130 stores, is one of the best-known names in French retailing.
UK-based Kingfisher encompasses the Woolworth, Superdrug and B&amp;Q chains as
well as Comet, Britain's second-largest electrical retail chain.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, Kingfisher's corporate affairs director, said the two
groups had been aware of each other since 1986. They had first talked about
co-operating four years ago and began 'talking seriously about this
transaction last summer'.
Kingfisher's shares fell 20p to 538p yesterday as the London stock market
worried about the cost of the deal.
Mr Whittaker said Kingfisher's gearing was low. He would not comment on
terms but countered suggestions that Kingfisher might be tempted to overpay
to gain a foothold in continental Europe. 'If we are going to do this deal,
it has to make sense on its own merits,' he said.
The purchase price is expected to be much less than that implied by Darty's
share price, plus its debt, and may involve deferring part of the
consideration.
Darty's shares were suspended at FFr519 in Paris, valuing the group at
FFr7.9bn (Pounds 1bn) . Darty has about Pounds 500m of borrowings. Only 4.7
per cent of its shares are listed after a management buy-out for FFr7bn in
1988. Any deal would include an offer to the minority shareholders.
Darty is under financial pressure because of the slowdown experienced in the
French economy, intense competition in the household goods market and the
burden of the debt that has been incurred to finance the buy-out.
Darty warned shareholders last week that it faced a fall in pre-tax profits
in the current financial year from the previous FFr1.07bn. Kingfisher's
pre-tax profits in the last financial year, to February 1 1992, were Pounds
207.1m, and stockbrokers expect a modest increase in the year just ended.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Bundesbank move calms pound: Lower rates bring hope of EMS
stability - Continental European markets rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN Bundesbank yesterday brought surprise and relief around Europe by
cutting its leading interest rates to stave off speculative attacks against
weaker currencies.
The Bundesbank, which effectively sets the direction of interest rates
around Europe, lowered its discount rate by 0.25 of a point to 8 per cent.
It cut the internationally sensitive Lombard rate by 0.5 of a point to 9 per
cent.
The move to reduce the main interest rates at which the Bundesbank provides
funds to the banks helped to stem sterling's relentless fall over the past
few days and rally stock and bond markets in continental Europe. The FT-SE
100, however, fell 7.9 to close at 2,865.9.
The Bundesbank's move followed the Bank of Japan's decision earlier in the
day to cut its official discount rate from 3.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent.
In a separate but related development to the Bundesbank's decision,
Germany's public sector workers yesterday accepted a pay increase of just 3
per cent, well below the current rate of inflation. The deal will be seen as
an indicator for the whole wages round in Germany this year, and could open
the way for the Bundesbank to cut interest rates further.
The wages commission of the DAG, the white-collar public sector union, and
the oTV, the larger public sector union, both accepted what the government
said was its final offer. The Bundesbank had seen such a wage agreement as
vital to its strategy for containing inflation and had been loath to cut
rates until such a deal was achieved.
Yesterday Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, interpreted
the German rate cut as a clear attempt to preserve Franco-German monetary
co-operation. He called the cut a 'good political signal at a time when one
was entitled to worry about the long-term stability of the European Monetary
System'.
The French finance ministry, which has been pressing Germany to lower rates
to help the franc, said: 'This is the kind of gesture that should help the
EMS get some stability back.'
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, underlined the importance of
the cuts for the EMS. 'We hope this unfriendly game sometimes called
dominoes, in which speculators pick on one currency after another, has
finally come to an end,' he told a news conference.
Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, governor of the Danish National Bank, which has had to
intervene heavily to support the krone this week, said the German cuts were
sufficient to head off a krone devaluation.
But German industrialists said the move bowed to foreign pressure to ease
German credit costs. The Federation of German Chambers of Commerce said the
timing was 'unfortunate' and said 'pressure to bring wage and fiscal policy
back to a stability orientated track is now smaller'.
On Monday, Mr Schlesinger appeared to oppose short-term interest rate cuts
by saying only 'ignoramuses' were saying German interest rates were
persistently high.
German long-term interest rates rose slightly as capital market dealers
worried about the persistence of German inflationary pressures. Ms Alison
Cottrell, an economist at London-based Midland Global Markets said: 'It is a
complete about-turn for Schlesinger. The move was forced on him by both
international and domestic considerations. Had he done nothing today the ERM
would have fallen apart disastrously.
'But a quarter point off the discount rate is not the end of the road. The
Bundesbank is buying itself time through to the French elections.'
The central banks of the Netherlands, Belgium and Austria, which closely
align their monetary policy to Germany's, reacted by cutting some of their
own key lending rates.
The Dutch central bank lowered its special advances rate by 0.1 of a point
to 8.3 per cent. Austria cut its discount rate to 7.5 per cent from 7.875
per cent and the Lombard rate to 8.75 from 9.25 per cent. The Belgian
National Bank cut the central rate for primary dealers to 8.3 per cent from
8.4 per cent and the emergency lending rate to 9.75 per cent from 10.0 per
cent.
Some German economists were disappointed that yesterday's announcement gave
no indication of further possible reductions in the Bundesbank's money
market dealing rates.
Mr Norbert Walter, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, interpreted yesterday's
modest concessions as an indication of 'deep divisions' within the
Bundesbank's governing central council.
Hardliners on the council were likely to have struggled to keep rates up
until there were sure signs that inflation, money supply, wages and
government spending were under control.
However, regional council members' arguments for some relief to help offset
the impact of recession, combined with renewed ERM turbulence and
speculative attacks on the Danish krone, won the day.
Germany's deepening economic crisis was highlighted again yesterday by
statistics showing that incoming manufacturing orders at the end of last
year had fallen by 8 per cent.

FT  05 FEB 93 / French premier hits at UK's 'dead-end' economic policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN WAS heading down a dead-end, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime
minister, said yesterday in his strongest attack yet on UK economic and
monetary policies.
'I feel today that Britain is going down a dead-end path. And that is true
for everything,' he said. UK interest rate cuts and the reduction in the
value of sterling had not helped the economy to recover, he said. 'You can
see that confidence is not coming back and unemployment in Britain is rising
at a pace clearly faster than elsewhere.'
He said Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, was the victim of the radical
free-market policies of his predecessor, Lady Thatcher.
Mr Beregovoy's outburst will increase tensions in Franco-British relations,
placed under fresh strain recently by the controversial decision of Hoover,
the US appliance maker, to close a plant near Dijon and shift production to
Scotland.
'You can see where unfettered liberalism gets you,' said Mr Beregovoy. 'The
Scottish workers, a pistol loaded with job cuts at their heads, have agreed
to give up employment rights, the right to strike, and accepted a blow to
their pension funds and wage cuts.'
His remarks also reflect suspicion in some French government quarters that
US and UK pressure was an element in the recent speculative attacks against
the franc, though this could ease following the Bundesbank's rates cut,
announced after his statement.
Mr Beregovoy called for a meeting of finance ministers of the Group of Seven
industrialised nations to discuss a world growth initiative.
'It is European co-operation and international co-operation which can
conjure up stronger growth in the months to come,' he said. The EC should
react strongly to recent US trade measures against European products.
Philip Stephens, Political Editor, writes: Downing Street signalled that Mr
Major was not prepared to engage in a slanging match with the French prime
minister although he could defend strongly both Britain's interest rate
policy and the assistance which persuaded Hoover to relocate.
The view at Westminster was that the approach of the French general election
would prompt politicians on all sides to seek votes by taking swipes at
Britain.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Lamont says Britain will not follow German lead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT made it clear yesterday there was little immediate prospect
that he would follow the Bundesbank's lead and cut British interest rates
again.
Amid fears in Whitehall that lower German rates might provide only a
temporary respite for the pound, the chancellor of the exchequer told MPs
that he was not prepared to jeopardise the government's anti-inflation
policy by risking a new sterling crisis.
'Markets should remember that interest rates can go up as well as down,' he
said.
His comments came as the Treasury prepared to reassure financial markets
about its medium-term economic strategy with the announcement of the most
sweeping review of public spending for more than a decade.
The review, led by Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury,
will aim to convince the markets that the government has a coherent
framework to reduce a budget deficit which is forecast to reach Pounds 50bn
next year.
The relative calm which returned yesterday to London's financial markets did
little to dispel doubts at Westminster over Mr Lamont's future as chancellor
after the March 16 Budget.
Mr John Major sidestepped a question in the House of Commons on whether Mr
Lamont would deliver the second Budget of the year in December.
Mr Major replied: 'I can't imagine anyone other than the chancellor of the
exchequer presenting a Budget.'
In an attempt to dispel the impression of disarray in the government's
economic strategy, Mr Lamont repeated that the recent cut in British
borrowing costs to 6 per cent had been 'fully justified' by the inflation
outlook.
'It was based on the advice of the Bank of England. It was based on what is
happening to the money supply and to asset prices,' he said.
Appearing alongside the chancellor, Mr Portillo brushed aside suggestions
that the pound's recent fall would translate into an acceleration of
inflation.
However, Mr Lamont said that the Treasury would continue to take the
exchange rate into account in its interest rate judgments.
Mr Lamont sought to lift the economic gloom prompted by this week's failure
of Leyland Daf, the commercial vehicle maker, by pointing to signs of an
upturn in the housing market.
But neither he nor his Treasury colleagues would rule out the possibility of
tax increases in the March Budget.

FT  05 FEB 93 / World News in Brief: Rebel Tories may settle for saving only
12 pits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government may be able to secure backbench support for an energy policy
which saves well under half the threatened 31 coal pits. Telephone
interviews with the most likely Tory backbench rebels indicated that a plan
which spared between 12 and 14 pits would be likely to keep the government
out of danger. But a hardline group remains which insists that up to 20 must
be kept.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Military manoeuvres: Britain's army will remain stretched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They marched them up to the top of the hill, and they marched them down
again.
Two years ago, the soldiers of the 1st Battalion, the Staffordshire
Regiment, were camped out in Saudi Arabia, about to join the land campaign
to liberate Kuwait. In April 1991, they returned to Fallingbostel in
northern Germany. In November they moved to England. The following April
they left their families again for a six-month tour in County Fermanagh,
Ulster.
Now back in Chester, at full strength of 600, they were waiting to be merged
in the autumn with the Cheshire Regiment when it returns from Bosnia, with
another emergency tour looming eight months later.
That is what is meant by 'overstretch' in Britain's army. Soldiers are
supposed to get at least two years between emergency assignments. They have
been getting about 15 months.
The Staffords were among four regiments saved this week from amalgamation.
In 1991, they were unexpectedly included on the merger list. The reprieve
came just as much out of the blue.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, made his move as pressure was
building up in Westminster for a more drastic scaling-down of army cuts. The
all-party Commons defence committee was ready to launch a report calling for
all the measures to be put on hold.
Regiments are great stirrers of emotion, although there have been many
amalgamations before. The Royal Scots, who until Mr Rifkind's announcement
were set to merge with the King's Own Scottish Borderers, are a rarity in
having survived intact since the 17th century.
The Scottish regiments - affected by one other merger and the loss of a
guards battalion - and the Staffords, waged the strongest campaigns. By
selecting regiments for reprieve, Mr Rifkind took the risk of opening a
Pandora's box; over the next two years, there are 10 more armoured and
infantry regiments waiting for amalgamations and three guards regiments
destined to lose their second battalions.
The government has backtracked, but so far by no more than 2.6 per cent,
retaining 3,000 more troops than planned for the mid-1990s, including
keeping 40 infantry battalions instead of 38. Defence ministers, who always
stood firmly by their Options for Change programme of armed forces cuts,
argue that its fundamentals have not altered. The 6,500 army redundancies
due later this month, mostly voluntary and linked to ages and rank rather
than individual units, are not materially affected.
The target first set in 1990 was an army of 'around 120,000'. Over the
following year, the figure was trimmed to 116,000 - a reduction of 40,000
over three years. Army chiefs had fought for more battalions. The infantry
that remained included two surviving Gurkha battalions of Nepalese soldiers,
who have never been used for jobs like patrolling Northern streets.
Since taking over the defence ministry last April, Mr Rifkind has faced a
difficult concatenation of circumstances. One of the premises of Options for
Change was that the number of British troops sent to Northern Ireland would
remain stable at about 10,500, with 10 regular army battalions. Early last
year this was increased by two extra battalions, and Northern Ireland
ministers are expected to argue against returning to the previous level. In
the meantime, more than 3,000 troops have been sent to former Yugoslavia.
Much of the army, meanwhile, is tied up in reorganisation and withdrawal
from Germany. Options for Change was meant to leave a margin for the
unpredictable, but the margin was too small and the unpredictable came
sooner than expected.
Then, with British troops newly arrived in central Bosnia, came the autumn
round of public expenditure cuts, reducing the defence budget for the next
financial year from more than Pounds 24bn to Pounds 23.5bn. The change in
army plans adds Pounds 80m a year to some Pounds 1bn worth of savings Mr
Rifkind has to find over the next two years. Cuts could hit RAF fighter
squadrons and the navy's plan for a helicopter carrier, due to be ordered
this autumn. Inter-service battles, which the government has tried hard to
keep a lid on, are bubbling up again.
The army asked for some 6,000 more troops than it got, not so much to revive
regiments as to bring depleted units up to strength.
Public controversy has focused on the infantry, but that is only about a
quarter of the army. The rest, including tank forces, engineers, signals and
artillery, also face heavy cuts. A new Royal Logistic Corps comes into being
in April, merging five activities from transport to catering, the biggest
reorganisation since 1904 when the army was drawing lessons from the Boer
war.
The problem is that it is infantry that is required for peacekeeping. The
army, which has been given the job of leading Nato's new rapid reaction
corps, does not want to cut its tank units any further to make up numbers.
It wants to keep its capacity for fighting real wars, in which infantry is
only part of the picture. It is determined to be something more than a
gendarmerie and to keep a place at Nato's top planning table.
Manning is still tight, just slightly less so. Pressures should ease in the
next few years. Numbers in Cyprus have been cut; the two battalions in
Berlin are due to go; the Hong Kong garrison has to pack up in 1997;
commitments in Belize and Brunei could end. More soldiers are likely to
become available through hiving off support functions and streamlining army
structures in the UK.
But the changes are unlikely to alter British military reservations about a
full-scale peacekeeping operation in Bosnia without US participation. The
French have more troops available, but their larger army is based on
conscription. Of 4,700 French troops in former Yugoslavia, 39 per cent are
national servicemen who have volunteered for foreign service. This could
become a problem if they become more directly engaged in fighting.
In the area where the British army now escorts convoys, it is reckoned at
least a brigade of 6,000 would be needed to oversee a ceasefire. The army
could provide that, and more, but could not send fresh troops to replace
them if the mission became permanent.
UN berets worn by British troops in Bosnia come in different shades of blue.
The paler ones are mementoes of Cyprus. The UN went there in response to a
crisis in 1964 and is still there almost 29 years later. It is the same
lesson Britain has learnt in Northern Ireland - going in is always easier
than getting out.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Letter: Nuclear threat posed by dispute over the status of
Kashmir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr GHULAM NABI FAI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your editorial, 'Kashmir's plight' (January 25), you note that 'the
misery of Kashmir has tended to be forgotten amid the upsurge of disputes
elsewhere. It should not be.' This is absolutely correct.
The crisis in Kashmir has claimed many lives. As in Bosnia and Somalia, the
majority of the victims of the Kashmir crisis are civilians, particularly
women and children. These non-combatants have been targeted by military
forces and suffer from chronic shortages of food and medicine.
But in Kashmir there is an added dimension to the crisis. This is that both
India and Pakistan, which as you say have fought two wars over Kashmir and
remain at loggerheads, are now believed to possess nuclear arsenals. As
tensions rise again today, the continued hostilities between them pose a
nuclear threat to the Indo-Pakistani region, and to the world.
The Bush administration had no policy for Kashmir. Its efforts to encourage
nuclear non-proliferation were therefore doomed to failure since reducing
the threat of a nuclear exchange in south Asia is inexorably linked to
resolving the status of Kashmir.
How can one talk of disarming India and Pakistan when the cause of their
tensions, the usettled status of Kashmir, was not up for discussion?
Reducing the threat of a nuclear exchange in south Asia is inexorably linked
to resolving the status of Kashmir.
Prime Minister John Major is to be congratulated for recognising this fact,
and for seeking to bring about negotiations with Britain as the mediator. He
should not be deterred by India's recent rebuff, and should also encourage
the new Clinton administration to make Kashmir a priority.
Time is not on our side. Every day more and more atrocities are being
committed by Indian security forces. Humanitarian considerations for action
in Kashmir are tremendous. But the geo-strategic considerations are even
more compelling. Kashmir's strategic location makes it a 'nuclear trip-wire'
for south Asia - a trip-wire more unstable than the threat posed by the
nuclear arsenal in the Commonwealth of Independent States.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Vaudeville days are here
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whew] That was close. The government got through Thursday with its trousers
on. When we woke up, sterling seemed to be in free fall. It looked as if the
pound was about to descend to Mr Norman Lamont's ankles by lunchtime. This
would have diverted attention from Mr John Major's big speech of the night
before.
I will come to that speech, but first let us return to the foreign exchange
rooms. When they opened, nobody could think of anything the government might
do to avoid a disaster. Sack the chancellor? Tempting, but six weeks ahead
of the Budget such a move might suggest that the prime minister was not
wholly confident of the truth of his supportive words of only two days
previously. Raise interest rates? Technically correct, but implausible just
a week after lowering them. Make a speech affirming the soundness of the
government's economic policy? Be serious.
In the event, the Bundesbank came to the rescue. By reducing German interest
rates just a fraction, it fractionally strengthened demand for the British
currency. The chancellor's dignity was saved. With a sigh, ministers
returned to their everyday task of appeasing Conservative backbenchers.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the industry secretary, went on calculating the
optimum subsidy for the coalmines. He is already up to his waist in
crumpled-up envelopes. Some, I fancy, bear drawings of Mr Winston Churchill
 -Mr Arthur Scargill's representative on earth - that fail to flatter the
Conservative MP for Davyhulme. The defence secretary, Mr Malcolm Rifkind,
reversed a few minor cuts in the size of the army and claimed, with straight
face, that his U-turn would cost nothing. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the
secretary for health, lay tied to the rails by the British Medical
Association, her face creased with alarm as the prospect of a capitulation
over the closure of London hospitals steamed ever closer.
If you ask how long this vaudeville can continue the answer is
'indefinitely'. The government is hamstrung. Fate, that exquisite torturer,
has placed Mr Major into Number 10 Downing Street on the strength of a small
yet unreliable majority. He can never be sure of getting anything through
the Commons. He must always be ready to grovel before one of its committees.
He cannot do much more to hasten the end of the recession. He is afraid of
raising taxes to tackle the growing public sector deficit. Until the
recovery is safely under way, the whispers about his and his chancellor's
fitness for the offices they hold will persist. Yet there is no challenger
for the Conservative leadership, and no sign that the Labour party is
transforming itself into an alternative party of government.
It is against this background that we must evaluate Mr Major's address to
the Carlton Club. It set out, plainly enough, the principles that make
Conservatives stand up and salute: choice, ownership, responsibility and
opportunity. 'The modern Conservative party,' he said, 'is heir to both the
great 19th-century political traditions: to the Whigs, in our free-market
radicalism; to the Tories, in our belief in community and tradition.'
As in all set-piece speeches, he then put it better: 'We will carry forward
the pursuit of economic liberalism, and the reinforcement of the social
cement that binds us together.'
Mr Major also listed existing government policies: 'the Citizen's Charter,
deregulation, privatisation, private finance, market-testing, openness'. He
affirmed his belief in the continuity of existing institutions, such as the
monarchy, Parliament, the unity of the United Kingdom, and 'our churches and
voluntary organisations'. He initiated a fresh debate on the merits of
asking people to work in return for unemployment benefits. The latter has
already caused quite a flurry.
There is nothing wrong with this declaration by the prime minister to a
receptive Carlton Club audience. If you consider its bits and pieces, his
domestic agenda is seen to be a conventional mix of the beneficial, the
harmless, and the dam-aging.
To take just three examples, the government's education reforms are
excellent, the Citizen's Charter is neutral, and the continued assault on
local democracy is scandalous. In some areas, such as his proud allusion to
'people from ethnic minorities entering public life', Mr Major is ahead of
many in his party. On this point he is exercising true leadership. In
others, such as the kite-flying on 'workfare', he is showing a degree of
courage that Lady Thatcher could not muster when she was in charge.
What is missing is glue. The invocation of Disraeli and Burke is not a
sufficient means of binding together a package of disparate policies, most
of whose origins can be traced back to the Thatcher years. Talk of blending
continuity and change is not in itself enough. 'Our political strength,'
said Mr Major, 'has always rested on our ability to keep a finger on the
pulse of the British people.' This is true, but the pulse beat of the 1990s
is different from that of the 1980s.
Some of the reasons for that difference are evident. There is a growing fear
of unemployment, which talk of workfare cannot by itself alleviate. The
seemingly unstoppable advance of the welfare state cannot be indefinitely
sustained by the working population. A growing proportion is ageing.
Government by Whitehall and quango is no proper substitute for
accountability to local elected authorities; London alone is in a state of
disrepair that may one day soon be seen to constitute a crisis. Britain's
century-long decline relative to other leading trading nations continues;
political leaders must tell us whether they propose merely to manage a
shrinking economy or whether they have found ways of reversing the trend.
Such topics would be fit subjects for a discourse by a prime minister who
had time to spare. The luxury of a stable majority would also help. Neither
advantage is available to the present occupant of Number 10 Downing Street.
The Carlton Club speech is therefore the best available exposition of what
Mr Major thinks he can get through the Commons. It set out a political
programme. Some Conservatives hoped for more - for a 'vision'. For that they
must wait until the vaudeville days are over.

Sir, We have been subjected to a spate of advertising on the advantages of
Yellow Pages. I have checked one line in my office which appears in business
directories. A rough count indicated a ratio of about 40 solicitation calls
from insurance sales persons, office cleaners etc to one 'professional
inquirer for our services'. Of the professional inquirers, only a very small
proportion turned out to be fruitful. Given the time that dealing with such
solicitation takes up, and the blockage of our telephone facilities, I
suspect that appearing in Yellow Pages results in our losing money rather
than gaining business. There are ways of controlling junk mail - is there
any way of controlling junk telephone calls?

FT  05 FEB 93 / Letter: Long-term rates for mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JEREMY ARCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Building societies are currently facing funding problems as depositors
find returns unattractive in a lower interest-rate environment. Some
commentators are now suggesting that the resultant diminution in lending
power may hinder the recovery. But why should building societies still be
obliged to borrow short in order to lend long?
Why should home-owners take out 25-year mortgages and then dance to the tune
of highly volatile short-term interest rates instead of the more predictable
long end of the yield curve? The latter interest payment structure is normal
practice in the US.
A change would be logical and would have the effect of smoothing the
inflation statistics as well as assisting household budget planning.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Letter: Mercedes-Benz an example to banks on cost-cutting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr P E FORREST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, According to your article, 'Making the leap out of the lap of luxury'
(January 30), Helmut Werner, the new boss of Mercedes-Benz, indicated that
the days are gone when the charging of premium pricing could cover up for
costs that were too high.
Perhaps, in another context, the spokeswoman from one of the banks who said
that they were losing money on any current account with a credit balance of
less than Pounds 1,000 should be introduced to this line of conjecture.
Banks have lived too long in a world where the answer to corporate happiness
was to divide extant costs by the number of transactions and use the product
of that equation as the basis for the price the customer should bear.
A hard look at the levels of waste of time, effort, resources and money
involved in their calculation of costs might be a productive place for them
to start rebuilding their justifiably tatty image.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Letter: Italy taxes patience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From D S HAGUE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article ('Exporters warned of payment delays', February 3) on
payment delays for UK exporters trading in continental Europe is a
cautionary tale. But surely the greatest offenders in this regard are the
Italian fiscal authorities, from which it seems to be well-nigh impossible
to obtain refunds of VAT incurred in Italy.
I have experience of a claim totalling more than Pounds 30,000 for VAT
incurred in 1989, which still has not been paid, despite chase-ups and
reminders.
While EC directives abound, affecting the minutiae of the lives of the
humblest European, it would seem that, in regard to VAT legislation, one of
the member countries has no desire to comply. Is it not time for Brussels to
bring the Italian authorities into line over this matter and insist upon
Italy settling VAT claims promptly, as does the UK VAT authority?

FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Telegraph sells Trinity stake and buys into
Canada
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TELEGRAPH has sold its near-13 per cent stake in Trinity International,
the publishing group, for Pounds 26.8m and is buying half of the 22.6 per
cent stake in Southam, the Canadian newspaper group acquired recently by Mr
Conrad Black's Hollinger Group.
Mr Black, chairman of the Telegraph, built up the interest in Trinity,
publisher of the Liverpool Post and Echo in 1990, almost certainly in the
hope that the Telegraph would one day be able to increase its stake or even
take over the group. Like Mr Black, Trinity has a string of small papers in
Canada.
Hollinger paid CDollars 259m (Pounds 141m) for the stake in Southam,
Canada's largest newspaper publisher with 18 daily papers and interests in
business information services and trade publications. The Telegraph is to
pay half of that.
The sale of the Trinity holding to a wide range of UK institutional
shareholders, suggests that Mr Black has conceded that he had little chance
of winning control of the company in the foreseeable future.
There are only 12 voting shares, and they are held by directors. The unusual
structure was created in 1904, when the company was first incorporated, to
protect its then Liberal political line against potential Conservative
predators.
Mr Black, through Hollinger, bought 5.6m of the shares at prices ranging
from 170p to 200p in July 1990.
The final total of 8.74m shares was sold, it is believed, at 320p, producing
a pre-tax profit on the deal of Pounds 6.5m.
Last May the Trinity stock was acquired by the Telegraph as part of a
reorganisation prior to the listing of the Telegraph on the Stock Exchange.
The money will be put on deposit.
Mr Philip Graf, Trinity's managing director designate, commenting on the
sale yesterday, said: 'We are very pleased. We understand the shares have
been placed with a wide spread of institutions.'
Trinity said it keeps its voting structure under review, but it is clear it
does not feel under any real pressure to change it at the moment.
In March, Trinity was able to raise some Pounds 23m from a rights issue to
help pay for its Pounds 45m purchase of Scottish and Universal Newspapers.
Participation by the Telegraph in Southam is subject to the approval of
Southam's independent directors and the Telegraph's shareholders, other than
Hollinger. Hollinger holds a 68.1 per cent stake in the Telegraph.
The statement said the Telegraph's cash resources, together with the Pounds
26.8m proceeds of the Trinity sale yesterday would be sufficient to cover
about 75 per cent of the cost of the proposed joint venture interest.
Hollinger paid CDollars 18.10 a share for its stake in Southam, shares of
which were yesterday trading at CDollars 15 1/4 .
Last month Mr William Ardell, Southam's chief executive, said the Canadian
group planned to forge closer links with Mr Black's other international
publishing investments, the Daily Telegraph in the UK and Australia's
Fairfax Holdings.
Mr Ardell said that he foresaw opportunities to create products, including
improvements to existing papers.

FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: ICI in talks to sell powder coatings arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the UK's largest manufacturer, yesterday
announced that it was in discussions with Ferro of Cleveland, Ohio, about
the sale of its powder coatings business.
ICI said the business, with annual sales of about Dollars 100m (Pounds 66m),
did not fit in with its core operations.
It employs about 350 people, half in the US and half in Europe.
Although the sector, which provides coatings, mostly for domestic
appliances, office furniture and automotive components, was growing faster
than gross domestic product.
ICI said it did not believe it had the critical mass to succeed in the
busi-ness.
Ferro said it thought the market was growing at 10 to 15 per cent a year.
The group was in discussions with ICI about a possible joint venture last
year.
Ferro, which generates annual sales of about Dollars 100m in powder
coatings, said ICI's operations would fit well with its business.
The company said it was in the top three in the world market and already had
some operations in the UK and continental Europe.
ICI insisted yesterday that discussions were at an early stage.
It would be premature to forecast the outcome of the talks, although both
parties were confident that an agreement would be reached.
The value of the transaction is expected to be less than 1 per cent of ICI
group assets.

<TEXT>
HEAVITREE Brewery, the USM-quoted pub operator, reported profits
substantially lower over the 12 months to October 31.
Although turnover improved 34 per cent to Pounds 8.38m (Pounds 6.28m), the
pre-tax line tumbled from Pounds 910,000 to Pounds 560,000.
Directors of the Devon-based group blamed the decline on 'settling down
costs' following the acquisition of its small managed estate and bad debts
which amounted to Pounds 344,000.
Interest charges on loans were 'exceptionally high', they added.
However, a recovery was under way and the recommended final dividend is held
at 2.45p for a maintained total of 3.05p, payable from earnings of 4.2p (8p)
per share.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABTRUST Preferred Investment Trust is attempting to more than double its
size via a placing of ordinary income and zero dividend preference shares
which will raise Pounds 16.4m after expenses.
The new ordinary income shares will be issued at 83p each and if the trust's
assets and income grow at 1 per cent a year, will have a prospective gross
redemption yield of 16.5 per cent.
The new zeros will be placed at 142p, giving a prospective gross redemption
yield of 8.5 per cent. The zeros will be covered 1.22 times by total assets.
The shares have been conditionally placed but existing shareholders will be
entitled to claw them back on a 1-for-1 basis in the case of the zeros and
on a 10-for-9 basis in the case of the ordinary shares.
The board believes that the outlook for low inflation plus recovery in
corporate profits will present profitable opportunities to achieve growth.

SHARES IN Northumbrian Fine Foods, the biscuit and snacks group, were
suspended at the company's request on the USM yesterday as speculation
mounted about the meaning of a statement issued late on Wednesday which
referred to a group reorganisation.
Northumbrian said then it was in discussions which 'are expected to have a
material effect on the group's interim results for the six months to
September 30'. These results were due to be released on Wednesday, but have
been postponed pending conclusion of the discussions.
Northumbrian said it hopes to make a further announcement shortly. There has
been speculation the company is in discussions with its bankers, and is
trying to sell a subsidiary to reduce debt, which stood at Pounds 5.82m at
March 31 last year.
The shares were suspended mid-morning after falling 2p to 17p.

launch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 210p placing price of Motor World, announced yesterday, values the car
parts and accessories retailer at Pounds 27.7m.
Beeson Gregory is placing 5.97m ordinary shares of 20p, representing 45.3
per cent of the company's issued share capital.
Based on its pro forma earnings per share of 16p for the year to November 1,
the p/e multiple is 13.1 and the notional gross dividend yield 4 per cent.
Of the shares placed, 5.95m were new ordinaries and the balance were sold by
existing shareholders. Some Pounds 3.2m of the proceeds will go towards the
redemption of existing preference shares and about Pounds 9m to repay debt.
Dealings are expected to start on February 11.
Motor World grew from one motor accessories shop in Bradford in 1968. It now
has 180 outlets, mainly in the north of England, Wales and the Midlands, and
is planning to build a national network.
Mr Darrell Kershaw, managing director, has said that he believes the chain
could expand to 300 outlets within the next two years.
In the year to November 1 1992, pre-tax profits were Pounds 2.29m (Pounds
1.57m) on turnover of Pounds 34.2m (Pounds 28.7m).

FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: DTI clears Suter chief of insider share
dealing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUTER, the industrial conglomerate, said yesterday that Mr David Abell,
chairman, had been cleared of insider dealing by the DTI.
Mr Nigel Blyth-Tinker, company secretary, said Clifford Chance, Mr Abell's
lawyers, had received confirmation in writing from the DTI that
investigations under section 177 of the Financial Services Act, which
relates to insider dealing, had been completed and the DTI did not intend to
bring any prosecution against Mr Abell.
The DTI refuses publicly to comment on insider dealing investigations and
would not confirm Suter's announcement.
The apparent clearance of Mr Abell comes two weeks after DTI inspectors
found no evidence that he and other parties acted in concert in taking
stakes in a number of companies in the mid-1980s.
However, the inspectors, who were appointed in July 1988, expressed severe
reservations about one of the cases, when Mr Abell acquired 100,000 shares
in Metal Closures, the final purchase being made on January 8 1987. Later on
the same day Mr Abell authorised the purchase on behalf of Suter of 350,000
Metal Closures shares.

FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Allied Leisure falls 25% to Pounds 1.2m and
seeks Pounds 13m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED LEISURE, the nightclub and ten-pin bowling company, yesterday
announced a 25 per cent fall in interim profits together with a Pounds 12.6m
rights issue to finance development of part of a leisure complex on the site
of the old Crystal Palace in south London.
The company is offering 7 new shares for every 10 held at a price of 48p -
10p below Wednesday's closing level. They closed yesterday at 53p.
Pre-tax profits for the 25 weeks ended January 3 fell to Pounds 1.24m
(Pounds 1.65m) on sales up 8 per cent at Pounds 11.5m.
Earnings per share declined to 2.92p (3.69p) and the interim dividend is cut
from 1.5p to 1p.
Mr Richard Carr, chairman, warned at the AGM that the dividend was to be
more conservatively covered by earnings but that the company would maintain
the policy of paying approximately a third of the full year dividend at the
interim stage.
The rights issue is fully underwritten by Williams de Broe but only after
Allied Leisure and Smith New Court, its usual merchant bank, parted company.
Smith and Allied Leisure are understood to have had different ideas about
the timing of the rights issue.
The company is expecting to spend about Pounds 10m on a high capacity night
club and a megabowl. It will become what Mr Carr calls the flagship of the
group.
Initially the rights issue will reduce gearing from about 55 per cent to 15
per cent at the year-end but the development will also depress earnings per
share until the complex is completed in 1995.
Mr Carr said he was comfortable with City forecasts that Allied Leisure
would make pre-tax profits for the year of Pounds 2.6m.

reluctantly recommended a cash offer of 30p per share from Kredietbank
Luxembourgeoise, its 29.8 per cent shareholder.
'Taking into account the on-going interests of the business and the
clientele, I support the solution this offer brings,' said Mr William
Dacombe, the chairman and chief executive appointed 16 months ago to turn
round the troubled group.
The bid values the group at Pounds 4.8m, against net assets of Pounds 8.1m.
Mr Giorgio Rossi, a director and 14 per cent shareholder, resigned from the
board before the bid announcement. Mr Rossi had taken his stake in 1986 when
the share price ranged between 400p and 645p. Last night the shares closed
4p down at 31p.
The sale of the final Brown Shipley businesses has, in effect, been forced
by potential claims of Pounds 2.4m from the Luxembourg bank. These claims
arise from possible liabilities relating to the leasing business sold by
Brown Shipley's banking arm last year.
Kredietbank, when it purchased the banking business last summer, was given
indemnities on the potential liabilit-ies.
The only alternative to a bid from Kredietbank would be to fight the claims.
If unsuccessful, the group's net assets would be reduced to less than the
called up share capital.
Brown Shipley, which has been struggling since suffering heavy losses in the
small companies market three years ago, has progressively sold several
businesses over the last two years.
Mr Dacombe had hoped to rebuild the group on its core investment and
stockbroking operations, which manage some Pounds 2.4bn in discretionary
funds.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hiram Walker, the spirits and wine division of Allied-Lyons, has signed a
long-term agreement for the distribution of Ballantine's Scotch whisky in
Mexico through Pedro Domecq, the Spanish drinks company.
Domecq's Mexican subsidiary is the country's leading spirits company. Its
Presidente brandy alone accounts for about a fifth of the total spirits
market, the second largest in Latin America.
'The Scotch whisky sector is currently quite small but we believe it will
grow very rapidly,' said Mr Tony Hales, Allied's chief executive.
Domecq already distributes Hiram Walker's main brands through a joint
venture in Spain where Ballantine's is the leading Scotch with annual sales
of more than 1m cases.
Last year Allied cemented the partnership by increasing its stake in Domecq
to an effective 32 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Net asset value per share of the TR City of London Trust stood at 125.69p at
the end of December. That compared with 112.8p at the June 1992 year-end and
with 109.55p 12 months earlier.
Available revenue for the half year to December 31 slipped from Pounds 4.42m
to Pounds 3.92m, equal to earnings of 2.01p (2.28p) per share. The fall was
blamed on lower interest received, dividend cuts and an increase in the bias
of dividends accrued towards the second half.
The board confirmed its intention to maintain the full year dividend at
4.76p.

The proposals included an offer of 7.67m new ordinary shares of 1p each and
reorganisation of the existing share capital.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will convert about Pounds 12m of borrowings into

FT  05 FEB 93 / Lord King set to step down from BA today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD KING is expected to announce today that he is stepping down immediately
as chairman of British Airways at a board meeting which will confirm Sir
Colin Marshall as his successor.
Lord King, who will become honorary president of the airline he has chaired
for the past 12 years, was due to retire in July after the company's annual
meeting. But the 75-year-old chairman has decided to leave early to ensure
the continuity of the BA top management succession, which has been shaken by
the company's involvement in a 'dirty tricks' campaign against Virgin
Atlantic, its smaller rival owned by Mr Richard Branson.
Sir Colin, who was recruited by Lord King as chief executive 10 years ago,
is expected to take over immediately as the airline's new executive
chairman. Mr Robert Ayling, head of marketing and operations, will take up a
new post of managing director. Although Sir Colin will be in overall charge,
he will not hold the two titles of chairman and chief executive as
originally planned. However, the board is not expected to appoint a new
chief executive officer, confirming Sir Colin's leadership of the company.
To provide checks and balances within the board as recommended by the
Cadbury Committee on corporate governance, Sir Michael Angus, president of
the Confederation of British Industry, is expected to see his
responsibilities as non-executive deputy chairman strengthened.
Mr David Burnside, BA's director of public affairs, is expected to leave the
company and Mr Peter Jones, senior press officer, is likely to replace him.
After its two public apologies to Mr Branson and a Pounds 610,000 High Court
libel settlement, BA has been anxious to restore internal morale and its
international reputation. However, Virgin is threatening to take further
legal action on anti-trust grounds in the US if it fails to secure
satisfactory compensation from BA for what Virgin claims is the commercial
damage it suffered from the 'dirty tricks'.
Mr Ayling and Mr Syd Pennington, Virgin's managing director, held talks this
week but little progress appears to have been made.
BA is also facing a growing campaign from the big three US carriers -
American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines - which are lobbying
the new US administration to block BA's equity partnership in USAir, the
sixth-largest US airline. In a letter to Mr Federico Pena, the new US
Secretary of Transportation, the chairmen of the big three US carriers
yesterday referred to BA's 'recent admissions of anti-competitive behaviour'
against Virgin as one of the reasons for holding a public inquiry into the
BA-USAir deal.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Retail monarchs in search of global empires: What a
Kingfisher-Darty merger may hold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERGER talks between Kingfisher of the UK and Darty of France, revealed
yesterday, add weight to theories of the increasingly global future for
retailing.
The industry was once seen as a purely domestic one, pandering to national
tastes and habits which might seem odd in others' eyes. Attempts by
successful retailers in one country to translate their formula to another
have often failed.
But there are notable successes, such as the Ikea furniture chain and the
Benetton fashion retailer. Now more retailers are trying to break through
national boundaries. Many continental European retailers have already
crossed borders, although UK groups have taken longer to leap the Channel.
Just before Christmas Tesco, the UK food retailer, paid Pounds 175.6m for
Catteau, a supermarket chain in northern France.
Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman and chief executive of Kingfisher, made it
plain last September that Kingfisher was keen to expand in Europe, and he
clearly believes he can succeed where other UK retailers have failed.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, Kingfisher's corporate affairs director, said yesterday
that 'the object of this deal is to gain a major profile in the single
market'.
The plan is simple. Darty is the leading French electrical retailer, with
130 stores and 12 per cent of the market for white and brown goods. Since
the group's creation in 1957 by the three Darty brothers - Bernard, Nathan
and Claude - the stores, with their distinctive red and black signs and
warehouse-style interiors, have come to dominate the sector.
Darty wants to expand in France and the rest of Europe, but it has been held
back by heavy debt from its 1988 management buy-out. It is battling with new
competitors in electrical retailing, notably the powerful hypermarket groups
such as Carrefour and Promodes.
Like the rest of the French retail sector, Darty has for the past year also
been struggling against the economic slowdown. If anything, the electrical
sector has been harder hit as depressed consumer confidence affected sales
of big-ticket items.
In its last financial year Darty's sales and profits slipped in spite of
opening seven new stores, and at last week's annual general meeting Darty
warned that it would 'find it difficult' to maintain profits this year.
This might make Darty look an unattractive target for Kingfisher. But it has
its problems too. Its failed bid for Dixons in 1990 must have been a warning
to Kingfisher that it was reaching its limit in the UK.
Its talks with various European retailers - its name has been linked with
Castorama, the French do-it-yourself group, and Woolworth in Germany, among
others - have so far come to nothing.
If the purchase of Darty goes through it would open up new horizons for
Kingfisher. Its financial muscle could give Darty the power to expand, while
extending the Kingfisher empire. A tie-up would also give the enlarged group
a much better bargaining position with the suppliers, which are increasingly
multinationals such as Philips-Whirlpool and Bosch-Siemens.
Meanwhile Darty's management skills might be welcome at Comet, Kingfisher's
UK chain and the smallest profit contributor in the group. Darty's margins
are, Mr Whittaker believes, the best of any electrial retailer in Europe or
the US.
This all looks rosy. So is Kingfisher likely to be tempted into overpaying
for Darty? It would not be in Sir Geoffrey's nature to become carried away
by any deal, especially one which has been under discussion in one form or
another over four years.
Further, Kingfisher has clearly done its homework on Darty and is aware of
some bargaining points in its favour.
Darty's need to free itself from its management-buy-out debt is pushing it
either to a merger or a flotation on a stock market unlikely to give a warm
welcome to a retailer.
Kingfisher must also be fully aware of the problems the French retail sector
is suffering, having experienced similar economic conditions in the UK. It
can use forecasts of another sluggish year for the French retail sector in
its bargaining.
In addition, it can point to many other recent French mergers and
acquisitions, such as moves in the hypermarket sector where Carrefour bought
Euromarche and Montlaur, and Casino acquired Rallye. The department store
sector has been shaken up by the takeover of Au Printemps by the Pinault
industrial group. The fall in the pound against the French franc will also
come into the bid equation.
Although neither side will be drawn on the likely value of the deal,
suggestions that Kingfisher would match Darty's stockmarket value of
FFr7.9bn (Pounds 970m) plus its debt, have been implicitly denied. The
figure now being touted is Pounds 1bn, including the debt, although currency
movements and other details yet to be agreed could make a considerable
variation either way.
If the bid is agreed will Kingfisher join the list of successful
international retailers? Mr Whittaker's arguments in favour are that
Kingfisher would be buying a market leader, with growth prospects, and a
management motivated by the terms of the deal to stay with the new owners.
Perhaps most important, Kingfisher will not be trying to export a UK
formula.

FT  05 FEB 93 / KLM plunges as Northwest falls and warns of heavy final
losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines yesterday announced a large increase in
third-quarter net losses and warned of likely substantial losses for the
full year.
The announcement contributed to continued nervousness and uncertainty on the
Dutch stock exchange in a business week that has seen the financial collapse
of DAF, the truck maker now in receivership, and a further worsening in the
liquidity of Fokker, the aircraft manufacturer.
In addition to its third-quarter losses KLM separately announced a decision
to defer acceptance of two aircraft and cancellation of its options on two
Boeing 737s, worth a total Fl 750m. At the same time, it revealed plans to
lay off a further 500 employees.
The increase in KLM's third-quarter losses to Fl 437.8m (Pounds 162m) from
Fl 8.6m, which greatly exceeded analysts' expectations, was largely caused
by operating losses suffered by its US partner, Northwest, amid the American
fare price war. But it also reflects fierce competition, weakening margins,
and sluggish economic activity worldwide.
KLM has taken a substantial third-quarter extraordinary charge of Fl 305m,
thus writing down the remaining book value of its 20 per cent stake in Wings
Holdings, Northwest Airline's parent company, after a total investment of
Dollars 400m since 1989.
KLM's share of Northwest's third-quarter losses were Fl 49.9m, down from Fl
87m. Following the writedown, KLM said that further Northwest losses will no
longer affect its results.
The two airlines will continue with their co-operation pact, announced last
December after KLM contributed Dollars 50m of a Dollars 250m bridging loan
to the financially troubled Northwest. In Europe, negotiations were
continuing between KLM, SAS, Swissair and Austrian Airlines, aimed at
forming a closer relationship.
For the nine months ending December 1992 KLM posted a net loss of Fl 229.3m,
against a profit of Fl 319.8m last time. Interest costs swelled to Fl 265.4m
from Fl 174.5m. KLM's traffic increased 30 per cent, but revenues in the
third quarter remained stagnant.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Japan urged to reform markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE government was urged yesterday by international and domestic
financial institutions to increase the transparency of markets and encourage
competition to ensure the longer-term health of the troubled financial
system.
An industry committee comprised of 22 companies ranging from Barclays Bank
to the Industrial Bank of Japan and Merrill Lynch, the US securities house,
said tight regulation had 'hindered the free play of the market mechanism'
and blocked the entry of new securities products.
The Committee to Make Tokyo Financial Markets More Transparent and
International (CTTI) said the cosy relations between regulators and some
large Japanese institutions have also created a lack of transparency,
leading to inconsistent policy decisions by the Ministry of Finance.
It is intended that the committee's report be used by the Japanese
government as a guide to financial reform.
Professor Kazuo Ueda, the committee's co-ordinator, said the collapse of the
stock market had led to a slowing of liberalisation in Japan, making it
unlikely that there will be quick approval of the changes recommended.
'There will be a long-term negative impact on Japan if nothing changes,' he
said.
Foreign brokers complained that, in other markets, an action is allowed
unless specifically prohibited, while in Japan, an action is not allowed
unless specifically permitted. There was also a general complaint that
unnecessary intervention has severely restricted the growth of the corporate
bond market in Japan.
The CTTI found that only 12 of 25 financial instruments available in the US
and EC are available in Japan, and that the use of administrative guidance
in handling new products leads to 'incongruous treatment of issues and
issuers, with insufficient consideration for the interests of investors'.
There were similar complaints expressed about fund management in Japan.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Swedish company buys 7% of MTM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD Lines, the former chairman of MTM, the specialist chemicals
company, has sold his family's 7 per cent stake to a company advised by Mr
Refaat El-Sayed, who was convicted for fraud in connection with Sweden's
Fermenta scandal.
Mr Lines, who left MTM last year after misleading the City and exaggerating
profits, told the company he and his family had sold its 6.99m shares to AB
Hebi.
The company said AB Hebi had bought the stake in a private deal off the
market and now owned 7.08m shares, equivalent to 7.8 per cent of the
company.
Mr El-Sayed is acting as adviser and consultant to AB Hebi. He said: 'Our
intention is simple, we get the shares and we would like to see what happens
in the future.'
The deal has left City observers baffled. Since the departure of Mr Lines,
MTM's share price has fallen from nearly 300p to a close of 14.5p yesterday.
Mr Ken Schofield, the new MTM chief executive, has revised plans to
refinance the company's Pounds 120m debt through a rights issue. The company
has net assets of about Pounds 15m.
MTM is now understood to be approaching its bankers to seek a
debt-for-equity swap before the end of March when its banking facilities
expire. Such a refinancing, if successful, would dilute existing
shareholders, now including Mr El-Sayed.
AB Hebi described its interest in MTM as a friendly trade investment. The
company has investments in Sweden in the pharmaceutical industry and in
healthcare product companies.
Mr El-Sayed declared bankruptcy after being ousted from Fermenta AB, the
Swedish industrial and biotechnology group which collapsed under the weight
of its debt burden in 1987. He was charged with insider trading and selling
Fermenta shares before a negative report about the company appeared in 1986.
Mr El-Sayed still protests his innocence. He was convicted and released from
jail in May last year.
Since leaving his chairman's seat, Mr Lines has set up business in the same
office in Stockton-on-Tees from which he started to build MTM into one of
the stock market's most rapidly-growing stocks, with a market capitalisation
at its peak of more than Pounds 250m.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Shares rise worldwide on revival hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH

<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES that the surprise cut in German interest rates will help revive the
fragile European economy pushed up share prices on most world markets
yesterday.
It lifted share prices in the US, where investors see a strengthening of
America's economic revival by increased demand for its exports. On Wall
Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record 3,416.74, up
42.95.
The Bundesbank's move quelled fears that the European exchange rate might be
in for another turbulent period after last weekend's forced devaluation of
the Irish punt.
The most immediate gainers were the Danish krone and the French franc
following a rush of funds out of D-Marks. Both the Danish and French
currencies had, until yesterday, been pinned relatively close to their ERM
floors by the strong D-Mark.
Sterling, which has been steadily losing ground since last week's base rate
cut, gained sharply against the D-Mark. By last night the system's hard core
currencies - the D-Mark, French franc and the Benelux currencies - were all
trading close to one another in the ERM grid. However there was some
disappointment at the relatively small cut.
The European bond markets showed little change on the day, although German
government bonds finished slightly lower. The best performers included the
Milan and Paris bourses, both of which gained about 1.5 per cent, while the
German rate cut move triggered an after-hours trading flurry on the
Frankfurt exchange.
The London stock market reacted cautiously. The FT-SE 100 index of leading
shares gained 26 points before the Bundesbank announcement to reach a high
of 2,900.1, the first time the index had breached the 2,900 mark. But the
index slipped back to a close of 2,865.9, down 7.9 on the day, after
widespread profit-taking.
The FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index, which tracks prices of leading company shares
across Europe, closed below the day's highs at 1,113.35, for a gain of
16.32.
Sterling rose to DM2.395 immediately after the Bundesbank announcement,
closing in London slightly lower at DM2.39 for an overall gain of 3 pfennigs
on the day. The pound closed against the dollar at Dollars 1.445, just over
1 cent up on the day. In New York sterling closed at DM2.3897 and Dollars
1.4415.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Tory rebels may back pits plan: Policy saving 12-14 coal
mines could win backbench support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, MICHAEL SMITH and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT may be able to secure backbench support for an energy policy
which saved well under half the threatened 31 coal pits, it emerged
yesterday.
A series of telephone interviews with the most likely Tory backbench rebels
indicated that, while a wide range of views is held, a plan which spared
between 12 and 14 pits would be likely to keep the government out of the
danger area.
The findings came as delegates at a special conference of the National Union
of Mineworkers agreed unanimously to hold a ballot on March 5, in
conjunction with rail workers, with a recommendation to stage a 24-hour
strike as part of a 'rolling programme' of industrial action.
Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM president, said miners were asking the government to
accept the logic of their case and keep open all 31 pits. 'There is no
logical reason for closing any one of the 31 collieries,' he said.
Separately, Mr Stephen Littlechild, electricity industry regulator,
expressed strong opposition to proposals to enlarge the market for coal by
delaying liberalisation of the electricity market next year.
Postponement of the plans would mean that regional electricity companies
would not have to compete with each other for the custom of about 45,000
medium to large customers. They would thus be more sure of the electricity
they could sell and would be able to buy more coal on long-term contracts.
A delay is among the most attractive options open to the government, even
though it would upset free market supporters on the back benches.
Mr Littlechild's opposition is one more complication for the government as
it struggles to complete the work for its white paper on energy. Mr Michael
Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, has previously said he would
publish the white paper as soon as possible this month but it is unlikely
that this will be next week and the last week in the month looks
increasingly likely.
It is thought that the Department of Trade and Industry has largely decided
on the policies it wants to adopt.
However, the fine detail is still being worked on and a series of
consultations with potential dissident members of parliament, the industries
affected and European Community officials is likely before the DTI puts a
final plan to the cabinet.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Nestle job sweetener in Dijon is a bitter taste for Glasgow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIJON is getting its own back on Glasgow. In an ironic reversal of Hoover's
switch of jobs from the French town to Glasgow, another multinational is to
close the bulk of its Scottish plant and indirectly move jobs to Dijon.
Nestle Rowntree, the Swiss-owned food conglomerate, said yesterday it would
close the chocolate bar production part of its plant in Glasgow over the
next two years with the loss of 550 jobs. The production of its Breakaway
and Blue Riband brands will be relocated to the company's Fawdon plant near
Newcastle upon Tyne.
As a result, the company will move UK production of its Lion bar from
Newcastle upon Tyne to its new Dijon plant where the European production of
Lion will be concentrated on a large, technically advanced production line.
Nestle Rowntree said it would look for a buyer for the 140-year-old Glasgow
plant, which would continue to make Gray Dunn chocolate biscuits. If a buyer
could not be found, the plant would be closed. The announcement came less
than a fortnight after Hoover's decision to shut its Dijon vacuum cleaner
plant and shift production to Glasgow.
Union leaders in Scotland last night denounced the Nestle Rowntree move as a
political manoeuvre to placate the French.
'I would need a lot of convincing that this is pure coincidence,' said Mr
John Glass, deputy divisional officer in Glasgow of the Union of Shop,
Distributive and Allied Workers, whose members will lose jobs as a result of
the Nestle Rowntree plant closure.
Mr Mick Casey, a company spokesman said: 'I cannot stress strongly enough
that there have been no political trade-offs. The Dijon connection is pure
coincidence. We have to make our products as competitively as possible.'
A spokesman for the parent company in Switzerland said: 'We are not in
business to satisfy the national ego of anybody. We are here to make money.'
He added that the decision to close the Glasgow plant originated in 1990
when the company closed its Noisiel plant outside Paris and moved to Dijon
to 'take advantage of economies of scale'.
Nestle Rowntree will shortly announce that it is moving the production of
Quality Street chocolate from Dijon to Halifax in the west riding of
Yorkshire. The company insists there will be no overall loss of jobs in the
complex shifting of production.
Mr Glass said the union was told of the Glasgow closure in a letter at 2pm
yesterday. 'There is no justifiable reason for closing the Glasgow plant. We
intend to fight it all the way,' he said.
Mr Graham Millar, the company's UK managing director, said: 'Everyone at
Glasgow has worked extremely hard to try to ensure the factory's viability
but Nestle Rowntree has to remain competitive and that means fully utilising
our more modern facilities at other locations.'
Nestle Rowntree will provide Pounds 250,000 in assistance to help their
Glasgow workers who are to lose their jobs.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Daf plan excludes UK plants: Dutch and Belgian operations
could form new company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DUTCH and Belgian operations of Daf, western Europe's sixth largest
truck manufacturer, may be demerged into a specially created company,
financed by local banks and the Dutch government, according to senior
bankers.
The UK operations would not be transferred to the new company. Much of UK
operating capacity, which employs 5,500 people, could close.
Bankers said yesterday that the main truck plant at Leyland in Lancashire
may be sold to management, but that the Birmingham van plant and the Glasgow
axle plant were at risk.
They added that Daf's administrators working under Dutch insolvency law,
together with local bankers and government officials, were working on the
demerger proposal.
It also emerged yesterday that before seeking bankruptcy protection on
Tuesday, Daf had been planning to withdraw from all van manufacturing. The
Birmingham van plant employs 2,000 people.
Under the original restructuring plan, Daf would have concentrated on the
manufacture of heavy and medium-sized trucks. It would have attempted to
find a partner for the manufacture of light trucks, at present assembled at
the Leyland plant with 2,200 employees.
Bankers said yesterday they believed MAN of Germany was the best partner for
Daf in light trucks and hoped that talks between the two companies could be
pursued.
Daf's restructuring plan was based in part on an investigation by the
management consulting firm AD Little, backed up by financial estimates from
accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
A confidential study by Coopers estimated that Daf's losses in 1992 were
more than Fl 800m (Pounds 296m). This included a Fl 580m provision to cover
restructuring costs.
Coopers and Daf also estimated that Daf needed to raise finance of Fl 800m
in 1993, followed by Fl 500m the following year and Fl 250m in 1995.
These funds would have had to be provided by the company's banks, its
holders of preference shares and debentures, together with the Dutch
government and the Flemish regional authorities.
Any demerger would need to be approved by the group's banks, principally a
consortium of nine led by the Dutch bank, ABN Amro, which is the biggest
lender to Daf.
A formal proposal should be put in the next three weeks, a banker said.
Daf confirmed yesterday that it had received a short-term bridging loan from
its banks and the Dutch government to allow it to continue trading for a
month. It has received a loan of more than Fl 100m, including Fl 60m from
the banking consortium.

While the 0.75 percentage point cut in Japan's discount rate was no
surprise, the authorities must be disappointed that the stock market
actually fell on the news. Shares had rallied ahead of the announcement, but
the equity market's lack of enthusiasm reflects more than cynicism over a
stage-managed event. The recession has prompted a larger cut than the Bank
of Japan previously wanted. Yet given the debt overhang from the 'bubble'
years, lower interest rates will take a long time to revive the economy.
Even the expected second supplementary budget in May may not have much
immediate impact.
With the Nikkei trading at around 55 times this year's earnings, shares look
expensive. The market is trapped in a narrow range with government-sponsored
pension fund purchases on one side and almost everyone else on the other.
There is little to break the impasse, though the approach of the financial
year-end in March may tempt those companies with long term shareholdings to
flatter this year's profits with some judicious sales.
If the government does manage to hold the line, few will be tempted into the
stock market. Individuals are still nursing large losses; institutions are
seeking yield and security. Those prepared to look beyond the current
recession see a period of slower growth in Japan. As Japan's economic
prospects start to mirror the rest of the industrial world, its share
ratings may have to follow.

The Bundesbank clearly wrestled with its conscience to come up with
yesterday's discount and Lombard rate cuts, but there is no escaping the
importance of the signal it has sent to the markets. As with last month's
decision to trim its money market repurchase rate, it has shown that, in the
last resort, it will act to preserve the integrity of the ERM. Since
yesterday's decision was unexpected by the foreign exchange markets, it is
also an admission that the speculative attack on the Danish krone earlier in
the week constituted a serious threat to the system as a whole.
With the Bundesbank in this mood, it will be difficult for speculators to
justify renewed attacks. That does not mean ERM countries can feel
comfortable with their lot. The half point cut in the Lombard rate is
largely meaningless; it simply allows the rate to catch up with falls in
money market rates that have already taken place. The substantial move is
the quarter point cut in the discount rate. That leaves other European
countries scant leeway to cut their rates. It must look particularly
niggardly in France where real short-term interest rates are roughly 10 per
cent.
To bolster Europe's economic prospects much larger cuts are needed. One has
to hope domestic developments will soon allow the Bundesbank to be less
cautious. The fear is that budget deficit worries, and the strength of the
dollar, may slow the pace of future cuts. If the Bundesbank continues only
to give just enough ground to hold the ERM together, the deflationary agony
of its ERM partners will simply be prolonged.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Personal View: Family emergency at heart of the UN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS HINTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a crisis in the international system for responding to humanitarian
emergencies. To put it bluntly, when famine strikes, when conflict creates
catastrophe, when refugees flee in large numbers, the international
community cannot cope.
From the Iraqi Kurds, to the former Yugoslavia, to Somalia, humanitarian
crises have provoked an important debate about the role and development of
the United Nations. Yet that debate has covered every area except the one
most relevant to humanitarian emergencies - the role of the UN's internal
'family' of technical agencies.
All too often, the response of these agencies has been slow, bureaucratic
and lacking in co-ordination. In the worst cases, they have been fatefully
negligent. The recent history of the Horn of Africa provides several
examples. When famine hit Ethiopia in 1984, for instance, there were hardly
any contingency food stocks in place, because the UN agencies had ignored
the previous year's warnings of impending shortage.
In 1988, when refugees from Siad Barre's brutal bombing of northern Somalia
arrived in Ethiopia, their presence went undisclosed by local UN officials.
Many died before, in the wake of donor pressure, the UN began to give aid.
Then, in 1991, the sight of the Iraqi Kurds perishing on mountain sides, and
the delays and mistakes that characterised that relief operation, finally
moved the UN and its member states to make cautious reforms. However,
following the deaths of hundreds of thousands in the Somalian famine, these
measures stand exposed as woefully ineffective.
It is the UN agencies' inability to deliver that is at the heart of their
failures, not a lack of resources. Unicef, the children's fund, has a
Dollars 755m budget. UNHCR, which deals with refugees, had around Dollars
550m in 1990. UNDP, which has a brief of development but which often finds
itself involved in emergency relief, had Dollars 1.4bn last year; and the
World Food Programme (WFP) can dispose of the same amount in a two-year
period.
It is this scale of resources, coupled with their status in the
international system, that makes the UN agencies the pivotal element in the
response to emergencies. When an emergency hits a developing country, the
first line of defence is that country's own skilled workers - its doctors,
nurses, engineers and public administrators. But if the country or the
affected region is already poor, they may be overwhelmed.
International non-governmental organisations can play a part in 'supporting'
them, but cannot step in to save whole countries or regions from disaster.
In a large-scale emergency it is normal to look to the UN agencies for the
requisite scale of relief supplies, logistical capacity and expertise.
The member states of the UN have a right to ask whether they are getting
value for the money.
Save The Children, which was closely involved in the emergencies discussed
above, believes that a thoroughgoing review of the functions of the UN
technical agencies is urgently required.
First, the mandates of these agencies should be re-examined. They were
drafted, in many cases, more than 40 years ago, to cover the needs of the
cold war era. They need updating both to incorporate increased understanding
of the complex causes and dynamics of emergencies, and to cope with an era
that, for many parts of the developing world, will bring insecurity,
instability and dwindling resources.
Second, co-ordination must be made paramount. The clutter of overlapping
responsibilities within the UN system must be cleared away. A single agency
should be given the clear lead role in emergencies, and the UN enabled to
act as an effective umbrella for the efforts of all workers involved.
Third, accountability must be introduced. All too often, failures are
covered over, while those who voice criticism to try to improve things are
disciplined or discarded.
Fourth, none of the above measures will have an effect unless the practical
performance of the agencies in emergencies can be improved and confidence
restored to the donors. This means, for example, ensuring that important
posts are filled with people of proper competence as leaders and managers.
It also means allowing much more autonomy to the good and experienced staff
on the ground.
Finally, UN member states must recognise their own responsibility, not only
to instigate reform, but to push it along through any obstacles, and to
oversee the continuing performance of the technical agencies.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Financial therapy for a mid-life crisis: The Japanese
government is confident of economic recovery, but adjustment could be
painful and protracted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The heyday of the Japanese economic miracle is over. The days when Japan's
financiers, manufacturers and retailers could revel in an economy growing at
more than 4 per cent a year have gone, perhaps for good. Japan has become a
mature economy.
Mr Naohiro Amaya, a former vice-minister at the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry, one of the architects of Japan's success, puts it this
way. 'Japan is particularly susceptible to the Peter Pan syndrome. Even
though the economy is now adult, many people behave as if we are a child.'
Mr Amaya believes the Japanese economy is beginning a long period of
adjustment during which it will grow only slowly, a period which could last
until the late 1990s.
The economy's main growth industries, cars and electronics, are facing a
sharp fall in demand which is forcing them to reconsider their traditional
high-growth strategies. The Japanese banks are burdened by bad debts which
will take several years to clear. The nation's service sector is facing its
first recession. Japanese consumer spending is flat after the conspicuous
consumption of the 1980s.
If this view proves accurate then yesterday's 0.75 point cut in the official
discount rate, to the historic low of 2.5 per cent, may not revive the
economy, which the government forecasts will grow by only 1.6 per cent in
the year to March, down from 5 per cent two years ago.
Yet such opinion is in the minority amid the optimism which rules in most
government departments and financial institutions.
The optimists argue that Japan is going through a cyclical downturn after
the collapse of the speculative bubble economy of 1987 to 1989 when credit
was cheap and share prices, land values and profits soared to record highs.
Once demand recovers, fuelled by low interest rates and public spending, the
optimists believe the economy should grow, from this autumn, by more than 3
per cent a year.
The next six months will show whether Japan is going to bounce back after
recession or whether the economy needs structural reform over several years.
The restructuring of the Japanese economy in the wake of the first oil shock
in 1973 took four years. Will it take that long this time?
The government is confident the economy will escape the need for
root-and-branch reform, largely because it is engaged in an ambitious effort
to shore it up. The interest rate cut is part of that effort.
By itself the discount rate cut will only have a limited impact on the
economy. The biggest beneficiaries will be Japan's hard-pressed banks, which
are facing mounting bad debts from speculative property lending. Lower
official interest rates will reduce the cost of their borrowing from the
Bank of Japan and so allow them to widen profit margins.
Yet even with the discount rate at an all-time low it is unlikely that the
cut alone will revive consumer spending or investment. Corporate investment
is being cut sharply. This is because many industries have excess capacity
as investments planned in the late 1980s come on stream at a time when
demand is depressed.
Japanese households are such prodigious savers that their income from
savings is more than twice their interest payments on borrowings. The cut in
rates may discourage them from saving more, but it will also reduce
disposable income.
But more support for the economy is on the way, in the shape of public
spending and tax cuts. The Y10,700bn (Pounds 60bn) emergency spending
package approved by parliament last autumn is only just filtering through
into the economy.
This year's budget, which increases overall spending by about 7 per cent, is
due to be approved next month. A task force from the ruling Liberal
Democratic party is drawing up plans for another emergency package, worth
perhaps Y4,000bn and probably including tax cuts, to be announced this
spring.
Mr Robert Feldman, chief economist at Salomon Bros, the US stockbroker,
believes this fiscal push is so large it will eventually revive consumption.
The growth rate of personal consumption has halved from 2.6 per cent in 1991
to about 1.3 per cent this year.
According to Mr Feldman, the foundations for a consumer-led recovery are in
place. Unemployment is still only 2.4 per cent, employment is still growing,
albeit slowly, and compensation per employee is likely to rise this year by
between 3 per cent and 4 per cent. He believes consumer spending should grow
by close to 3 per cent this year, about the level of the mid-1980s. That
should allow the economy to grow by 3 per cent this year and next.
The equation may not be that simple. First, there are doubts about whether
consumption will respond to the fiscal stimulus.
This year's fall in consumer spending has mystified economists, mainly
because the labour market remains tight and household finances are
relatively healthy. Some observers attribute the decline to a shift in
tastes and attitudes. After the spending spree of the late 1980s many
Japanese are going back to basics - simpler products which give value for
money. The markets for electronics and cars are saturated after high growth
in the late 1980s.
A second obstacle to recovery may be structural problems in finance and
industry. Most Japanese corporations are facing a fourth year of declining
profits. A recovery in corporate earnings is vital to fund renewed
investment. But profits will only recover if Japanese companies tackle their
costs, which grew rapidly in the 1980s.
The tight profit margins at many Japanese companies leave them vulnerable to
a slight fall in sales. This is because their fixed costs and wage bills
grew rapidly in the 1980s.
'Restructuring based on squeezing or reducing personnel costs is an urgent
priority. In some cases survival is at stake,' says the Japan Research
Institute, a private sector research group. Cost reductions on the required
scaled could take years, given the constraints of Japan's lifetime
employment system.
The financial sector is in no better shape. The banks are facing mounting
bad debts which could come to more than Y50,000bn, equivalent to about 12
per cent of gross national product. While they are trying to reduce their
bad debts, lending could be curbed. Low bank lending is one of the main
factors behind the recent unprecedented contraction of the money supply. So
if consumption does start to pick up, a recovery might be stifled by the
banks' inability to lend to promote growth.
One further uncertainty clouds the economic outlook. While the optimistic
outlook prevails in government and the bureaucracy, there is some
disagreement about how to respond to the downturn. The Bank of Japan only
agreed to the discount rate cut after the Ministry of Finance and the LDP
exerted pressure.
More important, there is no agreement over the strategic aim of economic
policy. LDP leaders want a strong recovery to secure victory in a general
election due by spring next year. They also want to head off American calls
for Japan to reduce its rising trade surplus by delivering higher Japanese
growth.
But some senior officials at the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance
believe the high growth and cheap credit of the 1980s disguised and delayed
the need for long-term restructuring to adjust to slower growth. As one
finance ministry official puts it: 'Companies made huge profits in the late
1980s, they should suffer some pain now. We have to learn that we are not
like Korea; we are not a developing nation any more; we have to slow down.'
But the longer the slowdown lasts, the more likely it is that Japan will be
in for a painful, wrenching period of restructuring, which could last into
the second half of the decade.

The mooted Anglo-French wedding between retailers Kingfisher and Darty has
run into problems already. While Kingfisher's statement merely mentioned
'discussions', Darty's went further and said the talks concerned a
'rapprochement'.
The British news services checked their dictionaries, translated the word as
a 'link-up', and rumours that Kingfisher was merely discussing taking a
stake in Darty started to spread. In the end Darty had to swallow its pride
and admit that its 'rapprochement' was more akin to the Anglo-Saxon
definition of the word takeover. Didn't Yves Saint-Laurent use the same
linguistic ploy before it was gobbled up by Sanofi?

In the way that accountants know best, Touche Ross has hit back at a group
of disgruntled creditors to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, whose cheerleader is Keith Vaz MP. Vaz had called for the
removal of partners in the firm as liquidators to the bank, criticised their
fees, the pace and the small size of the payout.
But in rigorous bean-counter fashion, Touche has retorted that without Vaz's
vacillations, payouts would already have commenced, and would have been
gathering Dollars 1m a week in interest. Thanks to the complainers, Touche
has been forced to call a creditors' meeting in Wembley stadium at a
staggering cost of Pounds 900,000.
Meanwhile, the firm insists that it is not still charging Pounds 1m a week
in fees, as Vaz alleges - just a modest Pounds 700,000.

Bad news for all of you who thought the dispute over the ownership of the
Falkland Islands had gone away. In fact it's set fair to return as a
diplomatic nightmare as we approach the millennium, thanks to that cause of
many past conflicts, oil.
A Falkland Islands' councillor, Terry Peck, has just sent an open letter to
certain British MPs complaining that the British government has failed to
provide a 'letter of comfort' to the oil industry; this would have confirmed
to the industry that a Pounds 6m oil exploration survey being conducted
around the islands would be just the first step to full exploitation.
The letter says: 'The lack of action stems from the reluctance of ministers
to face Argentina on this issue. . . . The Argentine government has already
written twice to oil companies claiming sovereignty over the areas
concerned. Britain has done nothing to counter these claims.'
Goodness knows what might happen were oil actually to be found.

Poor old Wolfgang Botsch. The newly-appointed German minister of posts and
telecommunications, has only been in office for 10 days and he gets to hold
his first big press conference to announce the licence for the new German
cellular telephone network.
Other ministers would fight for a chance to please the electorate by
announcing a deal promising 8,000 new jobs in the depths of a recession. But
it wasn't such a jolly affair for Wolfgang because he had to choose a
consortium from outside his home state of Bavaria. His home team, the
Munich-based BMW and MAN, came a sorry second.
Botsch, who used to be parliamentary leader of the Bavaria-based Christian
Social Union, bent over backwards to explain his decision to his home crowd
 -not least that the decision was as good as made before he got near his
office.
The minister cited endless experts who backed his decision - no less than 50
from outside, and 80 inside the ministry. But that won't convince his more
parochial fans.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Observer: Who governs the BA board?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Today's meeting of the British Airways board will not be the last word in
good corporate governance if all it does is confirm Sir Colin Marshall as
executive chairman and promote Robert Ayling, a relatively inexperienced
ex-civil servant, to be his number two.
A swift glance at the annual report shows that BA's board would almost
certainly fail the spirit if not the letter of Sir Adrian Cadbury's
corporate governance report. It badly needs beefing-up.
True, non-executive directors are in a majority. But on paper, at least, the
current board doesn't look as well-balanced as it was when Lord King led BA
into the private sector six years ago. Then there were powerful figures,
such as Kleinwort's Bobbie Henderson and ex-Cadbury Schweppes boss Basil
Collins, to keep a check on Lord King and Sir Colin.
Today, BA has two conventional non-execs in the form of CBI president Sir
Michael Angus and Michael Davies, deputy chairman of TI. Lord White, Lord
Hanson's US-based partner, and Hanson director Charlie Price, a former US
ambassador to Britain, are somewhat less conventional.
The strong Hanson connection in BA's boardroom (Lord King and Lord Hanson
also go back a long way) may be helpful for doing deals and calling in
political favours. But the corporate governance lobby would query the wisdom
of having two non-execs from the same stable.
Given that Lord White is 70 in May and Michael Davies has been on the board
for a decade, the BA boardroom could benefit from an injection of some fresh
outside blood. It shouldn't be hard to find able candidates - after all, one
of the perks is free first-class travel around the globe.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Leading Article: On workfare
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS nothing like a large budget deficit to focus the minds of
politicians on how to constrain the government's welfare spending. Even at
the best of times, societies cannot prosper if large and growing sections of
the population subsist on state handouts. Mr Major is right to ask whether
paying benefits 'without offering or requiring any activity in return' is in
the interests of either society or welfare dependents.
The prime minister is not alone in wanting to find ways to sharpen
incentives for people to move from welfare dependency into employment,
although the end of a lingering recession may not be the most politic time
to voice the issue. President Bill Clinton has also talked of extending the
scope of workfare schemes, which require unemployed US welfare recipients of
working age, the large majority of whom are female single parents, to
participate in community work or training schemes, in return for more
generous benefits.
Nor, despite yesterday's howls of anguish from opposition front-benchers and
trade union leaders, will Labour be able to avoid confronting the fiscal and
political difficulties which welfare-dependency throws up. Labour's Social
Justice Commission will inevitably spend the next 18 months trying to find
creative ways to attack poverty and spread opportunity against the
electorate's desire not to pay higher taxes in order to fund universal and
non-conditional benefits.
Yet proponents of compulsion must ensure that their schemes have the
intended effects. Here the US experience spins a cautionary tale. While
workfare has been the chosen method for encouraging welfare mothers back to
work, unemployed American men without children receive little or no welfare
support at all after the first six months of unemployment. The consequence
is not a markedly higher employment rate among US men than in those European
countries where unemployment benefits last indefinitely. Instead a growing
minority of US men, particularly young blacks with poor educational
qualifications, have chosen black market activities or crime over poorly
paid employment.
Nor has the UK been immune from the effects of rising crime and drug use
among the young unemployed as their relative wages have fallen and access to
state benefits has been restricted. Linking benefits to participation in
public works schemes for a nominal financial reward risks pushing more young
British men out of legal society into crime.
The solution to the growing number of welfare dependents must, instead,
involve some combination of better training schemes, the removal of tax and
benefit obstacles to part-time employment and recruitment subsidies for
hard-to-employ groups such as the young long-term unemployed. Only if
attractive opportunities are provided does the government have a good case
for compelling its citizens to accept them.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Housing policy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSING associations have been at the forefront of the government's strategy
for providing affordable homes for rent. They have shown themselves to be
flexible, efficient and responsive landlords - unlike many of the local
authorities they have supplanted. They have also been imaginative
developers, raising the quality of social housing, and financing an
increasing proportion of the cost by raising funds on the capital markets.
It is surprising, therefore, that the government should be planning to cut
its funding to housing associations. Following the Autumn Statement, the
grant paid to associations is to be reduced from 72 per cent of the cost of
each new home to 55 per cent by 1995. This means that the proportion of the
cost which must be raised privately will rise from 28 per cent to 45 per
cent, a step which could undo much of the good work associations have done.
The first problem this causes will be in raising the private finance needed
to complement government grant. It is unlikely that institutional investors
will be prepared to provide the balance of 45 per cent of the cost against
the security of a tenanted home. The Housing Corporation, the quango which
supervises the housing associations, believes that only the most financially
sound associations will then be able to borrow on the capital markets. It
therefore proposes to reduce the number of associations which receive
government grant for development from over 600 to under 100.
This reduction in the number of associations building new homes is
undesirable. It will concentrate development among a few 'premier league'
associations, contrary to the government's aim of breaking up large social
landlords. It will also exclude the smaller specialist associations which
have catered successfully for students, single people and ethnic minorities.
Even more undesirable, however, will be the dramatic rises in rents needed
to service the higher level of private funding. These rents will be beyond
the means of low-income families unless they are on benefits. Housing
association estates will become welfare ghettos, recreating the worst
aspects of council estates that associations were supposed to avoid.
Worse, the government could find that the savings from the cuts in grant are
wiped out by the additional housing benefit. That could lead to pressure to
cut housing benefit, which might leave some tenants unable to pay the rent.
Housing associations would then be further destabilised, while investors
would be even less willing to invest in social housing.
It is not too late to avoid these outcomes. The reduction in grant is to be
phased in over three years. The government should reconsider its plans, and
think again about cuts which could reduce the quality of social housing and
recreate the sort of no-hope council estates which housing policy has
rightly sought to eliminate.

THE BUNDESBANK'S decision to cut German interest rates yesterday was, in the
words of Mr Jacques Delors, a good political signal. But it was a singularly
confusing economic one, coming after hawkish rhetoric from Bundesbank
president Mr Helmut Schlesinger. Earlier this week he declared that talk of
persistently high interest rate policy in Germany 'was the idle chatter of
ignoramuses'. It was a tenable view on Monday, and would have looked no less
tenable today without the unexpected cuts.
While the German economy is stagnating, it is far from clear that inflation
has peaked. Mr Helmut Kohl's solidarity deal with employers, unions and the
state governments is not yet in the bag. The long end of the D-Mark bond
market was not unnerved by this loosening of policy, but the Federation of
German Chambers of Commerce attacked the move, worrying that price stability
might become the victim of political expediency. This is not an extreme view
in Germany.
The Bundesbank's action bears all the hallmarks of a hard-fought compromise.
And this is, indeed, a battle in which the stakes are exceptionally high.
After the speculative attack on the Danish krone and against a background of
growing pressure on the French banking system, a cut of half a point in the
Lombard rate and quarter of a point in the discount rate offers an immediate
reprieve for the exchange rate mechanism and for its harder-pressed members.
It also keeps alive, for the moment, the hope that monetary union has a
future. But the relief, however welcome for the rest of Europe, is likely to
be short term.
The Bundesbank has been prepared to accommodate pressure in the ERM before.
But it still seems implausible that a body that has always made domestic
economic conditions the primary focus of monetary policy will now emerge as
a D-Mark lender of last resort to this semi-fixed exchange rate system. Even
after the Bundesbank's modest gesture in the direction of interest rate
disarmament, the French economy continues to suffer from phenomenally high
real rates of interest and rising unemployment. And the franc still has to
cope with considerable political uncertainty before and after the French
elections in March.
As the strains within the ERM fail to go away, the search for scapegoats is
becoming more noisy. Yet there is little point attacking the speculators
when they are doing no more than highlighting inconsistencies of policy. The
Germans mishandled unification; and the French commitment to the franc fort
has meant that adjustment to the resulting shock has had to be taken in the
real economy. To blame the currency markets is to shoot the messenger. Since
there are unquestionably more messages in the pipeline, it would be helpful
if the policy lesson were firmly grasped now.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Corny to the core, and wet behind the ears, this new rock musical might just
become a hit. No, there is not an original bone in its body - but not a mean
one either. And almost half its rock songs have an expansively lyrical
instinct that is appealing. The music and lyrics are by Rick Fenn and Peter
Howarth, and almost every song is well delivered. Bill Kenwright's staging
puts music and characters first, without any flash scenic effects. And -
another plus - Robin, Marion and the Sheriff are all good-looking.
Still, this is a wholly formulaic show. And you know the formula - it is
Lloyd Webber's. You mix idealism (feared by the bad, loved by the good,
Robin Hood), romance (Maid Marion), crooks (the Sheriff) and comedy (Friar
Tuck). You tell it with plenty of tongue-in-cheek anachronisms (the outlaws
click their fingers and put on shades to sing their 'Hanging Around'
number). And you go overboard on pastiche; the authors of Robin, Prince of
Sherwood mean to remind you of songs from Presley down to Whitney Houston.
If Robin, Prince of Sherwood fails, it will be because it has not followed
the prescription well enough. It does not make enough of its story's
suspense; or of Maid Marian; or of Robin's idealistic cause. (Instead, in an
effort to create some cynical rock fun, it links the Sheriff to the
she-devil Morgana.) Early on, a crusaders' song erroneously makes Richard
the Lionheart also ruler of Scotland, Wales and Ireland ('It's us lot that
make Britain great'): does this mean to have its tongue in its cheek or not?
As for Robin's words, they only stop being corny when they are blatantly
anachronistic. 'Nottingham' rhymes with both 'dan' and 'flame,' "Morgana'
with both 'Indiana (Jones)' and 'Copacabana (Club).' Get the idea? Lloyd
Webber would have more sheer nerve; nor would he have handled so predictable
a subject. But with the outlaws' 'Hanging Around' number the audience at
last can relax and have an intermittently good time. Fenn and Howarth know
how to write ensembles - how to build a vocal fabric from differing layers
of melody and rhythm. The big number - 'Call Me Robin Hood' - has only one
big line, but that makes its effect potently, like a wave crashing. And a
little adjustment would actually help other numbers to work better. (The
outlaws' 'The lights grow dim' needs less Caribbean 4/6 accompaniment
beneath it, and more powerful singing from Little John in his big arching
entry.)
As Robin, Mike Holloway has looks and voice; he carries the show. I wish,
though, that he led it more like an actor who believed in the world onstage,
less like a cute TV compere. Peter Howarth not only co-wrote Robin, he also
plays the Sheriff. He carries his cuteness with properly melodramatic Mad
Max flair, but I don't care for a crook who is less interested in bashing
the poor than in diabolism. And surely it would be better to have a baddie
who sang in a plainly lower register than Robin? Richard the Lionheart is a
dud.
Yes, anyone can see the many ways in which Robin Prince of Sherwood could
easily be better; and no-one who likes theatre to be spontaneous and
persuasive will go near it anyway. Yet it really let actors sing. Full of
holes, but full of beans.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Arts: Lott sings Poulenc - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Felicity Lott and Graham Johnson, her regular piano partner, gave on Tuesday
a Wigmore Hall recital devoted entirely to the songs of Francis Poulenc.
This is perhaps a braver enterprise than at first glance it might appear.
For while the world is filled with Poulenc-lovers - people convinced that
his body of melodies comprises some of the richest, most vital and most
'personal' song-writing this century - there are also others who simply fail
to 'get' him.
In a recital presented as this one was - chronologically (songs from 1918 to
1961) - the programme was varied with highest expertise. And yet it did run
an inevitable risk that the relatively small musical range within which
Poulenc worked might be underlined - not to mention his adherence to a
relatively small number of 'manners' (surreal-skittish, rueful-nostalgic,
sly-witty) and even the personal tics (melting cadences, final-phrase use of
upward-rising intervals) that can seem like mannerisms.
Poulenc is not performer-proof. Style, carefully developed but lightly worn,
is therefore of the essence in showing off in the best possible light the
variety, emotional warmth and sheer delicacy of his songs. In this concert
the style was caught, the light trained, with absolute mastery: I thought it
one of the most perfectly planned and executed recitals I have ever been
privileged to attend.
Lott and Johnson were giving it at the close of a European tour (which
included a Paris concert apparently rapturously acclaimed), and by Tuesday
evening both had absorbed into their artistic fabric every note and word.
The sense of rapport, of subliminal give-and-take that informed every
song-performance went worlds beyond the usual well-prepared recital
experience.
It was a concert in which platform demeanour - the soprano a figure of
extraordinary chic a l'anglaise dressed by Givenchy - was made one of the
interpretative weapons. But never too prominently: the raising of an eyebrow
or the flick of the wrist was allowed to speak volumes. Mainly, however, it
was the exquisite silvery flow of the Lott soprano (in absolutely peak
condition just now) and the conversational ease and beauty of her sung
French that did the work.
Pattering away in 'Reine des mouettes' (from Metamorphoses), floating with
taut-drawn gentleness the ravishing quiet lyricism of 'Tu vois le feu du
soir', or concluding with the bittersweet comedy of 'La Dame de
Monte-Carlo', she seemed to tap into every current of poetic and musical
feeling. This level of achievement is rare in any musical sphere: Lott and
Johnson must have made legions of Poulenc converts-for-life across Europe.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Arts: Rembrandt's Girl at a Window's claim to fame - The
exhibition at Dulwich Art Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dulwich Picture Gallery's small-scale exhibition framed around Rembrandt's
'Girl at a Window' examines the fame of a painting. Like WF Yeames' 'And
When Did You Last See Your Father?', similarly investigated at the Walker
Art Gallery, the Rembrandt remains an enduringly popular image. The young
girl is to be found gazing out of anything from the cover of a National
Gallery day book sold in museum shops to leaflets promoting skin-care
products.
Yeames' painting entered the national consciousness through its translation
into textbook illustration, cigarette-card picture and waxwork tableau. The
tale of how successive generations in various countries have responded to
and interpreted Rembrandt's somewhat ambiguous 'Girl at a Window' is both
more typical and more subtle, and it begins in the master's studio.
Part of a young artist's training in Rembrandt's studio, as elsewhere in the
Netherlands, was to make literal copies of the master's paintings, and
copies with variations. The ability to paint in the manner of Rembrandt was
a prerequisite of a successful artistic career in Amsterdam. Moreover, guild
rules forbade pupils from working in a manner other than their master's, or
from signing their works.
'Girl at a Window' is signed and dated 1645, when the size of Rembrandt's
studio rivalled that of Rubens in Antwerp. The artist was not the first to
paint a figure leaning out of an open window; he had also drawn Saskia in
comparable pose some 12 years before. Characteristically, however, he was to
make a conventional formula entirely his own.
The girl is too young to be Hendrickje Stoffels, as has often been
suggested. She is more likely to be a servant or even a prostitute, given
her direct gaze and gaping bodice. A pool of water gathers around her left
elbow: is she straight from her bath or the washing? The painting is not so
much a portrait as a genre study of disarming naturalness and freshness.
Alongside it at Dulwich we find a 19th century copy of Chicago's famous
'Girl at a Half-Door', recently attributed to Rembrandt's pupil Samuel van
Hoogstraten but which must remain one of the more problematic demotions of
the Rembrandt Research Project. From Woburn comes a studio adaptation, 'Girl
at an Open Door', also attributed to Hoogstraten, which is indebted to the
two paintings but is notably inferior to both. (One of the unexpected treats
of the show is a thoroughly contemporary portrait by John Opie of his second
wife which pays homage to the Woburn picture, then celebrated as a Rembrandt
masterpiece.) 'A Kitchen Maid', on loan from Stockholm, shows the master
himself returning to the subject in 1651.
It is fascinating to see this small group. If only Dulwich had also been
able to secure the original 'Girl at a Half-Door' and Washington's 'Girl
with a Broom', now deemed to be by Carel Fabritius, this exhibition would
have proved far more revealing of the relationship between master and
pupils, and of the Research Project's distinction between masterpiece and
studio work, than last year's blockbuster Rembrandt show.
The show takes us on to 18th century France, where the vogue for 17th
century Dutch genre painting is reflected by the presence of the Dulwich,
Stockholm and Washington pictures. One of the canvases - probably 'Girl at a
Window' - belonged to the art theorist, painter and spy Roger de Piles and
would have been easily accessible to the artistic community for most of the
century. Certainly the Dulwich picture was to prove the most influential and
widely imitated.
One of the first to pursue the formula was Antoine Pesne, later painter to
the Prussian court. His girls at a window of 1706 and 1708 (illustrated in
reproduction) are pretty and simpering, and their expanses of bare bosom
make explicit the implicit sexuality of Rembrandt's painting. A few years
later Jean-Baptiste Santerre attempted a far more faithful, albeit
sentimentalised version. Here the girl's status is clarified by a basket of
onions, and she is as sweet and virtuous as any Greuze charmer.
Her impact on British art, after her arrival in the 1770s, is less
pronounced. Sadly we cannot see the the copy apparently painted by Sir
Joshua Reynolds, although a replica in the Hermitage shows it to be accurate
but still sugar-sweet. We can see Reynolds using it as a point of departure
in the 'Laughing Girl' from Kenwood, a full-blown essay in the master's
sombre rich tonality and clotted-cream impasto.
Frances Grace's painting of 1878-79 and Simon Edmondson's recent
interpretation using a local schoolgirl as model are witness to the
continuing popularity of copying the Rembrandt at Dulwich, which was not
only Britain's first public art gallery but doubled as an informal art
school.
It obviously had its copying uses, too, for the infamous 'Sexton Blaker' Tom
Keating, who is shown to have cut his crooked teeth on 'Girl at a Window' in
the 1950s.
The exhibition, sponsored by Martini &amp; Rossi, Sunley Holdings and
Williamson's Electrical Company, continues until April 25. While the Clore
Foundation's donation of Pounds 200,000 offers a temporary reprieve for the
gallery an additional annual income of Pounds 250,000, or an endowment of
Pounds 5m, is still needed

FT  05 FEB 93 / Arts: The Green Table - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Tuesday night, the opening programme of Birmingham Royal Ballet's season
at the Wells had a schizophrenic air. We saw a light opening piece - Graham
Lustig's view of the beau monde in Paramour; three contrasted duets; and
Facade. The company then took Dr Jekyll's potion, and closed the proceedings
with The Green Table, a work calculated to lower the most sanguine spirits.
I understand that Kurt Jooss always wanted Green Table to end an evening, so
that audiences might leave with the message still fresh in their minds. It
seems wholly unnecessary to perpetuate this routine, and it makes for awful
programme-building.
The Green Table, after 60 years, has its devotees. It is, as people never
tire of telling us, still dreadfully true in portraying the horrors of war.
But when, given human stupidity, was this not so? As a 1930s artefact, this
anti-war poster has an historic interest. Its message was unprecedented in
the dance repertory of its time and place. But unlike Georg Grosz's
drawings, which had already explored the theme, its characters are
generalisations, its style earnest, and it is riven with a sentimentality
that so often corrupts appeals to our better feelings.
Its dance language has a certain monumentalism - pose better than step  -
and the original principals (most of whom I saw) boasted an emotional and
physical weight which lent it credibility. We cannot expect BRB's dancers to
reproduce these qualities, albeit performances - notably James Bailey and
Timothy Cross as the Standard Bearer and the Young Soldier - are stronger
than at the work's revival last October. It is Marion Tait as the The Old
Mother (the very names tell you what to expect from the dance) who has the
absolutely sure dramatic presence that I recall from the Jooss
interpretations of the 1940s.
Miss Tait, that valuable, unerring artist, was all elegance in Paramour, and
was to look exquisitely true in Kenneth MacMillan's Pavane pas de deux,
happily restored to the repertory. This is a serene duet, made for Sibley
and Dowell in 1973, whose hushed, ecstatic mood and flowing shapes Miss Tait
captures perfectly. Her partner, Kevin O'Hare, has the unenviable task of
reproducing movement conceived for Dowell's impeccable line, and he makes it
look tense where it should unfurl with the sweetest muscular ease.
Pavane comes as a contrast to the bellicosities of Hans van Manen's
Twilight. Two lovers stalk each other as sexual adversaries, and Chenca
Williams has the vicious legs, the temperament as sharp as the heels on her
shoes, to make everything of the choreography. She needs a more provocative
partner than Joseph Cipolla, who underplays the man's challenge to her. And
to set the house in a roar, that well-known alternative to dancing, the Don
Quixote pas de deux. There, to knock spots off the choreography, were Miyako
Yoshida, turning like a top, and Tetsuya Kumakawa, who goes up into the air
and does things, not least some beautiful slow cabrioles. We saw too much
dazzle and too little style - acrobatics can be made to resemble art - but
the public likes circus tricks, and was more than content with these
dare-devil activities.
About Facade, I can only say that once upon a time it was a ballet in which
Ashton made stylish comment about dancing. It is now a romp, and pointless.
Musically, the evening was pleasing, with an idiomatic account of the
Poulenc two-piano concerto from Jonathan Higgins and Ross Williams, and the
Royal Ballet Sinfonia under Philip Ellis.
Birmingham Royal Ballet continues at Sadler's Wells, with mixed repertory,
until Feb 13

FT  05 FEB 93 / Arts: South Bank Schubert - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although the South Bank took a leading role in developing the 'theme' or
'festival' as a focus of musical life in London, it has more recently
allowed the running to be made by its rivals, as last autumn's ambitious
Scandinavian festival at the Barbican and the Wigmore Hall showed.
It may well have escaped the attention of most concert-goers that a Schubert
'series' (less than a theme, far less than a festival) has recently opened.
A half dozen chamber music evenings at the Queen Elizabeth Hall during
February promise some interesting items. A few choral and orchestral works
are featured at the Royal Festival Hall, but spread over six months and
probably totalling no more Schubert than we would have had anyway.
This latter half of the series, devised by William Glock, looks like an
attempt to balance the artistic books by sleight of hand. The 'Sundries'
section includes a couple of novel make-weights, but two half concerts of
choral music amount to the only unusual offerings of any substance. On
Tuesday Franz Welser-Most conducted the first of these with the London
Philharmonic, starting most promisingly with the Offertory 'Intende voci',
D963.
This is thought to be probably the last music that Schubert wrote. It has an
inner calm, an ability to fix its eyes on horizons far distant even within
its brief ten-minute span, that speaks powerfully of the Schubert of his
final years. Its atmosphere takes time to dispel, but dissipate it did all
too quickly, as it was followed by seemingly shallow youthful works - the
Offertory 'Totus in corde lagueo' D136, a duet 'Auguste jam coelestium' D488
and the Mass No. 2 in G, all written in the composer's teens.
A brighter attitude is called for, but that was manifested most noticeably
here by Welser-Most driving on in the Mass's vivacious Gloria and Credo. The
best of the solo music fell to the soprano Lynne Dawson, still sparkling of
voice, but not uninhibited as she used to be. Too many phrases were tapered
away into an artful piano. Kurt Azesberger and Simon Keenlyside were the
tenor and baritone.
Afterwards, a contrast. Welser-Most led the orchestra in Stravinsky's
Firebird, complete, not the easiest of ballets to make work in the
concert-hall; this performance, short on atmosphere at the start, took some
while to work up momentum. When the spark did take, it ignited into a fiery
Kastchei's Dance, headlong in pace. The score was performed in its earlier,
lavish orchestration, but did not sound as impressive as I remember. At the
1991 Edinburgh Festival the brass around the hall made a thrilling effect.
Here one hardly noticed there was anybody extra taking part.

Heimat (BBC 2, 11.20) continues its slow but gripping march through the
history of Germany in the 20th century.
Continuing on the Teutonic theme, there is Sam Peckinpah's harrowingly
realistic film Cross of Iron (BBC 1, 11.00). Set on the Eastern Front, the
film looks at the nature of warfare through the eyes of four German
soldiers.
But with that exception, this is an evening with so little - beyond another
dose of The Bill (ITV, 8.00) - to recommend it that a good book is surely
the answer.
However, if you are absolutely determined to spend it square-eying and fancy
something in the current affairs line, there is Public Eye (BBC 2, 8.0). The
film outlines the tough measures which from April, under the Child Support
Act, will in theory be implemented to catch those many back-sliding fathers
who won't - or can't - disgorge the maintenance they owe for their children.
If, by some unlikely chance, the so-called cult American comedy series
Nurses (C4, 10.00) has attracted followers, they should take note that
tonight sees an end of the bad business.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Technology: Researchers find genetic link with asthma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Researchers at Oxford have found a single gene which may make people
susceptible to allergy-based diseases including asthma and hay fever - but
only if they inherit it from their mother.
The discovery by Bill Cookson and colleagues at the John Radcliffe and
Churchill Hospitals is published in the Lancet today. It is certain to cause
controversy, because four other research groups have failed to confirm the
Oxford team's finding that most cases of asthma are associated with a
genetic mutation on chromosome 11.
The Oxford scientists say their 'candidate gene' predisposes carriers to
atopy, the allergy to inhaled particles which underlies asthma and hay
fever. Its identification follows a seven-year genetic study of 400 people
from 70 families, funded by the Wellcome Trust and National Asthma Campaign.
In technical terms, what the gene does is code for the beta chain of the
receptor for IgE. This controls the human response to IgE, the antibody that
causes allergy.
The gene on chromosome 11 accounts for about 60 per cent of asthma and hay
fever in the families studied by the Oxford group. But it seems to be
inactive when it is inherited from the father, unlike the vast majority of
genes which work in the same way whichever parent they come from. The
reasons for its exclusively maternal activity are not known.
The scientists now want to relate molecular variations in the IgE receptor
gene to cases of asthma and hay fever. That would prove that it is indeed an
important allergy gene - and would be the first step towards improving the
treatment for these disorders, which are poorly controlled by existing drugs
(steroids, antihistamines and broncho-dilators). In the UK there are an
estimated 6m seasonal sufferers from hay fever, and asthma affects 2m-3m
people causing 2,000 deaths a year.
'Once the gene has been found, the task of developing a new treatment is
likely to take at least 10 to 15 years,' said Donald Lane, chairman of the
National Asthma Campaign. The idea would be to switch off the gene or to
block the receptor for which it codes.
Last December, four separate research groups (from Japan, the US,
Netherlands and UK) published papers in the journal Clinical and
Experimental Allergy, saying they could find no linkage between atopy and
chromosome 11, on the basis of other genetic studies of families with
asthma. They are unlikely to be convinced by the latest evidence from
Oxford.
Cookson, however, says his group has re-checked all its data and remains
convinced that the linkage is real. He cannot explain the discrepancy with
the other studies, beyond observing that 'it is surprisingly difficult to
show genetic links of this sort'.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Management: Of hats and heads - Moves to separate the top
two jobs at UK companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
John Thompson, director of UK equities investment at Standard Life, the
insurance group, cites Lord Acton when explaining why he, as a shareholder,
is pressing boards of directors to appoint separate chairmen and chief
executives.
''Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.' The
principle is the same for businessmen as it is for politicians,' Thompson
says.
Corporate boards are apparently getting the message. Earlier this week, BAT
Industries chairman and chief executive Sir Patrick Sheehy announced that he
would shed his second hat with effect from April 1 in favour of Martin
Broughton, currently managing director of the company's Eagle Star
subsidiary.
Similarly, Yorkshire-based housebuilder Persimmon announced that its
chairman and chief executive, Duncan Davidson, will continue as an executive
chairman but a new group chief executive is to be appointed.
At British Airways, Lord King, who wore both hats, is expected to step down
today as chairman, to be succeeded by Sir Colin Marshall. The board is not
expected to appoint a new chief executive officer but Sir Michael Angus,
president of the Confederation of British Industry is likely to extend his
responsibilities as non-executive deputy chairman. A post of managing
director will also be created.
Shareholders have been seeking a dilution of the chairman's power following
the company's 'dirty tricks' against Virgin Atlantic and have been lobbying
for Sir Michael to be appointed chairman.
Institutions are apparently getting their concerns across to senior board
members, according to Pensions Investment Research Consultants, a private
group which advises pension funds on corporate governance issues. At the end
of 1991, 63 per cent of all FTSE-100 companies had split the role of
chairman and chief executive. By last week, that had risen to 73 per cent.
'I don't think companies have done it voluntarily in all cases,' said Stuart
Bell, senior researcher at PIRC. Andrew Buxton, who last summer was anointed
heir apparent to the roles of both chairman and CEO at Barclays Bank, has
been forced to relinquish the latter role under pressure from institutional
shareholders. Last year, British Petroleum was forced to split the two roles
upon the unhappy departure of the man who wore both hats, Robert Horton.
Still, there are several striking examples of chairmen who still do both
jobs: Sir Allen Sheppard at Grand Metropolitan, Tony Greener at Guinness,
Alan Sugar at Amstrad, Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy at Kingfisher and Sir Richard
Greenbury at Marks and Spencer.
The 1992 report of the Cadbury Committee on the Financial Aspects of
Corporate Governance finally gave official blessing to the view that boards
of directors operate best when the chairman and chief executive are two
different people.
Shareholder pressure for such a split had been some time in the making. More
than 18 months ago, the Institutional Shareholders Committee recommended the
split as best practice. But behind it lay shareholders' long memories of
glamour stocks that had gone wrong.
Shareholders point to the Burton Group under Sir Ralph Halpern, Brent Walker
under George Walker, Polly Peck under Asil Nadir as reasons why a single
forceful personality, no matter how talented, is likely to be a bad choice
to wear both hats.
'I personally think the acid test is whether the board can actually say no
to the person at the top,' said one member of the Cadbury Committee. 'If the
answer is no, there is not the mutual respect necessary to run the company.'
A strong and independent chief executive provides a rallying point for other
directors who may sense that a company is losing its way and who wish to
bring it back on course before any real damage is done.
Indeed, shareholders say, the real issue is whether there are sufficient
checks and balances within a board to stop an autocratic and misguided
chairman heading down the wrong path. Paddy Linaker, chief executive of unit
trust managers M&amp;G and chairman of the Institutional Fund Managers
Association, says the quality of board members is probably even more
important than whether the roles of chairman and chief executive are
combined.
In the case of GrandMet, for instance, shareholders have probably not
pressed as diligently for a split of the roles because of the perception
that the non-executive directors are strong and independent. And at some
other companies, Linaker said, the roles have been split, but the chief
executive is no match for a charismatic chairman. 'You can have the Cadbury
framework and weak people and that is no guarantee of success,' he said.
But while there is considerable agreement among shareholders about the best
way to structure board roles, many privately admit that they too often fail
to make a strong case until a company is in trouble. 'A rising stock price
is like a blindfold,' said one shareholder.
PIRC's Bell noted that plunging dividends tend to concentrate shareholders'
minds. Indeed, some of the most notable cases where boards have voted for
separate chairmen and CEOs have occurred long after the company's woes were
reflected in the share price.
Linaker says that despite that, there are signs that institutions are
changing. 'In the good old days, institutions didn't vote much.' But
increasingly, institutions are exercising their proxy votes and signalling
to management that board structure is an issue to which attention must be
paid.
'We don't just wait until something goes wrong. It's the sort of thing we
mention to managements whenever we see them,' he said.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Barbecue gives up smoking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As chill winter winds continue, many people might dream of a summer
barbecue. For many more, the idea of a barbecue might conjure up ideas of
charred food and acrid black smoke.
A Swansea inventor, Bill Darby, believes he has overcome the problem of the
smoking barbecue with a soft plastic fuel which could be sold in giant
toothpaste tubes or plastic containers. The fuel uses a base of charcoal or
anthracite mixed with lighting agents, and because it burns efficiently
produces no smoke. On lighting, flames appear for up to 12 minutes. Then a
hot glowing carbon mass remains. Darby: UK, 0792 472721.

have developed a cotton plant which has an in-built capacity to destroy
predators such as the bollworm or caterpillar.
The plant carries a gene from the bacterium bacillus thuringiensis which
enables it to produce a lethal toxin.
The plant was developed in conjunction with the Australian company Cotton

Love 'em or hate 'em, few have found it possible to ignore computer games
for Nintendo consoles. Now the lovable hero of many of these games, Mario
the Brooklyn plumber, has turned his attention from high adventure to
something more educational - painting and composing music.
Mario Paint enables would-be artists to draw, paint and animate characters
on the screen using a mouse, the controller familiar to many personal
computer users. Nintendo says this is the first computer game to be
controlled by a mouse rather than a joystick. (The mouse is included in the
Pounds 59.99 price of the package, and plugs directly into the Nintendo
16-bit Super NES console.)
If the console is also connected to a video cassette recorder, pictures or
animated sequences created on the screen can be recorded. Music can also be
added, by arranging in sequence a number of picture elements which appear on
the screen. A picture of a jumbo jet, for example, would represent one note,
a flower another and so on. Nintendo: Japan, 075 541 6111; UK, 0703 651010.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Management: Mercedes sees the writing on the wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW ARE the mighty fallen. And how tough a task they face in clambering up
again. They must accomplish not just a sharp shift in competitive strategy,
but also - far more daunting - a complete revolution in their internal
culture and organisation. If they had taken firm action in response to the
clear warning signals of a decade ago, their task would have been
immeasurably easier.
Hard on the heels of the latest ravages at IBM, Mercedes-Benz last week
emerged with its famous star firmly in the mire.
Thanks to the recent but entirely predictable appearance of much cheaper
high-quality Japanese products at the luxury end of the car market, its
overpriced, overweight models are piling up unsold on both sides of the
Atlantic. Rubbing salt into the wound, its great German rival, BMW, is
faring far less badly.
In most respects, including its leadership, Mercedes's troubles are several
steps short of IBM's. But in some ways it faces a tougher challenge.
Everyone at IBM is affected by the threat to its existence, whether they are
from design, engineering, marketing or finance. But the Mercedes problem is
rooted in the overwhelming dominance of one discipline, engineering. So its
cultural revolution will need to be bloodier.
Mercedes is also less advanced than IBM in confronting a core problem: the
time it takes to bring new products to market. Whereas IBM has done much in
the past decade to compress its development cycle through 'simultaneous
engineering' and other processes, Mercedes has started only recently.
Japanese car-makers have been able to develop a car, and then its successor,
in the time Mercedes has taken to launch just one model.
If the company had not been so arrogant, it would have realised the need for
change almost 10 years ago. It has always focused, with time-consuming
thoroughness and care, on belt-and-braces engineering: producing cars that
were tank-like in their solidity, outlasted almost every other make, and
cost the earth. This was fine so long as such quality-based
'differentiation' could only be bought at high cost.
But, as they have done so often, the Japanese changed the rules of the game.
They made what academics call 'differentiation at low cost' an entirely
feasible strategy. This reached its clearest fulfilment in 1989 when Toyota
and Nissan made their first direct challenge to the Mercedes stable with the
launch of Lexus and Infiniti.
The failure of Mercedes to anticipate this threat was entirely its own
fault. Moreover, if it had been less inward-looking, it would have noticed
in 1984 the first evidence of the radical compression of product development
cycles which has since swept through its industry. Moving swiftly from the
bottom to the middle of the volume car business, the Japanese shrank the
'time-to-market' for a 'compact' (family-sized) car by the late 1980s to
three-and-a-half years, compared with the European and US average of five.
Yet only in the wake of the influential late-1980s study by the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology of Japanese 'lean manufacturing' did
Mercedes realise it had to rethink its whole approach. It conceded this in
public only last week, when its in-coming chief executive, Helmut Werner,
implied that its cars were over-engineered and too expensive.
To remedy this, he said the company was taking the radical step - for it -
of moving to a product-development process based on 'target costing'. This
is a variant of a notorious but powerful Japanese approach which used to be
known as 'market share pricing'.
Instead of working on an ultra-generous cost-plus basis, Mercedes will now
derive its target product costs, right down to each part, from competitive
market prices.
The reaction of one experienced international consultant to this news was to
emit a deep belly laugh, followed by the expostulation 'about time]'.
Though a highly refined technique of 'target costing' has emerged only since
the late 1980s, the principle underlying it - like the term itself - has
been applied for more than two decades in most consumer product industries.
That includes Ford and other western carmakers. A key design goal for one of
the new Japanese luxury models was 'make a 7-Series BMW for a 5-Series
price'.
Recent advances under the broad banner of target costing include the use of
sensitive techniques such as 'co-variant analysis' to determine the sort of
value which customers will place on individual features, or clusters of
them. The methodology has also been adapted to include a company's
suppliers. Chrysler has used it recently to particular effect.
For Mercedes to adopt such an approach represents an even greater challenge
than meets the eye. This is because of a phenomenon which Kevin Jones, a
partner at Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton, the management consultancy, calls 'the
rational overhead': that most of the time taken to develop a product is
spent not on actual development work, but trying to convince everyone
involved that each decision is correct.
For Mercedes, one of the key challenges of target costing will be how to
introduce such a detailed technique without - in instinctively rigorous
fashion - increasing the complexity and time of its development cycle still
further. The only way to cope with this, Jones advises, will be to limit the
number of variables that it scrutinises on each new model.
For a Germanic company which will want constantly to challenge the details
and cost of every part, that is an almost unthinkable revolution. But, like
the other challenges which Mercedes is confronting, it is a matter of do or
die.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Technology: Hoping for a clean sweep - Alice Rawsthorn meets
a man who has devoted himself to building a better vacuum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is slightly strange to watch an apparently sane man brandishing a vacuum
cleaner and waxing lyrical about it. But if anyone has a reason to enthuse
about vacuum cleaners, it is James Dyson, who has spent the past decade
designing them. Dyson, 45, is one of that rare breed: successful British
inventors and industrial designers. The G-Force, his first vacuum cleaner
launched in 1986, sells in Japan for Pounds 1,200 and pops up on white
plinths in design museums.
His latest model is the Dyson Dual Cyclone, which is destined for the
British mass market rather than Tokyo trendies. It goes on sale this month
in several UK retailers - John Lewis, Rumbelows, Littlewoods - and
electricity showrooms with a price-tag of Pounds 199.
Dyson is more interested in how his products work than how they look. He
trained in product design at the Royal College of Art, but sees himself as
an inventor, rather than a designer. 'It's the technology that interests
me,' he said. 'I'm not turned on by the idea of designing a case for a
machine that someone else has developed. My thrill is coming up with
something new and embodying it in an exciting way.'
He worked for an engineering group for a few years after leaving the RCA,
but then set up on his own to develop and produce the Ballbarrow, a
wheelbarrow with a pneumatic ball instead of a wheel. The idea for his first
vacuum cleaner came while he was making a machine for the Ballbarrow
factory.
'One of our cleaning machines kept clogging up with dirt,' he said. 'We
needed a cyclone system but didn't have Pounds 70,000 to buy it, so I
decided to make my own. I realised that I could use a miniaturised version
in a vacuum cleaner.' He sold the rights to the Ballbarrow in order to
finance the development of the vacuum cleaner. The result was the G-Force.
Conventional vacuum cleaners work by sucking in dirt and air, then
separating them through a filter. The air escapes and the dirt collects in a
paper bag. The problem is that the filter gets blocked, making the machine
progressively less efficient. Dyson's cyclone system performs the same
function as a filter by whizzing the dirt and air around at high speed, but
does not clog. The dirt collects in a plastic container which can be clipped
off and emptied.
He designed the G-Force so that its handle operated as a hose. At the time,
most upright vacuum cleaners had clip-on hoses which were not part of the
machine. Although the mainstream manufacturers rejected Dyson's design when
he showed it to them in the early 1980s, an integral hose has since become a
standard feature on upright vacuum cleaners.
He chose to make the G-Force look different from the sober-coloured machines
then on sale. It has a jaunty pink plastic case and a clip-off container in
transparent plastic that reveals the guts of the machine. 'I wanted the
design to underline the fact that the G-Force was different from other
models,' said Dyson. 'I also liked the idea of a vacuum cleaner being fun to
look at.'
The G-Force design was licensed to a Japanese manufacturer. Dyson has used
the income (30,000 models are still sold each year) to set up a
product-development unit near his country home in Bath with a team of 15
designers. They have since developed vacuum cleaners for the US, including
an industrial model for Johnson Wax. But the biggest project is the Dual
Cyclone. Dyson has invested Pounds 1.75m to develop the design, register the
patents and to tool up a Wrexham sub-contractor to manufacture the machine.
This time, he has installed two cyclones. One operates at 200mph to process
bigger bits of dirt and the other at 800mph to treat tiny dust particles.
The Dual Cyclone has the same playful quality to its design as the G-Force,
although the shape is less exaggerated and Dyson has chosen the more subdued
shades of grey and yellow. 'I wanted it to look more functional,' says
Dyson. 'Pink would be a bit roue today.'
He hopes to introduce the Dual Cyclone to other countries once it is
established in the UK, and to plough the profits into a new vacuum cleaner,
just as he did with the G-Force. 'Sometimes I'm tempted to try other
products, but if you want to do something really well you have to find a
small area and work at it,' he says. 'We've still got lots of new ideas for
vacuum cleaners.'

FT  05 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Portillo to review public spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, is set to announce the
most sweeping review of public spending since the early 1980s.
As rising public sector borrowing increasingly threatens ministers' hopes of
avoiding tax rises, Mr Portillo will in the next few weeks announce plans
for re-assessing Whitehall departments' long-term expenditure priorities.
It is expected to be the most fundamental review since Lord Howe, the former
Chancellor, ordered a similar study after the Conservatives took power in
1979. The aim then was to cut public spending in real terms.
Mr Portillo's review, expected to last at least a year, will look at
spending in the hope of paving the way for further income tax cuts before
the general election.
A likely early target is the Pounds 76bn social security budget which now
accounts for about a third of government spending compared with less than a
quarter in 1979-80. Defence and transport are other possibilities.
Mr John Major is determined to take a tougher line on public spending as the
Treasury forecasts that the public sector borrowing requirement will reach
Pounds 37bn this financial year and Pounds 44bn in the following financial
year.
The cabinet agreed in principle to the review last May but work was delayed
while Mr Portillo concentrated on November's Autumn Statement.
He is expected to set out a programme of work - probably indicating the
departments to be subject to scrutiny first as well as the overall
objectives.
Mr Major hinted at the review in his speech to the Carlton Club on
Wednesday. He said it was, 'dangerously easy for the state to settle into
habits of spending which outlast their purpose and outrun their budgets. And
to avoid that happening, it is necessary from time to time to re-examine
long term trends in expenditure.'
The prime minister said that to make progress towards lower personal
taxation, 'we must keep firm control of inflation and take a rig -orous
approach to public spending'.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Faster shrinking of state controls
promised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN acceleration of the shift in power from the state to the individual was
last night predicted by Mr John Patten, education secretary, in a lecture
designed to pull together the threads of Conservative policy towards the
public services.
Mr Patten said that the government's approach to health, education, social
provision and housing would by the end of the century have redefined the
relationship between citizens and government.
Individuals would be entrusted with 'as much power as they wish to take.
That diffusion of authority would leave Britain with more 'relaxed'
government, lighter in touch and playing the role of a 'creative agent'
rather than a remote bureaucracy.
Mr Patten suggested that the reorganisation of health and education to
devolve power to individual hospitals, GPs and schools could be accompanied
by a fundamental reshaping of state help for the elderly and the infirm.
Central management of funds could give way to the creation of local 'care
associations' which would eventually allocate the resources provided by
Whitehall.
Arguing that individual choice remained central to Conservative philosophy
during the 1990s, he said that the government's housing policies would
further buttress the shift from government to the citizen. Home-ownership
would be within the reach of 75 per cent of the population by the year 2000
while tenants in social housing would have more more control over their
accommodation.
Echoing some of the themes set out by Mr John Major in his speech to the
Carlton Club this week, Mr Patten suggested that the impact of the reforms
would be far more radical than generally appreciated.
He told the Conservative Political Centre: 'We have set out a range of
changes that, by the start of the 21st century, will have effected an
enormous shift of power and responsibility from government.'

FT  05 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Costing the welfare state -
Claim-as-you-work arrangements in other countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKFARE was the label bestowed on the prime minister's musing about whether
society should expect something back from the unemployed.
For the term is generally interpreted as obliging welfare recipients to
'work off' their benefits without additional pay.
But in practice the word is ambiguous and covers a myriad of work programmes
which vary in their intent - from saving taxpayers money to inculcating work
values into single mothers.
Mr Major and his cabinet, it is understood, are not yet clear about what
form of workfare they want.
Various forms of workfare have been introduced into a number of countries,
including the US, Sweden and Australia.
In the US, where unemployment insurance runs out after 26 weeks with
generally no offer of income support, workfare is is a poverty relief
measure aimed mainly at providing single mothers with a route out of poverty
 -'able bodied' individuals with dependent children are obliged to register
for work or job training.
With the exception of a couple of states in the US deep south, single
mothers are not thrown onto the streets if they refuse an option.
Studies of US programmes, which cost on average about Dollars 1,500 a year
on top of welfare payments, produce as many conclusions about workfare as
there are projects.
The general conclusion is that programmes do save taxpayers' money,
particularly if individuals go to work in the private sector. However,
savings are cut if the approach of states such as Massachusetts is followed.
It claims its good-quality voluntary training programmes get people into
better jobs. However, its a controversial area. Professor Laurance Mead of
the New York University, who has made a large scale study of workfare, says:
'There is very little evidence to support this.
What counts, he says, is that workfare enforces the work ethic.
The Swedish model is very different in that it is an integral part of a
highly interventionist labour market strategy in a society that until very
recently was committed to full employment. Benefits have a limited duration
before it is compulsory to perform some form of work.
If private sector opportunities have been scarce the state has created jobs
and paid full wages while in training.
But rising unemployment is putting a strain on the Swedish system and there
is a new public debate on unemployment measures, while cuts are being made
in payments to those in publicly funded jobs.
The British government is unlikely to offer participants in any new work
scheme anything like this. Instead, it is more likely to model any scheme on
its own Employment Action scheme, which offered benefits plus Pounds 10. It
has not attracted its full quota of participants, mainly because people do
not want to work for Pounds 10 a week.
Some advocates of a new large-scale work scheme offering benefit plus a
small amount of cash argue it would have to be mandatory.
Schemes that are being considered in the UK concentrate on the long-term
unemployed, in an attempt to limit the cost and concentrate on the most
needy. Alternative schemes are being canvassed at a time when the plight of
the long term unemployed is highlighted by unemployment lobbying
organisations and MPs concerned that a rump of individuals are emerging who
may become unemployable.
Ministers say there is already a degree of compulsion in the system that
could be extended, with individuals having to attend Restart interviews from
this April after 12 months unemployment. There may be proposals to extend
this scheme in the Budget on March 16, and in the longer term.
These interviews are mandatory - with the threat of benefits withdrawal -
and demand the individual makes personal job plans.
A proposal made by Full Employment UK, is being given serious consideration
by the government. Mr Peter Ashby, a director of the consultancy, proposes a
Pounds 630m a year national workfare scheme offering up to 300,000 of those

FT  05 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pause in Maastricht debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs are to have at least a week off from debating the Maastricht bill - but
the government denied that it was having to be slowed deliberately to fit in
with Denmark's plans for its second referendum.
As the Commons last night began the 11th committee day on the bill,
ministers confirmed privately that the final vote by MPs before it goes to
the House of Lords will not take place before the Danish poll, now fixed for
May 18.
Yet they insisted that the bill was proceeding through the Commons as
planned and its timing had not been affected by the Danish announcement.
'We think that we are making reasonable progress on the Maastricht bill, in
line with the sort of progress that we expected to make,' said one cabinet
minister.
In the Commons Mr Tony Newton, leader of the house, announced a programme of
business for next week that excludes debate on the Maastricht bill. No
decisions have been taken about when the committee stage will resume.
Government managers argued that a backlog of business had built up which
required debate and that it was always the intention to vary the pace of the
bill's progress.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major defends workfare - Proposals
may mean long-term jobless face greater compulsion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government would not shrink from considering radical options to
introduce workfare-style schemes, Mr John Major said yesterday. He
emphasised that the aim would be to keep people who were unemployed 'in
touch with the world of work'.
Challenged at Commons question time about the prospect of requiring the
unemployed to carry out some activity in return for state benefit, the prime
minister said that might mean extending the element of compulsion present
now in the Restart scheme for the long-term unemployed.
There will be a two-stage process. First proposals from the group of senior
ministers discussing employment - chaired by Lord Wakeham, the leader of the
Lords - could be announced even before the Budget in mid-March. These might
include expanding existing employment schemes. More radical plans, which are
still at an early stage, would follow.
Mr Major's speech on Wednesday was discussed by senior ministers at a
political meeting after a cabinet meeting yesterday morning, and Mrs Gillian
Shephard, the employment secretary, had a separate meeting with Mr Major
afterwards.
Mrs Shephard has previously criticised the idea of a general workfare
scheme, and even after Mr Major's speech, she made clear her reservations
about a single scheme to cover all 3m or so unemployed.
'If by workfare it is meant we should treat all unemployed people in the
same way as if they were not individuals . . . of course we would rule that
out,' she said.
Downing Street said that the approach was to look at different schemes for
different categories of unemployed, depending on why they were having
difficulty finding work.
The Treasury will be especially uneasy at the cost of any new scheme,
especially as Downing Street has said that there might be two rates of
benefit, with a few pounds more a week for those taking up some activity.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, is thought to be
among workfare's main supporters in the government. Mr Peter Lilley, the
social security secretary, may see the initiative as strengthening his
efforts to crack down to 'scroungers'.
While there seems to be little opposition within the Tory party to targeted
schemes enabling the jobless to undertake voluntary work or education, the
most difficult political argument is the question of compulsion. Downing
Street said that it would only be in limited cases, but some ministers are
already warning that any extension of coercion is impossible in the current
political climate.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, was among Labour MPs
condemning the proposal. He said it was 'demeaning' to force people 'to work
for next to nothing'.
Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers
union, denounced Mr Major's suggestion as 'the first step back to the
workhouse'.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Retirement change to be staged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOCIAL security ministers are drawing up plans to soften the impact of a
planned rise to 65 in the female state retirement age. They intend to delay
the increase for a decade - and warn that Britain will lose to economic
competitors if the change is blocked.
Under proposals being considered by the department, the retirement age for
women would remain at the current 60 for 10 years. After that the qualifying
age would rise by 12 months each year for five years.
Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, has begun consultations with
other cabinet colleagues and is expected to publish before the summer a
white paper on pension equalisation.
The department is acutely aware of the strong political impact of the
planned rise, and the reaction of women employees. But they are preparing to
counter that by arguing that no woman currently in her fifties would be
affected.
Figures prepared by the department will be used to argue that UK companies
could be severely disadvantaged if male and female retirement ages are not
equalised at 65.
Maintaining the status quo would, as the population ages, impose an
increasing burden on the Treasury - and on companies who set their
retirement ages in line with the state.
A review by the social security department shows that in Germany, retirement
ages are to be equalised at 65 by 2012 and that over the next two decades
Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Spain, will equalise at 65. Denmark is to
equalise at 67 and the US is expected to move to 67 by the year 2027.
The exception is Japan, which is to equalise at 60 by 2000 but the social
security department believes the country may also move towards 65 by a later
date.

LABOUR'S recent attack on standards in the Civil Service was 'astonishing
and regrettable', Mr John Major said last night.
He criticised Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, for a speech last week in
which he accused officials and ministers of insensitivity and partiality
over issues such as the Matrix Churchill affair and the decision to pay part
of Mr Norman Lamont's legal bill.
'Every politician should know better than to let party political advocacy
run away with his judgment on matters such as these,' Mr Major said in a
speech to the Civil Service Club.

THE government came under further pressure in the Commons yesterday not to
impose VAT on newspapers and periodicals.
Mr Tony Lloyd (Lab Stretford) reminded Sir John Cope, the paymaster general,
that he recently stated that the government had no plans or proposals to do
so. Sir John said: 'I am not taking back anything we have said. At this
point we cannot discuss any tax changes so near the Budget.'
Urging the government not to restrict the scope of the zero rate of VAT for
short-term revenue reasons, Sir Terence Higgins (C Worthing), a former
treasury minister, warned that any change would be likely to prove
irreversible.

FT  05 FEB 93 / OECD urges tax increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government should exercise caution over further cuts in interest
rates and raise taxes by up to Pounds 10bn to steady the fiscal deficit, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said yesterday.
The 24-nation body says an over-aggressive programme of cuts in base rates
after the drop from 10 per cent to 6 per cent since September could trigger
an inflationary burst that might have to be controlled by monetary
tightening. In that case 'output would be stronger for at most a brief
period'. In its latest review of the UK economy, the OECD advocates an
extension of value added tax to items such as food and household energy
bills. This measure would raise up to Pounds 11bn a year and is thought to
be under examination by the Treasury for the Budget on March 16.
The study is mildly upbeat about recovery prospects, predicting growth in
gross domestic product of 1.3 per cent this year and 2.4 per cent in 1994.
But it warns that the risk of significant inflationary pressures are 'not
negligible' given the higher import prices caused by sterling's devaluation
and the possibility of growth in consumer demand if any upturn proves
strong.
The study was completed last month by OECD economists after consultations
with the Treasury and Bank of England.
The OECD estimates that under present policies the ratio of government debt
to GDP would grow to 45 per cent in 1994, up from 36 per cent last year and
29 per cent in 1990.
To halt this rise the OECD favours a tightening of fiscal policy. This would
also prevent a further rise in the ratio of the public sector borrowing
requirement to GDP. The OECD says this figure, excluding privatisation
proceeds will reach 7.5 per cent in 1993, before falling back to 6.5 per
cent next year - the same level as in 1992.
The OECD says about 70 per cent of the deterioration in the PSBR since 1990
can be accounted for by higher social security spending and lower taxes
caused by the recession.
Even though the government has ruled out giving the Bank of England greater
control over setting interest rates, the OECD says that removing this area
from Treasury control might make monetary policy less subject to political
pressures. It could help control inflation in the long run.
The study also urges:
Tougher regulations covering recently privatised UK utility companies to
prevent them pushing up profits by exploiting dominant market positions.
More efforts to boost education and training. The OECD says reform in these
areas 'remains a priority'.
Continued privatisation and cuts in the number of public services provided
free.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Construction is set to decline further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK CONSTRUCTION output looks set to decline even further this year, judging
by an industry workload survey published yesterday.
The results of a questionnaire covering more than 2,000 quantity surveyors
showed that orders last year fell by 18 per cent to their lowest level since
1985, when the survey began.
The findings, published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, are
worrying for the rest of the industry. Much quantity surveying work, such as
that of architects, occurs early in the construction process. Surveyors'
orders therefore provide a good guide to future workloads of construction
companies and building material suppliers.
Demand is likely to be worse for private commercial development where large
numbers of empty office buildings are expected to remain on the market even
when the economy recovers.
Mr Christopher Vickers, a senior partner at EC Harris, one of the largest
firms of quantity surveyors, said: 'These gloomy figures show the
construction industry still faces an uphill struggle. Any recovery is going
to be long and very difficult, particularly for smaller practices.'
The survey showed that orders fell by 5 per cent during the final three
months of last year compared with the previous quarter.
The number of staff employed by quantity surveyors declined by 8.5 per cent
in 1992 after falls in the previous two years.
The institution said the recession had hit south-east England hardest, with
a 26 per cent drop in surveyors' workloads last year. Further reductions in
orders occurred in south-west England, the Midlands and Wales. Meanwhile,
orders in Scotland and Northern Ireland, which had avoided the worst of the
recession, had begun to decline.

FT  05 FEB 93 / CBI says third of employers freeze pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT one in three of employers introduced pay freezes in the final quarter
of last year, according to the Confederation of British Industry's latest
pay databank figures, David Goodhart writes.
Over the same period, which saw Britain's withdrawal from the European
exchange rate mechanism and a spate of large redundancy announcements, the
CBI recorded average manufacturing pay settlements at only 2.8 per cent.
Pay awards in the service sector in that quarter were 3.2 per cent.
Although some of the low awards in the final quarter of last year might have
been affected by the uncertainty following withdrawal from the ERM,
subsequent settlements do not suggest that the downward trend has ended.
The CBI figures say that manufacturers' productivity rose 3.9 per cent in
the second half of last year, while basic pay awards averaged 3.5 per cent.

FT  05 FEB 93 / People: Guest appearance at enterprise agency federation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was the experience of handling a factory closure in the early 1980s which
brought home to John Guest, then a long range planner with Cadbury
Schweppes, the impact of change on local communities.
It was this event which ultimately led to his appointment, earlier this
week, as chief executive of the newly formed Federation of Enterprise
Agencies. The agencies provide support and advice to would-be entrepreneurs
and small and medium-sized businesses.
Ever since Business in the Community, which co-ordinates the community
activities of several hundred large companies, said in June that it was no
longer prepared to act as 'umbrella' organisation, the agencies have been
seeking to set up a national body.
When Cadbury decided to shut down a factory at Frampton on Severn as part of
a rationalisation programme, Guest was responsible for finding a developer
to take over the site and develop an industrial estate. This enabled Cadbury
to replace the jobs which had gone with the factory closure.
This project led to contacts with Business in the Community and in 1983
Guest became a regional director, helping to set up several enterprise
agencies in the Midlands. After two years he returned to Cadbury to combine
planning with community affairs, becoming group community affairs manager in
1989.
Apart from his secondment to BitC, this represents the 57-year-old Guest's
first break in a Cadbury career spanning 37 years. He is taking on the job
at a challenging time for the agencies.
The government's plans for a nationwide network of one-stop shops are
forcing all the participants, Training and Enterprise Councils, chambers of
commerce and enterprise agencies, to reassess their roles. 'It will be a
full-time job,' he says.
Guest calculates that the federation at present only speaks for half of the
country's 300 enterprise agencies though these account for 70 per cent of
agency business. An early priority is to improve the quality of the service
provided and member agencies will be expected to conform to the BS5750
quality standard or an equivalent within two years.
If the going gets tough, Guest can always call upon his chairman at Cadbury
for advice. Sir Graham Day has agreed to become founding president of the
federation.

been affected by the uncertainty following withdrawal from the ERM,
subsequent settlements do not suggest that the downward trend has ended.
National Westminster and Lloyds Bank announced last month that staff will be
receiving no general pay increase, and the national pay deal for the
footwear industry was 2.5 per cent.
The latest settlements will mean further strong downward pressure on average
earnings, which were still rising at an annualised rate of 5 per cent in
November for the whole economy.
Unit labour costs in manufacturing, rising at only 0.5 per cent in November
could fall even further. The latest CBI figures say that manufacturers'
productivity rose 3.9 per cent in the second half of last year, while basic
pay awards averaged 3.5 per cent.
Other pay analysts expressed some scepticism about the CBI pay freeze
figures.
Mr Alistair Hatchett, of the pay analysts Incomes Data Services, said that
IDS had found that there was a slight increase in the incidence of freezes
but it affected only about one settlement in six.

FT  05 FEB 93 / People: Craig moves up at Northern Telecom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The ripples from last month's unexpected changes at the top of Northern
Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications company, are spreading to Europe.
Yesterday Nortel named its new European president and chief executive as Ian
Craig, formerly the company's chief operating officer for the region.
Scots-born Craig, 50, will take up his new appointment immediately. He has
been with Nortel for 26 years and has held senior positions in marketing,
sales and strategic planning as well as research and development.
Yesterday he was flying to North America, no doubt to be briefed about his
new responsibilities which include sales and marketing throughout Europe,
the Middle East and Africa. Since the acquisition of STC, the region
contributes 17 per cent of the group's revenues.
The reshuffle at Nortel was initiated by the sudden resignation as chief
executive late last month of Paul Stern, the outspoken and colourful figure
who led the company's drive to expand business outside North America. He has
been replaced by Jean Monty, formerly head of Bell Canada.
Meanwhile, Craig replaces Desmond Hudson who is returning to North America
to take up an as-yet unexplained special assignment.

FT  05 FEB 93 / People: Healthy Julien turns to tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Julien, the former group chief executive of Storehouse, has become a
non-executive director at Chiltern Financial Services, an international tax
consultancy firm based in London.
Julien resigned from Storehouse last summer in order to recover from what
was called at the time a 'mystery virus'. Though none of his doctors
believes in the ailment, Julien believes it was chronic fatigue syndrome,
also known as ME, and irreverently as yuppie flu.
But Julien, at 54, says he is no yuppie. More important, he is substantially
recovered, and is taking Chiltern as the first of what he hopes will be a
number of non-executive directorships which he is currently examining.
Chiltern was founded in 1977. Dennis Tapper, the executive chairman, says he
expects Julien - its first non-executive director - to tender his experience
of large companies and strategic development. He had come across the
consultancy when he had used its services in the past.
Julien qualified as a chartered accountant at Price Waterhouse, became
finance director at BICC, then at Midland Bank and finally was managing
director of Guinness at the time of what he calls 'the event of which we
don't speak'.
He has no plans to return to a full-time executive position with any
company, except his own family business, Uniform Clothing in London, which
makes ceremonial uniforms.
He is also indulging his passion for France, and has an eye open for
non-executive directorships at companies with an international focus so that
he can mix business with pleasure.

Jim Felker is resigning as a director of Simon Engineering, where he had
responsibility for Simon's environmental division. He will step down at the
end of March to become president and chief executive of EMCON, a US
engineering and consultancy business.
Simon has sold off nearly all its environmental businesses this year because
of falling profits. On Wednesday the company made its last disposal, selling
its European environmental consultancy division to Northumbrian Water for
Pounds 10.5m.

Dares Estates, the heavily indebted property developer currently in talks

It has laid off its finance director in order to cut costs.
Michael Giles Knopp, who has worked for the company for seven years, has
resigned as a director of Dares although he will remain a consultant. Brian
Tomlinson, Dares' chief executive, is a chartered accountant and says that
Giles Knopp's departure is part of a cost-cutting exercise. He will take on
Giles Knopp's responsibilities. At its peak the firm employed 18 staff but
there are just eight left on the payroll.

FT  05 FEB 93 / OECD says coal closures will cut fuel costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE planned closure of coal mines should lead to cheaper energy and cut
environmental costs, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development said.
The latest OECD survey of the UK economy says taxes on fuel should be more
closely related to the amount of pollution they cause.
In a special section on the environment, the survey says there are
'inconsistencies' in the tax treatment of specific fuels which act against
goals of reducing pollution.
It adds: 'Removing artificial barriers to fuel substitution and conservation
and establishing energy prices which better reflect potential environmental
damage are likely to be the most cost-efficient means of protecting the
environment.'
The OECD suggests measures to relate taxes and other charges on vehicles
more directly to road use, rather than ownership of cars or lorries. As well
as reducing pollutants such as nitrogen oxides from vehicle exhausts, such
'road pricing' mechanisms could help reduce traffic congestion and energy
use.
The study says Britain's heavy dependence on burning coal for electricity
generation contributes to the large volumes of carbon dioxide and sulphur
oxides entering the atmosphere from the UK, at rates above the European
Community average. It welcomes the projected rapid substitution of natural
gas for coal in a new power stations.
Distortions in environment-related tax and pricing mechanisms highlighted by
the OECD include:
Household energy use is exempt from value added taxation, while investment
in energy saving is subject to VAT at the normal rate, factors which do
nothing to encourage energy saving.
Public transport receives relatively low government subsidies, while private
parking provided by employers is exempt from taxation as a benefit in kind.
Few households have meters to control the water supply, which may promote
profligate use of water.
OECD urges tax rise, Page 8

FT  05 FEB 93 / Power groups are rebuked: Opposition from Littlechild
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRICITY companies that have urged the government to delay liberalisation
of the energy market were yesterday rebuked by Professor Stephen
Littlechild, the industry regulator, as he expressed strong opposition to
their view.
A delay in the liberalisation was backed last week by a parliamentary select
committee because it would give electricity companies more certainty about
the size of future markets and thus enable them to put in long-term
contracts for more coal.
Hospitals, schools, supermarkets and other medium-to-large users would all
suffer because they would fail to benefit from the price reductions they
could expect from increased competition among electricity companies, said
Prof Littlechild.
Plans outlined by the government before the industry was privatised mean
that from next year customers using more than 100kw of electricity during a
half-hour period will be able to choose which company supplies their power.
The current threshold of 1MW applies to just 5,000 large users.
Liberalisation would take the figure to between 40,000 and 50,000.
Prof Littlechild's opposition is bound to influence the government, although
a delay would provide it with one of the simplest solutions to the coal
market crisis.
The regulator said yesterday a delay would be very regrettable and he was
disappointed that some of the generators and regional electricity companies
had associated themselves with that view.
There were 20,000 electricity customers just below the 1MW limit and they
needed the lowest possible costs for fuel to compete abroad and provide jobs
in Britain, he said.
Ten thousand of the new sites that would qualify for supplier choice would
be schools and hospitals. 'There is always need for more resources there,'
Prof Littlechild said.
Liberalisation would also ensure that regional electricity companies
purchased electricity efficiently, he added. The regulator also repeated
calls for a reduction in - and more clarity about - the nuclear levy which
is paid to Nuclear Electric to cover liabilities inherited from the Central
Electricity Generating Board when the industry was privatised. 'It really
has been pretty much a black box. Where does it go? What is it for? The
customer needs to know.'
His remarks were delivered at the annual meeting of the Major Energy Users'
Council, at which electricity companies were attacked by delegates for high
profits since privatisation.
Delegates also expressed discontent over the price rises that some large
users had experienced.
Mr Tom Lowes, representing Blue Circle, said the electricity companies'
returns on capital were more than twice those in the rest of industry. He
also attacked what he called the arrogance of the industry in responding to
complaints.
Other delegates called for the operation of the pool - the wholesale market
for electricity - to be simplified. Prof Littlechild said he was not
convinced that the running of the electricity pool needed to be as complex
as it was.
He said the record of the industry had been mixed since privatisation. Some
large users were having to pay more, but for most, prices had been reduced
by 10 to 15 per cent.
Eastern Electricity, the largest of the regional electricity companies,
yesterday signed a five-year contract with National Power, the generator, to
meet 21 per cent of its needs over five years from March 31.
The contract, similar to one already concluded between the company and
PowerGen, the other main generator, depends on National Power negotiating a
contract with British Coal for 40m tonnes next year and 30m in the following
four.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Ulcer treatment market may face big shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STUDY published in yester-day's New England Journal of Medicine suggests
that a combination of drugs could prevent duodenal ulcers recurring in 92
per cent of sufferers.
The results, which confirm previous studies, threaten to alter profoundly
the structure of the ulcer treatment market, which is worth Dollars 7bn
(Pounds 4.6bn) a year.
About a third of the drugs prescribed for ulcers are to prevent them
recurring. If the new combination of drugs is widely adopted by specialists
and general practitioners, it could severely reduce sales of maintenance
therapies.
The leading ulcer treatment is Glaxo's Zantac, which generated Pounds 1.8bn
of sales in the past year and is the world's best-selling drug. SmithKline
Beecham's Tagamet had sales of more than Dollars 1bn.
The Austrian one-year study of 104 patients compared results on patients
given a placebo with those on Zantac combined with antibiotics. In patients
followed for a year, ulcers recurred in 8 per cent of those given
antibiotics but 86 per cent on placebo - a treatment without any medicinal
effect.
The antibiotics kill a bacterium called Helicobacter Pylori, which is
associated with recurring ulcers. In those patients in which the antibiotics
successfully killed the bacteria, only 2 per cent suffered a recurrence
compared with 85 per cent on placebo.
A comment accompanying the study, by Professor David Graham of the Veterans'
Affairs Medical Centre in Houston, Texas, recommended that an attempt should
be made to eradicate the bacteriological infection in all patients with
Helicobacter Pylori and peptic ulcers. He concluded that if recurrence was
precluded, maintenance therapy would not be needed.
Glaxo said the study was a small one, but provided further evidence that the
bacteria played a role in the recurrence of duodenal ulcers. It also
confirmed that Zantac in combination with other drugs had the ability to
eliminate Helicobacter Pylori.
However, Glaxo said there had not yet been a large well controlled trial to
validate the effectiveness or safety of the combination therapy, and nor had
there been regulatory approval for such a regime. The group also noted there
had been a high incidence of side effects during the trials.
Some specialists have also been worried about widespread use of antibiotics
to prevent recurrence of ulcers, because it might allow organisms to build
up resistance to the drugs.

Mr Brian de Vecchis, formerly chairman of Central Stockbroking Services,
used the money after his firm failed to meet the SFA's minimum capital

FT  05 FEB 93 / Tory rebels state their pit demands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY OPPONENTS of the government's pit closures programme have signalled
that they may be ready to accept a new strategy for the industry which would
rescue fewer pits than the number implied in last week's report from the
Commons trade and industry committee.
An FT survey of the Tory backbenchers most likely to rebel if too few pits
are saved indicated that a plan to rescue between 12 and 14 threatened coal
mines may be enough to stave off defeat in the Commons on the issue.
But the potential rebels hold a wide range of views, and some hardliners
insist that up to 20 of the 31 pits must be rescued. Nevertheless, an
assurance that private operators would be able to take over the running of
any pits British Coal decided to close would help appease rebels.
The government could be defeated if as few as 11 of its backbenchers voted
against it in the Commons debate on the energy white paper to be published
later this month.
Among the most difficult to satisfy is Mrs Ann Winterton, MP for Congleton,
who spoke of sparing a number 'in the high teens.' Mr Stephen Day, MP for
Cheadle, described the trade and industry committee report as 'the bottom
line'.
Others have a lower threshold. Mr David Nicholson, the MP for Taunton, who
said he had attended meetings of the 30-strong coal group of Tory MPs, said
he would vote against the government 'only if the government appeared
suicidal.' He added: 'Anything below 10 and we come into abstention or
voting against.'
Mr Spencer Batiste, MP for Elmet and another coal group member, said he was
'looking for a minimum of 10 to 15 pits in the context of British Coal' with
remaining pits offered for sale. He was likely to support the government
unless it proposed an additional market significantly below 10m tonnes per
year, he indicated.
Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, the MP for Batley and Spen who has been among the
most prominent Tory coal campaigners, said she would be unlikely to back
proposals to save between 10 and 12 pits. 'I think we could get an
additional 30m tonnes per year with a subsidy of just short of Pounds 300m
over five years.'
Sir Richard Body, MP for Holland with Boston and 'theoretically' a coal
group member, said he had abstained when MPs debated the pit closure
programme last October because it was 'disgraceful' that any group of
employees should be treated 'in this way without consultation'. Many of
these concerns had been addressed, he indicated.
The soundings suggest that Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, may win a majority for a package which rescues fewer pits than
the committee implied.
He may be reluctant to pitch such controversial proposals so close to the
minimum that MPs regard as acceptable, however.
Mr Winston Churchill, one of the leaders of the coal group, has warned that
Mr Heseltine 'cannot afford to lead the government to defeat on this issue'.
Calculations of the number needed to defeat the government are complicated
by the presence of the 13 Ulster unionists. Last year the abstention of
eight Unionists helped to ensure that a Labour amendment was defeated in
spite of a rebellion by six Tories.
If all 13 unionist MPs abstained when the white paper is debated, the number
of Tory rebels needed to defeat the government would rise to 18.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Sales of new cars rise for fourth month in succession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK NEW car sales rose by 7 per cent in January, the fourth consecutive month
in which registrations have been higher than in the corresponding period a
year ago.
Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, said the figures indicated
that 'a sustained recovery' in the market could well be under way.
The growth in sales last month was because of a higher level of purchases by
private customers rather than by company fleets, he said.
The increase in retail sales was 'particularly encouraging' and indicated
that abolition of special car tax last year and the reduction in interest
rates was having a positive effect on consumer confidence, said Mr
McAllister.
Professor Garel Rhys, Professor of Motor Industry Economics at Cardiff
Business School, cautioned against optimism based on the January sales
figures.
'Last month's car figures were in fact dreadful,' he said. 'The previous
January was very poor, being 11.7 per cent down on the 1990 figure. But
since then the 10 per cent special car tax has been abolished. That should
should have lifted last month's market by 12 per cent on its own.
'The extent to which the market is up shows the recession is still there and
that people remain very cautious about buying,' he added.
New car registrations in January totalled 164,939, a 7.3 per cent rise on a
year before, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers
and Traders.
UK new car sales for 1992 at 1.59m were virtually unchanged from the very
depressed level of the previous year and were 31 per cent below the peak
sales of 2.3m in 1989.
There were tentative signs that demand had begun to recover in the final
months of last year, however, and new car registrations have been higher
than a year earlier in five of the last six months.
Registrations of new commercial vehicles in January rose 4.4 per cent to
17,418, which was also the fourth consecutive monthly year-on-year increase.
Daf, the beleaguered Anglo-Dutch truck maker that collapsed into
receivership this week, was the clear UK truck market leader in January,
with a share of 25.4 per cent.
In the UK new car market both Ford and Vauxhall, the market leaders, lost
ground heavily in January while Citroen, Renault and Peugeot all made
significant gains, as did Rover, Toyota, Nissan, Volkswagen and Audi.
Sales of Japanese makes in January were 32.9 per cent higher than a year
before, which boosted their share to 11.2 per cent.
