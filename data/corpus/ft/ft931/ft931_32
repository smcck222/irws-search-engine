FT  05 FEB 93 / VAT 'risk to 20% of local papers'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A FIFTH of Britain's regional newspaper titles might be forced to close with
a total loss of nearly 2,500 jobs if the government imposed value added tax
on their cover prices, a report commissioned by the Newspaper Society said
yesterday.
The impact of a 17.5 per cent tax on newspapers was described as
'catastrophic' by consultants Price Waterhouse in the report for the
society, which represents most regional and local newspapers.
The study forecasts that the imposition of VAT in one of this year's Budgets
would reduce the circulation of paid-for regional and local newspapers by
more than 1m from the current 13.24m. Many newspaper groups would be pushed
into loss after two years of the tax, the study says.
A survey of newspaper publishers has found that they would close 20 per cent
of their titles if VAT was introduced. That would mean the closure of 245
regional and local newspapers out of a total of 1,265.

<TEXT>
BARCLAYS BANK is to shed 450 jobs in order to centralise processing of
cheques and credit at its Northampton clearing centre, John Gapper writes.
The jobs form part of the 9,000 total the bank expects to lose over the next
three years.
The bank also said it would cut 1,000 jobs in London with the closure of its
clearing centre there, but would create an additional 450 posts in
Northampton. The move to Northampton will take place over the next four
years.
Barclays said it could not rule out some compulsory redundancies. The move
was described as 'a bitter blow' by the Bifu banking union.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Junior staff 'take more sick leave'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENCOURAGING employees to feel in control of their jobs will reduce sickness
absence, says a study of the Civil Service published today.
The survey of the backgrounds and health records of 10,000 non-industrial
civil servants in 20 London departments found 'striking' differences between
amounts of sick leave and grades of work. Men in lower posts were six times
more likely to take sickness absence than their most senior colleagues.
A relationship was also established between employees' attitudes to work and
the likelihood of reporting sick.
The study, which was by the University College and Middlesex medical school,
London, showed that men and women who rated their jobs lowly for control,
variety, use of skills and satisfaction were more likely to take sick leave.
This was most marked among employees who felt unable to control their
working environment and use their range of skills sufficiently: their
sickness absence rates were up to 82 per cent higher than for colleagues who
were satisfied with those aspects of their jobs.
Certified sickness absence causes the UK more than 370m lost working days a
year at a cost of about Pounds 5bn, according to the study, which was
published in today's British Medical Journal.
The survey says the variations in sickness absence 'cannot be attributed to
employees in the lower grades being more likely to take the odd day off, or
to those in the higher grades staying at work despite minor illness'.
The study suggests that financial worries, class-related health factors such
as smoking, and influences outside the workplace such as family
relationships account for some of the differences in sickness absencebetween
the civil service grades.

FT  05 FEB 93 / British Gas offers poor service, say rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE OF the UK's leading independent gas marketing companies expressed their
anger in a letter to British Gas yesterday about alleged poor standards of
service from the company's transportation arm.
British Gas is required to transport gas owned by rivals along its pipelines
as a way of introducing more competition. But the independent shippers say
British Gas does not have adequate systems to deal with the changing market.
The five companies say they have been waiting since October for monthly
meter readings by British Gas so that they can bill their customers.
'We've been severely damaged by this,' said Mr Norman Ellis, managing
director of Kinetica. 'The present system is too cumbersome and complex to
work in the current market.'
Mr Donald Young, managing director of gas transmission at British Gas, said:
'We're moving heaven and earth to sort out this problem. The number of sites
involved has grown from 6,000 in October to 27,000 on February 1.'
Mr Young said there were 'teething problems' with the system to handle the
extra business. British Gas has been caught on the hop by the rapid
development of competition in the industrial and commercial market. Rival
shippers supply nearly half of the market for firm gas (where supplies are
not subject to interruption), which represents half the overall industrial
gas market.
The rival shippers, however, suspect that British Gas's poor service
reflects antipathy towards competition. Their letter notes that while the
independents are suffering delays on meter reading and billing, British
Gas's own customers are receiving that service in a timely manner.
Mr Young denied the claim. He said: 'We are working flat-out to make sure
competitors get all the back-up they need from us.' The shippers' letter to
Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, stresses that they have
made many complaints to the company's transportation arm, but that, rather
than improving, the service has become worse.
Ofgas, the industry regulator, says it has received numerous complaints
about transportation. It is looking at the introduction of a list of service
standards to which British Gas would have to adhere in its dealings with
shippers.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Washington sets up early meeting of G7
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration last night signalled a desire for more effective
global co-ordination of economic policies by announcing an early meeting in
Europe of ministers from the Group of Seven industrial countries and saying
that Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, will attend.
The decision to hold a G7 meeting earlier than expected, later this month or
in early March, was unveiled by a Treasury official. It is a sign of the
importance attached by the White House to promotion of faster growth
worldwide.
Momentum has been building for a G7 meeting, including a call on Monday by
Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, for a spring summit of the
G7 to co-ordinate macroeconomic policy.
Yesterday, Mr Delors made an impassioned plea for vigorous leadership to
relaunch world economic growth, combined with a warning that, if the EC
could not co-ordinate policy with the US, it would have to stand up to it.
The meeting of G7 ministers will give Mr Bentsen an early opportunity to get
acquainted with his counterparts in other G7 countries.
However, he is certain to discuss ways to stimulate growth and stabilise
European currencies. The US administration is acutely aware that
recessionary forces abroad could depress US exports and weaken what looks to
be a promising domestic recovery.
Since his nomination as treasury secretary, Mr Bentsen has repeatedly stated
his determination to 'reinvigorate' the G7 consultation process.
Mr Delors's remarks come amid worsening relations with the US after
Washington's imposition of anti-dumping duties on European steel and its
threat to block EC bids for US public procurement contracts.
'Over the last couple of years, there has been a total lack of world
leadership: a drop in co-operation between the G7, a drop in co-operation
between the (EC) member states,' he told a European Socialist conference on
jobs and growth.
The result was punishing interest rates, mayhem on the currency markets, and
no macroeconomic co-ordination. 'The speculators are virtually running
things,' he said.
He denounced the US's unilateral imposition of trade sanctions on the EC. He
referred angrily to what he called President Bill Clinton's 'need to preen
in front of the mirror to make sure that his muscles are still firm', and
said that, if Europe allowed itself to be trampled on by Washington's trade
policy, 'I disavow that Europe'.
Mr Delors told the conference that 'classic models of growth are not
sufficient to produce jobs', and that 'the Community cannot survive without
an industrial policy'. In wide-ranging, unscripted remarks, he said the EC
should also reappraise whether it could let itself be undercut by
competitors with sweat-shop labour conditions, remarks taken to refer to
questions of whether Mexico comes to agreements with the US and Canada on
environmental standards and working conditions, under the North American
Free Trade Area treaty.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Clinton seeks further defence cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLINTON administration is looking for further cuts in US defence
spending, despite warnings that it may prove difficult even to achieve the
savings already projected by the Bush administration.
Defence Department officials have been asked to find savings of about
Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.93bn) from the Dollars 280.5bn national defence
budget for the 1994 fiscal year, submitted by President George Bush shortly
before he left office last month.
Press reports said the army, navy and air force would each be asked for
Dollars 2.5bn-Dollars 3bn in savings on the Bush budget which, although
Dollars 6bn higher than last year's defence budget, represented a drop in
inflation-adjusted terms. These cuts are expected to require troop
reductions beyond levels planned by Mr Bush.
Additional savings were expected from the strategic defence initiative,
which the administration is expected to strip of the ambitious, space-based
components favoured by the Bush and Reagan administrations.
President Bill Clinton has promised to cut Dollars 60bn from the defence
budget over five years, but Mr Les Aspin, defence secretary, has warned that
the Bush budget base-lines already assume substantial savings that may be
difficult to achieve and include plans for big weapons systems that have not
had adequate funds allocated to them over the long term.
Mr Aspin is also expected to add funds for some programmes in his budget,
especially in the field of helping defence industries convert to civil
operations.
Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate armed services committee, has
sounded even more ominous, cautioning that the department may have
overstated the savings from a review of its management practices by as much
as Dollars 50bn, and that the Bush plans for a 450-ship navy are unworkable
on the money currently budgeted.
Congressman John Murtha, chairman of the House sub-committee that approves
the details of the defence budget, has also warned that defence savings may
prove hard to find unless the US scales down overseas operations such as its
present involvement in Somalia.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, will travel to the Middle East
in two weeks' time, in an attempt to revive the stalled negotiations between
Israel, its Arab neighbours and the Palestinians.
Multilateral talks, which had been scheduled to begin next week in Rome and
Washington, were formally postponed this week because of the continuing
dispute over Israel's deportation of 415 Palestinians suspected by Israel of
links to the Hamas terrorist movement.
Mr Christopher's efforts to broker a solution to the deportation crisis
resulted in Israel's agreement this week to take back 100 of the
Palestinians who are now languishing in no-man's-land between Israel and
Lebanon.
Israel's decision was enough to ensure US support against any UN attempt to
impose sanctions, but it has not been enough to calm Palestinian anger at
the deportations.
Mr Christopher is expected to meet Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign
minister, in Washington before leaving for the Middle East, and is expected
to arrive in Israel on February 17.
He will remain in the region - visiting Jordan, Syria, Egypt and possibly
Lebanon - until February 24, and then stop in Europe on his way home.
Reuter adds from Jerusalem: An Israeli foreign ministry official said Mr
Christopher had indicated yesterday to the foreign minister that the Middle
East peace talks might resume in mid-April.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Portuguese gas talks collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO YEARS of negotiations on an Es103bn (Dollars 704m) project to pipe
natural gas into Portugal have collapsed.
The deadlock calls into question the Lisbon government's plan to introduce
natural gas by 1995 as an alternative to coal and oil. Portugal is the only
European Community country without a natural gas supply system.
The collapse also leaves a question mark over a 900MW plant powered by
natural gas and being constructed in Portugal by a Siemens-led consortium,
and over plans for another, similar plant to be built by 2001. Also, plans
to buy liquefied national gas (LNG) from Algeria will almost certainly be
scrapped.
The government called off talks between Natgas, an international consortium
led by Gaz de France (GDP) and Electricidade de Portugal (EDP), Portugal's
power company, after the two had failed to agree on prices and risk-sharing.
'We would rather have no deal than a bad deal,' Mr Luis Pereira, Portugal's
energy secretary of state, said. He blamed GDF, saying it had expected EDP
to take on exaggerated risks. It had insisted on too high a demand price for
fixed costs and had undermined the talks by reviving already agreed
questions close to negotiating deadlines.
Lisbon is now studying alternatives.
'We are not giving up on natural gas,' said Mr Pereira. 'It is our
alternative fuel for the future.'

FT  05 FEB 93 / Productivity in US increased 2.7% last year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT WILL not be long before people start talking of a US 'productivity
miracle'.
Figures published yesterday confirmed that output per hour in non-farm
businesses is growing at its fastest rate in two decades. Productivity rose
at an annual rate of 4 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year, and by
2.7 per cent in 1992 as whole. This represents a sharp turnaround after five
years in which productivity growth averaged about 0.5 per cent a year.
In recent congressional testimony, Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve
chairman, claimed the post-recession US economy was a 'different animal'. If
recent productivity gains were sustained, he said, the potential US
long-term growth rate might be substantially higher than the 2 to 2.5 per
cent assumed by most analysts.
The chairman said the reasons for faster productivity growth were not fully
understood but it probably reflected 'accelerating advances in computer
software and applications' that were making possible big gains in efficiency
in all sectors of the economy. Capital investment in computer technology has
soared in recent quarters.
The most encouraging aspect of yesterday's figures was the confirmation that
productivity is now rising rapidly in service-sector companies (everything
from banking and insurance to retailing and tourism), which account for
about three quarters of economic activity.
Manufacturing productivity grew at an annual rate of 3.8 per cent in the
fourth quarter, slightly slower than overall productivity, implying that
service industries, if anything, are improving their efficiency even more
rapidly than are manufacturers.
This is a new development. In the 1980s, US manufacturing productivity rose
rapidly as companies came to terms with tougher global competition. OECD
figures, for example, indicate that US manufacturing productivity grew by
about 55 per cent between 1980 and 1991, compared with gains of less than 40
per cent in Japan and Germany.
But inefficiency in the sprawling US service sector meant that overall
productivity growth was only about a third of the average pace of 1.5 per
cent a year in the industrialised world as a whole.
Better productivity figures augur well for inflation because the growth of
labour costs per unit of output is falling rapidly. Unit labour costs rose
at an annual rate of 0.6 per cent in the fourth quarter and by 0.7 per cent
relative to the equivalent period in 1991, the smallest annual rise since
the mid-1960s. If sustained, such low increases in unit labour costs could
result in a fall in inflation below the consensus forecast of 2.5 to 3 per
cent this year.
The surge in productivity growth explains a hitherto puzzling feature of the
current recovery: the juxtaposition of very bullish news on economic growth
(such as the 5.3 per gain in factory orders between November and December
reported yesterday) with depressing reports of big job cuts at leading
blue-chip companies such as IBM and Sears Roebuck.
For the first time since 1945, the US is experiencing a 'jobless recovery'.
Nearly all the growth of gross domestic product has reflected gains in
productivity, rather than increases in employment, which has barely moved
since the official end of the recession nearly two years ago.
Analysts are keenly awaiting the US employment figures for January, due
today, in the hope they will show the beginnings of a revival in
job-creation. But the chances are the US will have to learn to love
productivity-led growth.

THE EC Commission and Japan will hold their first meeting of trade experts
in Tokyo this month, in an attempt to ease friction over Japan's growing
trade surplus with the EC.
The February 23 meeting will look at why Japan's trade surplus with the EC
is widening. After a second meeting, the results will be reported to
Japan-EC sub-cabinet level talks scheduled for April.
The decision to hold the talks comes amid growing EC concern over its
deteriorating trade balance with Japan.
At a meeting of European businessmen on Tuesday, Sir Leon Brittan, EC
commissioner for external economic affairs, made clear his concern. He urged
Japan to make more effort to remove structural barriers to trade and create
an environment in which European companies could compete on equal terms with
their Japanese competitors.
Japan's trade surplus with Europe increased 14 per cent to a record Dollars
31.18bn (Pounds 20.6bn), according to Japanese government estimates last
month.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said Japan was increasing
efforts to stimulate imports from the EC and expected to see a gradual
improvement.

CRITICS OF the US baseball industry have welcomed the decision of the major
league's executive council to suspend Mrs Marge Schott, owner of the
Cincinnatti Reds team, for repeated derogatory remarks about blacks and
Jews.
The critics warned, however, that they want more progress towards ending the
sport's virtual exclusion of blacks from senior management positions.
Mrs Schott, the only woman owner of a major league baseball team, is known
for an eccentric management style that has alienated many of her employees.
She will be fined Dollars 25,000 and suspended from running the club for a
year, although she may apply for reinstatement after nine months if she
undertakes racial sensitivity training.
Mr Kweisi Mfume, chairman of the US Congress Black Caucus, said: 'The real
issue is ending the system of major league apartheid that for too long has
been part of our national athletic make-up.'

and said that if Europe allowed itself to be trampled on by Washington's
trade policy, 'I dis-avow that Europe'.
Mr Delors told the conference that 'classic models of growth are not
sufficient to produce jobs', and that 'the Community cannot survive without
an industrial policy'. This was not a case of 'backing so-called
Euro-champions', he said.
In his wide-ranging, unscripted remarks, Mr Delors said the EC should also
reappraise whether it could let itself be undercut by competitors with
sweat-shop labour conditions. 'We should distinguish. . . between those
(countries) which share the fruits of their trade and those which simply
exploit their workers.'
Behind this remark, senior EC officials are watching with intense interest
to see if the Clinton administration insists that Mexico comes to agreements
with the US and Canada on environmental standards and working conditions, as
part of the North American Free Trade Area treaty.

THE EC Commission and Japan will hold their first meeting of trade experts
in Tokyo this month, in an attempt to ease friction over Japan's growing
trade surplus with the EC.
The meeting, set for February 23, will look at why Japan's trade surplus
with the EC is widening. After a second meeting, the results will be
reported to Japan-EC sub-cabinet level talks scheduled for April.
The decision to hold the talks comes amid growing EC concern over its
deteriorating trade balance with Japan.
At a meeting of European businessmen on Tuesday, Sir Leon Brittan, EC
Commissioner for external economic affairs, made clear his concern. He urged
Japan to make more effort to remove structural barriers to trade and create
an environment in which European companies could compete on equal terms with
their Japanese competitors.
Japan's trade surplus with Europe increased 14 per cent to a record Dollars
31.18bn (Pounds 20.6bn), according to Japanese government estimates last
month.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said Japan was increasing
efforts to stimulate imports from the EC and expected to see a gradual
improvement. It said Japan was working to correct the imbalance by, for
example, extending for another two years a special tax break for companies
which increase imports to Japan.
Japan's official view is that trade imbalances require macroeconomic
measures rather than short-term adjustments.
The EC imported Dollars 62.5bn of goods from Japan but exported only Dollars
31.3bn to that country. The value of cars imported from Japan to the EC last
year, up to November, increased 9.7 per cent to Dollars 13.6bn, while the
value of EC-made cars imported into Japan fell 11.3 per cent to Dollars
4.7bn.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Portuguese gas talks collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO YEARS of negotiations on an Es103bn (Dollars 704m) project to pipe
natural gas into Portugal have collapsed.
The deadlock calls into question the Lisbon government's plan to introduce
natural gas by 1995 as an alternative to coal and oil. Portugal is the only
European Community country without a natural gas supply system.
The collapse also leaves a question mark over a 900MW plant powered by
natural gas and being constructed in Portugal by a Siemens-led consortium,
and over plans for another, similar plant to be built by 2001. Also, plans
to buy liquefied national gas (LNG) from Algeria will almost certainly be
scrapped.
The government called off talks between Natgas, an international consortium
led by Gaz de France (GDP) and Electricidade de Portugal (EDP), Portugal's
power company, after the two had failed to agree on prices and risk-sharing.
'We would rather have no deal than a bad deal,' Mr Luis Pereira, Portugal's
energy secretary of state, said. He blamed GDF, saying it had expected EDP
to take on exaggerated risks. It had insisted on too high a demand price for
fixed costs and had undermined the talks by reviving already agreed
questions close to negotiating deadlines.
GDF refused to comment in detail yesterday, beyond stressing that it was up
to Natgas to respond. 'Gaz de France, like all the partners, remains
determined to bring off this project, which it estimates to be viable, if
only the points in dispute can be overcome,' said the group.
Natgas's largest shareholder is Gas de Portugal, the local gas distribution
group, with 25 per cent, followed by GDF (23 per cent), Total (13 per cent),
Ruhrgas (13 per cent), the Portuguese government (10 per cent), and two
Portuguese companies with 8 per cent each. But GDF led the negotiations and
was to be industrial operator, said an official of the French group.
Lisbon is now studying alternatives.
'We are not giving up on natural gas,' said Mr Pereira. 'It is our
alternative fuel for the future.'

FT  05 FEB 93 / What bakers say about Major: How a sector of small business
is surviving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major conjured with the image of a 'homely' local bakery to evoke a
benign image of his free-market philosophy when he made his Carlton Club
speech on Wednesday.
But how do bakers see the impact of the prime minister's policies?
Mr David Harbourne, director of the National Association of Master Bakers,
took Mr Major's comments as a pat on the back for his members' efforts to
improve their service.
'We do have the friendly face behind the counter which Mr Major touched on,
but we are not doing anywhere near as well as we might,' he says.
He pointed out that small bakers have been particularly badly hit by the
recession, as well as by Sunday opening by supermarket chains and uniform
business rate increases.
Mr Patrick Cross, owner of the Holborn Bakery in central London, has been
affected by high interest rates and says rent for his premises has doubled
in six years while nearby shops stand empty.
'We are in the middle of London and a lot of our customers are office
workers,' he explains. 'Many firms have moved out of this area in recent
years because of rent and rates and a lot of people have been made
redundant, so our customer base has dropped quite drastically.'
But for one baker in Bristol, Mr Major's 'workfare' proposal is the real
cause for alarm. His independent bakery in the Montpelier area has a high
proportion of residents claiming social security benefits. 'As long as they
keep on paying so many people for nothing, we will be all right.'

The institute has developed a 'mission statement' after more than 100 years
of living with its Royal Charter aim: 'To advance accounting in all its
aspects.'
The statement says it will 'promote high standards of objectivity, integrity
and technical competence, thereby serving the interests of both the public
and its members and enhancing the value of the qualification chartered
accountant.'
The institute also intends to develop proposals for advanced qualifications.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Exporters angry at cost of cover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of British jobs are at risk and hundreds of millions of pounds in
exports are being lost because of the high cost and limited availability of
export credit cover, says a group of leading British exporters.
Recent examples include a Pounds 40m contract to build a urea complex in
China that will now be bid for by Snamprogetti in Italy instead of the
company's Basingstoke subsidiary. That is because an export credit insurance
premium of 2.1 per cent was offered by Italy's state insurer compared with
the 5.6 per cent premium required by Britain's Export Credits Guarantee
Department.
Exporters are inflamed by a letter from the ECGD this week telling them that
'as a result of recent business success in the (Indonesian) market, ECGD
cover is now fully committed and therefore we cannot currently accommodate'
cover for more business.
The letter arrived days after an intensive and strongly supported
export-promotion seminar on Indonesia in London by the Department of Trade
and Industry.
Evidence was presented this week to the Commons trade and industry committee
by a group of 10 leading UK companies active in construction, power plant
and engineering. They said the high cost of UK export finance presented
exporters with 'one of two unpalatable alternatives: to abandon the business
altogether, or to try to move as much work as possible offshore to countries
whose export credit authorities are more accommodating'.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Spending on roads to reach record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECORD road spending means work will start on 41 new national road schemes
in the year beginning this April, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary,
told MPs yesterday.
The biggest single project will upgrade 13 miles of the A1 between Walshford
and Dishforth in North Yorkshire to motorway status.
A fourth lane will be added to 18 miles of motorway, including the M25 in
Surrey and the M62 in Greater Manchester, and work will start on the
remaining M65 link around Blackburn, Lancashire.
Other schemes include improvements to the A66 northern trans-Pennine road,
the A11 to Norwich and the A27 south coast route, and by-passes for 19
communities.
The government's plans mean Pounds 2.09bn will be spent. The figure includes
Pounds 1.4bn for construction and Pounds 550m for maintenance.
Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said that although the
programme would be welcome in certain areas, it contrasted vividly with
plans to halve British Rail's investment.
Mr MacGregor said the plans would bring substantial economic, safety and
environmental benefits, and provide 30,000 jobs in construction.
'The value of the benefits from accidents avoided and time saved to road
users has been assessed at Pounds 2.5bn, and this is before any allowance
for the net environmental gain achieved by reducing urban congestion and
taking traffic away from town and village centres,' he said.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Sell-off fears stall Scottish rail plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRATHCLYDE regional council, which funds the railway network in the Greater
Glasgow area, yesterday suspended new investment worth Pounds 52m in trains
and tracks because of uncertainty about the network's future under the
government's railway privatisation, James Buxton writes.
Mr Malcolm Waugh, chairman of the council's transport committee, said it
wanted firm commitments from the government that the Strathclyde passenger
transport executive would be involved in the franchising of ScotRail,
British Rail's Scottish operation, and that fares would remain subsidised.
On Tuesday Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, announced that
ScotRail would be one of the first British Rail areas to be managed
autonomously as a prelude to being franchised to private operators after
April 1994.
Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive makes decisions about rail
services in its area and is the largest PTE in Britain. ScotRail operates
the trains, and the regional council puts in an annual subsidy of Pounds
30m, investing Pounds 150m over the past 10 years.
The committee's decision means that the award of a contract for 23 diesel
multiple units, due to be made in the next two months, will be delayed.
Three railway manufacturers have tendered for the work.
In addition, no contracts will be awarded for a Pounds 28m rail link joining
the electric railway networks of north and south Glasgow, and work worth
between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m on a new suburban line from central Glasgow
to Milngavie will not go ahead.
A Pounds 4.5m project to convert a freight line between Rutherglen and
Coatbridge into a passenger line with six new stations is also to be frozen.
All these projects are being partly financed with the use of European
Community structural funds.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Police back cut in senior staff numbers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY POLICE officers favour abolishing some senior ranks to create a flatter
management structure, according to research commissioned for the
government's inquiry into police responsibility and rewards.
The research, by Ernst &amp; Young, management consultants, is one of the most
extensive examinations of the police conducted. Its findings make it
probable that when the inquiry reports in May, it will recommend a simpler
management structure and some form of performance-related pay.
Some provincial police forces have already delegated more responsibility to
local level, cutting down on chief superintendents. The Ernst &amp; Young survey
says the ranks of chief superintendent and chief inspector are the most
popular candidates among officers for abolition.
The survey says an important aspect of change in the police service over
recent years has been the 'injection of local innovation and experimentation
with different management systems'. This trend has the potential to
'increase the responsibilities and accountability of individual officers'.
Sir Patrick Sheehy, the chairman of BAT Industries who is chairing the
inquiry, said the study had identified opportunities to improve
accountability and operational effectiveness.
Lord Edmund-Davies, who conducted the last inquiry into police pay and
conditions in 1977-78, identified four factors that made police work unique
 -the independent status of the constable; risk of assault and injury;
prohibition of the right to strike; and disruption to family life. The new
report says there is no evidence that these have changed.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Plants may be left out of Daf rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DUTCH and Belgian operations of Daf, Western Europe's sixth-largest
truckmaker, may be demerged into a specially created company, financed by
local banks and the Dutch government.
The UK operations would not be transferred to the new company, senior
bankers said yesterday. Much of the UK's operations, which employ 5,500
people, could close.
Bankers said that the main truck plant at Leyland in Lancashire might be
sold to management, but the Birmingham van plant and Glasgow axle plant were
at risk.
They added that Daf's administrators - appointed on Tuesday under Dutch
insolvency law - are working on the demerger proposal with local bankers and
government officials.
Any demerger would need to be approved by the group's banks, principally a
consortium of nine led by the Dutch bank, ABN Amro. A formal proposal should
be submitted in the next three weeks.
New startling details also emerged yesterday about the extent of the
truckmaker's financial problems. A confidential report by accountants
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, prepared for Daf in the past few weeks, estimated that
the company's 1992 losses were in excess of Fl800m (Pounds 304m).
Coopers was studying the financial implications of a restructuring plan
based on work by both Daf and the consultants Arthur D. Little.
Under this plan, Daf would have abandoned van manufacturing and sought an
outside partner in light trucks. Vans are made at a Birmingham plant with
2,000 employees and light trucks are assembled at the Leyland plant, which
has 2,200 employees.
The biggest portion of last year's estimated loss stemmed from Coopers'
estimate that the company should make a charge of Fl580m to cover the costs
of restructuring its operations. Trading losses were more than Fl200m.
In order to carry out the reconstruction, Coopers estimated that Daf needed
to raise Fl800m of new finance in 1993. In 1994, a further Fl500m would have
been needed plus another Fl250m in 1995.
Under the rescue plan, this external finance would have come from three main
sources:
Daf's commercial banks.
The Dutch government and the Flemish regional authorities.
Holders of Daf's preference shares and debentures.
The scale of the new money required demonstrates why three UK banks and
Generale de Banque of Belgium refused on Monday to accede to a last-minute
demand from the Dutch and Flemish governments that the main providers of
finance should back the medium-term rescue plan.
These banks - whose UK members are National Westminster, Lloyds and Barclays
 -were prepared to put up funds only for the businesses' immediate
requirements. But they repeated their earlier demand that outside
accountants should verify Coopers' hastily prepared estimates of Daf's
future financing needs.
Not all the new money would have come in the form of new bank loans. Much of
it would have been conversions of debt into equity or injections from the
two governments.
Nevertheless, banks had already lent Fl900m to Daf's manufacturing
operations, plus a further Fl2bn to its finance companies.
They were therefore reluctant to give a commitment to put in hundreds of
millions more, until they knew how much was required.
Coopers said that if the restructuring was carried out, Daf would break even
in the current year. It also forecast a profit of Fl150m in 1994 and profits
of Fl200m in 1995.
The proposed restructuring was radical. In order to keep Daf's 1,300-strong
dealer network supplied with light commercial vehicles, the company had
planned to seek to purchase vans from another producer and then re-badge
them with the Daf name.
The Little study also concluded that Daf's position in the light truck
market was not strong enough to justify continuing to make these vehicles on
its own in Lancashire.
Daf would have searched for another partner in this business, such as MAN of
Germany or possibly Mercedes-Benz. Talks had been taking place with
Mercedes-Benz since last autumn about a possible exchange of components or
products.
However, the study concluded that Daf had a strong position in heavy and
medium size trucks and that an independent future manufacturing these was
possible.
It recommended that the company should buy a greater proportion of its
components and parts from outside manufacturers and should abandon its
integrated approach to manufacturing - it makes its own engines and axles.
Little said that in general the company needed to change the emphasis of the
business from volume manufacturing to profitability.
The restructuring proposals stemmed from a general analysis of Daf's
strengths and weaknesses. The weaknesses included the following:
Daf is the smallest of the full-line truck makers in Europe and the only
non-car maker with a van line.
It is too dependent on the UK, where margins on big trucks are the slimmest
in Europe and which has been hardest hit by the recession. Its presence in
Germany is far too small.
It tries to make too wide a range. As a result, the investment programme
required to keep it competitive is far too expensive, given its limited
financial resources.
Its interest burden, running at around Fl20m a year, is too high.
On the other hand, some strengths were listed:
It has the second newest range of truck models in Europe after Iveco (though
this advantage is about to disappear, as rivals introduce new models).
It is relatively good at serving customers, with an effective sales/service
network.
Though sales volumes have slumped, margins have held up relatively well.
Daf also confirmed yesterday that it had received a short-term bridging loan
from its banks and the Dutch government to allow it to continue trading for
a month. It has received a loan of more than Fl100m, including Fl60m from
the banking consortium.
Mr John Talbot, the administrative receiver for Leyland Daf in the UK, is
expected to meet the Dutch administrators for the first time today in the
Netherlands.

LIMITED production resumed yesterday at Leyland Daf's truck plant in
Leyland, Lancashire, as the receivers reactivated component supply lines
that had been halted on Tuesday when the truck group collapsed.
The 2,000 employees at Leyland Daf's van plant, at Washwood Heath,
Birmingham, are to resume production today.
In Amsterdam, Daf said it expects regular production at its Eindhoven and
Westerlo truck facilities to resume on Monday. At present both its Dutch and
Belgian truck plants are suffering parts shortages.
Daf said the receivers of Leyland Daf would travel to Daf headquarters at
Eindhoven 'in the near future' for talks.
Meanwhile, all 5,500 of Leyland Daf's employees were at their workplaces
yesterday and its UK network of 54 dealers were told that they could take
and place orders.
The Leyland plant produced only a handful of trucks yesterday because of
components shortage. 'But the situation has been getting easier throughout
the day,' said one employee.
A spokesman for Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop, the receivers, said
the intention was to resume 'business as normal' as quickly as possible
while alternative strategies for the future of the UK operations were
studied.
He indicated that an initial assessment of whether and how the UK operations
might be put on the market could be in place by early next week.
More than half of the UK dealers say they will continue at their own expense
to undertake warranty and other work normally paid for by Leyland Daf.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Judge demands end to obstruction of Iraq probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Justice Scott, who is heading an investigation into British
defence-related exports to Iraq, is increasing pressure on government
departments he believes are obstructing his inquiry, threatening to name
those that do not provide documents.
It emerged last night that some Whitehall officials were withholding
information Lord Justice Scott has requested since beginning his inquiry two
months ago.
The inquiry team has received 170 volumes of original documents containing
more than 30,000 pages, mostly from government departments and including
intelligence agencies.
Officials close to Lord Justice Scott would not identify the departments
that have yet to provide documents considered relevant. But the judge is
understood to be determined to secure all relevant documentation even if it
means forcing the issue in public.
In a statement yesterday, Mr Christopher Muttukumaru, the secretary to the
inquiry team, confirmed that Lord Justice Scott still intended that hearings
'should as far as possible be held in public'.
Lord Justice Scott plans to announce details of the arrangements within five
weeks, although he is believed to have set himself the end of the year as
the date by which he is likely to conclude his inquiry.
In a statement yesterday, Mr Muttukumaru said: 'Lord Justice Scott has
called for original documents from a number of departments and from the
intelligence agencies. Further material has been sought from Whitehall
departments and we expect to receive it over the next few weeks.'
The Scott inquiry was set up by the government in response to claims -
arising during the aborted trial of executives of machine-tool makers Matrix
Churchill - that government departments had colluded in trade with Iraq in
breach of official guidelines.
Lord Justice Scott has made clear his determination to draw up a thorough
and detailed report that would not be open to accusations of a political
whitewash.
Officials said last night that witnesses called to give evidence in public
could include former or present ministers, although no list has been drawn
up yet.
Mr Tam Dalyell, Labour MP for Linlithgow, in a Commons clash with the prime
minister, questioned the inclusion of the public-interest immunity issue in
the terms of reference of the Scott inquiry, Ivor Owen writes.
Four ministers signed public-interest immunity certificates to prevent
confidential government documents being used as evidence in the Matrix
Churchill trial.
Mr Dalyell said the Commons should not have to await the outcome of the
Scott inquiry to discover why it had been necessary to protect the
ministers.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Lloyd's disbands committees in radical shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London yesterday announced a radical overhaul of its complex
committee structure as part of efforts to improve management and cut costs.
The insurance market will disband 31 of 48 committees that advise or act on
behalf of the council, the market's governing body. Their functions will be
taken over by new market and regulatory boards.
Mr David Rowland, chairman, said the changes represented a 'very substantial
change in the way we handle our affairs' and would bring Lloyd's into line
with standard corporate practice.
Mr Rowland said members of the two new boards would be asked to take
individual responsibility for areas of work - ranging from training to
registration of agencies and brokers - formerly handled by committee. These
individuals would be accountable to the council.
Mr Rowland said Lloyd's had been 'bedevilled for years' by its committee
structure. Representatives of agencies and brokers spent too much time on
committee business. The committees were also a 'drain' on the resources of
the corporation, which administers and regulates Lloyd's.
The changes are part of an extensive review of business practices at
Lloyd's, started when Mr Peter Middleton became chief executive last
September.
Lloyd's announced late last year that 200 of the 2,200 jobs at the
corporation would go as part of a Pounds 26.6m budget cut. The market's
agency structure - which links Names with their syndicates - is among a
number of areas under review by the market board, which expects to announce
details of a 'business plan' for Lloyd's in the second half of April.
Lloyd's announced that 100 syndicates intended to insure against terrorist
damage as part of a new mutual company being formed by the UK insurance
industry.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Council wants pledge over rail franchise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRATHCLYDE regional council, which funds the railway network in the Greater
Glasgow area, yesterday suspended new investment worth Pounds 52m in trains
and tracks because of uncertainty about the network's future under the
government's railway privatisation plans.
Mr Malcolm Waugh, chairman of the council's transport committee, said it
wanted firm commitments from the government that the Strathclyde passenger
transport executive would be involved in the franchising of ScotRail,
British Rail's Scottish operation, and that fares would remain subsidised.
On Tuesday Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, announced that
ScotRail would be one of the first British Rail areas to be managed
autonomously as a prelude to being franchised to private operators after
April 1994.
Strathclyde passenger transport executive (PTE) makes decisions about rail
services in its area and is the largest PTE in Britain. ScotRail operates
the trains, and the regional council puts in an annual subsidy of Pounds
30m, investing Pounds 150m over the past 10 years.
The committee's decision means that the award of a contract for 23 new
diesel multiple units worth about Pounds 1m, due to be made in the next two
months, will be delayed. Three railway manufacturers have tendered for the
work.
In addition, no contracts will be awarded for a Pounds 28m rail link joining
the electric railway networks of north and south Glasgow, and work worth
between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m on a new suburban line from central Glasgow
to Milngavie will not go ahead.
A Pounds 4.5m project to convert a freight line between Rutherglen and
Coatbridge into a passenger line with six new stations is also to be frozen.
All these projects are being partly financed with the use of European
Community structural funds.
Mr Waugh said he met Mr MacGregor and Mr Roger Freeman, the railways
minister, last week, and they assured him that Strathclyde PTE would be
consulted after the House of Commons statement.
'Consultation is very nice but I want an assurance that the benefits of our
investment will go to the people of Strathclyde and not to the private
sector,' he said.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Major refuses consideration of aid for Daf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday brushed aside calls for government financial aid to
Leyland Daf as 'simply not realistic' in spite of mounting pressure from
Labour to rescue the truck maker, Ivo Dawnay writes.
During angry exchanges in the Commons Mr Major refused to make any
commitment to match any intervention in the company from the Netherlands or
Belgium.
He told Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, that the receivers had made clear
that parts of the business could be saved without state funding. 'I believe
that is the way to proceed,' he said.
Mr Smith refused to accept the decision, arguing that it was 'vital' to
British manufacturing industry that the company should not be allowed to
collapse.
Earlier the cabinet had heard a report from Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade
and industry secretary, on the company.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Exporters angry at cost of cover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of British jobs are at risk, and hundreds of millions of pounds in
exports is being lost, because of the high cost and limited availability of
export credit cover, says a group of leading British exporters.
Recent examples include a Pounds 40m contract to build a urea complex in
China that will now be bid for by Snamprogetti in Italy instead of the
company's Basingstoke subsidiary because an export credit insurance premium
of 2.1 per cent was offered by Italy's state insurer, compared with the 5.6
per cent premium required by Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department.
Exporters are inflamed by a letter from the ECGD this week telling them that
'as a result of recent business success in the (Indonesian) market, ECGD
cover is now fully committed and therefore we cannot currently accommodate'
cover for more business.
The letter arrived days after an intensive and strongly supported
export-promotion seminar on Indonesia in London by the Department of Trade
and Industry.
Evidence was presented this week to the Commons trade and industry select
committee by major British Exporters, 10 leading UK companies active in
construction, power plant and engineering, that the high cost of UK export
finance presented exporters with 'one of two unpalatable alternatives: to
abandon the business altogether, or to try to move as much work as possible
offshore to countries whose export credit authorities are more
accommodating'.
Mr John Fletcher, Trafalgar House's marketing and business development
director, said ECGD refusal to provide cover for a Pounds 200m contract to
build a synthetic medicine plant in Russia forced his company to give the
work to its US subsidiary, where the US Eximbank was willing to offer cover.
The exporters' group called for ECGD country coverage comparable with that
of competitors; for premium rates to be harmonised with those of competitor
countries; and for the government to provide aid-supported finance where
competitors provided it.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Receivers act to allow truck plant to restart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS and DAVID BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIMITED production resumed yesterday at Leyland Daf's truck plant in
Leyland, Lancashire, as the receivers reactivated component supply lines
that had been stopped on Tuesday when the truck group collapsed.
The 2,000 employees at Leyland Daf's van plant, at Washwood Heath,
Birmingham, are to resume production today.
In Amsterdam, Daf said it expects regular production at its Eindhoven and
Westerlo truck facilities to re-start on Monday. At present both its Dutch
and Belgian truck plants are suffering parts shortages.
As the UK plants began returning to life, Daf said the receivers of Leyland
Daf would be travelling to Daf headquarters at Eindhoven 'in the near
future' for consultations.
Meanwhile, all 5,500 of Leyland Daf's employees were at their workplaces
yesterday and its UK network of 54 dealers were told that they could take
and place orders.
The Leyland plant produced only a handful of trucks yesterday because of the
components shortage. 'But the situation has been getting easier throughout
the day,' said one employee.
A spokesman for Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop, the receivers, said
the intention was to resume 'business as normal' as quickly as possible
while alternative strategies for the future of the UK operations were
studied.
He indicated that an initial assessment of whether and how the UK operations
might be put on the market could be in place by early next week.
More than half of the UK dealer network has pledged to continue at their its
own expense to undertake warranty and other work ordinarily payable by
Leyland Daf, in a show of continued support for the truckmaker.
Meanwhile, some big fleet customers such as the Royal Mail and Parcelforce
were understood to be standing by substantial orders already placed with
Leyland Daf.
Leyland Daf unions yesterday also kept up pressure on the government,
demanding an early meeting with Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, to discuss ways of preserving the company.
Mr John Allen, chief negotiator with the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union, said up to 18,000 jobs could be lost, taking component and
other suppliers into account, if Leyland Daf went into liquidation.
Such an assessment is not seen as an exaggeration by most motor industry
analysts.
Mr Allen said the losses would be even worse if the Leyland Daf dealer
network, which employs just over 5,000 people, should collapse. But that may
not be likely.
'We would have no problem surviving - there are other franchises which would
love to snap us up,' said a director of North-east Leyland Daf, the
country's largest Daf dealer.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Poland set for showdown on size of budget deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND'S coalition government faces an important test of its budget policies
as parliament continues to press for a larger deficit than the International
Monetary Fund is willing to accept as the basis for a Dollars 660m (Pounds
437m) stand-by loan.
The government of Ms Hanna Suchocka is trying to hold this year's deficit to
81,000bn zlotys (Pounds 3.3bn), 5 per cent of GDP, a vital step it Poland is
to settle its financial affairs with western partners.
Western commercial banks will not sign a restructuring agreement on Dollars
12.3bn of debt unless the IMF agreement is in place. A further 20 per cent
reduction of western government debt worth Dollars 30.6bn is also predicated
on agreement with Washington.
The World Bank has said it will not free a Dollars 450m loan to help
restructure domestic and bank and company debts until the IMF deal is
agreed. Western governments are also waiting for the IMF before freeing
their shares of an unspent Dollars 1bn fund set up in 1989 to support
Poland's currency.
On Wednesday, the government lost another pensions vote in parliament, thus
raising spending this year by an extra 20,000bn zlotys to 30,000bn zlotys.
This, taken with other votes in the past few weeks, threatens to push this
year's deficit past 120,000bn zlotys.
The government now plans to stake all on a final vote on February 12, when
it will ask the 460-strong Sejm, parliament's more important chamber, to
shelve its previous decisions and approve the budget with its original
deficit figure of 5 per cent of GDP.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party yesterday called for more public
funds to be used to support stock prices, reflecting widespread concern that
the Tokyo market will fall sharply before the close of the fiscal year next
month.
An LDP committee on economic policy said yesterday only Y1,000bn (Pounds
5.3bn) of a maximum of Y2,820bn in public funds made available last year has
flowed into the stock market, and requested an urgent injection of fresh
funds.
Under an emergency economic package announced last August, managers of
postal and other public funds were given more freedom to invest in stocks,
up to the Y2,820bn level, but some managers are believed to have chosen
other, safer investments.
The Ministry of Finance has also attempted to prop up the Tokyo market by
urging banks and other financial institutions not to sell stocks before the
close of the fiscal year. In the final weeks of a fiscal year, Japanese
institutions generally sell stocks to realise profits and bolster their
accounts.
Members of the LDP committee plan to visit the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications and the Ministry of Health and Welfare, which control
most of the public funds, and request that the investments be made as soon
as possible.
However, the ministries have received many complaints from depositors and
pension fund members, who fear their money is being used in a risky share
support exercise. The ministries say the funds will play a limited role in
reviving the market, which will recover only when there is genuine investor
demand for stocks.
'People get the wrong idea about the sort of influence we have. If we invest
money at the right moment, we can have a limited impact on stock prices, but
we can't support the market indefinitely,' the Postal Ministry said.
But LDP officials will insist that the two ministries invest the full
Y2,820bn in shares by April, and they would like further public funds to be
set aside to ensure the longer-term health of the market.
The LDP, under pressure from the financial industry, has also begun studying
a plan to use public funds to assist the banking industry. There is concern
in the party that the banks' own Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company will
be unable to cope with the pile of non-performing property loans.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, has cancelled a visit to
Cambodia that he was due to begin next week, apparently because of the
continuing conflict there, officials disclosed last night. However, his plan
to make an official trip to Japan remains unchanged, Michael Littlejohns
writes from the United Nations in New York.
In a report to the UN Security Council on January 25, the secretary-general
announced his intention to go to Phnom Penh 'to review the situation
personally and study what further measures might be taken usefully to
reinforce the peace process.'
Mr Yasushi Akashi, head of the UN operation in Cambodia, now may be expected
to go to Tokyo next week to brief Mr Boutros Ghali on the situation,
following widespread ceasefire violations.
Mr Boutros Ghali is expected to be sounded out by the Japanese government on
its prospects of a permanent seat in the Security Council, an idea that has
been greeted with considerable coolness by Britain and France, although it
appears to have the support of the US.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Chinese steelmaker to cut 80,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BOB JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WUHAN Iron &amp; Steel, the fourth largest steelmaker in China, is to cut its
workforce by two-thirds in an effort to achieve western standards of
efficiency, Xinhua news agency reported yesterday.
However, none of the 80,000 workers affected will be out of a job. Wuhan's
decision appeared to conform with the stated aim of the country's paramount
leader, Deng Xiaoping, of breaking the 'iron rice bowl', which guarantees
workers' basic necessities from cradle to grave.
Last year, the plant, China's main producer of tinplate for can making,
produced just under 5m tonnes of crude steel with a workforce of 120,000. By
contrast, British Steel employed about 40,000 to produce 12.1m tonnes.
In reducing the number of workers and transferring them to ancillary
companies, Wuhan is treading a path already well worn in the west. British
Steel had to reduce its workforce radically in the 1980s. Italy's Ilva,
which has just hired a Japanese managing director, is following the same
route.
In Japan, where employees are used to having a job for life, steelmakers
have had to diversify to maintain employment as well as profits growth.
However, these companies have faced stagnant or declining markets for their
output. China is one of the very few places where steel demand is booming.
Imports are up steeply and, according to Mr Hafidzah Hassan, an analyst at
Asian Capital Partners in Singapore, the supply-demand gap will rise to 12
per cent this year.
Wuhan has not had the same high levels of investment as some of its large
rivals in China. The country's steel showpiece, Baoshan, in Shanghai, made
6.5m tonnes of crude steel in 1992, up from 4.7m the previous year.
Shougang, in Beijing, saw production rise to 5.7m from 4.9m.
Wuhan's production rose by just 380,000 tonnes. But, as a producer of sheet
steels, Wuhan remains a key player in the development of the Chinese steel
industry. Last year, it announced plans to invest in a tinplate facility in
the Pearl River delta near Hong Kong, adding to the huge growth of
investments in China's coastal regions.
China produced 80m tonnes of crude steel in 1992, 9m tonnes more than in the
previous year and the biggest increase in the world, and wants to produce
100m tonnes by 2000.
As steelmaking in China is hugely profitable, Wuhan's move to cut costs is
not necessitated by immediate fears of losing money. Rather, it is aimed to
create a leaner, more flexible organisation to help pay for investments and
prepare for the inevitable downside in this cyclical industry.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Japanese lose ground in drugs market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN and US drugs groups are threatening to dominate the world's market,
leaving their Japanese counterparts trailing, according to a study* by
Datamonitor, the London-based strategy consultants.
In particular, the European groups' dominance will be driven by their
innovative research and development, new products and international
marketing strength.
Only three Japanese companies, Takeda, Sankyo and Shionogi, are among the
world's top 25 drugs groups, and none is in the top 10. Japan ran a trade
deficit of more than Pounds 800m in 1989.
Repeated price cuts implemented by the Ministry of Health and Welfare have
seriously handicapped the Japanese industry. While drug prices in the US
increased by 40 per cent between 1982 and 1988, those in Japan fell 39 per
cent. In 1991 alone, Shionogi and Fujisawa suffered average price cuts of
9.5 per cent and 9 per cent. respectively.
Japanese groups have been hit disproportionately because of their dependence
on the domestic market. Takeda, the largest Japanese group, generates 98.6
per cent of its turnover in Japan.
Japanese spending on research and development has doubled in the past 10
years, though sales increased only 50 per cent. The Datamonitor report
warns, however, that the Japanese R&amp;D push may come too late, because of
increasing penetration of the Japanese market by western drugs groups. This,
it argues, is likely to accelerate a consolidation of the Japanese industry.

THE resignation of Algeria's foreign minister, Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, is a
considerable blow to the international reputation of the government of Prime
Minister Belad Abdessalam.
He is one of the Arab world's most respected diplomats. In 1989 he brokered
the Taif agreement that brought a measure of peace to Lebanon. His departure
late on Wednesday underlines the prime minister's desire for unchallenged
authority and his unwillingness to allow even a long-standing political
friend any great authority over his own department.
The daily Algerian newspaper El Watan said yesterday that the cabinet
reshuffle which followed Mr Brahimi's resignation suggests Mr Abdessalam has
no intention of negotiating with other political forces.
The embattled prime minister now faces two challenges. A year after
declaring war on Islamic fundamentalist groups, the security forces are
still mired in bloody clashes.
The second challenge is economic. The budget deficit is set to double this
year to AD168.3bn (Pounds 5.2bn).

ZAIRE'S three main donor states, the US, Belgium and France, yesterday
discussed options for forcing Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko to end his
27-year monopoly on government and transfer 'all powers' to his rival, Prime
Minister Etienne Tshisekedi, agencies report from Brussels.
Mr Herman Cohen, US assistant secretary of state, and his French and Belgian
counterparts, Mr Jean de la Sabliere and Mr Wilfried Jaenen, met for more
than five hours.
Diplomats said they discussed several possibilities, including the freezing
of Mr Mobutu's assets in foreign countries, the expulsion of his ambassadors
and fewer visas for his officials.
Diplomats said the three countries would co-ordinate action toward Zaire
during a mid-February meeting of the International Monetary Fund in
Washington.
The three countries said on Wednesday that the recent bloody riots and
reprisals in the capital, Kinshasa, which resulted in hundreds of deaths,
were due to Mr Mobutu's refusal to co-operate with Mr Tshisekedi's
transitional government or to yield any authority.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Keating braces himself against chilly wind from the west:
State election is crucial to the future of Australia's Labor government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN

   PERTH

<TEXT>
MR Paul Keating, Australia's Labor Prime Minister, will have his eyes fixed
firmly in a westerly direction on Saturday as the results come in from a
state election which could make or break his government.
The state of Western Australia (WA) is critical to the federal government,
which will need to hold most of its six marginal seats in the state to be
re-elected. So far, however, the signs are not encouraging.
Officially, Mr Keating played no part in the WA state government's decision
to go to the polls three months before its mandate expires. But no-one
doubts that Dr Carmen Lawrence, the state's Labor premier, called an early
poll partly to help clear the decks for a federal election expected on April
3.
Labor's strategy is to give WA voters a chance to vent their anger against
the party in the state election, in the hope that the faithful will return
to the fold in the federal poll.
Dr Lawrence, who in 1990 became Australia's first female state premier, has
tried to focus voters' attention on traditional Labor issues such as
education, health and social justice. But she has found it impossible to
distance herself or her party from the so-called WA Inc scandal, which has
fascinated Western Australians for the last five years.
A government-appointed royal commission reported late last year that the
normal processes of democratic government had virtually broken down under Mr
Brian Burke, who took the WA Labor party to power in the state in 1983, and
his successor, Mr Peter Dowding.
Their intention was to build a partnership with local business to encourage
economic growth and provide finance for ambitious social programmes.
The reality, the commission found, was a network of slush funds, backdoor
deals kept hidden from parliament, and 'the secret purchase of political
influence'.
Satchels stuffed with cash were kept in ministers' offices, political
cronies were appointed to highly paid public service jobs, and the
commission also found evidence of bribery.
The roller coaster crashed in 1990 when a desperate state cabinet replaced
Mr Dowding with Dr Lawrence, one of the few state Labor leaders not
implicated in the scandal.
Several local businessmen have since been convicted of offences related to
the scandal, and both Mr Burke and Mr Dowding face criminal charges. Mr
Burke's trial is scheduled to begin two days after the election.
Surprisingly, Dr Lawrence was given a breathing space by the state's
conservative opposition parties, which bickered their way to defeat in the
last two elections.
However, the Liberal Party and the National Party agreed in November to
unite under the leadership of Mr Richard Court, the recently elected Liberal
leader and son of a former Liberal premier.
Mr Court is no keener to discuss the details of WA Inc than Dr Lawrence,
mainly because another former Liberal premier is alleged to have accepted
ADollars 25,000 (Pounds 11,160) to help Alan Bond's Bond Corporation win
planning permission for a hotel project.
But he has successfully limited the damage to the conservative coalition by
concentrating on promises to clean up the public service and restore probity
to government.
'The royal commission showed that Labor had acted illegally and improperly,'
he says. 'They were always prone to put their own political interests ahead
of the interests of the people of WA, and Labor voters feel betrayed by
that.'
Unfortunately for Dr Lawrence, the only other significant issue in the
election is the state economy, which grew significantly faster than the rest
of Australia in the 1980s, but has slowed in the last two years.
Labor is forecasting growth of 4 per cent this year, but the positive
message is being ignored by voters who are more concerned about
unemployment, currently at 11.1 per cent.
The state government's growing desperation was underlined on Monday, when Dr
Lawrence suddenly agreed to a televised debate with Mr Court.
The debate provided little new information, but Mr Court was clearly the
winner because the premier was unable to dent his air of assurance.
Opinion polls give the conservatives a state-wide lead of up to 11 points,
which would be sufficient for a landslide victory if translated into votes
on Saturday.
However, even a uniform swing of 1 per cent would be enough to give the
conservatives the two seats they require to form a government, while a
comparatively modest swing of 4 per cent would cost Labor 12 seats.
The result is that Western Australia is almost certain to become the third
Labor domino to fall in the last year, following Tasmania and Victoria into
the conservative camp.
The best Mr Keating can hope for is a narrow conservative victory, followed
by a return to the fold by Labor voters in the federal election. But
precedent suggests that even this scenario is optimistic.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Chinese steelmaker to cut 80,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BOB JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WUHAN Iron &amp; Steel, the fourth largest steelmaker in China, is to cut its
workforce by two-thirds in an effort to achieve western standards of
efficiency, Xinhua news agency reported yesterday.
However, none of the 80,000 workers affected will find themselves out of a
job. Wuhan's decision appeared to conform with the stated aim of the
country's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, of breaking the 'iron rice bowl',
which guarantees workers' basic necessities from cradle to grave. Last year,
the plant, China's main producer of tinplate for can making, produced just
under 5m tonnes of crude steel with a workforce of 120,000. By contrast,
British Steel employed about 40,000 to produce 12.1m tonnes.
In cutting the number of workers and transferring them to ancillary
companies, Wuhan is treading a path already well worn in the west. British
Steel had to reduce its workforce radically in the 1980s. Italy's Ilva,
which has just hired a Japanese managing director, is following the same
route.
In Japan, where employees are used to having a job for life, steelmakers
have had to diversify to maintain employment as well as profits growth.
However, these companies have been faced by stagnant or declining markets
for their output. China is one of the very few places where steel demand is
booming.
Imports are up steeply and, according to Mr Hafidzah Hassan, an analyst at
Asian Capital Partners in Singapore, the supply-demand gap will rise to 12
per cent this year.
Wuhan has not had the same high levels of investment as some of its large
rivals in China. The country's steel showpiece, Baoshan, in Shanghai, made
6.5m tonnes of crude steel in 1992, up from 4.7m the previous year.
Shougang, in Beijing, saw production rise to 5.7m from 4.9m. Wuhan's
production rose by just 380,000 tonnes. But, as a producer of sheet steels,
Wuhan remains a key player in the development of the Chinese steel industry.
Last year, it announced plans to invest in a tinplate facility in the Pearl
River delta near Hong Kong, adding to the huge growth of investments in
China's coastal regions.
China produced 80m tonnes of crude steel in 1992, 9m tonnes more than in the
previous year and the biggest increase in the world. China wants to produce
100m tonnes by 2000, according to estimates from the ministry of
metallurgical industry. Production could rise to 110-120m by 2010 - which
would almost certainly make China the world's biggest producer.
Other Chinese steelworks are also planning investments to meet this growth.
Baoshan, which is set this year to become the holding company for all the
steelmaking facilities in Shanghai, is looking for investment at home and
overseas for a greenfield steel plant in Guangdong province. The plant is
set to produce eventually 10m tonnes a year. Baoshan also wants to build a
3m-tonne plant in Zhejiang province, using the latest thin strip casting
technology which looks set to slash globally the costs of sheet steel
manufacture.
Shougang intends to build a 10m-tonnes-a-year steel plant in Shandong
province. In an effort to meet the raw material requirements for this
expansion, Shougang bought a Peruvian iron ore mine last year and, last
month, started dismantling a disused melt shop in California for shipment to
Shandong.
As steelmaking in China is hugely profitable, Wuhan's move to cut costs is
not necessitated by immediate fears of losing money. Rather, it is aimed to
create a leaner, more flexible organisation to help pay for investments and
prepare for the inevitable downside in this cyclical industry.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Algeria loses some credibility with departure of key

THE resignation of Algeria's foreign minister, Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, is a
considerable blow to the international reputation of the government of Prime
Minister Belad Abdessalam.
Mr Brahimi is one of the Arab world's most respected diplomats. In 1989 he
brokered the Taif agreement that brought a measure of peace to Lebanon.
His departure late on Wednesday underlines the prime minister's desire for
unchallenged authority and his unwillingness to allow even a long-standing
political friend any great authority over his own department.
The daily Algerian newspaper El Watan said yesterday that the cabinet
reshuffle which followed Mr Brahimi's resignation suggests Mr Abdessalam has
no intention of negotiating with other political forces.
Three weeks ago, the acting head of state, Mr Ali Kafi, said his five-man
interim presidency - which took over from President Chadli Bendjedid 13
months ago - would seek the people's endorsement for a transitional
arrangement before a final agreement on a new constitution. The embattled
prime minister faces two challenges. A year after declaring war on Islamic
fundamentalists groups, the security forces are still mired in bloody
clashes with the radicals.
The second challenge is economic. The budget deficit is set to double this
year to dinars 168.3bn (Pounds 5.2bn), equivalent to some 40 per cent of
budget receipts, a figure which will make it more difficult to seal an
agreement with the International Monetary Fund. Spending on defence and
security is set to increase by 50 per cent, while dinars 83.5bn will be
allocated to the recapitalisation of loss-making state companies.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Yeltsin accuses central bank of adventurism
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin yesterday assailed his central bank chairman
and economics minister, accusing them of pursuing reckless policies. Mr
Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister and new financial overlord, joined
the attack with a warning that the country was 'at the gates of
hyperinflation'.
Mr Fyodorov is planning a public showdown if he fails to obtain the
agreement of Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, on a tough
stabilisation policy to stave off hyperinflation. Accusing his predecessor,
Mr Yegor Gaidar, of not having a financial policy, he is also trying to get
the government to focus on reining in spending and restructuring the
economy.
In an apparent show of support for his deputy prime minister, Mr Yeltsin
accused the central bank of 'a most crude mistake, adventurism' in issuing
Rbs3 trillion in cheap credit to state-owned enterprises.
'The consequences of this financial injection will be felt through the
currency year,' he was quoted as saying.
After a stormy cabinet meeting at which Mr Yeltsin accused Mr Andrei
Nechayev, the economics minister, of doing nothing about industrial
restructuring, the minister promised the government would now take tough
action on all fronts.
'We understand the situation better. The lessons (of the past year) have not
been lost on us,' Mr Nechayev said, stating that many of the Gaidar
government's radical policies had only been 'words' or had been buried by
subsequent compromises. He also said people now 'understood that inflation
can be really dangerous. It's like radiation, its's not immediately visible
but extremely destructive'.
With inflation at 30 per cent in January (compared to the 50 per cent
monthly benchmark for hyperinflation), he said the government also had to
'restrain itself' and take the blame for at least Rbs1 trillion in credits
issued to agriculture.
Pending implementation of a bankruptcy law, the government would also
publish embarrassing studies of 'potentially bankrupt' enterprises as a
warning to others. He said that the most spheres most vulnerable to closure
or reorganisation were the coal industry, agriculture, and machine-building,
which he described as 'uncompetitive'.
To increase government revenues and preserve the country's economic
integrity, he said the government would be reviewing special tax and other
benefits given to individual regions and enterprises.

The Belarus parliament ratified the Start I treaty yesterday, leaving

The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and its protocols require Belarus to
surrender all 81 SS-25 single-warhead missiles it inherited from the former
Soviet nuclear arsenal.
The parliaments of Russia and Kazakhstan ratified Start I last year. The
treaty was signed in 1991 by former US and Soviet Presidents George Bush and
Mikhail Gorbachev.
If ratified by Ukraine, the treaty would leave Russia as the only one of the
four with nuclear weapons. It also would make deep cuts in the nuclear
arsenals of the US and Russia.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Tokyo welcomes discount rate cut: Bentsen predicts reduced
trade surplus with US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER and EMIKO TERAZONO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S business and political leaders yesterday gave a resounding welcome
to the Bank of Japan's 0.75-point cut in the official discount rate, to 2.5
per cent, as an important step towards reviving the economy.
The domestic welcome was amplified by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury
secretary, who said the cut would be instrumental in whittling down Japan's
trade surplus with the US. He said the cut would revive Japanese demand and
'help shrink Japan's very large external surplus, as well as strengthening
world economic growth'.
The Bank of Japan decided on the cut, the sixth consecutive cut since 1991,
when the discount rate stood at 6 per cent, at an emergency meeting of its
policy board yesterday morning.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, bank governor, said the cut was justified because the
adjustment of the economy after the collapse of the speculative bubble
economy of the late-1980s had been much more severe than expected.
He said other factors in the bank's decision included stable wholesale and
consumer prices, the rising trade surplus and the recent sharp contraction
in the money supply. The cut should help to stimulate bank lending and thus
rekindle growth in the money supply.
The bank had agreed on the cut only after intense pressure from its masters
in the ruling Liberal Democratic party.
Business leaders praised the long-awaited cut but immediately stressed that
it needed to be followed by income tax cuts to stimulate depressed personal
consumption. Mr Soichiro Toyoda, chairman of the car-maker, Toyota Motor,
said an income tax cut should be introduced as soon as possible to lure
consumers to resume spending.
Mr Koehi Abe, of Chubu Electric Power, said the cut would have a limited
impact unless there were further stimulative measures such as increased
public works spending. Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation
of Employers' Associations, called on the government to take every measure
it could to revive the economy if it sank further next month.
Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, finance minister, said the priority was to pass the 1993
budget, which would increase overall spending by about 7 per cent. He said
an income tax cut would not stimulate the economy. The ministry favours
higher spending on public works.
However, a task force set up by the LDP is expected to recommend soon an
emergency fiscal package of about Y4,000bn (Pounds 21bn), including an
income tax cut.
Government ministers called on the commercial banks to pass on the official
discount rate cut to lenders by lowering their short-term prime rates. It is
thought the banks will consider a cut as early as next week.
The long-heralded cut left the Tokyo equity and foreign exchange markets
unmoved. The Nikkei stock average, which closed 35 points up on Wednesday,
lost 31 points to 17,190 yesterday.
The yen was almost unchanged, falling Y0.27 to Y124.6 against the US dollar
in Tokyo.

FT  05 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rights fear at Kingfisher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESS REPORTS from France that Kingfisher was discussing the possible
takeover of Darty, France's leading electrical retail group, sent shares in
the UK stores company reeling on fears that a possible Pounds 900m rights
issue might be involved. Darty, with more than 200 outlets, turnover of
around Pounds 1bn and pre-interest profits of around Pounds 100m, is highly
rated by analysts in the UK.
However, the press reports, later confirmed by Kingfisher, appear to have
upset negotiations which were said to have been well advanced. Sources from
both camps yesterday spoke of a 'rapprochement' rather than a bid, analysts
said. It was suggested that Kingfisher might seek only a 30 per cent stake,
giving it a toe-hold in the French market and perhaps encouraging a joint
venture buying agreement.
But, analysts close to Kingfisher believe a full takeover is still the most
likely outcome, and that Kingfisher may have already taken positions in the
currency markets in readiness for the deal. A bid would cost Kingfisher
about Pounds 1.3bn and could involve a rights issue of some Pounds 900m.
While many analysts welcomed the move, others questioned whether Darty would
be too risky a purchase in the current uncertain environment. Mr Nick
Hawkins at Kleinwort Benson said: 'There are concerns that Kingfisher may be
buying into a deteriorating economic environment.' The shares closed 20
adrift at 538p in turnover of 7.5m.
Utilities switching
A series of big institutional switches, mostly triggered by broker
recommendations, saw the utilities register strong progress. Goldman Sachs,
the US brokerage, was said to have been a big switcher into the utilities,
while James Capel was said to have recommended a switch from British Gas to
regional electricity stocks.
Water shares were also boosted by a strong recommendation from the Panmure
Gordon utilities team. Panmure said; 'The prospect of safe, growing
dividends in a stable regulatory environment should ensure continued
outperformance.'
Severn Trent, Panmure's primary buy recommendation, jumped 9 to 466p, while
Anglian added 10 at 481p and Thames 6 to 487p. North West moved up 8 to
477p. The best performers included Northern, 9 higher at 468p, Southern,
better at 421p and East Midland, 7 to the good at 406p. Kleinwort Benson was
said to have been responsible for pushing Scottish Hydro 4 up to 240p and
Scottish Power 3 better at 219p. Kleinwort said the Scottish generators are
going to become the most diversified utilities with unregulated profits
making up at least 15 per cent of operating profits by 1994/5.
WH Smith firm
Stationer WH Smith rebounded from sustained underperformance on rumours that
it will today announce cutbacks at its DIY division. There was also talk
that one leading house would issue a positive note shortly. Smith shares
have collapsed since the group revealed large losses and provisions at its
Do-It-All joint venture, falling from 523p at the end of the year. Yesterday
they rebounded 16 to 426p.
The losses have led many analysts to question Smiths' strategy with regard
to the DIY market, with some calling for the group to cut and run. However,
any restructuring would be warmly received. As well as some closures,
rumoured to be affecting upwards of 20 stores, news on the financing of a
new distribution centre is also expected.
Lasmo favoured
News of the sale of Pounds 126.5m worth of North Sea assets triggered a
sharp turnaround in Lasmo. The exploration company's shares underperformed a
generally buoyant oil sector on Wednesday but rose sharply yesterday to
close 5 higher at 166p. Turnover was a hefty 5.6m shares.
The asset sales, made up of interests in 17 North Sea blocks sold to
Germany's Deminex for Pounds 105.8m and interests in the Balmoral and
Maureen fields to Pentex Oil for Pounds 30m, had been expected by the
market.
Oil sector specialists viewed the disposals as good for the company. There
were, however, a few grumbles from the market at the terms of the deal and
some question marks about the company's claim that the sales would reduce
gearing by around 14 per cent. Some Pounds 53m of the deal is payable in
loans redeemable in January 1994 while the rest is valued at January 1 1993
exchange rates which will lop more off the value. The general consensus,
however, was that Lasmo's strategy was correct. At NatWest Securities, Mr
Simon Flowers said; 'This deal shows that the asset value of 185p is
realisable in cash.'
RTZ weakens
The world's biggest mining group RTZ suffered in spite of good trading news
as the market caught wind of a profit forecast cut from one of the UK's
leading agency brokers.
The shares fell 21 at one stage, shrugging off an announcement that the
group's gold production for the fourth quarter to December rose to 310,000
ounces from 229,000 ounces previously.
Dealers heard that Cazenove was preparing to cut its 1993 forecast today by
Pounds 70m to Pounds 390m. Cazenove never comments on its actions to the
market or the press. The forecast compares with an estimate of Pounds 450m
from Hoare Govett. RTZ shares closed 8 lower at 663p on 4.7m share turnover.
BP continued to move ahead, still responding to the recent flurry of US
buying. The shares closed 3 firmer at 268 1/2 p. Shell also progressed,
settling 6 up at 583p.
Fears of a rights issue continued to circulate around Trafalgar House. The
shares gave up 1 1/2 to 92p as HongKong Land exercised its option to acquire
more of the company's stock taking its holding in Trafalgar to 20.1.
Redland shares raced higher, closing 8 firmer at 465p on turnover of 3m,
following a highly successful presentation at Kleinwort Benson Securities
and the German interest rate cut.
The presentation was addressed by Mr Erich Gerlach, the head of Braas,
Redland's German associate. He said Braas's industrial and roofing
businesses were still expanding in response to the reconstruction of the
former East Germany.
Drug stocks had a volatile day, starting on a positive note and then being
forced down at the close by the weight of US and European selling as well as
individual factors.
Glaxo opened timidly on further reflection of a US congressional hearing on
drug pricing. Then, the stock rose sharply in response to a US scientific
journal article which concluded that ulcer treatment Zantac is effective in
eradicating ulcers if used with antibiotics. The shares, 14 higher at one
stage, closed 10 off at 655p.
Meanwhile, ICI shed 16 to 1118p in spite of an announcement that it is

Environmental services company Rentokil eased 5 to 214p as securities house
Smith New Court placed 5m shares with institutions at 207p.
Defence contractor Hunting jumped 8 to 223p after an announcement that its
majority owned joint venture Hunting BRAE had won a 7-year contract for the
management and operation of the UK's 4 Atomic Weapons Establishment sites.
Profit-taking in British Aerospace left the shares 9 easier at 278p.
Losses at Dutch airliner KLM and talk of a stock overhang combined to cause
British Airways to retreat 8 to 288p, with volume reaching 6.3m.
Newspaper group The Telegraph added 6 at 367p after announcing the sale of
its 13 per cent stake in Trinity International for Pounds 26m.

THE derivatives sector had a volatile session as hopes of a cut in German
interest rates initially faded and then disappointed the market when it
eventually happened, writes Joel Kibazo.
In futures, the March contract on the FT-SE opened strongly at 2,911, but
that early strength slowly ebbed away on profit-taking and a general feeling
that there would be no cut in German interest rates.
Speculation that the Bundesbank would cut rates after all surfaced over the
lunch-time period and caused a squeeze in March, pulling the underlying cash
market higher. March reached its all time peak of 2,918 at around 2.10pm,
just before an announcement of the German rate cut.
That, however, disappointed and sent the contract into retreat once again, a
fall that was encouraged by early falls on Wall Street, and fell to a
discount of about 3 to the underlying cash market.
The March contract closed at 2,870, down 19 on its previous close and at a
premium to cash of only 2 points. Turnover was 14,393 contracts.
The volume in the traded options was also heavy reaching 43,734 lots by the
close. Turnover in the FT-SE 100 option was particularly heavy reaching
17,669 contracts and that in the Euro FT-SE 100 Option reaching 1,350 lots.
Among stock options, BP was the most active with 3,305 lots dealt.

FT  05 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE Index tests the 2,900 hurdle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK stock market's success in foreseeing yesterday's cut in German
interest rates was marred by disappointment that the Bundesbank's discount
rate was reduced by only one quarter of a point. The London market just
managed to break through the Footsie 2,900 hurdle following the news from
Germany but the 26.3 point gain was then wiped out by heavy profit-taking
pressures, reflected in at least three large trading programmes at the
market close. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index down 7.9 on the day
at 2,865.9, while Seaq trading volume was one of the highest daily totals
since what the market has re-christened 'Golden Wednesday' - when Britain
quit the ERM network.
Equities were very firm early in the session but were hesitant in
challenging the Footsie 2,900 barrier even after the Bundesbank's
announcement that it would, after all, hold a press conference, virtually
confirmed hints in London on Wednesday of powerful international political
pressure for a cut in German rates.
The speed of the turnaround in share prices later emphasised the somewhat
speculative nature of the previous buying pressure. The downturn was led
from the stock index futures sector, where the March contract on the FT-SE
Index fell to a discount against the underlying blue chip sector.
However, it seemed that the big UK investment houses were still bullish of
the stock market and that yesterday's downturn could be safely ascribed to
profit-taking; last night, the Footsie was still around 30 points up on its
close on Tuesday night, ahead of the latest bout of interest rate
speculation. A strong opening to the new Wall Street session, with the Dow
Industrial Average 18 up in early trade, helped sentiment in London at the
close.
One programme trade by a UK investment bank was believed to be a massive
switch away from the blue chips which have stood out this week and into the
underperforming second line issues. Another, from a large US investment
banking house, involved heavy purchases of utility stocks.
The programme deals came very late in the day and delayed, as well as
boosting, the final Seaq volume figures for the session. Seaq volume bounded
to 949m shares, with the non-Footsie share total again lagging slightly at
around 58 per cent of the total.
The shakeout in share prices fell mainly on the bank shares, which have been
rising strongly this week. But some other interest-related stocks, notably
in the property sector but also among construction, contracting and building
materials stocks, continued to move ahead.
The leading oil stocks also extended recent gains as US investors continued
to buy them ahead of next week's meeting of the Opec ministers, when the
market expects producers to confirm production cuts.
Sterling's firmness at the end of the day served to underpin expectations of
another reduction in UK base rates, although the more cautious analysts do
not expect a move before Budget day, early in March.
With attention on currencies now returned to normal, at least for the
present, the stock market resumed its search for the next rights issue
candidates.

Dow soars

Wall Street
US STOCK prices hit record levels yesterday afternoon, helped by bullish
sentiment about the domestic economy and the German cut in interest rates,
writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 42.95 to 3,416.74, above its
previous high of 3,413.21 set last June. The more broadly based
Standard&amp;Poor's 500 also reached new heights, adding 2.35 to 449.55,
surpassing its previous day's record.
The Amex composite was 0.62 higher at 415.51. NYSE volume was heavy, with
more than 348m shares changing hands. Rises outnumbered declines by 1,334 to
604. On Wednesday, the Dow had closed 45.12 higher at 3,373.79.
The Nasdaq composite hit a new high of 708.85, up 0.18, recovering from an
earlier bout of profit-taking which drove the index lower at mid-session.
Chrysler continued to lead the market, adding Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 39 3/4
. It has been active since Tuesday's successful completion of a 46m share
offering. It is also benefiting from an improved credit rating from
Standard&amp;Poor's.
Ford jumped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 50, General Motors slid Dollars 1 3/8
to Dollars 37 3/4 in active trading. Standard&amp;Poor's downgraded its rating
on Wednesday.
Waste Management, the biggest US waste disposal company, ended the day
Dollars 1 3/4 lower at Dollars 37 3/4 after tumbling Dollars 4 earlier in
the day. Investors were disappointed by the company's underlying fourth
quarter earnings of 42 cents a share. An analyst at Prudential Research
downgraded his rating on Waste Management International after the UK-based
subsidiary posted disappointing fourth quarter earnings of 18 cents a share.
Shares in Waste Management International fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 21 3/4
.
Allied Signal hit a 52-week high of Dollars 65 1/4 , up Dollars 3 3/8 on
Wednesday's 33 per cent improvement in underlying fourth quarter earnings.
Toy-maker Mattel dropped Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 24 following the release
of fourth quarter net income of 35 cents a share, below expectations of 43
cents but above last year's earnings of 29 cents.
Canada
Toronto stocks ended higher in heavy trading. According to preliminary data,
the 300 composite index was up 22.37 points, or 0.67 per cent to 3,366.40.
Advancing issues led declines 392 to 304. Volume was 54.43m shares, above
Wednesday's 51.79m shares, and trading value rose to CDollars 512.7m from
CDollars 440.1m.
American Barrick reported higher fourth-quarter and full-year earnings and
said there has been a 20 per cent increase in the Betze-Post ore reserves at
its Goldstrike Mine in Nevada. The stock rose  1/2 to 38 7/8.

FT  05 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Rate cut fails to
maintain Tokyo's momentum

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EXCITEMENT over the Bank of Japan's 75 basis point cut in the discount rate
faded in the afternoon session, and share prices closed marginally lower on
profit-taking, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei index fell 31.40 to 17,190.63, its first decline in four trading
days. It saw a high of 17,390.79 in the morning after the official
announcement of the rate cut, before falling an afternoon low of 17,171.87
on profit-taking.
Volume fell to 260m shares from 339m. Declines led advances by 555 to 368
with 205 unchanged, and the Topix index of all first section stocks fell
6.77 to 1,300.83 after rising for seven consecutive days. In London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.74 to 1,057.96.
Reaction on other financial markets was muted, with the yen closing at
124.60 against the dollar, down 0.27 from the previous day, and the yield on
the No 145 10 year benchmark bond rising 0.015 points to 4.355 per cent.
However, market participants remain hopeful that the lower interest rates
will filter through the economy to good effect. Traders said that investors
are now waiting for further fiscal stimulus. 'Whether the stock market will
recover or not depends on the government following up the cut with another
supplementary budget, or a cut in income taxes,' said a manager of Nippon
Life's stock investment division.
Activity centred around short-term speculative trading and cross-trading by
financial institutions to realise profits ahead of the March book-closing.
Joyo Bank, a leading regional bank, was the most active issue of the day,
rising Y10 to Y860 on cross activity.
Isuzu Motors, which has been bought on the 'restructuring' theme, fell Y5 to
Y375 on dealer profit-taking while Oki Electric, which has also been traded
actively as a restructuring beneficiary, gained Y1 to Y392.
Aids-related issues were active. Green Cross fell Y40 to Y1,220 and
Kanematsu, a trading company which will produce and distribute a substance
used in AZT, an anti-Aids drug, rose Y20 to Y396.
Profit-taking depressed some financial issues which had been popular on
expectations of wider profit margins due to a rate cut. Industrial Bank of
Japan fell Y50 to Y2,380 and Mitsubishi Bank lost Y10 to Y2,390.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell for the first time in eight trading days on
small-lot profit taking. It closed 96.23 lower at 18,576.86 in 54.3m shares.
Roundup
A cautious mood emerged in many of the region's markets.
HONG KONG ended firmer with sentiment still underpinned by the record price
paid at Wednesday's government land auction. The Hang Seng Index gained
67.21 to 5,778.01 in turnover of HKDollars 1.86bn.
Properties saw the sharpest rise with Cheung Kong gaining 50 cents to
HKDollars 20.30 and Sun Hung Kai Properties up 20 cents to HKDollars 27.20.
AUSTRALIAN stocks staged an early rally, inspired by the strength of
overseas markets; but the advance ran out of steam, leaving the All
Ordinaries index to close just 1.2 higher at 1,531.4.
Turnover was healthy at ADollars 242m. up from ADollars 238m on Wednesday.
A 16 cent fall in News Corp to Dollars 29.40 was attributed to market
speculation that the group's stake in British Sky Broadcasting may be worth
less than originally thought.
SINGAPORE retreated on profit-taking and the Straits Times Industrial index
fell 10.51 to 1,627.08 in volume on 114.45m shares.
KUALA LUMPUR closed mixed as investors became cautious after Wednesday's
surge. The composite index closed 3.71 higher at 642.95 in volume of 163m
shares.
BANGKOK saw a late selling spree as a series of rumours - none of them true
 -spread through trading rooms. Investors later repurchased bank and finance
company issues leaving the SET index 3.10 lower at 972.16 in turnover of
Bt10.34bn.

FT  05 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: European majors reflect squeeze on oil
margins - - Weak share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOW OIL prices, and the economic recession in much of Europe, have hit the
profit margins of leading European oil companies. Share prices for many
companies have been languishing.
The weak financial position of some European majors has been exacerbated by
chronic overcapacity in refining and marketing, as well as petrochemicals.
Profit margins at European oil refineries dropped late last year to as low
as Dollars 2.30 per barrel. This means that no companies are making money
from their refining operations, since margins would have to be above Dollars
3 a barrel for them to do so.
OMV, the Austrian oil company, has warned that it will report a loss of
Sch300m for last year and be forced to cut its dividend. Elf Aquitaine, the
French oil group saw profits fall by 36 per cent last year, causing it to
announce cutbacks in investment.
Petrofina, the Belgian group, has already said that it will halve its
dividend after a sharp drop in profits. The company is due to report its
results in the next couple of days. Total, the French oil company, is also
expected to report a drop in profits next week.
'The companies realise that there is little chance of a recovery this year
and maybe not even next year, but I'm not sure investors have realised that
yet,' says Mr Alan Marshall, associate director of equities research at
Swiss Bank. 'There are too many deep-seated problems in the industry for
there to be a quick recovery.'
Mr Marshall points to severe overcapacity in European refining, as well as a
proliferation of service stations which has kept margins in the business
extremely low. 'The business is just at the worst point in the cycle -
profit margins are entirely dependent on demand since no-one is losing
enough money actually to close any capacity down.'
European demand has been depressed by economic recession in many countries.
The International Energy Agency, the west's oil monitoring body, points out
in its latest monthly oil report that European oil demand declined by 2.5
per cent in the final quarter of last year. First quarter demand this year
is expected to be 14m barrels a day (b/d) - unchanged from the same period
last year when it was also low.
European oil companies are suffering in a similar way to their counterparts
overseas from low oil prices and the downturn in demand. But some companies
are managing to weather the storm better than others.
The Spanish oil group, Repsol, has maintained earnings during a difficult
period chiefly because of its strong position in the Spanish energy market.
The company's debt to equity ratio is expected to have risen at the end of
last year from 3 per cent to 23 per cent, but this still leaves it with one
of the strongest balance sheets in the industry.
Repsol's financial strength is reflected in its share price performance. The
shares showed a sharp drop when the peseta was devalued last September, but
since then the price has recovered. Smith New Court, the London brokerage
house, says that the problems being encountered by other oil companies such
as British Petroleum, Elf, Total and Petrofina has led to a certain amount
of switching by investors into Repsol.
Many European oil companies are looking to eastern Europe. OMV, in
particular, aims to build up a network of service stations in central Europe
which will take the cleaner products provided by its Austrian refineries.
Elf has bought into the East German refining market where it could use plant
for processing oil it may discover in its exploration acreage in Kazakhstan.
However, Mr Marshall points to the risks in these strategies and stresses
that investment in eastern Europe is not likely to pay dividends in the
short term.
An additional problem looming for European refiners will be the renewed
emphasis on environmental regulations in Europe which is likely to prompt
the EC Commission to introduce tough new standards for refineries in the
same way as the US has done. The estimated cost of bringing refineries up to
new environmental standards in the US has been put at over Dollars 14bn for
the industry. It could prove almost as costly in Europe.

FT  05 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses climb as Bundesbank
caves in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank's decision to announce a late cut in interest rates, while it
supported an earlier, Italian rate cut, was not met with unanimous acclaim,
writes Our Markets Staff.
Politicians and stock market traders seemed to like it. The French finance
ministry said that it was a gesture which should help stabilise the EMS; and
the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index moved from a gain of just 3.93 at noon to one
of 16.32, to 1,113.35, at the close.
However, German businessmen worried about the new threat that the rates
decision implies to price stability, and some of their stockbroking
counterparts criticised Bundesbank council members for saying one thing, and
doing another.
FRANKFURT did little before the Buba news, closing the official session with
the DAX index just 0.08 higher at 1,601.61 in turnover up from DM6.6bn to
DM7.1bn, but it reacted manfully in the post-bourse with indications of a
0.75 point percentage gain in the late afternoon.
Domestic analysts and strategists had their reservations, saying that this
was the second time that the Bundesbank had caved in to political pressure,
and that its method of doing so made the council sound more like politicians
than central bankers.
There was a case, they said, for expecting dollar-sensitive shares, and the
interest rate-sensitive banks to rise tomorrow. In the meantime, Allianz,
the insurer, reflected its strong beta factor, exaggerating the market move
with a 1 1/2 per cent gain in London post bourse trading; but MAN, with its
truckmaking interests, was more concerned with the Daf debacle as it fell
another DM6 to DM284.
PARIS did not get all that it wanted and the CAC-40 index came back from a
high of 1,869.01, up 2.5 per cent in mid-afternoon, to close 30.24 or 1.7
per cent better at 1,854.38.
Mr John Fordyce of Ferri International said that the bourse took the view
that the Bundesbank had done only a little over the minimum - but that this
should be still be enough to bring French interest rates down, too.
Money piled into interest rate sensitive stocks as market turnover climbed
again, from FFr3.45bn to a 'colossal' FFr4.7bn. In financials, Cie Bancaire
rose FFr23, or 5 per cent, to FFr464 in 200,000 shares and Axa rose FFr30 to
FFr1,150 after FFr1,159.
Other features included Matra-Hachette, up FFr5 to FFr109, or 15 per cent
for the week so far, on buying enhanced by the American appeal of the media
and defence group.
MILAN took heart at the opening from a rate cut of its own - the Bank of
Italy's decision to cut discount rate by half a percentage point to 11 1/2
per cent - and the mood was enhanced late in the trading day by speculation
about the Bundesbank move.
The Comit index ended 7.15 higher at 498.14.
Analysts were heartened by the timing of the Italian cut which demonstrated,
they said, that the Bank of Italy was taking a lead in setting its own
rates, rather than holding on to the coat tails of the Bundesbank. The
German cut, however, would leave the way open for another cut soon.
Montedison added L93 to L1,240 amid continuing speculation that it would
soon sell its Farmitalia Carlo Erba pharmaceuticals unit to Kabi Pharmacia,
the pharmaceutical arm of Sweden's Propcordia. Fondiaria firmed L2,037 to
L30,990 on further expectations of a reorganisation of the group.
AMSTERDAM ended mixed, but higher it was at midday. The CBS Tendency index
finished 0.9 lower at 95.9 after exposure to more gloomy corporate news.
Daf was suspended from trading again, this time on the unofficial,
'punishment bench' section of the market for part of the afternoon session.
The bourse gave no reason, but the announcement came after the company said
that agreement had been reached between banks and the Dutch government on
short-term bridging finance to allow its Eindhoven plant to carry on
working. The shares moved 15 cents ahead to Fl 1.95 in active turnover of
more than 2m shares.
KLM fell Fl 2 in the immediate aftermath of announcing third quarter losses
of Fl 437.8m. However, the shares picked up later to end 20 cents higher at
Fl 195.90 when it became clear that the figures included a Fl 305m charge
against KLM's Northwest Airlines stake. Fokker continued its decline but
picked up from a day's low of Fl 8.10 to finish Fl 1.50 lower Fl 8.70, amid
concern that Germany's Deutsche Aerospace would press for new terms if it
were to go ahead with the plan to acquire a majority stake.
In the chemicals sector, DSM dipped Fl 3.90 to Fl 72.30 on market rumours
that the company would cut or omit its 1992 dividend. The company said later
that no decision on the dividend had yet been reached.
ZURICH ended steady, apparently not overly impressed by the German rate cut.
Prices opened easier amid some profit-taking but the SMI index erased the
early losses to close 3.1 higher at 2,123.7.
COPENHAGEN's KFX index closed 0.77 higher at 86.17 in spite of a slight dip
from 86.34 at the end of the day on the Bundesbank news, and the receding
possibility of a the Danish crown devaluation which had taken equities
higher in the first place. Turnover was high at DKr1.4bn.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Saving the Danish Bacon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TENSIONS inside the European exchange rate mechanism eased considerably
yesterday after the Bundesbank surprised foreign exchange dealers by cutting
its officially posted interest rates, writes James Blitz.
The cuts of 25 and 50 basis points in the Discount and Lombard rates pushed
the Danish krone well within its ERM bands against the D-Mark, and triggered
a sharp appreciation in the value of the French franc.
But, the timing of the move, in a week which has seen acute ERM pressures,
was hailed as another indication that the Bundesbank is determined not to
see the ERM break up.
Mr Avinash Persaud, a currency strategist at UBS Phillips and Drew in
London, said: 'This move brings the ERM back from the brink. There will be
no further devaluations in the exchange rate mechanism for the next 12
months.'
Miss Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets, who predicted last Christmas
that the Bundesbank would ease its official rates on February 4th, said that
the move was a complete about turn for Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank
president.
But she added: 'A  1/4 -point off the discount rate is not the end of the
road. The Bundesbank is buying time until after the French elections.' She
now expects another easing in policy in April.
The Danish currency had been trading close to its ERM floor against the
D-Mark of DKr3.9016 before the Bundesbank move, forcing the authorities in
Copenhagen to raise a key lending rate by 200 basis points.
By the close of trading yesterday, the currency was near to its central ERM
parity. at DKr3.8392.
The French franc also appreciated to a close of FFr3.3790 at the European
close, more than a centime up on the day. One-month French francs traded at
around 12 per cent last night, around 300 basis points below their peak on
Monday.
A particularly interesting sign of how much the tension eased was that the 5
hard core currencies of the system - the D-Mark, French franc and the
Benelux currencies - were all trading within 1 per cent of each other in the
ERM grid last night. A move to 1 per cent bands for the hard core has often
been touted as a road to faster monetary union.
The dollar rose to a new 1993 high of DM1.6670 against the D-Mark on
prospects of a narrowing of the D-Mark/dollar interest rate differential. It
later closed at DM1.6535, up 1 pfennig on the day.
The immediate prospects for the dollar depend on today's non-farm payroll
figure for January, a critical indicator.
Sterling gained 3 pfennigs on yesterday's rate cut, closing at DM2.3900.
But, ironically, a rescued ERM puts off all hopes of an aggressive easing of
interest rate policy. A slow shaving of German rates in 1993 is probably the
last thing sterling investors want.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Money Markets: Selling the facts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN cash and futures markets were extremely bullish about the prospect
for rate cuts on the continent yesterday after the Bundesbank announced that
it would be holding a news conference after its fortnightly council meeting,
writes James Blitz.
Sterling and French franc futures rose sharply in the interval between 1.00
and 2.15 pm London time on the expectation that a cut in Germany's
officially-posted interest rates would help ease monetary policy elsewhere.
But, when news of both the 25 basis point cut in the Discount rate and the
50 basis point cut in the Lombard rate came through, the reaction was one of
disappointment, and sterling futures fell back sharply.
In part, the price fall in the European afternoon may have been due to the
dealer principle of 'buying on the rumour and selling on the facts.'
However, dealers seemed unwilling to assume that yesterday's cut in the
Discount rate heralded aggressive easing in the future.
The March Euromark contract rose 17 basis points on the day, to a peak of
92.30, before closing unchanged on the day at 92.13.
At this level, it assumes that 3-month money will be 7.87 per cent next
month, only 13 basis points below the current Discount rate.
The reaction in French franc markets was more ebullient. The March French
franc contract rose 75 basis points to 89.30 on the expectation that a cut
in German rates could allow French policy to ease.
But, again, the March contract fell back to a close of 89.91. At this level,
it prices 3-month French francs at 9.09 per cent next month, some 3 per cent
below yesterday's level for 3-month money. The assumption of traders must be
that there will either be an aggressive easing in German policy or that the
French franc will float.
There was a bullish mood in the sterling cash market, too, where 3-month
Certificates of Deposit were bought as low as 5 7/8 per cent, before closing
back up at about 6 per cent.
Dealers assumed that a German policy ease would take the presure off
sterling on the FX markets. However, Mr Norman Lamont's comment's yesterday
that the exchange rate would be closely monitored injected some bearishness
at the end of the day.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Azerbaijan to announce Caspian
Sea oil deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BAKU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT of Azerbaijan says it is about to announce a series of
contracts to major foreign oil companies to explore and exploit reserves in
the Caspian Sea. Proven and probable reserves are estimated at about 7bn
barrels with further significant discoveries thought likely.
These will be the first contracts with foreign companies signed by the
former Soviet republic and are likely to establish the country as a
significant oil producer within the decade. Mr Saleh Mammedov, the Azeri
finance minister, said yesterday that the present production of between 10m
and 11m tonnes should rise to 40m tonnes in 1996-97, with further rises
thereafter. The Azeri government is looking to a sharp increase in oil
output as the major means of reversing a disastrous industrial decline.
At the same time, the construction of a pipeline to take the oil out of the
country - the only existing line runs into Russia - will profoundly affect
the economy and the politics of the entire region. The pipeline project
being studied by the Azeri government with the oil majors working in the
country comes down to a choice between running through the neighbouring
countries of Iran, Georgia or Armenia.
Paradoxically, even though Azerbaijan and Armenia are in a state of
undeclared war over the Armenian enclave of Nagorno Karabakh, the last route
is thought the most likely. This is because a pipeline through Armenia to
Turkey could tap into an existing line from Iraq to the Mediterranean port
of Iskanderon - unused at present because of sanctions against Iraq - with
adequate loading facilities for supertankers.
The Georgian route to a Black Sea port would result in a bottleneck of
supertankers through the Bosphorus - while the Iranian route is thought
politically sensitive.
The first agreement between the Azeri State Oil Company and a foreign
corporation is likely to be signed as early as Monday. This will be with the
Turkish company, AD Petrosan, a subsidiary of the Attila Dogan construction
corporation. This relatively small agreement gives the Turkish company 49
per cent of a joint venture to exploit proven and already-working reserves
on land.
The next deal is likely to be with the US Pennzoil Corporation which, in
partnership with Ramco, the UK company, is thought likely to conclude an
agreement to up-grade and increase present production in the off-shore
Guneshli field from the present 130,000 barrels a day to a level estimated
by Pennzoil at 230,000 b/d within the next four years.
This deal is being pushed through because of the republic's desperate need
to earn hard currency and to raise the low exploitation level of 50-55 per
cent of proven reserves. Mr Sabir Bagirov, head of the State Oil Company,
said he expected the Pennzoil deal to be signed within a week.
The third deal is expected to be with a consortium led by BP, which is
exploring reserves in the Turag field, where production is expected to rise
to 30m tonnes a year when it comes on stream. BP, with Statoil of Norway,
says the Turag field has proven reserves of at least 1bn barrels and claims
it is the largest Caspian field yet discovered.
The final project, the Amoco-led plan to develop the 2bn-barrel Azeri field,
is the least certain of the projects. The Azeri government has postponed a
decision because the US Congress has refused to allow humanitarian aid to be
sent to Azerbaijan on human rights grounds. The issue is to be raised next
week in Baku by Mr Greg Laughlin, a Democratic Congressman from Texas, who
is coming to Azerbaijan for talks with the government on the oil contracts.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Big crops squeeze orange
profits - The bitter fruits of aggressive 1980s replanting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPECTATIONS OF near-record orange harvests in Florida and Brazil this year
have sent prices paid to Florida fruit growers to their lowest levels since
the 1950s. The harvest promises to be just the first in a series of bumper
years, leaving a gloomy outlook for a price recovery in the sunshine state.
The bountiful supply of oranges is also projected to raise the combined
production of frozen concentrated orange juice in Florida and Brazil to a
record, a fact not lost on New York's orange juice futures traders. Futures
prices for frozen juice for March delivery fell to 16-year lows this week.
The March contract has fallen from Dollars 1.80 a lb 18 months ago to a low
of 67.40 cents Tuesday. The drop accelerated last week, traders say, when it
became clear that the season for a crop-damaging freeze in Florida was
nearly over.
With large surpluses in the offing, both the US and Brazil are targeting
Asian and EC countries for potential market expansion.
The orange juice market is suffering from the after-effects of crop damage
done to Florida orange groves during a succession of frosts and freezes
during the 1980s. Growers compensated for tree losses with aggressive
replanting and most of those new trees are just now maturing enough to yield
fruit.
The 1980s crop losses in Florida inspired a new orange industry in Brazil,
which now claims the title as the world's largest producer of frozen
concentrated orange juice.
In 1986, in the midst of the crop damage, Florida had 43.5m orange trees. In
1992, the tree count had risen to 72.8m trees. Of that total, more than 30
per cent were 2 years old or less.
'Over time, this crop is only going to get larger,' says Steve Platt, senior
commodities analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds. 'It takes three years to get
an orange tree to produce, and the older a tree gets, the higher the
yields'.
The Florida orange crop currently being harvested is expected to yield 188m
boxes of fruit and the Brazilian crop, which should come on to the market
several months from now, is estimated at 292.8m boxes, both the
second-highest crops on record. A box is 40.8 kg, or about 90 lb.
Florida's orange harvest is projected to hit 211m boxes three years from
now, and 257m boxes in 10 years. Brazil's orange groves are also just
getting into their stride, adding to production overload.
Orange growers in Florida received 45 cents a lb for orange juice solids
this week, down dramatically from the Dollars 1.48 they were grossing a year
ago. Mary Hartney, spokesperson for Florida Citrus Mutual, Florida's largest
association of citrus growers, says 'this is one of the worst seasons in
memory for growers'. She says the industry standard for break-even in orange
production is Dollars 1 a lb.
So far the price slump has not prompted growers to abandon their crops, but
Ms Hartney says another year of low prices could affect operations of the
most highly geared growers. Brazilian growers are no better off. They are
generally paid a moving average of the New York futures price for their
fruit.
Judith Ganes, senior futures strategist with Merrill Lynch, believes that if
the futures price slide is severe enough, it may encourage Brazilian growers
to limit their investment in the crop and trim tree yields. However, the
overall crop impact would be minimal, she says.
While frozen concentrated orange juice futures prices and prices paid to
farmers for fruit have slumped, analysts say the world price of 95 cents a
lb for solid frozen orange juice concentrate has been slow to fall, leaving
consumers with little benefit from the crop surplus.
Florida growers and fruit processors are looking toward expanding foreign
markets to absorb the excess supply and stabilise orange prices. Ms Hartney
says Japan and Germany are particularly promising markets, with per capita
juice consumption in those countries less than a fifth of the American
level.
Japan relaxed import restrictions against imported orange juice in April,
1992, and since then it has doubled its juice consumption. Germany's imports
are also expected to rise once the country recovers from its current
economic slowdown, Ms Hartney says.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee producers set limits on
pact compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE PRODUCING countries have set firm limits on the price they are
prepared to pay for a new international pact, Brazil, the world's biggest
producer, warned yesterday.
After two weeks of talks the fifth round looks like ending today with
virtually no progress towards a pact with economic clauses. Delegates were
meeting late into last night in a bid to clear a deadlock over whether there
should be a review of the export quota system after one year of operation.
No attempt has been made to tackle crucial points such as how to determine
quota size or the price range to be defended.
The fourth round of talks ended in December with consumers blaming producer
countries for the lack of progress. Yesterday Mr Valdemar Leao, the
producers' spokesman, said producers had to a large extent agreed to
consumer demands, particularly for a universal quota and selectivity, under
which the mix of the different coffee types exported would be determined -
the producers proposing division into four types, the consumers favouring
three. 'We have compromised - but there are limits,' Mr Leao said.
Mr Rubens Barbosa, the new head of the Brazilian delegation, said producers
were not prepared to keep conceding without any concessions from the
consumers. 'We have the political will to work for an agreement,' he said.
'We have doubts that the consumers still have this will.'
The agreement expires at the end of March, and provision has been made for a
sixth round of talks in the last week of that month.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian farmers to plant
record rape area
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN FARMERS are set to plant a record acreage of oilseed rape this
spring in response to a strong run-up in prices and steadily rising US
demand for rapeseed oil.
Barring unforeseen setbacks, such as the early frost which damaged about 20
per cent of last year's crop, next season's prairie harvest could offset the
expected tumble in European Community production. According to early
estimates, European output will fall by at least 500,000 tonnes this year to
a maximum of 5.7m tonnes, the lowest in four years.
An official at the Canola Council in Winnipeg - canola is the Canadian name
for oilseed rape - estimates that this year's plantings in Canada will rise
from 3.15m hectares (7.8m acres) in 1992 to between 3.44m and 3.64m ha.
With a yield of 23 bushels an acre the crop could be as high as 4.8m tonnes,
up from 3.68m tonnes in 1992. Last year's harvest was initially estimated at
4.5m tonnes, but frost cut the area harvested to 2.83m ha.
The popularity of the crop is partly due to low wheat prices, but also
reflects high canola prices prevailing on the Winnipeg commodity exchange.
The March contract closed at CDollars 333.50 (Pounds 184) a tonne on
Wednesday, up from a low of CDollars 275 a tonne last August. The March
price has been as high as CDollars 349 a tonne in recent months.
Mr Nick Underwood, the Canola Council's crop production co-ordinator, said
that farmers 'can lock in next year's production at good prices'.
The most recent surge in prices has been caused by an acute shortage of the
top two grades of canola, as a result of damage caused by last August's
frost. A trader at ScotiaMcLoeod in Winnipeg said that prices would probably
drop later in the year if the expected high plantings materialised.
However, the canola market is also expected to be buoyed over the longer
term by firm US demand for canola oil. Canada's annual canola oil exports to
the US have soared from 100,000 tonnes to 260,000 tonnes over the past five
years.
Canola oil received Food and Drug Administration clearance as a
'generally-recognised-as-safe' product in 1985. It has been promoted since
then as the vegetable oil with the lowest saturated fats content on the US
market.
Procter &amp; Gamble and Hunt &amp; Wesson are among the large manufacturers which
now sell canola oil, either by itself or blended with other vegetable oils.
Such well-known brand names as Mazola and Crisco now include some canola oil
in addition to their traditional ingredients.
The Canola Council predicts that the total crush in Canada will rise from
the 1.5m-tonne average over the past five years to 2.2m tonnes by the end of
the decade.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices rise
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil prices rose by 25 cents in late trading to reach Dollars 18.60 a barrel
for North Sea Brent crude, writes Deborah Hargreaves. The price rise
followed comments by current president of the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, Mr Alirio Parra, that all 12 Opec countries had agreed
to play their part in cutting the cartel's output by 1m barrels a day. Mr
Parra was quoted by the official Opec news agency as saying the market had
already taken account of an Opec accord to cut production to 23.5m b/d.
The International Energy Agency, the west's oil monitoring body, showed in
its monthly oil report yesterday that Opec production had been 25m b/d in
January. It estimated that world oil demand would rise by 1.5 per cent in
the first quarter of the year to 39.9m b/d.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: German group plans temporary
zinc closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUHR-ZINC'S smelter at Datteln, Germany, is likely to close for about two
months from the middle of April, taking about 30,000 tonnes of refined zinc
out of the market this year, said Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, chairman of
Metallgesellschaft's executive board, yesterday.
He was responding to market rumours that MG, the German metals and
engineering group, would follow Cominco of Canada, which last week announced
poor market conditions were forcing it to cut production this year at its
Trail smelter in British Columbia by 50,000 tonnes.
MG has close connections with Cominco and Mr Schimmelbusch said MG welcomed
the Canadian group's move. He admitted: 'We have actively been considering
how we could contribute to improve conditions in the zinc market'.
The opportunity would arise because further technical changes were to be
made at the Datteln smelter and it would be advantageous to shut it down
rather than keep it running while these were carried out.
In normal circumstances the smelter would be kept operating but the present
depressed state of the zinc market made it more sensible to shut it down
temporarily, as this made the work less risky.
MG owns 45 per cent of Ruhr-Zinc, which recently expanded the Datteln
smelter's annual production capacity from 130,000 to 200,000 tonnes. MIM of
Australia also controls 45 per cent of Ruhr-Zinc and Mr Schimmelbusch said a
decision would be made at meetings next week at which he would recommend a
temporary closure.
He suggested present London Metal Exchange prices were not reflecting the
true value of zinc. Prices were abnormally depressed by a surge in exports
from the former eastern bloc countries and by the liquidation of market
positions built up during the technical squeeze in the exchange's zinc
market for many months last year.
LME zinc stocks reached a record 525,000 tonnes this week and the
International Lead and Zinc Study Group estimates that exports from eastern
bloc countries more than doubled last year to 250,000 tonnes compared with
western consumption of about 5.36m tonnes.

Base metals prices eased off their highs during late afternoon trading at
the London Metal Exchange. COPPER ran into technical resistance and Chinese
selling before ending after hours trading Dollars 6 up at Dollars 2,238 a
tonne in the three months position. The sterling quotation was Pounds 8.75
down at Pounds 1,560.50 a tonne as the pound clawed back some of its lost
ground. The three months ZINC price broke above the Dollars 1,130 level at
one stage, triggering some stop-loss buying orders, before settling back in
after hours trading to Dollars 1,129 a tonne, up Dollars 4.50 from
Wednesday. COCOA futures finished near the day's lows with sentiment on
charts becoming increasingly bearish. The May position ended Pounds 22 down
at the London Futures and Options Exchange. There continued to be
unconfirmed talk that Ivorian arrivals may have been higher than previously
believed. Robusta COFFEE futures managed to partially recoup earlier losses
during the afternoon session but the May position, which had dipped to
Dollars 910 at one stage, still finished Dollars 16 down at Dollars 928 a
tonne.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ekofisk safety plan
'inadequate'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NORWEGIAN Petroleum Directorate, the oil industry watchdog, has
expressed concern over 'inadequacy' of proposals submitted by Phillips
Petroleum Norway to improve the safety and operational reliability of the
main processing and transportation facilities of the North Sea Ekofisk field
centre tank, the hub of the world's largest oil transportation system.
Last October, the NPD warned Phillips that it was considering an order to
close the tank by the winter of 1995-96 for safety reasons.
The directorate is deeply concerned for the safety of personnel at the tank,
its operational reliability and relentless subsidence of the field, which
poses hazards to the facility. It said it would study Phillips' proposals
for interim risk-reducing measures until mid-February before making a final
ruling. But it was not satisfied with the premise on which technical
evaluations for the proposed measures were based.
The NPD ordered Phillips, operator of Ekofisk with a 37 per cent stake in
the field, to submit interim measures - which the directorate would have to
approve - for continued operation of the facility until a long-term plan
could be presented in July.
In response, Phillips said it was quite possible to achieve safe operations
by applying modern safety and maintenance management principles but that it
would enhance fire protection and provide an additional escape route at the
tank.
To deal with field subsidence, Phillips is expanding water injection
capacity through the use of a temporary facility from July 1993 while
studies for permanent expansion are completed.
'We believe our proposals will enable the tank to meet necessary safety
criteria for personnel and equipment. Our plans are to continue working with
our co-venturers and government officials to ensure that Ekofisk will remain
open, safe and economically sound for all parties involved,' Mr Sander
Bull-Gjertsen, a Phillips executive said yesterday.
About 18bn cubic metres of gas is transported annually through the Ekofisk
system to a consortium of European buyers and about 40 per cent of Norway's
petroleum production is processed there.

FT  05 FEB 93 / The Property Market: The cause of convertibility - Vanessa
Houlder on a report which argues that empty offices should be used for
residential accommodation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'London has a glut of empty offices - and not enough homes . . . If one
problem could be used to help solve the other, it would provide badly-needed
work for the building industry and stave off . . . dereliction.'
This declaration of the case for converting offices to housing kicked off a
report* that was launched this week by a team of surveyors, architects and
analysts.
The argument for putting unwanted offices to a better use has long been
debated both inside and outside the property industry. The idea has now been
seized upon by politicians.
'Where it is feasible, practicable and possible, I shall do what I can to
support such a transition (from offices to other uses),' said Sir George
Young, housing minister, at the launch.
Last month, environment secretary Michael Howard said: 'We are now seeing an
increasing number of applications for change from offices to residential use
on both sites and existing buildings. I want to encourage these trends.'
And this week Mr Charles Hendry, the Conservative MP for High Peak and
chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Homelessness, took up the
issue by calling for new initiatives 'to tackle the scandal of empty
offices.
'The tragedy of this situation is that there are 30m sq ft of offices in
London, and millions more in other cities, lying empty and gradually
decaying, when there are tens of thousands of people in need of
accommodation,' he said. The politicians' pleas have not fallen on deaf
ears. Empty office blocks, owned privately and by local authorities, have
been converted into hostels for use by the destitute; and a campaign by the
Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors to use empty space above shops for
flats has been endorsed by the retail industry.
In a recent CSW/Gallup poll, four out of five of the industry's top 100
managers said that planning authorities should allow the conversion of empty
commercial space to residential use.
But the obstacles facing such conversions are substantial. There are few
successful examples of conversions. Plantation Wharf in Battersea, south
London, where the receivers have turned the half-finished central office
tower into flats, is a notable exception.
Some of the problems facing office conversions are insuperable. Physically,
many buildings, particularly the high-tech, glass-walled buildings that were
built during the period of hectic construction activity in the 1980s, are
generally ill-suited for conversion; windows in such buildings do not open,
and their huge floor areas mean that too much of the floor space is too far
from windows.
The buildings that best lend themselves to conversion are the grey, slab
office blocks built in the 1960s and 1970s, for which demand is currently
poor.
Many unoccupied commercial properties are also in office ghettos, which
would not adapt well to residential use. The Empty Homes Agency, which was
set up last year to address the possibilities of converting vacant buildings
to residential use, says the close proximity of restaurants, post offices
and other community services often determines whether a building is a good
candidate for conversion.
Some of the problems facing conversions could be alleviated. Local
authorities, for example, are often reluctant to relinquish sites that they
have earmarked for uses that could generate jobs.
Campaigners such as Mr Hendry would like to see local authorities grant
temporary residential consent. This would allow developers to keep their
options open if demand for offices revives.
Granting temporary residential planning permission could also assuage the
fear of developers, who are often reluctant to sacrifice hard-won office
consents. Planning permission for office use has historically been far more
valuable than permission for residential use.
Also, temporary residential planning permission may provide some assurance
to property owners who are reluctant to convert their offices to housing
because they fear the premises would deteriorate after a period of
residential use.
'The government could help in producing booklets which show how conversions
can be carried out and the buildings kept in good order, to give reassurance
to the owners,' says Mr Hendry.
Another concern for the advocates of conversions is that property owners are
deliberately vandalising their own empty buildings to avoid paying rates.
The effect of this self-inflicted vandalism is that buildings that could be
used for housing are made uninhabitable.
Yet the biggest question mark over the viability of converting offices to
houses is financial. At present, the numbers rarely add up. An appraisal of
four central London schemes by surveyors Cluttons and Gardiner &amp; Theobald
found that converting a building to residential use was far more profitable
than if the premises were retained for office use, with profits often up to
15 per cent higher.
However, this profit was more than wiped out when value added tax - which is
payable for work on office buildings - is taken into account. As VAT is not
incurred on the construction of a residential building, developers find it
can be more profitable to pull a building down and start again.
The enthusiasts for office-housing conversions argue that if house prices
recover and office values continue to plunge, the economics of converting
will become more attractive. Already, in certain circumstances - where
developers have pre-let the accommodation and conversion costs are low -
schemes are viable.
Housing associations and universities looking for student accommodation are
the most important sources of demand for conversions. In London, more than a
dozen colleges are looking for some 50,000 sq ft each for student hostels,
according to Applied Property Research, which produced the Home Office
report. Planning applications for change of use are being lodged at a rate
of three to four a week.
In any event, the conversion of existing office blocks to housing is
unlikely to prove a panacea for the huge expanse of empty office space in
London, which is equivalent to 25 Canary Wharf towers. Mr Hendry puts the
predicament starkly: 'Unless action is taken to find new uses for them
(unwanted offices), we will see dereliction on a scale we have not witnessed
since the blitz.'

FT  05 FEB 93 / The Property Market: Revenue from loans, bonds and rights
issues down in 1992
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A TOTAL of Pounds 2.95bn was raised in property-related loans, bonds and
rights issues in 1992, down from Pounds 3.98bn in the previous year,
according to Savills, property advisers.
Just Pounds 660m of the total was 'new' financing, Pounds 2.16bn was for
refinancings and Pounds 130m for housing associations. The most significant
component was the Pounds 1.25bn loan that refinanced Rosehaugh Stanhope
Developments, the developer of the Broadgate office project in the City of
London, last November.
The amount of debt owed by the property and construction sectors fell by 1
per cent in the last quarter of 1992 to Pounds 53.6bn. The sector's total
debt has fallen by Pounds 4.3bn since May 1991.
The main reason for the drop in loans was UK retail banks' and US banks'
reduced exposure to the sector, which has fallen by about Pounds 450m per
quarter - a total of Pounds 2.7bn since May 1991. About 30 banks are now
providing finance to the market, of which a quarter are new to the market,
says Savills. With few exceptions, they are only prepared to lend to
well-let properties with long, unexpired leases and large borrowers.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: Enthusiastic welcome for Bundesbank's cut
in interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank's decision to cut its official interest rates yesterday was
greeted with enthusiasm in the European government bond markets, where it
was seen as relieving the tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism.
The high-yielding government bond markets, such as Spain and Italy, rallied
strongly and gained nearly a point at one stage in the day.
Bond prices started to climb as rumours swept the European bond markets that
the Bundesbank would hold a press conference in the early afternoon. Most
market participants expected it to announce an easing in interest rates at
the conference, and as the news of the cuts in the Lombard and discount
rates emerged, some of the markets sold off.
Dealers noted strong overseas buying of high-yielding paper, particularly of
Spanish and Italian government bonds. 'The yields look attractive and there
is scope for an easing in Spanish interest rates possibly as soon as the
next repo,' said Mr Steve Major, bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais.
The yield on the Spanish 10.3 per cent bond due 2002 fell from 11.63 per
cent to 11.50 per cent.
In Italy, which had started on a strong note because of the 50 basis point
cut in the Italian discount rate, bonds continued to climb on the Bundesbank
news. The Liffe futures contract gained 0.77 to 96.60, while the yield on
the 12 per cent bond due 2002 fell from 13.14 per cent to 13.02 per cent.
FRENCH government bonds rallied as the German interest rate cut was seen as
taking pressure off the French franc. The yield on two-year paper dropped
from 8.15 per cent to 7.91 per cent, while at the longer end, the fall was
less dramatic with the 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2003 yielding 7.81 per cent
by late afternoon, against 7.82 per cent at the opening.
THE German government bond market saw a surge of activity as rumours of an
interest rate cut circulated. The bund market has shown steady gains in
recent days, but started yesterday on a quiet note as dealers were waiting
for news on the public sector wage negotiations.
Dealers bought bunds on expectations that the Bundesbank would announce a
rate cut at its hastily-called press conference, and the market later sold
off once confirmation of the rate cuts came. The Liffe bund future contract,
which opened at 93.36, climbed to a high of 93.54 and then dropped to 93.05
before ending at 93.14.
THE UK government bond market rallied at first on expectations of a German
interest rate cut, then fell to end the day half a point lower on the Liffe
gilt futures contract.
Dealers pointed out that with sterling out of the European exchange rate
mechanism, the Bundesbank move would have little influence on UK interest
rates.
THE Bank of Japan cut its Official Discount Rate by 75 basis points to 2.5
per cent early yesterday, as expected, prompting a fall in Japanese
government bond prices initially.
The sell-off was mainly futures driven, with the March futures contract
falling from its opening level of 109.28 to a low of 108.95.
Dealers noted some buying interest as the futures contract fell below
109.00, an important support level, and the future recovered to end at
109.14 in Tokyo, before climbing to 109.26 in London trading.
In the cash market, the yield on the benchmark No 145 issue traded in a
range of 4.33-4.375 per cent, ending the day little changed at 4.35 per
cent.
The Official Discount Rate is now back at its historic low last seen in the
late 1980s.
The cut had been expected for some time, and was reflected in the rate on
three-month certificates of deposit. Three-month CD rates have fallen from
3.70 per cent a week ago to 3.25 per cent on Wednesday and 3.24 per cent
yesterday.
US TREASURY prices firmed across the board yesterday as the market continued
to take strength from the Treasury's decision to cut the size of the long
bond issue in next week's quarterly refunding auction.
News that the Bundesbank had cut its Lombard and discount rates initially
helped bond prices, but by the afternoon attention was firmly focused on
today's release of employment figures for January.
The market remained bullish in spite of yesterday morning's report that US
factory orders for December had risen 5.3 per cent, above expectations of a
5 per cent increase.
The benchmark 30-year government bond was  5/16 higher at 105 3/8 in late
trading, yielding 7.179 per cent. Gains were more modest at the short end of
the yield curve, where the two-year note was up  1/8 to yield 4.167.
The Federal Reserve refrained from open market intervention yesterday
morning, with Fed funds changing hands at 3 1/16 per cent, slightly firmer
than the Fed's perceived 3 per cent target for the rate.

THE Chicago Mercantile Exchange is to add an afternoon trading session for
its interest rate and foreign exchange products to the Globex electronic
trading system. US futures and options begin trading on Globex at 1800 local
time and are offered through the night.
From March 4, the CME plans to open Globex trading shortly after its trading
pits close each afternoon, extending futures and options trading during
Chicago business hours.
The move may be an admission by CME officials that Globex is more useful in
boosting domestic trading volume than as the universal worldwide trading
vehicle for which which it was first conceived.
Globex's slow start may lie in the fact that Japan is not yet part of the
system.

FT  05 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Philippines set to make
market come-back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Philippines is set to become the latest less-developed country to stage
a return to the international capital markets, having completed the
restructuring of its commercial bank debt under the Brady plan last
December.
An offering of Eurobonds totalling at least Dollars 150m is due to be
launched next Tuesday, following a series of investor roadshows. J. P.
Morgan is arranging the issue, which will have an option for placement in
the US market, under the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission's rule 144a.
The issue was originally planned for last November, but was postponed twice
due to poor market conditions.
The three-year offering is expected to offer a yield of around 325 basis
points more than the three-year US Treasury note. That would compare with
India trading at 400 basis points over US Treasuries, Turkey at less than
300 basis points and Mexico at around 250 basis points, dealers said. The
Philippines has no official debt rating.
Speaking at an investor roadshow in London yesterday, Mr Jose Cuisia, the
central bank governor, said that other Filipino borrowers hoped to follow
the Republic's lead. Among those mentioned were the country's Development
Bank and National Bank, as well as some private sector companies such as
Philippine Airlines, Manila Electric Company and San Miguel.
The Republic has an estimated Dollars 1bn of funding needs this year.
However, it is not yet clear how much the government will try to raise in
the international markets.
It will seek to maximise the amount of borrowing from bilateral sources,
such as international agencies, and will also raise funds in the domestic
markets, through T-bills and central bank bills.
However, with three-month rates at about 14 1/2 per cent, foreign currency
borrowings offer substantial cost savings.

FT  05 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Kingdom of Spain returns with DM4bn
Eurobond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Kingdom of Spain returned to the international capital markets yesterday
with a DM4bn, 10-year Eurobond, which benefited from the timely cut in
German interest rates.
An official at Dresdner Bank, which arranged the deal, said that the
Bundesbank's move fanned demand, which allowed the issue to be increased
from DM3bn.
The deal was priced to yield 31 basis points over the 7 1/8 per cent bund
due December 2002, at the lower end of the indicated range of 31-34 basis
points.
Yesterday's deal was Spain's first venture since last September, when
turbulent conditions in Europe's financial markets, caused by the currency
crisis in the exchange rate mechanism forced it to delay the pricing of its
first Eurodollar bond, as well as substantially increase the yield on the
Dollars 1.5bn deal.
Syndicate managers said yesterday's offering from Spain was attractive to
domestic investors since it yielded about 20 basis points over domestic
mortgage bonds. The paper also found favour in Austria, which has a special
tax agreement with Spain.
The issue traded close to its re-offer price of 99.50, to yield 7.32 per
cent, in the late afternoon, outperforming German government bonds which
fell on profit-taking after the cuts in the Lombard and discount rates.
The Spanish region of Andalucia is due to launch a DM300m issue via Dresdner
Bank in the next two weeks. Syndicate managers expect further sovereign and
supranational issues shortly, including five-year Eurobonds from the World
Bank and Belgium. Deutsche Bank declined to comment on speculation that it
would arrange the World Bank deal.
Elsewhere, Abbey National raised a further Pounds 100m through its second
reverse floating-rate note in as many days. Syndicate managers said that
investors were discouraged by the issuer's option to call the FRN in a
year's time, which they believed would considerably reduce their potential
gain.
Similarly, the three-and-a-half year maturity on the European Investment
Bank's Pounds 200m reverse FRN, compared with the three-year duration of
Wednesday's offerings, proved unpopular with investors since it increased
their risk on the interest rate front.
The pricing of the EIB deal was also viewed as aggress-ive.
Syndicate managers said distribution of the FRNs launched yesterday was much
slower than those brought on Wednesday. 'The market is getting saturated as
there is only a finite pool of demand for this sort of paper,' one syndicate
manager said.
The Canadian province of Saskatchewan provided a further variation on the
theme, with its 10-year, DM200m reverse FRN.
The Irish government is planning a new Eurobond issue of some IPounds 400m
equivalent, writes Tim Coone.
Mr Adrian Kearns, head of foreign currency borrowing at the National
Treasury Management Agency, said the funds would be raised in D-Marks, Swiss
francs or French francs.
Ireland returned to the Eurobond market last October as the European
currency crisis and speculative attacks upon the punt exhausted the Irish
government's reserves.

<TEXT>
an extension of the trend late last year and further evidence the economy is
pulling out of recession.
Retailers claimed promotions, such as heavy price-discounting, were less
noticeable than in the same month of previous years, which should boost
retailers' profits.
Mr Joseph Antonini, head of K mart, the large discount store chain reported:
'Record sales and profits in December, as well as high sell-through of
seasonal and apparel merchandise during the Christmas season, resulted in
fewer clearance sales at mark-down price this January.'
Mr William Howell, chairman of J. C. Penney, the Texas-based retailer, said:
"During the month, we virtually sold out of winter merchandise, and early
spring apparel sales posted good gains.
'Promotional activity was considerably below the level of last year,' he
added
Sales growth was spread across the retail sector.
Wal-Mart the largest stores group in sales terms which and operating
operates at the discount end of the market, reported a 10 per cent rise in
same-store sales last month.
Among specialty stores, The Gap, the fashion retailer, clocked up a 12 per
cent improvement in comparable store sales.
Circuit City Stores, one the largest consumer electronics retailers, posted
a 13 per cent advance in same-store sales.
Among the department stores, Federated, which takes in Bloomingdale's and
The Bon Marche, had a 5.3 per cent sales advance.
May Department Stores recorded a 7.4 per cent sales improvement in its
department stores. Neiman Marcus reported a 7.9 per cent improvement.
Sears, the large Chicago-based retailer, which recently announced the
closure of its catalogue operation, recorded an 8.3 per cent advance in
same-store sales.
There were laggards. Woolworth reported a rise of only 0.2 per cent in
comparable domestic store sales in January.
K mart saw general merchandise sales dip by 0.7 per cent year-on-year,
although the specialty stores division posted a 2.5 per cent improvement.
J. C. Penney also saw a 0.1 per cent decline, on a same-store basis, from
its core chain.

FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Goldstrike mine boosts American
Barrick profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Barrick, defying the gloom in the gold-mining industry, announced a
near-doubling in 1992 earnings, an accelerated production schedule at its
flagship Goldstrike mine, and plans to broaden its horizons to Latin
America.
The Toronto-based company lifted net earnings to USDollars 174.9m, or
Dollars 1.22 a share, in 1992, from Dollars 92.4m, or 68 cents, the previous
year. Revenues from gold sales soared by 57 per cent to Dollars 540m.
The strong improvement was almost entirely due to higher production and
lower costs at the Goldstrike mine in Nevada. Goldstrike's output more than
doubled to 1.11m ounces last year.
Output from all five of the company's mines rose to 1.33m ounces from
790,000 ounces. Aggregate cash costs fell to Dollars 210 per ounce from
Dollars 305.
An active hedging programme held prices realised last year at an average
Dollars 422 per ounce, well above prevailing market levels. Mr Greg Wilkins,
chief financial officer, said yesterday output was fully hedged to the end
of 1994 at prices above Dollars 400, and the company was now hedging between
20 per cent and 25 per cent of its output up to 2001.
Thanks to a co-operation agreement signed late last year with Newmont
Mining, which owns deposits adjoining Goldstrike, Barrick forecasts its
total production will surpass 2m ounces by 1995, five years earlier than the
original target.
Barrick has also raised its estimate of ore reserves at Goldstrike's
Betze-Post pit by 20 per cent, bringing the company's total reserves to
27.2m ounces. The estimated grade at Betze-Post has been revised upwards to
0.22 ounces per ton from 0.19 ounces.
Exploration work at Goldstrike will continue this year. Mr Bob Smith,
Barrick's president, expressed confidence yesterday that 'the final chapter
on reserves at Goldstrike has yet to be written.'
Yesterday's announcements pushed Barrick's share price up 37 cents to
CDollars 38.75 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The company, which had its
origins as a troubled oil and gas producer in the early 1980s, is ranked
eighth in market value on the TSE, ahead of such traditional giants of
Canadian business as Canadian Pacific and Alcan Aluminium.

FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Rescue of Japanese property
finance company in jeopardy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN AGREEMENT by leading Japanese banks to bail out Nippon Housing Loan, a
troubled property finance company, is in jeopardy following a refusal by
agricultural credit institutions to accept a cut in interest rates on loans
to the company.
Nippon Housing Loan, founded by nine commercial banks in 1971, has an
estimated Y1,300bn (Dollars 10.5bn) in non-performing loans arising from the
'bubble' era of the late 1980s, when it became a leading lender to ambitious
property developers.
The Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance have drafted a rescue package,
in conjunction with Tokyo-based commercial banks, calling on each of the
banks with exposure to Nippon Housing to accept a reduction in interest
payments.
But the national executive of the prefectural credit federation of
agricultural co-operatives said yesterday that it would not accept the
proposal made by the central bank and the ministry, which expect
institutions to lower rates to between 1.5 per cent and 3.25 per cent.
As commercial banks became wary of lending to Nippon Housing, agricultural
institutions, looking for new customers, filled the gap as the property
market was turning sour. About one-third of the housing company's debt of
Y2,100bn was provided by these institutions, which were apparently unaware
of the risk.
The involvement of politically-influential farmers' groups with Nippon
Housing has made the rescue all the more awkward, as agriculture ministry
officials have seriously proposed that the bail-out plan be linked to the
opening of the rice market. Under that proposal, the farmers' groups would
be repaid in full following an agreement to allow rice imports.
It is likely that the farmers' co-ops will eventually accept a small
reduction in interest payments, but the delay in reaching agreement on the
rescue is frustrating larger institutions, which see the Nippon Housing case
as a model for seven other housing loan companies in need of urgent
restructuring.
Daiwa Securities, a leading Japanese broker, said yesterday that it would
support a troubled small broker, Marukin Securities, by accepting 95 per
cent of a Y655m third-party share allotment. The agreement appears to set an
important precedent for assistance by large Japanese securities houses to
ailing small brokers, which have suffered most from the share price
collapse.

OMRON, the Japanese control component maker, joined the country's growing
number of corporations altering their long-held employment practices due to
the prolonged economic slowdown.
The company is reducing its workforce by 9 per cent over the next three
years, said Mr Yoshio Tateishi, president. The company will reduce its total
workforce of 16,000 by 1,500, but Omron plans to achieve this by natural
wastage and by reducing its graduate intake.
Omron's taxable profits, hit by a fall in capital spending, were 80 per cent
down to Y1.28bn (Dollars 10m) for the six months to September.

FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Campbell gains 53.6% of Arnotts
with AMP stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CAMPBELL Soup, the US food group, last night claimed victory over Arnotts,
the Australian biscuit maker, after its hostile takeover offer was accepted
by the AMP Society, Australia's biggest financial institution.
AMP said it had sold a 6.3 per cent stake in Arnotts, reducing its stake to
2.2 per cent. This reversed AMP's earlier decision to reject Campbell's
ADollars 9.50-a-share offer, which values Arnotts at ADollars 1.3bn
(USDollars 870m).
The society's change of heart increases Campbell's stake in Arnotts to 53.6
per cent, comfortably in excess of the group's target of 50.1 per cent.
Further acceptances are expected before the bid closes today.
However, Campbell will be prevented from taking control of Arnotts by a
shareholding agreement which prevents the US group from appointing a
majority of board members unless it acquires 85.1 per cent of the shares.
The agreement was drawn up when Campbell took a friendly 33 per cent stake
in Arnotts in 1985 as part of the company's defence against a hostile bid by
Mr Alan Bond's Bond Corporation Holdings.
Mr David Johnson, Campbell's chief executive, said the group would encourage
Arnotts to expand its presence in the growing Asian biscuit market, which it
claims the Australian company has neglected.
Mr Johnson, who was born in Australia, said AMP's change of mind was 'wise
and responsible'. He said it would serve the national interest by assisting
Arnotts to grow.
Mr Bill Purdy, Arnotts' chairman, said he was 'disappointed' by the AMP's
decision, but claimed it was 'out of the question' Campbell would gain
control of the board.
The AMP move was criticised by family shareholders, who have campaigned
strongly against Campbell's offer on the grounds that it would transfer
control of important Australian consumer products to foreign owners.
Ms Alice Oppen, chairman of a shareholder lobby group and a descendant of
one of Arnotts' founders, said Campbell must have offered 'inducements' to
AMP to change its decision.
She said family shareholders, who account for more than 20 per cent of the
stock, would try to ensure that Campbell was unable to achieve control of
the board.
Mr Leigh Hall, AMP's investment manager, said the society had accepted the
offer because it believed that the bid would not be increased or extended.
AMP was 'sympathetic' to calls for Arnotts to remain Australian-owned. But
he said 'Arnotts is now more than one-half foreign-owned and. . . Campbell
will in any event have a considerable input into its operation.
'Given this position, AMP considers that the size of the minority Australian
element is no longer a relevant issue.' Arnotts shares closed 1 cent lower
at ADollars 9.51.

FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Thai banks earn more after
liberalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THAILAND'S 15 commercial banks increased their overall net profits by 59.8
per cent last year to Bt31.10bn (Dollars 1.2bn), after a 25.4 per cent rise
in 1991, according to figures compiled by Bangkok Bank, the country's
largest.
Bangkok Bank attributed the strength of profits partly to financial
liberalisation measures introduced by the Thai authorities, including the
relaxation of foreign exchange controls and the easing of restrictions on
new branches.
Banks have been allowed to engage in many new areas of business. Compulsory
holdings of government bonds as a condition for opening new branches have
also been reduced.
'All banks have been improving their efficiency to prepare themselves for
the anticipated greater competition from both local and overseas commercial
banks and other financial institutions,' Bangkok Bank's research department
said.
'Furthermore, several banks have been able to reclaim many of their bad
debts, resulting in greater revenue.'
One factor not mentioned in the report is the continued co-operation between
Thai banks in maintaining wide spreads between deposit rates and lending
rates.
Bangkok Bank said the assets, deposits, credits and capital of Thai banks
last year grew at a lower rate than in previous years because of the
moderate slowdown of the local economy and the world recession. Assets of
the 15 banks were Bt2,589.5bn at the end of December.
Rates of return on assets were generally higher last year than in 1991,
averaging 1.2 per cent against 0.87 per cent, with Bangkok Bank itself
chalking up the highest figure of 1.58 per cent.
Bangkok Bank also had the highest rate of return on equity, at 23.25 per
cent, compared with the average of 17.59 per cent.
Twelve of the banks reported much higher increases in net profit last year
than in 1991. Bangkok Bank was one of the three exceptions: its net profit
rose 45.3 per cent last year to Bt10.54bn, after a 54.7 rise in 1991.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
METHANEX, of Vancouver, will emerge as the world's biggest methanol producer
and distributor under a deal to buy the methanol interests of Fletcher
Challenge, of New Zealand. Methanex, whose biggest shareholder is
Metalgesellschaft, the German metals and chemicals group, will pay Fletcher
Challenge USDollars 250m in cash plus 74m Methanex shares.
As a result, Fletcher will end up with a 43 per cent stake in Methanex,
while Metalgesellschaft's interest will drop from 32 per cent to 10 per
cent.
But the German group will have an option to acquire some of Fletcher's
shares, and each group will have a right of first refusal on the other's
shares.
The deal is conditional on shareholder and regulatory approvals as well as
the completion of financing for the cash payment. Methanex also announced it
was raising CDollars 346m (USDollars 272m) by selling 42m shares to an
underwriting group of Canadian securities dealers.
Its purchase of the Fletcher assets, together with other expansion projects
under way, will boost its annual production and marketing capacity to over
5m tonnes of methanol, or almost a quarter of world output.
Its leading facilities will be in North America, New Zealand, Chile and
Trinidad.
The company said the plants being bought from Fletcher were among the
lowest-cost facilities in the world and would 'considerably' reduce
Methanex's average production costs. Methanol is a key feedstock for
production of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), used as an octane enhancer
and oxygenate to cut emissions from motor vehicle engines.
Demand for MTBE is rising in the US following passage of the Clear Air Act
in 1990, which requires the use of oxygenates in petrol.

FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Northwest Air deficit soars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHWEST Airlines, the fourth-largest US carrier in which KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines holds a significant minority stake, yesterday reported an after-tax
loss of Dollars 89.1m, before special charges, in the fourth quarter.
This compares with a Dollars 79.2m loss for the same period of 1991, and
brings the after-tax loss for the year to Dollars 156m - substantially
increased from the Dollars 3.1m deficit seen in 1991.
Including charges related to accounting changes, quarterly and annual losses
for the airline operations were Dollars 207.2m and Dollars 383m
respectively.
Meanwhile, NWA, the privately-owned parent company, incurred losses of
Dollars 139m (against Dollars 164.3m) and Dollars 405.1m (Dollars 316.9m) in
the fourth-quarter and 12-month periods respectively, with the charges
excluded.
With the addition of these items, the deficit widened to Dollars 682.4m in
the final three months of the year, and Dollars 1.06bn in 1992 overall.
Revenues were virtually unchanged at Dollars 1.93bn in the final quarter,
but increased by 5.3 per cent for the year overall to Dollars 8.13bn.
Northwest's figures complete the results season for the leading US airlines.
With the exception of Southwest Airlines, all carriers have shown heavy
fourth-quarter and annual losses before the accounting-related charges.
Mr John Dasburg, Northwest's chief executive, summed up the prevailing view
of the airline companies yesterday when he said the results 'underscore the
extremely difficult and predatory pricing environment in which this industry
operated beginning in April 1992'.
'The pricing environment and the slow economic recovery both domestically
and internationally made 1992 the third bleak year in a row for this
industry,' he noted.

CAISSE d'Epargne, the French network of savings banks, yesterday highlighted
the pressures on France's banking sector by publishing provisional results
for 1992 which indicated a 14 per cent fall in net profits to FFr2bn
(Dollars 370m).
Mr Rene Barberye, chairman of Caisse d'Epargne, the main savings institution
in France, said the profits reduction reflected the financial impact of the
company's attempts to modernise its activities by investing in new
management systems and technology.
Net profits were FFr2.5bn on net banking income of FFr23.3bn in 1991, a year
in which its overall costs settled at FFr17.8bn. Mr Barberye did not
indicate the likely level of sales and costs for 1992 but said operating
profits fell by between 7 per cent and 8 per cent during the year.
The profits warning from Caisse d'Epargne is the latest in a stream of
gloomy announcements from the French banks, which are being squeezed by the
dual impact of the economic slowdown and the crisis in the French property
market.
Paribas, one of the most prestigious investment banks, last week announced
that it had returned to the black with net profits of around FFr900m in
1992, but had been forced to make heavy provisions.

FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Poor nickel prices hit Inco
result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SLIDING nickel prices pushed Inco, the West's biggest producer of the metal,
to a deeper fourth-quarter loss, despite a vigorous effort to contain costs.
The Toronto-based company's loss reached USDollars 28.9m, or 28 cents a
share, up from a deficit of Dollars 5.8m, or 7 cents, a year earlier.
Fourth-quarter revenues slid to Dollars 627m from Dollars 710m.
The latest figures include after-tax expenses of Dollars 9.7m for production
shutdowns and Dollars 8.1m for severance pay.
The biggest drag on earnings, however, was a drop in average nickel prices
to Dollars 3.01/lb in the final three months of the year, from Dollars 3.55
a year earlier and Dollars 3.47 in the third quarter. Copper prices were
also lower.
The company ascribed the fall in nickel prices to the surge in exports from
Russia and 'reduced demand' in some consuming countries.
The fourth-quarter performance was the worst of the year and resulted in a
loss for 1992 as a whole of Dollars 17.6m, or 21 cents a share, compared
with earnings of Dollars 82.6m, or 74 cents, in 1991. Revenues for the year
dipped to Dollars 2.61bn from Dollars 3.05bn.
Weak nickel prices have forced the company not only to cut back output, but
also to tighten cost controls.
Nickel deliveries fell to 473m lb last year, from 507m lb in 1992.
Fourth-quarter shipments were down to 122m lb from 125m lb. Gold shipments
fell especially sharply, from 23,000 ounces to 9,000 ounces.
Inco said that its nickel unit production costs fell by 14 per cent in the
fourth quarter against a year earlier.
Capital spending will be trimmed to about Dollars 225m this year, from
Dollars 234m last year and Dollars 440m in 1991.
The company said it planned to further reduce costs.

flotation

<TEXT>
SAUDI British Bank, the Riyadh-based joint-venture bank 40 per cent owned by
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, is to float 1.2m shares on Saudi
Arabia's stock market from February 13 to raise its paid-up capital by 150
per cent to SR1bn (Dollars 266m).
HSBC will buy a further 800,000 shares in the issue to retain its present
holding.
Bankers in Riyadh said the shares would be offered at SR570, a SR100 face
value price plus a premium of SR470. The bank will also offer existing
shareholders 4m free shares, one-for-one, paid for from reserves. This is
likely to halve the share's present market price, presently just over
SR1,500, offering a substantial premium after the flotation.
Saudi Arabia's stock market has eased from its buoyant peaks last year,
partly as a result of a slew of new issues, but bankers expect the Saudi
British issue to be heavily subscribed. 'Some extraordinary figures have
been bandied around,' said one.
Saudi British Bank, the Kingdom's fourth-largest, recently reported a 7 per
cent rise in net profits for 1992 to SR268.1m, but sees last years' figures
as the end of a period of recovery and restructuring.
The bank has doubled its balance sheet size since 1988 and is thought to
require the additional capital to expand further. The bank says it is
looking to capitalise on the continued buoyancy of both the consumer market
and private sector in the kingdom since the end of the Gulf war.

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WASTE Management, the multi-national environmental and sanitation services
company, yesterday reported fourth-quarter operating results of Dollars
206.2m, or 42 cents a share, virtually unchanged from the 1991 fourth
quarter of Dollars 207m, or 42 cents.
The 1992 figures exclude a 5 cent per share charge for restructuring at
Brand Companies and Chemical Waste Management subsidiaries, while the 1991
results exclude a 37 cents a share one-time charge for environmental
liabilities.
Fourth-quarter sales were Dollars 2.2bn, up from Dollars 2bn.
Mr Jim McDonald, securities analyst with the Chicago Corporation, said the
results were slightly below Wall Street estimates because of an earnings
shortfall at Chemical Waste Management, expenses related to an expansion in
North American sales staff and unfavourable foreign exchange conversions.
For the year, operating earnings advanced to Dollars 828.8m, or Dollars 1.68
a share, from Dollars 773.4m, or Dollars 1.57, in 1991, excluding
extraordinary charges and gains in both periods. Sales were Dollars 8.7bn,
up from Dollars 7.6bn.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COLGATE-PALMOLIVE, the US consumer products group, yesterday reported a 27
per cent rise in fourth-quarter net income and a 14 per cent increase in
earnings per share.
The company reported net income of Dollars 110m, or 66 cents a share, up
from Dollars 86.9m, or 58 cents, in the same period of last year on sales 12
per cent higher at Dollars 1.77bn. The company had 14 per cent more shares
outstanding in the quarter than a year before.
For the full year, Colgate reported net income of Dollars 477m, or Dollars
2.92 a share, compared to Dollars 124.9m, or 77 cents, in 1991 when the
company took a Dollars 243m restructuring charge. Excluding the charge,
income rose 30 per cent, while earnings per share were up 14 per cent on
sales 16 per cent ahead at Dollars 7bn.
The 1992 figures were helped by the Mennen personal care business, which
Colgate acquired early in the year.
Mr Reuben Mark, chairman, said each of Colgate's four main geographic
regions achieved excellent growth, with the largest base business sales
increases coming from Latin America and Asia/Africa.
Gross profit margins had set a record of 47.1 per cent, up from 45.6 per
cent, as the company moved its product mix towards high-margin personal care
products and invested in more efficient production.
In the fourth quarter household and personal care product sales rose 14 per
cent to Dollars 1.53bn, while specialty marketing, which includes pet
nutrition and healthcare, was 6 per cent ahead at Dollars 237.4m.

FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Montedison close to stake sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MONTEDISON, the lossmaking Italian chemicals and agro-industrial group
controlled by Ferruzzi, yesterday confirmed it was in the final phase of
talks to sell an important stake in its profitable Erbamont pharmaceuticals
subsidiary.
The likely buyer is Procordia, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, which was
rumoured to have been in talks on buying a stake last year.
Montedison gave no indication of the size of the stake for sale or the
potential price. However, analysts believe the group, which is struggling to
reduce its large debts by disposing of non-core activities, will give up
majority control.
Montedison said the aim was to create one of Europe's biggest
pharmaceuticals companies. Erbamont controls Farmitalia Carlo Erba, the
leading Italian producer of prescription drugs.
The group, which had sales of about L1,600bn (Dollars 1.1bn) and operating
profits of about L250bn last year, is active in the US through its Adria
Laboritories subsidiary.
Procordia's pharmaceuticals activities are conducted through its
Kabi-Pharmacia arm. The operation, which specialises in drugs for growth
problems, eye surgery and patient feeding problems, has annual sales of
about L2,600bn. Erbamont controls Antibioticos, a smaller bulk
pharmaceuticals business, with turnover of about L175bn, which is not
expected to be included in the transaction.
In spite of its profitable agro-industrial and energy businesses, Montedison
plunged into loss in the first half of last year as a result of the downturn
in the world chemicals business and heavy interest payments on its debts.
Apart from the sale proceeds, divesting a majority stake in Erbamont would
allow the group to take about L1,000bn in Erbamont debt off its balance
sheet.

FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Defence companies in France link
arms - The first restructuring of the military industry for 20 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S powerful defence companies are closing ranks, as their
quartermaster - the French state - has told them to.
The most visible sign of what is the first restructuring of the French
military industry for some 20 years is the recent accord between
Aerospatiale and Dassault Aviation. The government has used its financial
holdings in the country's two aircraft makers to force them into more
industrial co-operation.
There have been recent shifts in other areas. SAGEM, a space and aeronautics
company, has taken an 8 per cent stake in Dassault Electronique. CAP Sesa,
the computer services company, has a co-operation agreement with the Matra
defence arm of the new Matra - Hachette group.
Aerospatiale has set up with the state-owned SNPE a common subsidiary to
work on missile propulsion. Potentially more far-reaching are the talks
which Aerospatiale is holding with Matra and Thomson-CSF to mesh its missile
division with one or other of them.
The squeeze on the French defence industry can be measured by the relief
with which Dassault has greeted Taiwan's confirmation of its FFr4bn (Dollars
740m) order for 60 Mirage jets, and by the considerable risk which the
French government is ready to run that China will retaliate by cancelling
other business with France. The Taiwan contract is Dassault Aviation's first
military export order in more than four years.
In spite of this order, France's arms exports, which totalled FFr29bn in
1991, are well down on their mid-1980s level, without any compensating
increase in orders from the French state.
The government is trying to give the industry a soft landing by keeping the
equipment budget steady in nominal terms (FFr102.9bn last year). 'But we
will have to be more selective in the future; we can't have any more
doubling up of research,' says a senior adviser to Mr Pierre Joxe, the
defence minister.
It was precisely to avoid research duplication that Mr Joxe decided that the
state should at last exploit its 46 per cent overall stake in Dassault. He
revived a state holding called Sogepa, set up in 1967 to hold the 20 per
cent stake which the state then took in Dassault.
To that original Sogepa holding in Dassault Mr Joxe has added 16 per cent of
the state's further acquisitions of Dassault in 1981.
However, the government has kept a direct 10 per cent stake in Dassault,
with the right to one direct nomination to its board. At the same time, the
government has put into Sogepa 25 per cent of state-owned Aerospatiale's
equity.
The financial web has been completed by making Mr Louis Gallois,
Aerospatiale's head, president of Sogepa with its decisive voice in
Dassault, and by making Mr Serge Dassault vice-president of Sogepa and a
board member of Aerospatiale. The point of creating this incestuous
relationship is, says the defence ministry, that the two companies should
conduct more of their research and commercial activities in common.
They certainly have large research departments. Dassault, for example,
employs 3,200 engineers, a quarter of its total payroll.
Aerospatiale's larger commercial network could benefit Dassault, whose sales
force has receded in line with its export orders.
France is still an important maker of missiles - about FFr20bn to FFr25bn a
year. But it is not so important, says Mr Henri Conze, a former senior
defence official who advises France's conservative opposition, that it
warrants maintaining three producers - Aerospatiale, Thomson-CSF, Matra.
'There are now seven missile companies in Europe, but there will only be two
eventually,' he forecasts.
At the centre of the manoeuvring is Aerospatiale, whose long-standing
missile co-operation with Deutsche Aerospace is undergoing one of its
cyclical drops, and which is thus seeking a domestic partnership, even
partial merger, with either Thomson or Matra.
Each has its merits. Thomson makes radar/command and control systems into
which Aerospatiale missiles could be integrated; Matra makes missiles, but
of ranges that complement Aerospatiale's.
Just for that reason, Matra is nervous that Thomson may be planning to buy,
from Bombardier of Canada, Short Brothers of Belfast.
The latter makes short-range missiles that could compete with Matra's.
With elections two months away, French defence companies could become a
political football again, as in 1981 when the state took control of, or
stakes in, Thomson, Dassault and Matra, and in 1986 when Matra was
privatised.
A new conservative government would probably find Thomson relatively easy to
make private because it once was so. Aerospatiale would be much harder to
float.
However, Mr Conze believes privatisation is largely irrelevant.
Whatever their ownership, defence companies are effectively controlled by
their customer - the state. The socialist government agrees. The crucial
issue is forging international as well as domestic alliances.
'The real question is not whether French defence companies are privatised or
nationalised,' says one of Mr Joxe's officials.
'It is whether they should have their capital opened up to foreign
partners.'

FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Celcius ownership structure to
be broadened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CELCIUS, the Swedish state-owned defence group, moved a step nearer
privatisation yesterday when the government announced plans to broaden the
company's ownership structure and consider a stock market quotation within
four months.
The government says the state will remain a significant shareholder in the
group, but it is likely that its holding will be reduced to about 20 per
cent if enough industrial and institutional investors are willing to buy the
shares. Estimates of the market capitalisation range widely, with most
falling between SKr2bn and SKr3bn (Dollars 276m to Dollars 415m).
The aim is to draw in industrial and institutional owners, rather than
retail investors.
If carried through, this would make Celcius the second large Swedish
privatisation since the government announced in 1991 that it was planning to
sell off 35 state-owned groups.
Last year, the government sold off the big state steel group, SSAB, and
three smaller companies.
However, a stumbling block could be the attitude of the opposition Social
Democrats, who say they oppose a stock market listing for Celcius at this
stage. The party gained a say in the privatisation process as part of a
crisis package agreed with the government last September.
Mr Olof Lund, Celcius chairman and chief executive, said the group had
decided in September 1991 that it wanted to broaden its ownership structure.
Since then, it has been carrying out internal restructuring, which has
included the sale of its installation company Calor and the disposal of some
real estate operations.
Mr Per Westerberg, industry minister, said: 'A market quotation for Celcius
gives the company the possibility to take an active part in the
restructuring of the Swedish and European defence industry.'
Even though Celcius is a defence company, there are no restrictions on
foreign ownership.
Celcius made a profit of SKr345m on sales of SKr7.7bn in the first eight
months of 1992.

SGS-THOMSON, the Franco-Italian state-owned semiconductor group, yesterday
revealed that it swung into a Dollars 3m net profit last year from a Dollars
102.6m loss in 1991, and forecast a substantial improvement in 1993.
Mr Pasquale Pistorio, group president, said the group, the world's
13th-largest chip maker, had increased its share of the global semiconductor
market slightly to 2.7 per cent from 2.5 per cent in 1991. The company,
which is in its fifth year, said it needed to nearly double that to ensure
long-term survival.
The world semiconductor market will nearly triple in size to Dollars 170bn
from Dollars 60bn over this period, the group estimated. That implied that
SGS-Thomson's sales needed to increase more than five-fold to Dollars 8.5bn
over the next seven years from last year's Dollars 1.6bn. Group sales rose
by 12 per cent last year, two points ahead of the market.

FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Travelers faces Dollars 658m
loss as loan reserves increase
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRAVELERS, one the largest US composite insurers but beset by a troubled
property portfolio, yesterday said it would step up sales of foreclosed real
estate assets as the US property market recovers.
As a result of this, and the need to comply with a new fair value accounting
requirement, the company was bolstering property and mortgage loan reserves
by a further Dollars 735m, and warned it would post a Dollars 658m after-tax
loss for 1992.
Mr Edward Budd, Travelers chairman, claimed the strategy was designed to
'take early advantage of emerging liquidity developing in real estate
markets'. It would allow Hartford-based Travelers to redeploy investment
funds tied up in ailing property into assets offering a better return.
Over the past four-and-a-half years, the company has shed some Dollars 1.4bn
of foreclosed real estate assets. However, at end-1992, its mortgage loan
and real estate portfolio stood at Dollars 13.6bn (before valuation
reserves). Of this, Dollars 5.1bn-worth was classed as underperforming and
Dollars 2.3bn-worth as underperforming in the foreclosed category.
To reflect the disposal strategy and the accounting standard - which
requires the company to account for the foreclosed real estate held for sale
at fair value - Mr Budd said Travelers had written down almost all of its
foreclosed property assets and provided for disposal costs. It had increased
provisions for mortgage loans which might be affected by the new strategy.
As a result, the loss provision ratio, as related to the underperforming
property portfolio, stands at 38 per cent, and Travelers' total mortgage and
real estate reserves are about Dollars 1.5bn. At end-1991, the reserve for
potential property-related losses was Dollars 909m.
The increased provision will cause Travelers to post a net loss of Dollars
589m in the fourth quarter, and a Dollars 658m deficit - equivalent to
Dollars 6.51 a share - for the year. In 1991, the company reported after-tax
profits of Dollars 318m, or Dollars 2.97 a share.

Recession coupled with difficult conditions in the shipping industry left
Bristol Channel Ship Repairers Pounds 236,261 in the red at the pre-tax
level for the 28 weeks to October 9.
The loss, which compared with previous profits of Pounds 74,884, was struck
after taking account of a special non-recurring item of Pounds 150,000.
Turnover fell from Pounds 661,801 to Pounds 34,192 and losses per share
amounted to 0.3p (earnings 0.09p).
Andreas Ugland, a private Norwegian shipping group, took a 24 per cent stake
in the company last July.
Developments at Bristol could result in Mr Christopher Bailey stepping down
as chairman.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Marshalls, the building materials and engineering group, has sold a
fully-worked part of its Howley Park quarry to Biffa Waste Services, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Severn Trent, for a minimum Pounds 5m.
An initial Pounds 600,000 has already been paid and further payments of
Pounds 500,000 are due in stages with a substantial final instalment in May
1997.
The disposal will result in an exceptional profit to Marshalls of at least
Pounds 2.9m for the year to March 31 1993, when the company expects profits
to approach last year's Pounds 12.5m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, has decided not to refer the
proposed merger of the mining equipment division of Dobson Park Industries
with Meco International to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Between them, Dobson Park and Meco supply all of British Coal's hydraulic
roof supports and 80 per cent of its conveyors, used to carry the coal away
from the face.
Both companies have shed about 1,000 jobs over the past three years, and Mr
Heseltine's pit closure programme has added to the speculation about further
job losses.

FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Kwik Save moves into Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KWIK SAVE, the discount grocery retailer, is moving into Scotland and plans
to open up to 100 stores in the next few years.
The expansion will intensify competition in the Scottish discount retailing
market, where Isle of Man-based Shoprite is also expanding and is set to
increase its stores from 38 to 59 this year.
Worries about competition and price cutting knocked Shoprite's shares down
30p to 753p yesterday. Kwik Save shares were unchanged at 799p.
Kwik Save had delayed opening in Scotland, seen by analysts as a natural
market for the company, until a five-year development programme for London
and the south-east was 'up to speed', according to Mr Graeme Seabrook, chief
executive. 'We didn't want to be losing money on two fronts,' he said,
adding that the south-east was expected to be profitable this year.
Kwik Save will today begin advertising for high street and edge-of-town
sites. Costs of the expansion would depend on whether sites were acquired
leasehold or freehold. Mr Seabrook said funding would come from existing
resources.
Distribution will be handled from Kwik Save's warehouse site north of
Manchester. Despite higher distribution costs, Mr Seabrook said Kwik Save
would 'not be beaten on a value for money basis' against Shoprite.
Kwik Save's decision follows a report last month from Verdict, the retail
market research company, predicting that discount food retailers were
becoming a significant force in the UK and could double their sales by 1996.
Other analysts estimate the sector will also become more competitive,
especially if foreign discounters target the UK market.
Mr Seabrook said he hoped the Scottish expansion would become profitable
more quickly than the south-east programme. He would be disappointed if
losses were sustained for more than two or three years. 'We weren't
understood in the south-east and we're a very different company now to
then,' he said.
The Scottish move will not affect the programme of store openings throughout
England.

HONG KONG Bank of Australia, the wholly owned subsidiary of HSBC Holdings,
yesterday announced its first profit in four years.
The company showed after-tax profits of Dollars A8.06m (Pounds 3.8m) in
1992, compared with losses of Dollars A37.8m previously.
The results were in line with analysts' expectations.
HKBA reported an increase of 9 per cent in its total assets, and a marginal
improvement in its capital adequacy ratios.
Mr Richard Orgill, chief executive, forecast increased profitability in
1993.
The bank has undergone staff cuts and a rationalisation of its operations
and is now trying to capitalise on its Asian links to boost business. Its
treasury and trade finance division achieved record profits.
Mr Orgill said: 'A major strength of our group is its well-established Asian
franchise.

FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Bad debts behind fall to Pounds 61.4m at
Britannia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RISE in provisions for bad debts, caused by the slump in the housing
market and recession, reduced pre-tax profits at Britannia Building Society
by 4 per cent from Pounds 64m to Pounds 61.4m last year.
Britannia, the ninth largest society, was weighed down by a bad debt cost of
Pounds 71.9m (Pounds 50.3m) for the year to December 31, comprising Pounds
47.1m (Pounds 33.7m) in provisions and Pounds 24.8m (Pounds 16.6m) in
irrecoverable interest on non-performing loans.
The results were roughly in line with the pattern expected in the industry
for 1992. A survey last month by the brokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew found that
societies' pre-tax profits were likely to fall by 7 per cent on average.
Operating profits before provisions rose by 16.5 per cent to Pounds 113.8m
(Pounds 97.7m), but pre-tax profits were further reduced by a Pounds 5.3m
exceptional charge for the cost of making 100 staff redundant and the
closure of estate agency offices.
Britannia Life, the society's life assurance and investment subsidiary, made
a Pounds 14m contribution to profits, up some 30 per cent on 1991.
A widening of margins as base rates fell by 4.5 percentage points in the
last quarter of the year helped raise net interest received - the gap
between interest paid on savings products and received on assets - to Pounds
165m (Pounds 144.3m).
Mr Michael Shaw, managing director, said the results represented 'a very
good trading performance during a year in which the housing market virtually
ground to a halt'. He said the society had benefited from 'vigilance on
costs'.
The cost to income ratio, including the exceptional charge, rose slightly to
49.5 per cent (48.4 per cent). Capital increased from Pounds 470m to Pounds
623m as a result of profits and two issues of permanent interest-bearing
shares totalling Pounds 110m.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEWAY, the struggling environmental engineering group, yesterday announced
its second boardroom shake-up in a year with the departure of Mr John
McGowan, the chief executive
Mr Hugh Ashton, who took over Mr McGowan's post of chairman in November,
said yesterday the group was 'a long way down the line' on appointing a
replacement. An announcement was expected soon, he said.
Mr McGowan's departure comes after two years of increasing difficulties for
the loss-making company.
The accounts, published yesterday, were qualified by Price Waterhouse, which
stated that 'subject to the group having sufficient banking facilities to be
able to continue trading', the company was a going concern.
Mr Ashton criticised the decision to qualify the accounts in light of the
recent agreement with banks to secure Pounds 21m in facilities until the
financial year-end in September. Last year the banks agreed to extend the
facilities in return for security on Wheway's Pounds 21m in net assets. The
group paid some Pounds 1m in debt restructuring fees.
Wheway said that it intended to strengthen the board with new non-executive
and executive appointments.

FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Menvier-Swain seeks Pounds 9m to help fund
French buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MENVIER-SWAIN Group, the emergency lighting and fire alarms company, plans
to raise Pounds 9m through a rights issue to help fund the acquisition of
Nugelec, a French fire alarm system manufacturer for FFr84.8m (Pounds
10.6m).
The company announced the planned acquisition and the proposed 1-for-8
rights issue at 520p a share, underwritten by Schroders, at the same time as
reporting a 16 per cent increase in first half profits and a 22 per cent
lift in the interim dividend.
The profits growth reflected both organic growth and recent acquisitions.
The shares closed down 2p at 603p yesterday.
Separately the company also announced that Mr Charles Swain, president and a
director, had placed 2.39m shares, representing a 16.7 per cent stake, with
institutional investors at 573p a share yesterday. Mr Swain retains an
interest in 550,000 shares.
After the placement and rights issue the directors will hold 3.1m shares,
representing 19 per cent of the equity.
Menvier-Swain has been steadily building its operations in continental
Europe through a string of small acquisitions, including one in Italy and
another in Germany in the last six months.
It already claims to be the market leader in Europe for emergency lighting
with an overall 10 per cent share and aims to become the largest in terms of
fire alarm systems as well.
Paris-based Nugelec, which made pre-tax profits of FFr18m (FFr12.7m) on
sales of FFr50.6m (FFr35m) in the year to December 31 1992, will link up
with Luminox, Menvier's existing French subsidiary, to form a French group
with a similar product range to Menvier-Swain's operations in the UK.
Nugelec's sales are expected to decline by about 10 per cent this year
because of a fall in sales to its biggest customer.
Menvier-Swain will pay FFr79.8m in cash and FFr5m in shares.
The interim results highlight the success of the group's expansion into
continental Europe.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to October 31 increased to Pounds 3.21m
(Pounds 2.77m) with interest charges falling to Pounds 277,000 (Pounds
363,000).
Sales grew by 27 per cent to Pounds 25m (Pounds 19.7m). Earnings per share
increased from 13.3p to 14.9p. The interim dividend goes up from 2.7p to
3.3p.
The USM-quoted company said it was considering moving to the main market.

FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Chrysler's credit upgraded by
S&amp;P
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHRYSLER, the US carmaker which raised dollars 1.78bn gross on Tuesday in an
international share offering, yesterday saw this success result in an
upgrading of its credit rating by Standard &amp; Poor's.
The rating agency's move brought the car company to within one notch of its
declared goal of getting its senior debt re-classified as investment grade,
rather than the more speculative 'junk' label it has now.
Chrysler's stock offering was priced at dollars 38 3/4 a share, the closing
price of the company's shares on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday
night. The shares rose yesterday to stand at dollars 38 7/8, up dollars 1/8,
before the close.
Demand from investors was sufficiently strong that the company and its
underwriters, led by First Boston, increased the size of the offering from
40m shares to 46m.
Chrysler's share price has nearly quadrupled since the start of last year as
the company's financial prospects have improved and the shares continued to
perform robustly after the new issue was announced on January 11.
The shares stood at dollars 36 3/8 immediately before the announcement,
dipped a little immediately afterwards, but then rose, helped by a strong
fourth-quarter earnings report.
Standard &amp; Poor's, which raised the company's debt rating from Single-B-plus
to Double B when the issue was announced, lifted it a further notch
yeaterday, to Double-B-plus.
The next grade up is Triple-B-minus, which qualifies as investment grade.
The company has indicated that it will use almost half of the funds raised
to reduce the underfunding of its pension obligations. The shortfall stands
at about dollars 4bn and Chrysler has left open the possibility that all the
cash could be contributed to the pension fund.
S&amp;P said that further success by Chrysler with new product launches could
enable the company to bolster financial flexibility to levels adequate to
protect the company in the event of another severe downturn in market
conditions.
'Thus the company could achieve its standard goal of achieving investment
grade ratings by early 1995 - or even sooner,' S&amp;P added.

FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Time Warner files plan to raise
Dollars 1.5bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIME WARNER, the leading US media and entertainment group, yesterday offered
fresh evidence of its aggressive move to reduce the cost of debt and
preferred stock dividends when it said it had filed a shelf registration
with the Securities and Exchange Commission to raise up to Dollars 1.5bn.
Over the past few weeks, Time Warner has raised Dollars 3.5bn in debentures
and spent the proceeds repurchasing the Series D preferred stock which was
issued after Time and Warner Communications agreed to merge in 1989.
Some Dollars 3.1bn of Series C preferred stock remains outstanding, and Time
Warner said yesterday it planned to use the next Dollars 1.5bn it raises to
redeem some of these securities.
The Series C and D stock in 1991 cost Time Warner a total of Dollars 579m in
dividend payments, dragging the company into loss despite healthy operating
earnings.
The debentures being issued to replace the Series C and D preferred stock
have maturities ranging from five to 40 years. Analysts believe Time
Warner's financial strategy will eventually shift from redeeming preferred
stock to the disposal of non-strategic assets in order to raise funds to
reduce bank debt.

FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Behind Paris's marriage of money
and chic - Alice Rawsthorn examines the merger between Yves Saint-Laurent
and Elf-Sanofi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE opulent Salon Imperial at the Inter-Continental Hotel in Paris resounded
with applause last week when Mr Yves Saint-Laurent, one of France's most
famous fashion designers, mounted the stage for a standing ovation at the
end of his haute couture show.
Mr Saint-Laurent has been showing couture in Paris for more than 30 years,
but last week's collection was special. It was his last as an independent
designer before YSL, his company, merges with Elf-Sanofi, the
pharmaceuticals and cosmetics arm of Elf-Aquitaine, the flagship French oil
group.
YSL has struck a complex share swap agreement whereby its perfumes will be
taken over by Elf-Sanofi, but the fashion business will continue to be run
by Mr Pierre Berge, who co-founded the company with Mr Saint-Laurent.
At first glance, the deal makes sense for both parties. Elf-Sanofi has been
expanding in perfume to augment its pharmaceutical interests. It now has a
portfolio of brands, including Nina Ricci and Fendi, which provide FFr3.2bn
(Dollars 581m) of its FFr19bn annual sales.
But Elf needs to increase its perfume portfolio, preferably with a
prestigious brand, if it is to continue to compete for distribution in the
increasingly consolidated retail sector against powerful players such as
L'Oreal and LVMH of France as well as Estee Lauder of the US.
YSL has the prestige that Elf lacks. Its scents, including Opium and Rive
Gauche, represent roughly FFr2.5bn of its FFr3bn annual sales. It also needs
new inward investment. The growth of the big groups, such as L'Oreal and
LVMH, has raised the stakes in fashion and beauty. It now costs up to
Dollars 50m to promote a new perfume worldwide. This is imposing intense
financial pressure on independents, like YSL, which barely broke even in the
first half of last year.
In theory, last week's deal should give YSL and Elf what they want  - money
and chic, respectively. In practice, though, things might prove more
difficult.
The challenge for Elf is to launch new YSL fragrances. It has the necessary
financial resources, but has taken on YSL at a difficult time. The French
fashion designers have seen sales fall by 20 per cent in real terms from
their 1990 peak to FFr4.3bn in last year. The global beauty market has been
relatively static for two years.
Elf also has the problem that, although YSL is still prestigious, it is
these days less obviously in the forefront of fashion. Mr Saint-Laurent's
era as an innovator is rooted in the 1970s, when his most successful scents,
Rive Gauche and Opium, came out. His classic style, beloved of haute
bourgeoise Parisiennes, is not always in step with the informal fashions of
the 1990s. This may make the YSL name less marketable for Elf when it tries
to launch new perfumes in the future.
There is also the question of what will happen after Mr Saint-Laurent, now
56 with a history of poor health, retires. Elf might be able to revive YSL
under a new designer, as Chanel has done with Mr Karl Lagerfeld. But other
houses have found the transition more difficult, notably Balmain and Lanvin,
which have experienced a series of design and management changes.
These difficulties are aggravated by the prospects for YSL's personnel
within the Elf empire. Mr Saint-Laurent is seen as unpredictable even in the
histrionic Paris fashion world. Mr Berge is called Pierre le Panthere in
French business circles for his autocratic style. Until now, they have been
free to run their company exactly as they wished.
What occurred in the Scherrer house shows how difficult it can be for
fashion entrepreneurs to adjust to a more buttoned-down corporate life. Mr
Jean-Louis Scherrer, the founder, stormed out before Christmas after a row
with its new owners and the house is now mired in legal suits.
Mr Berge insists there is no possibility of that scenario recurring at YSL.
Even so, the spectre of Scherrer provided an ominous backdrop to Mr
Saint-Laurent's last independent couture show.

WORLD GROUP, the Hong Kong corporate empire of the late Sir Yue-kong Pao,
yesterday paid a record HKDollars 3.53bn (USDollars 458m) for a large
property development site on the Kowloon Peninsula in an auction held by the
Hong Kong government.
World won the bid for the 1.7m sq ft site in Diamond Hill in the face of
competition from all of the colony's leading property developers, including
Cheung Kong, New World Development and Sun Hung Kai Properties.
The deal is to be shared evenly between three of World's listed companies  -
World International, Wharf Holdings, and Hong Kong Realty and Trust.
Mr John Hung, director of Wharf, said the group would 'create the only mega
purpose-built retail centre under one roof in that region'.
It plans to build retail and residential property on the site.

DRAFT rules designed to reduce technical barriers to international trade
will block, and even reverse, government efforts to raise environmental
standards, the World Wide Fund for Nature said yesterday.
A WWF report on the proposed new Technical Barriers to Trade agreement,
negotiated in the 112-nation Uruguay Round, says the accord would prohibit
some environmental rules and open others to challenge as trade-restricting.
Regulations on the use and transport of toxic chemicals, factory pollution
and vehicle emissions could be weakened by the new rules.
The WWF report underscores reservations already expressed by the US and
other countries about the draft TBT text, which aims to ensure technical
regulations and standards do not create unnecessary barriers to trade.
The draft recognises that countries should not be stopped from taking
measures to protect consumers or the environment. But the draft also
requires countries to use international standards, where they exist, unless
they can show these are inappropriate or ineffective.
The US wants revised wording that would stipulate countries' rights to set
environment, consumer and safety standards above international norms. The US
and environmental groups have similar concerns over a draft Uruguay Round
agreement dealing with measures to protect plant and animal health.
Mr Charles Arden-Clarke, WWF policy analyst, said yesterday that the US
change would be an improvement but it did not tackle the fundamental
problem, in that the TBT accord gave precedence to free trade over
environmental protection.
The agreement, which would apply to most if not all 105 members of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), would replace the present
voluntary code, which has 37 signatories.

FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Alcatel in Dollars 300m link
with Sprint

<TEXT>
ALCATEL, the world's leading supplier of telecommunications equipment, and
Sprint, the third-largest US long-distance telephone company, have agreed to
form a Dollars 300m turnover joint venture in data communications systems.
The new company, Alcatel Data Networks, will sell equipment and systems to
large public and private data communications networks, such as France
Telecom's Transpac, already among the 300 network operators that form the
partners' customer base. Other customers include telecommunications
carriers, service providers, state agencies, international businesses,
airlines and railways.
This will be among the top two companies in the world in the specialised,
but fast-growing, field of wide area data networks, or data communications
between separate sites, said Mr Jozef Cornu, Alcatel vice-president
responsible.
It will have an estimated 25 per cent world market share, in competition
against the data communications divisions of Northern Telecom of Canada,
Ericsson of Sweden and Germany's Siemens. The European market for this kind
of equipment is worth Ecu2.3bn per year in Europe and growing at 20 per cent
annually, said Mr Cornu.
Alcatel Data Networks, based in Paris, will be 51 per cent controlled by
Alcatel, which is providing the chairman, Mr Pierre Guichet, and 49 per cent
held by Sprint, but it will be jointly-managed.
Sprint is expected to provide about Dollars 180m of sales in the first year,
with the remaining Dollars 120m from Alcatel. It will employ 1,000 people,
700 from Sprint and 300 from Alcatel, drawn from the US partner's network
systems department and the equivalent branch on the French side.
The group will distribute each partner's products and provide both companies
with the complete range for their own distribution. They will also
co-operate on the introduction of equipment based on so-called asynchronous
transfer mode, a way of speeding up transmission of pictures, voice and data
along shared lines. 'This will allow us to increase our size and
competitiveness in a key, growing market segment,' said Mr Cornu.

FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Queue for a slice of cheese
market - The larger producers are seeking to expand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LA Vache Qui Rit, the creamy cheese with a chuckling cow on its box, is one
of France's most popular cheeses. It is being talked of as a takeover target
in the speculation over the future of Bel, its owner.
Bel, which also owns Port Salut and Les Petits Amis, is one of the few large
French cheese companies still under family control. Mr Robert Fievet, its
chairman and controlling shareholder, is 84 years old.
Besnier, the acquisitive French dairy group, has been buying Bel shares and
owns 8.1 per cent of the company. It has made no secret of its hopes of
raising its stake further.
However, Besnier is not the only predator in the French cheese industry.
Bongrain, another ambitious dairy concern, has made a number of acquisitions
and is intent on expansion. Philip Morris, the US group which is a
significant player in processed cheese through Kraft, is also eyeing the
French market.
'We've already seen a great deal of change in this industry,' said Mr Claude
Boutineau, joint-chairman of Bongrain. 'There is still more to come. The
only question is how quickly?'
French cheese is an attractive area for investment. The European cheese
market slowed in the second half of last year, reflecting the economic
squeeze in France and other European countries. However, cheese still has
relatively high growth potential in the mature food market.
France has a strong cheesemaking tradition and plentiful supplies of milk.
The 340 French cheeses tend to be high-quality products that are well-placed
to benefit from the European trend towards more sophisticated food.
'In the short term, the growth of the cheese market will remain relatively
low,' said Mr Michael Oertli, European food analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
in London. 'But in the long term there is strong growth potential for
high-quality French cheeses, particularly in Germany and Spain.'
The French cheese industry is polarised between a handful of very large
companies - Besnier, Bel, Bongrain - and hundreds of small family companies
and co-operatives. The small players are finding it increasingly difficult
to operate in the French market, which is dominated by multinational
manufacturers, such as Nestle of Switzerland and France's BSN, and multiple
retailers, notably Carrefour and Casino. As a result, there is no shortage
of acquisition targets for the large cheesemakers.
Bongrain has grown rapidly both inside and outside France, increasing its
sales to FFr9.7bn (Dollars 1.75bn) from FFr5.95bn in the five years to 1991.
Last summer, it took a 10 per cent stake in ULN, a troubled co-operative of
Normandy dairies, but, because of ULN's fragile finances, was able to secure
full management control.
The company is searching for other acquisitions. 'We have a strong balance
sheet and if suitable opportunities arise, particularly in branded cheeses
or interesting areas of technology, we'll take them,' said Mr Boutineau.
Besnier, a co-operative chaired by Mr Michel Besnier, is pursuing a similar
strategy. It is one of Europe's largest dairy groups, with annual sales of
FFr22bn. Last year, it paid FFr862m for 58 per cent of Roquefort cheese in a
deal with Nestle, the Swiss food group which had acquired the stake as part
of its bid for Perrier mineral water. Besnier has since increased its
holding to 69 per cent.
Bel is Besnier's latest target. Mr Bernard Aubert, chief executive, said
after the recent share-buying exercise that Besnier had 'absolutely no
ulterior motives' towards Bel, but that it hoped to acquire a 'more
significant holding'. He also envisaged amassing similar stakes in other
businesses.
Bongrain and Bel have been able to expand without coming into competition
with the multinational manufacturers that dominate other areas of the food
market.
Cheese production is a complex process with limited scope for economies of
scale. It is also prone to supply problems due to sharp seasonal variations
in milk production.
As a result, the general food groups have tended to favour sectors such as
processed cheese, rather than finicky French products.
Nestle chose to sell Roquefort to Besnier (partly to placate the French
financial establishment), although it has significant cheese interests in
Spain. BSN is a significant force in French fromage frais, but its cheese
business is bigger in Italy than in its native France.
Bongrain and Besnier may face stiffer competition partly because advances in
dairy technology are eroding production problems.
Philip Morris has been suggested as a potential purchaser for Bel. Its
interest may well have prompted Besnier to speed its share-buying in Bel in
order to make sure that it had a blocking stake, in case La Vache Qui Rit
does come up for sale.

FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: BA and USAir seek May start for
agreement on 'code-sharing'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways and USAir, the sixth-largest US carrier in which the UK
airline has invested Dollars 300m, are seeking to begin their 'code-sharing'
arrangement in May. They would focus initially on connecting internal US
flights operated by USAir and international services provided by BA at
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.
Implementation of the agreement is dependant on approval from the US
Department of Transportation, which has yet to decide how to deal with the
revised BA-USAir tie-up.
The 'big three' US carriers, which oppose the deal, have accused BA of
timing its revised USAir transaction to fall within 'the unsettled initial
hours of a new administration' and have urged the DoT to withhold
authorisation until it 'has had time to develop a coherent approach to
foreign investment'.
The UK carrier announced its investment in USAir, which buys a potential
19.9 per cent voting interest, in January, less than one month after a more
extensive Dollars 750m investment plan was rejected by US authorities.
However, BA and USAir seem determined to keep up the pressure. In an
application to begin code-sharing filed with the DoT yesterday, USAir said
the airlines wanted to begin phasing in a 'seamless service' on May 1,
between Syracuse, Rochester and Cleveland, and the Philadelphia gateway. In
June and July, they planned to add certain flights from Cincinnati,
Columbus, Dayton, Indianapolis and Nashville to Pittsburgh.
USAir noted that other international code-sharing arrangements - which allow
flights where different sectors are operated by different carriers to carry
the airline designator code for both airlines, and hence to be marketed as a
'seamless' through service - are in already in force.
It also argued that the proposed USAir/BA code-sharing services were
authorised when the air services bilateral agreement between the US and the
UK was revised in 1991.
Delta, one of the US carriers that opposes the BA-USAir tie-up, has asked
the DoT to reverse the anti-trust immunity granted to KLM and Northwest
Airlines last month.

FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: S&amp;P re-classifies Chrysler and
GM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, yesterday downgraded its
ratings of struggling General Motors' debt but raised its ratings on Detroit
rival Chrysler following the company's successful Dollars 1.78bn share offer
this week.
S&amp;P's action on Chrysler brought the company to within one notch of its
declared goal of getting its senior debt re-classified as investment grade,
rather than the more speculative 'junk' label it has now.
The downgrading of GM, which follows similar action in November by the
Moody's, the other leading rating agency, keeps it well within the
investment grade band yet could make it more expensive for the company to
borrow funds.
GM's senior debt has been lowered from Single-A Minus to Triple-B Plus,
while its commercial paper rating has been lowered from A-1 to A-2. GM has
relied on commercial paper as an important source of cheap funds, which it
then uses to offer financing on GM vehicles.
S&amp;P said that GM's pension and medical liabilities were now materially
larger than previously assumed and servicing these massive benefit
obligations would be a 'a substantial drain on the company's financial
resources . . . for the foreseeable future'.
However, it added that with improving domestic demand, the negative
cash-flow of 1990 to 1992 was unlikely to persist and 'further erosion in
credit quality within the next few years is unlikely'.
GM replied that the action came as the financial condition and liquidity of
the company was showing strong positive momentum.
S&amp;P, which raised Chrysler's debt rating from Single-B-Plus to Double-B when
its share issue was announced on January 11, lifted it a further notch
yesterday to Double-B plus. Its next grade up is Triple-B minus, which
qualifies as investment grade.
The action followed news that the share issue had gone well, with Chrysler
selling 46m shares, rather than the 40m planned, at a price of Dollars 38
3/4 .
S&amp;P said that further success by Chrysler with new product launches could
allow the company to bolster financial flexibility to levels adequate to
protect the company in the event of another severe downturn in automotive
market conditions.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Kuwaitis seek end to secrecy on fraud probe: Government
accused of cover-up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
KUWAITI parliamentarians and journalists said yesterday they would defy a
ban imposed by the Gulf state's public prosecutor on issuing any
unsanctioned information concerning alleged fraud in the management of
Kuwait's overseas investments and at the state-owned Kuwait Oil Tankers
Company.
Mr Mohammed al-Banai, who is leading the government's investigations of the
two affairs, announced the ban on Monday, into a torrent of criticism that
he was party to a government cover-up. He forbade any public statement on
either matter without his written permission.
Members of the opposition-dominated national assembly said yesterday
parliament would study the ban to see if it was constitutional. But Mr Hamad
al-Jouan, who chairs the assembly's legislative committee, said the
prohibition in his view was 'against the law as I know it'. He added: 'For
my part, I will say whatever I know about these things - it is in the public
interest and the interests of Kuwait.'
The ban also angered local journalists, who have enjoyed considerable
freedom since the end of the Gulf war and have led in making public
disclosures of alleged corruption at KOTC. Many said the ban was an attempt
by the government to block potentially embarrassing revelations.
Mr Ghanim al-Najjar, a columnist at al-Wattan newspaper, said: 'The press is
a vital force in opening this issue up. Without the press, investigations by
the government would not have reached this stage.'
The curb muddies the government's stated intention not to obstruct
parliamentary or press freedom in connection with the investigations, which
are the focus of considerable interest in the Gulf state.
Sheikh Saud Nasser al-Sabah, information minister, said last week that
Kuwait's press was entirely free and that the government would give an 'open
door' to the national assembly's efforts to look into alleged scandals.
Mr Mohammed al-Sagr, editor of al-Qabbas, said he would continue to publish
information on both affairs, though without naming names.
Mr al-Banai has refused any comment on his investigations into the Kuwait
Investment Office's loss-making Spanish investments and into an alleged
multi-million dollar fraud at KOTC. But he said on Monday that any
information spread by Kuwaitis risked damaging the 'public interest'.
The public prosecutor is understood to have detained for questioning at
least one former top official at KOTC over an alleged fraud said by Mr Ali
al-Baghli, the oil minister, to amount to at least Dollars 13m (Pounds
8.6m). Al-Qabbas newspaper has already named two former KOTC officials in
connection with the investigation.
According to local media reports, and some senior Kuwaitis, Mr al-Banai is
looking into claims that some senior officials at KOTC chartered oil storage
tankers to the government at a profit, pocketing the difference.
Mr al-Banai is also understood to have frozen the Kuwaiti assets of three
ex-employees of KIO and their direct relatives, although no charges against
them have been brought in the Gulf state. Spain's senior monetary court last
week rejected a criminal lawsuit brought by Torras, the KIO's Spanish
holding company, against seven of its former executives. Torras is appealing
the decision.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FRENCH multi-party commission yesterday suggested introducing some
proportional representation into the electoral system, which currently gives
large parties the lion's share of seats in parliament, Reuter reports from
Paris.
But small parties with little or no parliamentary voice - the
environmentalist groups Generation Ecologie and the Greens, the Communists
and the far-right National Front - called for more radical changes.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the Socialist prime minister who appointed the
commission last June to look into reform, noted that no changes would be
made ahead of parliamentary elections in March.
The report should become a reference work for any government wanting to
resolve the ongoing debate on the electoral system, he added.
The 19-member group of parliamentarians and legal experts suggested that one
tenth of the 577 National Assembly members be elected by proportional
representation.
The remaining deputies would be elected by the current system - by which
candidates go to a second, first-past-the-post round of voting if they fail
to win an outright majority in the first.
The current system means parties such as the combined ecology list, tipped
by opinion polls to take as much as 20 per cent of the vote, could win just
a handful of seats in March.

   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE new Czech Republic is demanding Kcs19bn (Dollars 655m) from Slovakia to
compensate it for the loss that it claims arises from the sale of state
assets before Czechoslovakia split into two republics at the start of the
year.
It has threatened to seize Slovak assets if the money is not paid.
The row over assets privatised in the former Czechoslovakia is threatening
to cause further friction between the two new republics.
The Czech government says that the Slovaks must make up for the difference
in the value of privatised assets bought by Slovak investors in last year's
voucher privatisations.
The Czechs says Slovak investors took up a far greater proportion of equity
in Czech companies than Czech investors in Slovak ones, and that this
represents a massive financial handout to Slovakia. It wants the Slovak
government to pay Kcs19bn in compensation, but the Slovak authorities say
that they are willing to pay only about Kcs900m.
Mr Jiri Skalicky, Czech privatisation minister, says that unless an
acceptable compromise is reach in three weeks, Slovak assets will be seized.
He says the Czech government offered more property for privatisation than
the Slovak one, and that the privatised Czech companies have a higher real
value than their Slovak counterparts.
'In our agreement on dividing the (Czechoslovak) state last year it was also
agreed that privatisation should continue but that it should be balanced,'
he said.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Japanese lessons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE manufacturing companies, throughout most of the past decade, have
been feared and admired in equal measures by their competitors in Europe and
the US. But three years of falling profits has brought many Japanese
companies down to earth. The electronics industry is becalmed; Japan's
personal computer makers are facing an onslaught in their own market from US
producers such as IBM, Dell and Compaq; the car makers are struggling with
the depreciation costs of their huge investments which have left them with
vast overcapacity in Japan.
Throughout the 1980s western companies were urged to learn many Japanese
lessons. Sony and Toyota were held up as models of the lean, innovative and
far-sighted company. Western firms were urged to make production more
efficient and improve quality through more flexible working practices and to
emulate Japanese producers which, in cars and electronics, have developed a
wider range of products with greater speed than their competitors.
But not all the sources of Japanese success in the 1980s have been properly
understood, as a recent Bank of Japan report concludes. Much of the
improvement in Japanese manufacturers' finances was due to the availability
of cheap finance from banks and the stock market. Japanese companies'
profits rose and their market valuations soared, enabling them to buy
foreign companies and build plants abroad.
This cheap capital helped to mask a deterioration in performance at most
companies where fixed costs rose. As the stock market has fallen, the cost
of capital in Japan has risen, thereby undermining one of the main
advantages of Japanese companies.
Yet the downturn is exposing the real strengths of the best Japanese
companies: a well-educated workforce; deep financial reserves built up over
time; good technology to exploit strong market positions and, at some
companies, far-sighted senior management.
Past economic crises forced Japanese manufacturers into wrenching
restructuring from which they emerged much more competitive. The oil shocks
of the 1970s forced a shift from heavy industry to light industries such as
electronics. The yen appreciation of the 1980s led Japanese companies to
diversify internationally.
This capacity to reinvent its corporations and to remake its industrial
structure still persists in Japan. Companies are retreating from some of the
gospel of the 1980s. Product ranges are contracting. The life-cycle of
products is being extended. Supplier networks are being rationalised. The
lifetime employment system is being reformed with retirements among older
workers more commonplace. Companies are paying greater attention to
controlling costs and expanding their profit margins.
The last few years have thrown up some new Japanese stars, such as Nintendo
and Seaga, the electronic game companies which dominate industries which did
not exist 10 years ago. These nimble, entrepreneurial companies should serve
as a model for restructuring which is much needed at the lumbering giants
such as Matsushita, the electronics group.
Japanese companies will come out of this downturn deprived of some of the
advantages they enjoyed in the 1980s. Some may never again experience the
glories of the 1980s. But it would be very unwise of any western company to
assume that the Japanese challenge is bound to fade.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Free speech for Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission will soon decide whether to abolish the telephone
monopolies which exist in most member states. Its decision will not only be
a watershed for telecommunications but will also define its overall attitude
to public monopolies.
The decision will be controversial as the public consultation now at an end
has shown. Ranged against full-blooded liberalisation are most of the
monopolies themselves, backed by their national ministries. In favour are
users and a few telephone companies, the most important being British
Telecommunications, which published a powerful document on the subject this
week.
It is uncertain which way the Commission will go. This is partly because the
two commissioners with the biggest say - Mr Karel van Miert, in charge of
competition, and Mr Martin Bangemann, in charge of industry - are both new
to the sector. But the Commission should have no doubt over what to do. Not
only is the economic case for full liberalisation of both services and
infrastructure overwhelming. The Commission is arguably required to open the
market by the Treaty of Rome's competition provisions.
Competition will bring lower prices and stimulate investment in new
services. In particular, it will help tie Europe together by driving down
cross-border tariffs which are three to six times higher than charges for
calls of a similar distance in the US. Maintaining monopolies, by contrast,
will undermine Europe's competitiveness at a time when the US and Japan have
already moved down the path of liberalisation.
The legal position is also clear. The European Court of Justice has
reaffirmed that the treaty's competition provisions apply to public
monopolies and that the Commission has the authority to implement them. In
this case - as in others concerning competition - the principle of
subsidiarity cannot be used to deter Commission action. If nations had local
choice on whether to open up their markets, the single market would quickly
fragment.
The only possible justification for retaining the monopolies would be if
that was the only way social obligations, such as the provision of universal
service, could be preserved. But this much-used argument has been undermined
by the fact that telecommunications has been successfully liberalised
elsewhere without abandoning social obligations.
It is, of course, important to ensure a level playing field so that new
rivals do not simply 'cherry-pick', leaving the established players
handicapped with obligations. But this is perfectly feasible - for example,
through a system of access charges whereby competitors contribute to social
costs.
The Commission has already taken small steps down the path of
liberalisation. It may now be tempted to take more half measures and phase
them in over a long period. But Europe has already waited long enough and
nothing less than full competition will do.

With an eye on the UK Budget, now less than six weeks away, the BBC has
finally finished fine-tuning its economics team.
Gerry Baker, 30, and with a first in PPE from Oxford, has been hoiked out of
Panorama, where he was a producer, to take over as economics correspondent
from Steve Levinson, 44, who has defected to Channel 4 news. Levinson, an
old Press Association hand, did a lot to improve the Beeb's economic
coverage after Daniel Jeffreys quit.
However, the 1990 arrival of Peter Jay, well-known economic guru and former
ambassador to Washington, meant that Levinson had to move if he wanted to be
more than number two. Another casualty of Jay's growing economic empire is
Dominick Harrod, 52, son of the late Sir Roy Harrod. He's been economics
editor of BBC Radio since 1979 and leaves next month.
Bimedia types, who can flit effortlessly between radio and TV, are all the
rage at the Beeb currently and, as an old wireless man, Harrod seemed
increasingly sidelined. What's left of his empire will now fall into Jay's
hands.
By contrast, Baker seems to have all the right connections. He's no stranger
to BBC director-general John Birt, having started his TV career on LWT's
Weekend World, and also gets on well with Jay. He produced Jay's recent
documentary about Bill Clinton during the making of which the Beeb's
56-year-old economic guru is reported to have sampled his first McDonald's
hamburger.

Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery but timing is important,
too. No sooner had the plongeurs washed up on the last Friday afternoon of
the FT's Lunch for a Fiver fortnight, than representatives from London's
Evening Standard were ringing restaurateurs to see if they were interested
in their proposed Dinner for a Tenner during April.
Although the FT scheme was described by Brian Clivaz, general manager of
Simpsons-in-the-Strand, as 'the most successful restaurant promotion ever',
his fellow restaurateurs are also aware that April usually heralds an upturn
in trade. Surprising if there were many takers.

Could this be a comment on the state of British management theory by its

FT  04 FEB 93 / Observer: Hot seats and musical chairs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What should be a routine game of musical chairs at the European Commission,
following the recent reshuffle of commissioners, is starting to become
rather fun. It seems that the Germans are having second thoughts about how
they want to play the 'name-your-director-general' part of the game.
Each member state gets to fill a chair. The Germans had been expected to use
Dieter Frisch's departure from the EC development policy directorate - he
couldn't get on with his prickly Spanish commissioner Manuel Marin - to
appoint its own man as DG in charge of the new common security and foreign
policy division. Gunter Burghardt, Jacques Delors' highly regarded foreign
policy adviser, seems to have been under the impression that the job was his
for the asking.
However, the latest word is that the Germans now have their eye on a
different DG post, the newly created job of overseeing the internal market.
That would disappoint both Burghardt and the British, who want the job for
John Mogg, Sir Leon Brittan's private secretary during the Westland affair
and now deputy DG of the industry directorate.
Bonn's leading candidate is Johannes Beseler, head of the Commission's
anti-dumping division. He would be a distinctly odd choice. A talented
empire-builder, Beseler hardly ranks as an economic liberal. Under his
aegis, anti-dumping has developed into the EC's most powerful protectionist
weapon, which critics say has often been used to shelter uncompetitive
producers at the expense of consumers. Surely that's not what the internal

<TEXT>
Britain needs strong, stable local government now more than at any time in
recent years. Few aspects of modern British politics and administration have
been more wasteful of public money and time than the seemingly endless
disputes which have taken place between Whitehall and town halls.
It is time for these disputes to end and to establish a new partnership
between central and local government. While central government will always
be the stronger partner, a reasonable recognition of the practical limits of
its power and even more of its perspicacity is needed. Then we shall be able
to make better headway in facing up to the country's social and economic
problems.
The government is learning this lesson, yet it continues to propose
far-reaching changes in the powers and responsibilities of local government.
Indeed, Britain is now close to a situation in which Whitehall takes
decisions on relatively small matters affecting local people and
communities. This is without it being able to place the issues in a local
context, and it risks increasing people's alienation from the political
system.
My case for local government has four elements.
The first is the most nebulous but the most important. Is it possible to
imagine a healthy democracy at the level of the national government without
there being a sound foundation in some system of local government?
A healthy democracy rests not just upon a national parliament but needs
vigorous political debate locally; the opportunity for citizens to
participate in meaningful decisions affecting their communities; a means for
communities to balance conflicting interests locally rather than needing to
refer to the central authority; and a proper system of local accountability
for financial management and propriety.
Too often local democracy has been replaced by appointed bodies, answerable
only to the centre. And I know from personal experience that the power and
influence of an appointee are much less than that of a person who has been
elected to a position, however flawed the process of election may be.
Second, by spreading decision-makers we minimise the effects of any errors
in public policy. We have the opportunity to experiment, perhaps to take
some risks without committing the whole body politic to a particular course
of action.
It may well prove better to organise the provision of health, education or
housing services in a new way. But what if it is not? By concentrating so
much power at the centre we risk getting things spectacularly wrong and fail
to allow for the testing and evaluation of new policy initiatives.
Local government is also of continuing importance to Britain's economy. It
employs 2.8m people and spends Pounds 60bn a year. It provides the necessary
social and physical infrastructure to our economic life. A national
partnership would allow central government time to concentrate upon national
concerns with corresponding benefit to public policy.
Third, a better partnership could in several ways save public expenditure.
One would be by eliminating over time many of the organisations that have
grown or been newly established in recent years to take over in whole or in
part functions which were once the preserve of local authorities.
Finally, the lessons of a comparative study of Britain's main competitor
nations ought to be heeded. Each starts from a different position in the
relative powers of its central and regional or local government. But none of
our European partners is significantly reducing the power of local
authorities. Nor does there appear to be so many disputes with local
authorities, nor proposals to take over local powers and services without
consultation with local government.
The new democracies in eastern Europe are busy establishing vibrant local
and regional governments. Can all these countries really be wrong while
Britain is right? Recent history strongly suggests otherwise.
Britain's local government is not perfect. By its very nature some
authorities will manage their affairs better than others. But local
government has gone a long way in recent years towards putting its own house
in order. Westminster and Whitehall need to recognise this and be prepared
to return some of the real power lost by local communities in recent years.
If the principle of 'subsidiarity' is right for Europe, why is it not also
right for Britain?

England, which is reviewing local government structure

FT  04 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Cyprus choice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GREEK CYPRIOTS have an important decision to make next Sunday, and the
Sunday after, in their two-ballot presidential election. It is to all
intents and purposes a referendum on the 'set of ideas' proposed by the
United Nations as a basis for reuniting the island as a single state, but
with two separate zones for Greeks and Turks and a federal constitution. The
incumbent, Mr George Vassiliou, was intimately involved in negotiating this
document and is firmly committed to it. Of his two serious opponents one, Mr
Paschalis Paschalides, rejects it outright, while the other, Mr Glafcos
Clerides, says it contains both good and bad, and claims that he can improve
it.
The latter claim is quite unrealistic. The set of ideas, although worked out
by the UN Secretariat on the basis of two years of intensive contact with
both sides, has been rejected by Mr Rauf Denktas, the Turkish Cypriot
leader, as giving too much to the Greeks. But it has been formally endorsed
by the UN Security Council which, in a resolution passed last November,
pointed its finger clearly at the Turkish Cypriot side as being responsible
for the failure of repeated attempts to reach agreement, and formally called
on that side 'to adopt positions that are consistent with the set of ideas'
on certain important issues.
That the Security Council should have involved itself in this way in the
substance of negotiations between the two communities, and have come down so
clearly on one side, is unprecedented, and constitutes a remarkable victory
for Mr Vassiliou's moderate and reasonable approach. Mr Denktas and his
protectors on the Turkish mainland are more isolated internationally on the
issue than at any time since Turkey used force to secure the northern third
of the island for the Turkish-speaking fifth of the population in 1974-75.
At that time the Turks successfully defied Security Council resolutions
calling for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the island; and in
cold war conditions the council did nothing about it, except urge the two
Cypriot communities to negotiate. In the 1990s it will not be so easily
fobbed off. Turkey would have to take seriously the position of a re-elected
President Vassiliou, backed by a sympathetic President Clinton and, for
once, a united EC. Greek Cypriot voters would be foolish indeed if they
spared the Turkish government that dilemma.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Not in the best of health: The WHO faces recurring internal
divisions and doubts about its effectiveness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Dr Hiroshi Nakajima set himself the goal last year of being re-elected
director-general of the World Health Organisation, following a Japanese
custom he painted one eye on to a huge red-and-gold papier-mache head.
Twelve days ago he painted on the second eye to mark his victory: a second
five-year term at the head of one of the largest and oldest United Nations
institutions, despite being dubbed by critics the least popular
director-general in its history.
'There have been many attacks on my style but I am pleased with the
(election) outcome,' he says, in a deadpan comment on one of the most bitter
campaigns fought in the WHO. When the Japanese ornamental carp at its Geneva
headquarters were found gutted on the grass one morning last summer, many
assumed it was the work of his opponents. In more explicit statements, he
has been accused of poor communication, autocratic tendencies and lack of
leadership.
He kept his job by a decisive 18-13 margin because of support from
developing countries, who make up most of the 31-strong board. They appear
to believe he will be better than his rival candidate, Algeria's Mohammed
Abdelmoumene  - who was backed by the US and Europe  - at safeguarding their
health programmes. Although Japan has not yet played a prominent part in
international aid projects, his re-election may represent a judgment by
developing countries that they can no longer rely so heavily on the European
and US economies.
But just days into his new term Dr Nakajima has ordered an independent audit
into alleged financial irregularities in awarding contracts to research
institutes. He is also confronted by a series of difficult strategic issues
now facing the organisation and by doubts that he is the right person to
resolve them.
Founded in 1948, in the flush of post-war humanitarian ideals, the WHO is
dedicated to tackling some of the world's most intractable problems - the
growth of population and the spread of disease. Its greatest triumph came
with the eradication of smallpox in 1977. Its influence is considerable: its
pronouncements can force governments to clean up drinking water or persuade
mothers that 'breast is best' for their babies.
Yet the organisation lacks the high public profile of some of the smaller UN
agencies which have been fighting emergencies in Bosnia and Somalia, such as
Unicef, the children's fund, or the UNHCR refugee schemes. 'We could fly in
like them, with good-looking doctors and TV crews, but it's not our style,'
says one WHO official.
Primarily a research and advisory body, many of whose 4,500 staff hold
degrees from top western medical colleges, the WHO adopts a low-key
approach. Its doctors point out that together with its long-term outlook,
this makes success hard to define. Smallpox is the only disease it has
eradicated, and future triumphs are unlikely to be as clear-cut. It had
intended malaria to be the second 'wipe-out' but it realised more than 20
years ago that it would have to limit its goals. It was typically taking
pharmaceutical companies 10 years and Dollars 75m to develop drugs to combat
the disease, but the malaria parasite was mutating into drug-resistant forms
at a much faster rate.
The WHO's latest targets are still formidable, and its doctors are cautious
about whether they are achievable. It hopes by the year 2000 to have
eliminated leprosy and polio and to have immunised more than 90 per cent of
the world's children against measles, whooping cough, tuberculosis, tetanus,
polio, and diphtheria. It has already reached more than 80 per cent of
children, but the rest live in the poorest countries where disease is most
prevalent. Universal immunisation 'may be almost impossible', says one
official.
The spread of Aids, perhaps the biggest challenge the WHO faces and the one
with which it is most closely identified in the public mind, presents even
greater difficulties. With no vaccine in sight, the WHO says it is trying
simply to curb the spread of the disease. Its doctors say they judge success
by small steps  - persuading health ministers to take Aids seriously or
setting up the distribution of condoms to Nigerian brothels.
But now that recession is making developed countries look more closely at
their aid budgets, the low public awareness of much of the WHO's work and
the difficulty of measuring progress leaves it vulnerable in the fierce
international competition for humanitarian funds.
Its core or 'regular' budget covering 1992 and 1993 was Dollars 734m, a
quarter contributed by the US and 12 per cent by Japan. For several years,
like many UN bodies, its contributions have risen in line with inflation.
However, the WHO collected only 76 per cent of its core budget last year;
several poor countries defaulted on commitments, and the collapse of the
former Soviet Union wiped Dollars 70m off its income.
Some programmes, notably Aids, have managed to continue to grow, because of
the increase in funds given by donor countries for specific projects. For
1992 and 1993 together, 'extra' contributions amounted to Dollars 999m, a
third more than the core budget; 20 years ago such contributions were only a
quarter of its size.
While the new funds are welcome, the trend has led to accusations from some
of the 182 member countries that donor countries are 'hijacking' the WHO by
giving money only where they are assured of control, and that its priorities
are increasingly selected by lobby groups in developed countries.
The Aids prevention and testing programme attracts much of the criticism as
it is now the largest single programme and one of the largest in the UN,
with an annual budget of about Dollars 80m and a worldwide staff of 450. The
US, which has shown vigorous support, finds about a quarter of the funds.
Dr Michael Merson, director of the Aids programme, is adamant that its size
is justified. 'I don't know of any other disease that affects young and
middle-aged adults, is 100 per cent fatal, and can penetrate 30 per cent of
some populations  - I think it's a wise investment to put in this kind of
money.'
In contrast, the WHO's research into 'human reproduction', which includes
some of its work on contraception, gets only about a quarter of the amount
provided for Aids. That is partly because in the past the US has not
contributed to work involving abortion, even though the projected doubling
of the world's population to 10bn in the next 50 years will jeopardise
standards of health in many countries.
However, Dr Paul van Look, head of the reproduction programme, says that
lack of money has not been a problem. He says he is pleased with
achievements such as persuading the Chinese government to distribute more
efficient copper intra-uterine devices instead of steel ones to reduce the
number of unwanted pregnancies.
In light of the increasing strains and problems of defining the WHO's role,
the anxiety among member countries and staff about who runs the organisation
is understandable. Some of the antagonism over the election arose simply
from a clash of styles; Mr Nakajima's cautious bureaucratic approach clearly
jars with the WHO's rangy, shirt-sleeved doctors who itch to leave Geneva
for the villages of Africa and Asia. But he also lacks vision at a time when
many WHO staff feel they need a charismatic leader to articulate the
organisation's ideals to the outside world. That sort of role appears to
make him uncomfortable. He says: 'Of course I could talk about leprosy or
polio, but my priorities for the next five years are streamlining the budget
and improving internal co-ordination.'
There seems some justification. too, for his critics' accusations of poor
communication. Although he speaks English, the meaning behind phrases such
as 'the priority of structure' or 'paradigms of healthcare' can be elusive.
The countries which voted for him may be right in calculating that the
Japanese financial contributions to the WHO will grow. But Dr Nakajima's
re-election may nonetheless prove to be a source of recurring friction
within the WHO at a time when it faces its greatest external challenges.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Germany fails the Maastricht test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The theme of this year's Davos World Economic Forum was 'rallying all the
forces for global recovery'. There was a good deal of agreement on a general
theme that the world needed a sustained, soundly based recovery rather than
a quick fix.
There was also the theme of a world capital or savings shortage. How this
could be so amid so many complaints of the lengths and depths of the
recession and the calls to stimulate spending baffled me. If there is a
shortage of savings one would expect interest rates to be rising and demand
to be booming. Instead we see the opposite. The nearest I got to an answer
was from a well-known US economist who wanted to see a rise in American
savings, but not too much too soon, echoing Saint Augustine, who wanted to
become virtuous, but not yet.
The European Monetary System (EMS) was a peripheral theme in the global
forum. But it was extensively discussed in what British political
conferences would call fringe meetings. A widespread consensus, covering
Germany as well as Britain, was expressed by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the
governor of the Bank of England, when he said that the EMS had to work more
flexibly, 'with more timely and more frequent realignments'.
The former French prime minister Raymond Barre, himself a pioneer of
European Community monetary arrangements, agreed that it had been a mistake
to see the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) prematurely as a de facto
monetary union. He would have preferred a realignment earlier in 1992. He
would have liked the UK to have realigned downwards by a few percentage
points together with Italy, Spain and Ireland while the D-Mark and the
French franc should both have realigned upwards. Yet only a couple of years
ago the Bundesbank was pressing for an appreciation of the D-Mark against
the franc as well as other currencies.
The French government is now braced for a further speculative attack on the
franc, maybe bigger than last autumn's, either in the run-up to the
parliamentary elections in March, which the right-wing opposition headed by
Jacques Chirac is likely to win. Some think that the pressure will be
greatest during the negotiations that lead up to the next period of
co-habitation between the French conservatives and President Mitterrand.
The paradox is that on 'fundamentals' the franc is in a stronger position
than the D-Mark. French inflation is lower; the budget and current account
balances are in better shape; and there has been a smaller drop in
industrial production in the current recession. Indeed one reason why the
Bundesbank is against an early fast track to monetary union among a few core
countries is the belief that Germany is not strong enough for such a step -
the budget deficit in particular is likely to be for several years well
above the Maastricht criteria.
Nor is the Bundesbank impressed by some of the specific proposals in the
air, such as representatives of the Bundesbank and the Banque de France
sitting on each other's boards. Apart from anything else there is no body
equivalent to the Bundesbank council in France and the Bundesbank is
unwilling to share responsibility for German monetary policy in advance of
the Maastricht process.
As for the frequent suggestion of a narrowing of the franc-D-Mark margins,
the response is that there is an intellectual case for wider not narrower
margins to provide flexibility. A de facto example is provided by
Switzerland, where the national bank has in practice shadowed the D-Mark
within a broad band as well as targeting the money supply, but, unlike
Austria, has avoided rigid currency links. Because of expectations of a
rising Swiss franc, Switzerland can now have short-term interest rates some
3 percentage points below those of Germany. (The reason why a wide margin
did not work in the British case is that the central rate was regarded as
too high and there was no belief in a likely upward rebound when the bottom
end of the grid was reached).
A proposal for wider margins would be thrown out politically by France and
some other nations as a step away from the European goal. The Bundesbank is
therefore unlikely to propose it in the current review of ERM procedure.
The one argument for a franc depreciation is the height of French short-term
interest rates and the high and rising level of unemployment. French
officials regard their country's unemployment as largely structural,
reflecting labour market blockages - which does not sit easily with the
insistence of the Mitterrand government for a so-called social element in
the EC.
Obviously French unemployment has been aggravated by recession. But the
increase has not been anything like as large as in Britain and the
dependence of French households and industry on short-term finance is very
much less. The question for the country's leaders is whether it is worth
jeopardising the credibility so painfully won by the years of the franc fort
policy and the political gains from the close monetary relationship with
Germany for the sake of a quicker cut in interest rates.
The Bundesbank objection to 'unlimited intervention' in favour of any
currency is well-known. But it may not arise because of the French policy
(unlike the British last autumn) of defending the franc before the limit of
the grid is reached. The hope of both the German and French sides is that a
mixture of finite Bundesbank intervention, French willingness to use
reserves and to introduce emergency increases in interest rates, will enable
the franc to pull through until the end of March. There are strong hints
that the French have undisclosed lines of credit, apart from their partners'
ERM obligations. These could be either with the Bundesbank directly or
through the central bank network at the Bank for International Settlements
in Basle.
The hope is that such measures will buy time until it is clear that a new
French government supports the franc fort. The need for interest rate
differentials against Germany could then go. In addition, German interest
rates may at last be in clear decline. These two influences together should
be sufficient to reduce French interest rates by up to 5 percentage points,
and resist the political pressures for a U-turn. The strongest force going
for the franc is, however, the market belief that it is fundamentally very
strong.
A Swiss banker specialising in France told me that he was switching from
franc deposits into French equities. But he hesitated to move French francs
into other currencies because he did not expect at worst a depreciation of
more than 5 per cent and that there were many risks and costs involved,
including the strong chance that the franc would soon start moving up again.
The greatest risk for the French franc is the delay in making substantial
cuts in German interest rates. If questioned about the strong recessionary
forces in Germany, Bundesbank sources will ask why they are not showing up
in the monetary numbers. They also see little sign of any other underlying
turnround in inflation.
Nevertheless the Bundesbank does look at the real economy as well as the
money supply and once the symbolism of the solidarity pact with the unions,
employers and Lander is in sight - Chancellor Kohl has given a deadline of
February 17 - the Bundesbank will have to start reducing interest rates in
earnest. But I cannot blame it for waiting until the last possible moment.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mrs ROWENA MILLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, was not particularly wise in
reminding us that interest rates are now at their lowest level for 15 years
 - viz, 1978 ('UK base rates cut to 15-year low', January 27). There are all
too many of us who will vividly recall that on November 23 1979 the minimum
lending rate, as it was then called, was jacked up to 17.5 per cent (I was
driving at the time of the announcement and nearly hit a tree), and from 7.5
per cent in May 1987 to 15 per cent in September 1989. How can the
chancellor possibly fail to understand that a reduction to 6 per cent will
be of little stimulus to consumption and investment when there is this
record behind him?
Above all, companies and individuals need to be confident of long-term
stability in lending rates before they go out into the market place and
commit themselves to expenditure or borrowing on any significant scale.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Letter: Illogical to fault ICI's new deal on productivity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KEITH STANDRING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader ('ICI pays up', January 2) on the new deal at ICI argues
that the company was at fault in agreeing a substantial real increase in pay
in exchange for greater productivity. This was both unfair and illogical.
I hope you would concede that the future of Britain is as a high-skill,
high-wage economy, like Japan, and not merely as an EC base for that
country's 'screwdriver' operations. If that is the case then what is the
problem with workers who produce more being paid more?
The GMB is, and will remain, at the forefront of negotiations which make
British industry more productive, but we do this for the benefit of our
members and the UK economy as a whole, not simply for the benefit of
shareholders.
If we had a few more companies such as ICI we would have neither a trade
deficit nor a ballooning public sector borrowing requirement. But then to
achieve that we also need a government with an industrial strategy.

POST-CAPITALIST SOCIETY By Peter F. Drucker In UK, Butterworth Heinemann
Pounds 16.95. In US, HarperCollins Dollars 25
In the two dozen books which the encyclopaedic Peter Drucker has written
since his first, The End of Economic Man, in 1939, he has dealt in various
combinations with philosophy, politics, economics, ancient and modern
history, sociology, science, technology and  - most notably - the management
of all types of organisations, from businesses to non-profit bodies and even
governments.
Very occasionally, this still-fresh 83-year-old has turned his hand to
integrating all these themes into one volume, in a manner rivalled by few
writers over the past 50 years  - and that includes the once-fashionable
John Kenneth Galbraith. Yet Drucker's reputation among most 'educated
persons' (the object of the slightly teasing conclusion of this volume)
rests just on his seminal writings about business management.
These range from classics such as Concept of the Corporation in 1946,
through The Practice of Management in 1954, right up to Innovation and
Entrepreneurship in 1985, plus the book a year he has produced since then.
With Post-Capitalist Society, Drucker has reverted to weaving all the
threads together into a universal tapestry. For readers uninitiated in his
power and range, the book should put an end to his narrow reputation. It
reveals him better than ever as an acute observer of the underlying trends
in each subject area, and his erudition and perspective help him knit them
together persuasively.
The 'post-capitalism' of his title may create unfortunate echoes of the
recent flood of often half-baked writings about 'post-modernism' in almost
every walk of society and the arts. But it has method in it.
We have entered a 'post-capitalist' era, says Drucker, in the sense that the
'capitalist' society of the mid-1800s to mid-1900s was dominated by two
forces: capital and labour. Now, and increasingly over the next two decades,
we will move rapidly into a 'knowledge' society, in which the most vital
factor of production will no longer be natural resources, capital or labour
 - all of which can be obtained with relative ease today  - but knowledge.
By the year 2000, he predicts, there will be no developed country where
workers making and moving goods account for more than one-sixth of the
labour force.
Instead, the two key classes of society, with a greyer line between them
than there has been between capital and labour, will be knowledge workers
and service workers. Drucker argues that the main economic and social
challenges will be, respectively, the productivity of the former and the
dignity of the latter, whose numbers will be slightly greater.
Lest his 'post-capitalism' should confuse the reader, Drucker makes it clear
that it is in no way anti-capitalist in the sense that some post-modernists,
though not all, are anti-modernist. It is centred upon the free market, as
the only proven economic mechanism, although some of its institutions will
have to change their roles. Commercial banks, for instance, will make their
money increasingly by receiving fees for information, rather than by earning
a return on money.
Among the other characteristics of post-capitalist society, says Drucker,
will be the confusing economic, political, social and managerial effects of
constantly see-sawing tension between tribalism, nation states, regionalism
and 'transnationalism'.
For all his illuminating discussion of this phenomenon, Drucker is at his
most thought-provoking on the economics and productivity of knowledge, and
on organisational issues such as why specialisation is almost always more
effective than diversification, whether in a business or a hospital.
In an especially intriguing chapter, he points out the difficulty of
quantifying knowledge, and therefore calculating a return on it. Hence, as
he says, the lack of an adequate economic theory of knowledge despite the
emergence of knowledge at the centre of the wealth-producing process.
At a more down-to-earth level, Drucker dwells at length on the need in a
knowledge-intensive society to take education out of the traditional
classroom and, by the use of technology, to make it available  - and
attractive  - to people throughout their lives.
Universal 'literacy' will consist not just of reading, writing and
arithmetic, but also of fully-fledged numeracy, an understanding of science,
technology and foreign languages, plus what Drucker calls 'learning how to
be effective as a member of an organisation'. Above all, it will require
better 'process knowledge'  - including 'learning how to learn'  - as
distinct from traditional subject knowledge.
In order to lay the foundations of this society, Drucker argues that schools
and colleges will have to become open to all ages, as well as more
competitive and accountable for their performance.
If all this seems too rich and indigestible a concoction to swallow,
potential readers should be reassured that Drucker's sparse prose is laced
with allusions not just to Socratic versus Protagorasian debate (about the
nature of knowledge), but also to 13th-century Sienese art, to Jean-Jacques
Rousseau, to Margaret Thatcher, and even to the Girl Scouts movement.
Drucker is nothing if not eclectic. After all the torrential, over-cooked
outpourings of American futurologists such as John Naisbitt and Alvin
Toffler over the past decade, this slim volume makes a meatier yet more
elegant and refreshing change of menu.

Sir, You assert ('Parcelling up the Post Office', January 3) that Post
Office Counter Services loses money. Not so. Since our company was set up as
a separately managed subsidiary in 1986 we have consistently hit the profit
targets set by government. Last year we made Pounds 26m, a return on capital
employed of 10.5 per cent. This year we are well on course for another
successful result.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Letter: Nuclear the cheapest energy in France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CLAUDE MANDIL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his Personal View (January 29), Mr Malcolm Bruce mentions
'subsidised French electricity'. Such an allegation is wrong. Every two
years a thorough assessment of the nuclear energy costs is done by a group
of experts from various fields of expertise: oil, gas and coal producers,
power generators and equipment manufacturers, representatives of Electricite
de France and civil servants as well.
The conclusions drawn from their studies have proved to be consistent with
the ones obtained by experts from the most recognised international bodies
such as the OECD. Its last report, entitled Reference Costs, which has
recently been published, clearly shows that in France nuclear-fuelled
electricity is, for load-based periods longer than 4,000 hours a year (ie,
for half of the year), still the most efficient and cheapest source of
energy.
Such a conclusion remains valid even under contrasting scenarios concerning
the prices of primary fuels, strong currency exchange rates and discount
rate fluctuations.
The present cost of French nuclear electricity, between 20 and 22 cents a
kilowatt/hour, includes all the costs derived from the entire nuclear
process, particularly the reprocessing and storage of nuclear waste and the
decommissioning of obsolete plants. All such costs are, under very
conservative hypotheses, integrated into the nuclear kilowatt/hour final
cost.
Electricite de France, which operates our electro-nuclear programmes without
any subsidy, is a profit-making company though. Its operating profits will
amount to about FFr3bn (Pounds 360m) for 1992.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Letter: Police still face many problems in combating serious
fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From J A MCSTRAVICK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The article by Robert Rice ('Dilemma over dealing with City cases',
January 27) commenting on the working party report by the bar highlighted
many of the problems faced by the authorities in combating serious fraud.
Apart from the retention of the jury, there were a number of matters in the
working party's recommendations with which I could disagree.
I do not believe that the Serious Fraud Office, the Crown Prosecution
Service  - or indeed City regulators  - are capable of deciding whether a
defendant is likely to receive a custodial sentence. If offences which are
investigated by the SFO are not serious enough to warrant prison sentences,
why would that office be dealing with them?
Self-regulation is not at present working  - some disciplinary proceedings
are almost as costly as many Crown Court trials] They can be too fragmented,
have only powers over members and while they can impose substantial
financial penalties, they are powerless to deal with non-member accomplices.
I agree that some elements of 'compounding,' as practised by the Customs and
Excise, are attractive, but would prefer a formal system of plea bargaining.
However, what is essential to reduce important fraud trials to a manageable
status is an end to what the working party call the defendants' 'right of
non-co-operation'.
'Common sense and the weight of evidence submitted' led Lord Roskill's Fraud
Committee to conclude that non-co-operation 'is a hindrance to efficient
handling of many fraud cases'. The committee dismissed the argument that an
obligation to disclose would be an infringement of fundamental principles of
criminal law. Following that committee's report, Section 9(5) of the
Criminal Justice Act 1987 requires that, after the service of a case
statement by the prosecution, defendants may be directed to give a written
statement outlining the 'general' nature of the defence.
Unfortunately, in practice the intentions of parliament have been thwarted
whenever a defendant does not see fit to co-operate. Possibly as a result of
the word 'general', in more than one trial since the act, defendants'
'statements' have called on the prosecution strictly to prove all of the
case for the Crown. Other than being later commented upon by the judge to
the jury, such compliance is not compellable.

One of the pleasures of 1993 so far has been The Sexual Imperative (C4,
9.00) which tonight looks at the different strategems within the animal
kingdom for rearing one's young. None is more bizarre than that of human
society in which sexually mature young are discouraged from getting on with
the business for such a long period.
The Late Show (BBC 2, 11.15) has boldly decided to go to Scotland once a
month. Its opening programme from Glasgow asks pundits to assess the impact
of the Gaelic Television Fund on TV North of The Border. Created by the
government with Pounds 9.5m, the fund has been asked to treble the gaelic
output.
There is only one prison in Luxembourg and it is profiled tonight in that
first-rate series, The Essential History of Europe (BBC 2, 8.00). Are the
affluent Luxembourgois so happy, or does the fact that one third of those in
jug are there for drug-related offences signal a certain malaise?
The Trouble with Medicine (BBC 2, 9.30) regularly overdoes the foreign
angle. Tonight we see how Americans, Irish, and Indians deal with old people
(as they used to be known in less mealy-mouthed times).

FT  04 FEB 93 / Arts: After 30 years Alec McCowen returns to the RSC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The return of Alec McCowen, after three decades, to play Prospero in The
Tempest; Robert Stephens as Lear; Max Stafford Clark directing The Country
Wife and Ian Judge Love's Labour's Lost; new productions of Murder in the
Cathedral and Goldoni's The Venetian Twins, are among the highlights of the
Royal Shakespeare Company's 1993 Stratford season, announced yesterday.
There will also be a new play by David Pownall, Elgar's Rondo, starring
McCowen as the composer.
At the Barbican in London the RSC is playing safe with successful transfers
from Stratford, like The Beggar's Opera, As You Like It, Antony and
Cleopatra and Tamburlaine the Great Later in the year comes the interesting
revivals with Tom Stoppard's Travesties, directed by RSC artistic director
Adrian Noble, Schiller's The Death of Wallenstein, and a London premiere for
Alan Ayckbourn's dark comedy Wildest Dreams
There will also be a world premiere of Misha's Party written jointly by the
American playwright Richard Nelson and the Russian Alexander Gelman and set
in Moscow just before the 1991 coup attempt.
Although audiences in the past year, at 80 per cent, were slightly above
1991 and the RSC will break even in the 1992-93 season, Noble is cautious in
his repertoire. The recession; an accumulated deficit of Pounds 2.5m; and
the knowledge that the RSC will lose its Pounds 700,000 a year in
sponsorship from Royal Insurance after the 1993-94 season, have persuaded
him to reduce the new productions at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre to four.
However the Royal Shakespeare Theatre is currently undergoing a Pounds
400,000 facelift, including new seats.
A boost for the RSC has come from English Estates, which is to sponsor the
regional tour of Julius Caesar to small venues, like sports halls. The cost
will be in excess of Pounds 100,000.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Arts: Born in the USA - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the 1970s George Crumb was the most performed of contemporary American
composers, a success founded on his knack of offering all the exotic
textural trappings of the avant garde within a friendly sugar-coated shell.
Twenty years on it is John Adams who occupies a similar position of eminence
in the US. Adams's confections may be sugar-free yet they have their own
surface allure, even if in keeping with the spirit of the 1990s it is a far
more astringent one.
On Monday Adams himself conducted the London Sinfonietta in a programme of
contemporary American works, three of them UK premieres, which ended with
Crumb's Ancient Voices of Children. The song cycle was beautifully delivered
by the mezzosoprano Christine Whittlesey and treble Sam Pay, yet sounds now
a museum piece, the thin musical substance sustained only by its web of
cultural references and the undimmed beauty of the Lorca text.
There just might be more magic left in the sounds than was obvious here, for
Adams conducts rather as he composes, with bold poster colours and bracing
rhythmic energy which leave precious little room for subtlety or magic.
Certainly Peter Lieberson's nimble Raising the Gaze would have benefitted
from more air and awareness of light and shade than Adams and the
Sinfonietta instrumentalists suggested, while Tod Machover's Song of Penance
seemed over-insistently eloquent.
Machover's was, though, an intriguing construction, with a solo
computer-linked 'hyperviola' (played by Paul Silverstone) set against dense
textures which combined live and pre-recorded instruments and voices. A
specially commissioned poem serves as thematic backbone; it appears in both
spoken and sung form throughout the work, usually embedded deep in the
textures, while the hyperviola alternates keening chromaticism with ripe
romantic harmonies. The mixture is beguiling and repellent by turns like
latter day Skryabin; the sheer density of the sound world is seductive in
itself.
There was some new Adams too, a Chamber Symphony completed last year which
was receiving its first British performance. The Schoenbergian echoes of the
title belie the musical substance. There are three movements with
calculatedly memorable titles  - 'Mongrel Airs', 'Aria with Walking Bass',
'Roadrunner'  - and plenty of spiky stylistic allusions along the way.
The first movement jumbles Soldier's Tale Stravinsky with Threepenny Opera
Weill, the second unfolds an increasing elaborate skein of lyrical lines
over a constantly mobile bass, while the finale is an extrovert romp, highly
virtuosic (brilliantly played by the Sinfonietta) and propelled by a
rock-like rhythmic pulse. It is artfully put together, undeniably attractive
and ultimately, I suspect, totally specious.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Arts: A board-game of sex and death - Film
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAMAGE (18)Louis Malle
THE PUBLIC EYE (15) Howard Franklin
THE END OF THE GOLDEN WEATHER (PG) Ian Mune
HONEY I BLEW UP THE KID (U)Randal Kleiser
FOLKS] (PG) Ted Kotcheff
In Louis Malle's Damage the main characters could be refugees from a game of
Cluedo. Married British MP Jeremy Irons  - let us call him Mr Grey  - falls
dangerously in love with ambassador's daughter Juliette Binoche, let us call
her Miss Black. (The hair, high-heel shoes and knock-em-dead stockings are
all in midnight monochrome.) Since Miss Black is Mr Grey's son's girlfriend
and prospective bride, neither son (Rupert Graves) nor mother (Miranda
Richardson) must know. All goes well  - or as well as rough sex between an
ageing Minister and beautiful Anglo-French girl can go  - until Madame
Marigold-Yellow (Leslie Caron) blows in. She is Miss Black's mother, come
from South America to pour trouble on oiled waters.
A few reels later: death. Weapon, a bunch of keys. Place, a house in West
London. Victim and culprit  - for me to know and you to learn.
Damage is scripted by David Hare from the novel by Josephine Hart and has
the screaming orderliness of Hare's best film Wetherby. At first the sense
of neat board-game melodramatics seems constricting. We have seen these
moves before, haven't we? Not least in Losey-Pinter's 1967 Accident: perm
Irons and Graves into Dirk Bogarde and Michael York and then add an
interchangeable French-accented homewrecker.
But Hare and Malle make a more brutalist, 1990s partnership and an
ultimately brilliant film. In Accident the Britain burst open by romantic
apocalypse was the old cricket-and-dreaming-spires one. Damage gives us an
older, greyer Euro-Britain already raddled by geo-political anxieties. Here
a French film-maker and English writer can find common ground in a tale of
sex, death and Brussels agriculture initiatives.
With tariff barriers crumbling, not even passion now bothers to stop at
borders. In mid-movie Irons is seen nervously woolgathering at an EC
conference, before dashing off to Paris to disturb the bedsheets of his
weekending son and mistress. Elsewhere in the film the language of sex -
that gymnastic gobbledegook that unites co-linguists and excludes all
foreigners  - is treated at once frankly and scientifically. As Irons and
Binoche grapple on carpets, on tables or in stand-up French alleyways, we
recognise a human phenomenon at once stirringly visceral and arcanely,
forbiddingly ritualistic.
Damage is a psychosexual board-game, blending real emotion with a postmodern
fondness for heraldic tropes. Though Miss Binoche's nymphomania is humanised
by a back-history about a brother who killed himself, we know that she is
really the Angel of Love and Death: a belle dame sans merci for the mid-life
Minister. He in turn is pluperfect Mr Grey, the very model of a modern Major
generalist, though Jeremy Irons gives him so many sad and witty shadings
that the particular grows from the prototypical.
Malle, with cameraman Peter Biziou and designer Brian Morris, creates a
visual style that sets off the movie's ever more telling ambivalences. Hints
of hyperbole  - in the stately piles of Irons's social circle, in the stark
angles and colours of Binoche's neo-Art Deco flat  - are softened by
humanist lighting. And even the character who seems most unbendingly iconic,
Miranda Richardson pale and enamelled-of-feature as Irons's wife, is allowed
a scarifying scene at the close: a breakdown played as if all the
wellbehaved misery of Britain had at last been allowed its voice and
revenge.
'Why are you doing this?' someone asks The Public Eye's news-photographer
hero on catching him in flagrante depicto. 'It's what I do, that's all'
comes back shutterbug Leon Bernstein (Joe Pesci). The movie's 'Bernzy' is
based on real-life 1940s photographer 'Weegee', who earned his name from his
ouija-like powers of getting to murder scenes before the police and almost
before the murderers.
Exchanges like this  - terse, hardboiled, pseudo-profound  - proliferate in
this solo directing debut by Howard Franklin, who co-directed the Bill
Murray comedy Quick Change and scripted the Ridley Scott thriller Someone To
Watch Over Me.
The Public Eye is like a daft compote of both. There are bits of film noir
romance/suspense, as lumpen-paparazzo Pesci courts glistening nightclub
owner Barbara Hershey. (Plot: she is being blackmailed by the Mafia). And
there are bits  - better bits  - of caustic knockabout as Pesci performs his
quick-change routines in order to hi-jack moments of criminal history.
Student photo-journalists, please note the skill with which he cuts out a
'dog-collar' from an old shirtsleeve, turning into a priest to crash a
wounded crook's ambulance.
Wit, though, is slowly pushed aside by portentous wisdom. As well as likable
clown our Bernzy must be a misunderstood artist: his snaps of poverty or
urban violence dismissed as 'too sensational' by publishers he approaches to
print them in book form. So sent back into the streets, he decides to show
them how sensational life really is. Following a Mafia black-market intrigue
all the way to a showdown between families, he is there to catch the
bloodbath on camera.
It sounds schematic and, oh dear, it is. Through the retro-noir visuals move
the plot pawns. Poor Miss Hershey looks as if her daily call-sheet read
'Come dressed as Gene Tierney or Barbara Stanwyck' and only Pesci,
resembling an overfed penguin in a mac, crackles out lines with some of the
animist venom he found for GoodFellas. Franklin directs like a man divided:
it is as if he is holding up a photo of what a 'stylish' film should be like
with one hand, cranking the camera with the other, and nervously glancing
between the two as dramatic life drains away.
According to cinema from the Antipodes  - see My Brilliant Career, The
Getting Of Wisdom, Celia, Flirting etc. etc.  - growing up is a fulltime
occupation. Adults are those oversize eccentrics who loom in from side of
screen, wielding a Bible or cane or rolling pin. Children are those holy
truants who forever wander the gilded beach or outback seeking and finding
lost Edens.
The End Of The Golden Weather is the recipe as before. But as directed by
Ian Mune from a stage play by Bruce Mason, it has such charm you tuck in
eagerly. We are on a stretch of New Zealand coast with cliffs like layer
cake. The usual grown-ups hover round the side of the narrative banquet
table  - fierce Dad, dimpling Mum, dotty aunts and uncles  - while
12-year-old Geoff (Stephen Fulford) sits in the middle. Also jockeying for
space are Geoff's mentally defective pal Firpo (Stephen Papps), who wants to
be an Olympic runner, and the real Olympic runners who interrupt their beach
training to rag Firpo something rotten.
Nothing and everything happens. Indeed the film is best when pursuing the
sublimely marginal: like the night of disastrous Christmas theatricals by
Geoff and his young sister and brother. Despite moments of here-we-go-again
Antipodean archness  - need there be quite so many shots of gorgeous beach
and sunset-golden rollers?  - this is a film about feeling good to be alive
which makes us feel good to be alive.
Honey, I Blew Up The Kid makes us feel there are worse things than a swift
and painless demise. Suburban boffin Rick Moranis, last seen shrinking his
spawn at great special-effects cost to Disney, here goes the other way.
Two-and-a-half year old, 112-foot Adam becomes the Baby That Terrorised Las
Vegas. But wit and true inventiveness are left behind in miniature state,
along with Moranis and his struggling co-stars (Marcia Strassman, John Shea,
Lloyd Bridges).
Folks] is worse: a long, questionably tasteful, unquestionably mirthless
comedy about Alzheimer's disease. Directed by Ted Kotcheff, it has Tom
Selleck coping with senile dementia in father Don Ameche. The title plus
exclamation mark says all. Next up, no doubt, if they make a sequel:

FT  04 FEB 93 / Arts: 'La Musica' - a French 'Private Lives' / Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They loved each other once, but they couldn't bear being married to each
other. Now that each of them is about to re-marry, they realise that they
are still in love. We have come across this situation before - in drama as
well as in real life, I mean. Noel Coward made it a classic comedy of it in
Private Lives. Broadway and (especially) Hollywood made a whole genre from
it: see The Philadelphia Story et al. La Musica is Marguerite Duras's
version. It is very French, very dejected, very plotless, and pretty damned
dull.
From the first re-meeting, comparisons between Private Lives and La Musica
are inevitable. Like Elyot and Amanda, Michel and Anne-Marie try to avoid
for a long time the shocking fact that they are still attracted to each
other. They quickly point out when they must leave, they are politely
considerate about each other's plans, they make discreet enquiries about the
other one's intended, and then they start to reveal how much heartbreak they
have been through. Certain details make Michel and Anne-Marie the more
believable couple. Anne-Marie wanted a child; both of them were consumed by
jealousy; at one time he came near to murdering her, at another she close to
suicide.
But these details are few and far between. What consumes both Anne-Marie and
Michel is ennui. Early on, when talking guardedly about the
once-in-a-lifetime hell of love, she says 'If it does happen again, it's
perhaps because one hasn't found another way of . . .' She pauses, and he
helps her out: '. . . of dealing with the . . . the weariness?' 'Yes,' she
says. Later, his new mate rings up and asks how things are going. He
replies, almost casually, 'We're in the hotel lounge. We're both in
despair.' How to get through the rest of their lives? This is what
preoccupies them.
And La Musica is more successful as an expression of French worldweariness
than as an examination of a broken marriage. True, you could say something
similar about Private Lives  - that it is more truly an expression of
English frivolity than it is about a couple who can't live together or
apart. But Private Lives creates its own world and makes it tick. La Musica
does not have the energy or the nervous system to be a play  - it is too
sophisticated. It is full of post-Chekhovian non-sequiturs, post-Proustian
reminiscences of obsessive jealousy, and post-Maeterlinckian symbolism
('Come into the light') that serves no purpose.
Joseph Blatchley, directing, has paced the dialogue to near-perfection, but
both Harriet Walter and Larry Lamb, excellent actors, are miscast here. It
is not that they sound or look too English  - far from it. But her nervous
intensity is too up-front; and he is too obviously sensitive and passive.
Both of them lack the degree of mystery, cool and self-possession that would
give more tension to what Duras leaves unspoken. (English actors can achieve
this; my mind goes to Nicola Pagett and Jonathan Hyde in Anouilh's The
Rehearsal two years back.)
The triumph of the production is Geraldine Pilgrim's set, a hotel foyer with
doors and stairs leading who knows where. Nothing ever happens in this grand
hotel, but it is in a haunting shade of green, with mysterious smoke in the
air  - and overgrown branches beyond the windows.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Technology: Fast-talking computer shows its strength - A
powerful translation system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHAN CONSTANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Language barriers are set to tumble with the advent of powerful technology
which allows messages to be sent between personal computers anywhere in the
world and instantly translated en route.
European scientists have harnessed the power of parallel processing, where
up to 256 computers can work alongside each other, to achieve previously
unheard-of speed and accuracy of translation.
The method is so quick that 200 pages of text in most languages can be
translated in 20 minutes  - a task which previously took eight hours on the
best systems. Experts predict that better programming will make it even
faster.
For brief messages sent electronically around the world, the operation is
almost instantaneous. Even complex documents only take a few minutes to
translate.
The work, being carried out by Bull of France, Siemens of Germany, and ICL
of the UK, is part of an EC research programme known as Esprit. It is at the
test stage, but products could be on the market by 1994-95.
By scanning print directly into the computer, the system will operate at
half the cost of a human translator and 35 per cent quicker, believes Bill
O'Riordan, ICL's manager of research and advanced technology.
Accuracy has been a problem in the past because of the complexity of the
task  - colloquialisms, cultural differences and context are just some of
the elements that must be taken into account.
'The Archbishop is ready for dinner,' for instance, gives no clues as to
whether he is waiting for his evening meal or has been captured by hungry
cannibals.
People are still needed to edit the results, but parallel processing has
enabled far more sophisticated programming, says O'Riordan, taking computers
well beyond clumsy word-for-word translation. 'I tried to trick it with 'I
think a thought'. The computer analysed this and came back with 'I think of
an idea'.'
O'Riordan believes the greatest demand will be for manuals and technical
papers, especially from manufacturing industry which is expected to account
for more than 55 per cent of computer translation in the next few years.
Professional translators have yet to discover the benefits of the new
technology: 'At the moment we don't use machine translation because it takes
too long to correct the mistakes  - it is still quicker if we do it
ourselves,' says Emma Wagner, head of the EC's English translation unit in
Luxembourg.
Jane Mountford of the Institute of Translation and Interpreting in London
still feels there is no substitute for the traditional approach.
'Computers will not replace human translators. They are a tool and if they
take some of the hard graft out of our work they will be welcome,' she says.
EC translators currently use a vast multilingual computer dictionary called
Eurodicatum, and many sectors of industry also rely on technical language
databases to aid translation of specialist papers. One of the largest is a
medical dictionary with 230,000 terms in Japanese and 180,000 in English.
Bob Kowalski, a professor at Imperial College London, has succeeded in
disentangling the jargon from a parliamentary paper  - the British
Nationalities Act. The result is straightforward, logical language that is
legally accurate, and comprehensible to both computers and the person in the
street.
The next few years will see science fiction become fact. O'Riordan predicts
that computers will soon cross the ultimate barrier by translating speech,
with simultaneous interpreting at conferences achieved within just five
years.

FT  04 FEB 93 / People: Reducing Ladbroke's property exposure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cyril Stein, chairman of Ladbroke Group, is handing over the chairmanship of
Ladbroke Group Properties, its property division, to John Anderson, its
managing director. Anderson is also joining the main board of Ladbroke.
Anderson (right), aged 44, is an accountant who has worked for Ladbroke
since 1971. He joined the property division in 1979, becoming finance
director in 1988 and managing director in February 1991.
Ladbroke says Anderson will continue to report to Stein on property matters,
although he will now have more authority over the day-to-day management of
the division.
Anderson's chief priority is to reduce Ladbroke's exposure to property,
which has proved a serious liability during the property slump of the past
three years. The group plans to reduce its portfolio of Pounds 1bn of
office, retail and industrial property when it can achieve reasonable
prices. Anderson is also responsible for the management of Ladbroke's
property assets in the business as a whole, which are worth more than Pounds
2bn.
In Ladbroke's last full year, which was 1991, the property division made a
loss of Pounds 12.4m after write-downs against falling values. In the first
six months of 1992, losses deepened to Pounds 14.8m in the property
division.

FT  04 FEB 93 / People: Founder of Arlington to retire
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Raymond Mould, the founder of Arlington, the property company that was
bought by British Aerospace, is retiring from the company on March 31.
Mould, together with Patrick Vaughan, another senior Arlington executive who
will retire on March 31, is moving to a new European property consultancy in
Brussels, called Business Park Consultants, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Richard Ellis Holdings.
George Simpson, the BAe director responsible for Arlington, will take over
as chairman of Arlington Property Holdings from Mould. He will also become
chairman of Arlington Securities, a post currently occupied by Vaughan.
Simpson says the resignations recognise 'the changes now taking place as the
Arlington business develops'. BAe had agreed with Mould and Vaughan that it
would have access to their advice for as long as necessary. 'In many ways,
these new arrangements give us the best of both worlds,' he says.
Arlington was bought for Pounds 278m in 1989 to add value to BAe's surplus
landbank, which had grown after its acquisitions of Rover and Royal
Ordnance. However, it has incurred losses during the property downturn and
BAe has stated that it wants to introduce outside shareholders once the
property market improves.
Mould says: 'It is obviously sad to be leaving Arlington after so many years
but I am pleased with the way the company's future has been secured. We have
both agreed that if we should return to the UK some time in the future, and
if at that time BAe wished us to be available in some capacity, we would be
delighted to work with them.'
Mould resigned from the main board of BAe last August. His resignation
coincided with the expiry of his three-year service contract although the
contracts were rolled over until the end of the year.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Technology: You'll never be alone again - Satellite phones
could transform communications once prices come down to earth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a desert island, a man stretches out his hand and picks up a telephone
receiver. He dials his access code, and his voice is soon beaming up to a
satellite, then back down to earth, allowing him to talk to anyone, anywhere
in the world.
This is the sort of image that satellite telephone companies are trying to
sell to international investors and regulators. Information brochures for
these companies are strewn with exotic images of potential users  - from
desert nomads to dark-suited businessmen. So far, however, their best-known
role has been in the desert sands of the Middle East during the Gulf War,
when journalists on the move used them to get the news out.
Satellite telephones could revolutionise communications in much the same way
that cellular phones did a few years ago. Since cellular telephones send
their signals through earthbound transmitters, they are limited in their
reach.
With satellite communications, however, phone calls could be placed and
received anywhere on earth, from the North Pole to Tahiti, or from the top
of Mount Everest to a boat in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
Before this dream becomes a reality, though, companies will have to overcome
two hurdles. First, they will have to win a battle against exorbitant costs,
and second, they will have to win over concerned regulators.
Six US companies have already committed themselves to the creation of
satellite telephone systems: Constellation Communications; Ellipsat (a unit
of Mobile Communications holding company); Loral Qualcomm satellite
services, part of Loral; Iridium, a unit of Motorola; TRW Space and
Electronics Group; and American Mobile Satellite (AMS), owned by McCaw,
Hughes and MTEL.
In addition to telephone services, most of these companies plan to use the
satellite communication system to provide data services, inter-computer
communication and radio tracking. AMS already has a satellite system in
operation. However, it only has a few hundred subscribers and covers US
territory. The other companies, with more ambitious plans for world-wide
service, hope to be in full operation by 1996-98.
The estimated costs of setting up shop, though, are high. Each group will
spend a minimum of between Dollars 500m (Pounds 331m) and Dollars 4bn for
the installation of their systems. 'This is an extremely expensive and risky
business,' one satellite telephone executive explained. 'A lot of these
plans exist only on the drawing board, and when you're just in the
development stage it's hard to have a full understanding of your cost
structure.'
The most expensive items are the satellites themselves. The telephone
satellite companies have put forth proposals for a mind-boggling array of
systems, or 'constellations' as they are referred to in the industry jargon.
One of the few points of agreement seems to be that the low earth orbiting
satellites (Leos), which orbit at a range of 450 to 6,000 nautical miles,
are generally preferable to the higher orbit geo-stationary satellites
(Geos), which orbit at a height of about 12,000 nautical miles. Only AMS
uses a geo-stationary system, mainly because it applied for a licence while
the technology for Leos was not fully developed.
'The development of lower orbit satellites is exciting and has made the
proposals for telephone satellite systems more viable,' said Bruce Franca,
deputy chief engineer with the Federal Communications Commission, the main
US governmental body regulating the new companies.
Leos do carry some disadvantages. They have a relatively short life span,
often four to five years, compared with 10 to 12 years for Geos. They are
also far less powerful, so many more of them are needed to do the job. While
AMS operates with a single, rented geo-stationary satellite, Motorola, for
instance, has applied for a 66-satellite constellation system. Although more
Leos are required to do the job, they do offer economies of scale.
'As the satellites are churned out in an assembly line-like process, the
cost goes down,' said John Windolph, a Motorola spokesman. Because they are
smaller and lighter, Leos are also cheaper to make and cheaper to launch.
Analysts say Leos may also help to lessen the telephone voice delay which
can occur if the transmission has to travel too far from earth.
Because the signals have to travel less distance, Leos also render
land-based booster systems unnecessary, and allow users to carry lighter and
cheaper portable equipment. But the telephone satellite groups have very
different ideas about how far out they want to go, while still operating in
the Leos range. TRW, for instance, plans to operate its satellites towards
the outer limit of Leos orbits.
According to Edward Nowacki, vice president and general manager of the TRW
Federal Systems Division, satellites orbiting closer to earth spend more
time in the earth's shadow. Because the satellites are solar-powered, this
shortens their life span. 'Another problem is that they get cold without the
sun's rays and this applies additional stress,' says Nowacki.
Constellation, on the other hand, chose an extremely low-range orbit of 550
miles, which it says is a low-density height. 'The higher the density, the
more particles floating around and the more radiation shielding you have to
put on the satellite,' says Ron Lepkowski, consultant to the group. Ellipsat
rejected the idea of a steady, circular orbit altogether.
'With a circular orbit, you tend to get significant amounts of
communications capability where you can't use it, like at the North Pole,'
said John Naughton, vice-president in charge of engineering at the company.
'With an elliptical orbit, we can pull the satellite in closer to the places
which would have the heaviest traffic, and let the satellite spin out in
other, low-demand spots.'
One other important advantage of the Leos is that they require a smaller
spectrum range. With governments around the world worried about overcrowded
radio space, this may give the lower-orbiting constellations a strong hand
with regulators.
To operate fully world-wide, the telephone satellite companies will have to
obtain approval from local governments, as well as international regulatory
bodies such as the International Telecommunications Union. To facilitate
their application for spectrum space, most of the companies have accepted
the idea of a multiple access system, which would allow all the companies to
operate along the same spectrum band.
The companies would share the band by providing their users with different
access codes. 'With multiple access, all of us could operate on such a wide
band that we would become almost invisible to each other,' said Douglas
Dwyre, president of Global Star, which is a division of Loral. 'By sharing
the same band, it throws the question of spectrum share back on the market,
since whoever has the most business occupies most of spectrum.'
Motorola, however, is pushing to be allocated its own individual band. 'If
we're all sharing the same spectrum, the chance for interference is too
great,' said Windolph. Many regulators, including the FCC, say they are
anxious to co-operate with the telephone satellite groups, which could
provide an important consumer service.
The companies themselves are busy negotiating joint ventures with telephone
operators around the world in an effort to win local rights to satellite
usage. Despite the problems, these groups are determined to have their
constellations up and running in the next few years.
If they continue to attract the necessary investment funds, they will
probably succeed. Industry estimates are for a possible 10m satellite
telephone subscribers by the year 2005, and usage costs for satellite
communications are anticipated as being just slightly above current cellular
rates.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Two-card trick from
Visa - The credit card company's motives in sponsoring the city of Atlanta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In an unusual marketing deal, Visa looks set to become the official credit
card of the city of Atlanta, Georgia. Barring a last-minute political upset
the agreement, for more than Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.6m) over four years, will
be finalised next week. Already it is being hailed by city officials as a
marketing milestone.
They and Visa executives predict that it will be widely imitated by many
other cities and companies. But the partnership has critics, who wonder how
far the city's rampant commercialism may go. Will Tylenol's manufacturers
market the pain reliever as the city's official headache remedy?
Maybe, if they become a sponsor of the 1996 Olympics, which will be held in
Atlanta. Visa, which is already an Olympic sponsor, says it saw the
additional partnership with the city as a good 'ambush marketing' strategy.
During the Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, last year, Visa accused
American Express of running a campaign which implied a close relationship
with the Games, even though AmEx was not an official sponsor.
Such 'ambush marketing' can be also be done by plastering the airport of the
Olympic city with advertising, for example, giving the impression of an
Olympic link.
Olympic sponsors pay dearly for the Games' commercial opportunities (an
Atlanta Games sponsorship goes for Dollars 40m) and react viscerally to
alleged ambushers.
Under Atlanta's deal with Visa, other credit card companies will be excluded
from placing their ads around the airport or from otherwise diminishing the
exclusivity of Visa's sponsorship.
While the Olympics provided the impetus for the deal, Joel Babbit, Atlanta's
marketing chief and the mayor's official spokesman, believes there will be
more like it. He argues that cities are seeking new ways to raise revenues
at a time when the public is hostile to higher taxes.
Babbit admits, however, that there are limits to such marketing alliances.
He would draw the line at firearms and sexually-oriented products, for
example.
His main targets are the 1996 Olympic sponsors, though he says he would not
rule out partnerships with other companies. This suggestion has some in the
business community worried that the city is extorting 'protection' money
fromtheir Olympics sponsorships.
Nonetheless, companies appear to be lining up to pay. Babbit says he is
currently negotiating with three more companies and expects to sign similar
marketing deals soon.
From Visa's standpoint, the deal protects the company's impending Olympic
sponsorship, but also wins it plaudits as a good corporate citizen. Although
a large slice of its fees will go to the Atlanta Conven-tion and Tourism
Bureau to market the city worldwide (with Visa's logo on the materials), the
remainder of the money goes to general city expenses like park improvements,
and police and teacher salaries.
The eagerness of other cities to become part of corporate marketing
campaigns is unclear. Greg Longini, assistant commissioner for planning and
development in Chicago, where the opening game of the 1994 World Cup soccer
contest will be played, says that the idea might have merit. But he
cautioned: 'Before the city became a partner in a corporate marketing
campaign, we'd have to look very, very carefully.'
One sensitivity he noted was that a marketing deal should not tread on the
toes of a city's existing investors. In essence, if McDonald's has a
corporate presence in your city (as is the case with Chicago), you cannot
sign a deal with Burger King.
The Atlanta Chamber of Commerce has worried aloud about the potentially
harmful effects of the Visa deal on economic development. The chamber, which
leads Atlanta's promotional efforts to recruit investors, is concerned that
the city's alliance with Visa could preclude investment by other credit card
companies.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Luxury for everyone
 -The mass-marketing of exclusive brands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The German motor manufacturer BMW grew powerful not just by producing an
excellent range of cars; careful nurturing of the BMW brand image also
helped, making BMW owners feel they were members of an exclusive club.
But times are changing. BMW is now running press advertising in the UK which
features a gleaming BMW bonnet accompanied by the slogan: 'It's just like a
Pounds 65,000 BMW, only Pounds 50,000 less.' By stressing value-for-money as
much as status, BMW is tinkering  - at what risk is difficult to assess so
far  - with that important intangible, brand image.
Another luxury German car producer, Mercedes, has decided to take a similar
route. Last week its chief executive designate, Helmut Werner, announced
that the company plans to transform itself from 'a car manufacturer with a
long tradition in the luxury class' into 'an exclusive full-line
manufacturer offering high-quality vehicles in all segments of the market'.
Once it starts producing smaller, cheaper vehicles, though, will Mercedes
also dilute its brand reputation? Not necessarily. Some luxury goods
producers have successfully pinned their premium label on cheaper goods,
without losing their consumer appeal.
In 1973, Cartier launched its 'Les Must de Cartier' brand of trinkets aimed
at the mid-market purchaser. The range proved successful, helping Cartier
achieve annual growth of 25 per cent in the 1980s, and in 1991 contributing
more than half of the company's SFr1.8bn (Pounds 800m) sales.
Jean-Louis Dumas-Hermes followed suit in 1978, bringing out cheaper items
with the same Hermes badge as is attached to considerably more expensive
items; sales have since grown ninefold, to FFr2.4bn (Pounds 300m).
Some analysts, though, attribute the relative decline of luxury brand names
to an undisciplined extension of the branding to a plethora of products; at
one point, for instance, the name Gucci could be found on 14,000 different
products, arguably diluting beyond repair a once exclusive name. In the
1970s General Mills extended a sporting status symbol of the time, the
Lacoste alligator, into a widened clothing market; sales started to sharply
decline in 1982, which may have been due to a dilution of the luxury brand.
But brand-stretching of those sorts of luxury goods does not provide the
best marketing analogy for what Mercedes is about to attempt. Purchasers of
luxury personal accessories are not, on the whole, looking for utility as
well as social status from their purchase; nor have the likes of Dunhill,
Cartier or Hermes truly attempted to become mass-marketers.
Whereas these companies were simply seeking to boost profits at the margin,
Mercedes is arguably engaged in a more fundamental fight for survival. In
the car world, where technological distinctions are becoming increasingly
narrow, price-plus-quality is becoming a marketing must. Werner said that
Mercedes was in danger of being priced out of world markets if it stuck only
with its luxury models which were 'over-engineered'.
Like BMW, Mercedes is starting its mass-marketing from an enviable position
of brand strength. The trick is to produce cars for the common person
without also becoming, in the minds of consumers, just another box-pusher.
After all, far worse than damaging a brand, perhaps, is to see it die
altogether.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Regional bank bucks
the trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most of the UK's big high-street banks may be taking the knife to their
branch networks  - but not all.
Yorkshire Bank, whose Australian ownership is not permitted to obscure its
homely, northern flavour, underlined how it is successfully bucking the
trend with the opening of its 270th branch at Hemel Hempstead,
Hertfordshire, last week.
Yorkshire cannot claim to have completely escaped the storm of political
criticism directed at banks. But it sees the present wave of ill feeling
more as a market opportunity than a problem.
Far from dreaming up a novel strategy for the times, however, its tactics
seem to be to play on its traditional strengths while the others flounder.
In terms of products, Yorkshire cannot claim to be much different from its
larger competitors. Its emphasis has been on carving out for itself a
different brand image, consolidating its position as a regional bank -
though its branches now stretch from Gateshead to Slough  - and of winning
business from customers who are simply fed up with its rivals.
Yorkshire took a close look at the promotional activities of its competitors
last year and found that customers were unimpressed with the stark contrast
between expensive advertising imagery and actual delivery. It believed the
service its own network delivered was, if anything, running ahead of its
image.
With personal and small- to medium-sized business accounts as its main
target, Yorkshire increasingly makes a virtue of its size and parochialism.
Its claims of friendliness and approachability seemed to be supported
recently when it was voted best overall bank for customer satisfaction by
'Which?', the UK consumer magazine.
While insistent that it will not necessarily pick up accounts other banks
consider too risky, Yorkshire maintains that the greater autonomy and
discretion given to its managers guarantees a more considered, sympathetic
approach.
Not everyone, however, is impressed. Christopher Cartwright, the owner of a
small but long-established graphic design company who responded to
Yorkshire's well-publicised desire to help small businessmen, says he got a
sympathetic hearing  - and a polite refusal. 'So much for a different
approach,' says Cartwright.
Not content with welcoming suitable refugees from other banks, Yorkshire
also has a keen eye for the empty high-street properties vacated by its
shrinking competitors.
The bank has moved into branch premises vacated by competitors in such towns
as Macclesfield, St Albans, Reading and Slough, though it remains fussy. It
turned up its nose at every branch on a long list of properties put on the
market by Midland Bank.
Expansion is undertaken steadily, advancing into new, adjacent areas only
when the bank's local presence has been established. With a large chunk of
the country now covered, attention is primarily concentrated on expanding
within existing areas, rather than on reaching new regional markets.
There are around 70 locations on the bank's expansion list, although only
three new branches are projected to open this year. At around Pounds 500,000
a time, no one wants to get the next location wrong.
So far, Yorkshire claims it has never been forced to close down a branch,
most of which become profitable in about three years.
Yorkshire does have some things in common with its larger counterparts -
apart from its recently reported 1992 losses. It shares the view that
branches will increasingly take on the appearance of other high-street
shops, with the majority of space given to customers, rather than staff.
The Hemel Hempstead branch, with its spacious banking hall, is a sign of
things to come. Steve Harrison is far too thrilled with his first manager's
post to complain about his own, windowless box at the back of the building.
In any case, he intends to spend most of his time on the road seeing
customers: 'If I'm sitting in here I'm not making any money,' he grins.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Accountancy Column: Environmental auditing still awaits its
green signal - The challenges facing the measurement of ecological issues on
the balance sheet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
DAYS BEFORE the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro this past June, Greenpeace's
ship, the Rainbow Warrior, blockaded Aracruz Celulose's port in Brazil.
Activists had turned up to confront the chairman of the world's largest
exporter of bleached eucalyptus pulp, who was speaking at a conference of
the Business Council for Sustainable Development in Rio.
At stake was the new concept of 'sustainable development' he was promoting,
and for which the United Nations is now trying to draw up an accounting
standard.
In a publication released for the conference, Aracruz declared that its pulp
production methods demonstrated that 'enlightened environmental and social
stewardship can be combined with corporate profitability'.
Greenpeace claims this is not really what Aracruz is doing. Near the port
they were blockading, Aracruz grows eucalyptus trees which it harvests for
wood every seven years. The company claims that new eucalyptus forests it
had planted are regenerating the local economy and the environment.
But forest campaigners for Greenpeace say that Aracruz's forests are
eucalyptus monocultures that destroy topsoil, water tables and biodiversity.
They also say that Aracruz omits to mention that the land it now harvests
belonged to the native Tupiniquim people and was handed over by a former
military regime which claimed the local people were not natives.
These are a few of the issues with which accounting for sustainable
development is fraught. Its proponents argue that the newly-emerging field
of environmental accounting is only the tip of the iceberg. Groups like
Greenpeace say it is not enough to increase forest cover; only by including
issues such as the types of forests, their effect on the environment and the
impact on the local community can the full picture of corporate performance
emerge.
A traditional set of accounts shows financial profits and losses. It takes
into account the depreciation of tangible assets acquired, certain
intangibles like goodwill, and sets aside provisions against disasters or
liabilities.
New environmental standards say that it should also reflect expenditure of
natural resources like air or soil. If a toxic substance is emitted, there
could be a future cost that would affect the traditional balance sheet. This
impact might include respiratory problems caused by the emissions, or even
loss of life. The latest accounts of the chemical manufacturers Monsanto
noted that it had doubled its balance sheet liability for cleaning up its
toxic wastes in the last financial year from Dollars 120m to Dollars 245m,
for instance.
Kristin Dawkins, an analyst at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade
Policy in Minneapolis, who has been developing a model for what she calls
'full cost accounting', explains that even this approach to accounting for
future liabilities is not sufficient. She stresses the importance of other
factors that cannot be identified so easily.
She says there can be a vast difference between the market's valuation of
social and ecological impacts, and a community's definition of the
non-market value of the same resources. The full value of a particular log
would be different for a furniture company, the timber industry, and a
Amazonian Kayapo Indian living in the forest, for example.
Simply replacing a mahogany tree with eucalyptus is good enough for the
timber company, which will return to harvest the tree seven years later. In
succeeding years, if the soil continues to produce eucalyptus, the company
gets its share of wood every seven years. Likewise the furniture company is
satisfied with the same return.
But for the Kayapo, the eucalyptus tree has few leaves and adds very little
value to the soil. By contrast, the traditional Brazilian rainforest trees
decompose and add organic material that supports millions of other plants
and animals on which the Indians depend for food and medicine.
These environmental issues are gradually beginning to be tackled by some
accountants. Daniel Rubenstein, of the Canadian Auditor General's office in
Ottawa, has been attempting to develop green standards. He says that
companies should present separate environmental balance sheets so that
analysts and shareholders can compare the protective measures taken by
different businesses.
Resources that are used and returned in their original state, such as a
factory site, can be considered 'borrowed'. While they are being used, the
company will have to pay a 'price' for the dangers of contamination. Oil
companies will have large 'expenses' for transporting oil over the sea, for
instance, but they can write off the liability once it is sold.
Rubenstein's work was partly commissioned by the United Nations'
Transnational Corporations and Management Division in New York. Lorraine
Ruffing, the chief of its accounting section, says there is now similar work
beginning on green accounting in Britain and at the European Community in
Brussels.
But her the latest project, which is being developed by Harris Gleckman in
the environmental department of the same UN division, will try take the
issue still further towards the approach suggested by Dawkins. In the case
of an oil company, that would mean taking into account what happens to the
oil after it has been sold.
This is called 'full life-cycle accounting', by which a company must reflect
the impact of a product from cradle to grave. Ernst Callenbach, an adviser
on eco-auditing for the Elmwood Institute in Berkeley, California, says:
'Companies need to be viewed as living, breathing and excreting organisms.
We have to look at everything that goes in and everything that goes out.'
One company that employs these ideas is a Danish textile manufacturer called
Novotex. It analysed the environmental impact of every stage of the
production of cotton T-shirts, covering every detail of cultivation, such as
the use of pesticides, fertiliser, irrigation, defoliant, transportation and
the working conditions of labourers. The same comprehensive thinking was
applied to spinning the raw cotton, knitting the thread into fabric, dyeing,
shirt manufacturing, possible recycling, and finally its destruction.
Other companies attempting to scrutinise the full costs include Esprit,
which has started a line of more environmentally-responsible clothing, and
the Swiss corporation Ecover, which manufactures washing liquids and even
cautions consumers against using too much of its product  - a novel but
effective marketing technique.
But most such experiments are still at a very early stage. Novotex readily
admits that it still has 'a lot of goals ahead'. For some companies, the
choices are also much more difficult. Extractive industries clearly cannot
replace the minerals they take from the earth, for instance.
In many cases, the potential future environmental significance may remain
unclear. For instance, loggers had cut down all but the last few clumps of
the Pacific Yew  - once known as a 'trash tree'  - before researchers
discovered that its bark could treat breast cancer.
How does an accountant or an actuary work out the possible benefits of this
discovery? The only way is to ensure that no stocks of natural 'capital' are
completely depleted. That goal is many years off.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Political Notebook: Finding a place in the world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASK any group of Conservative MPs about Britain's place in the world and the
competing cross-currents of opinion surface within minutes.
First comes a surprisingly pragmatic realism appropriate to a middle-ranking
European power in the 1990s. Applied most obviously to Bosnia but also to
Saddam Hussein's Iraq, it states with certainty that Britain must no longer
aspire to the role of world policeman.
Its stretched armed forces have a part to play in humanitarian aid efforts
in the former Yugoslavia and elsewhere. But British soldiers are too scarce
and too precious to be cast in the dangerous role of peace-makers. So
successive debates in the Commons have left the government in no doubt that
its supporters would not tolerate the risk of significant casualties in a
Balkans conflict seen as tangential to British interests. Unquestioning
support on the backbenches for military action against Iraq has given way to
questions over whether it serves a strategic purpose.
But then comes the second, more familiar, strand of opinion. It is rooted in
Tory nostalgia for empire. Britain is placed still centre-stage,
interpreting its national interest in the context of a much wider
international order.
It is a current that abhors the temerity of those - most recently Mr Warren
Christopher - who raise questions about whether Britain deserves still its
seat at the top table in institutions such as the UN. It is one that has
persuaded many Tory MPs that the cuts in the armed forces mapped out by the
government for a post-cold war world went too far. The peace dividend
promised by Options for Change no longer looks quite so attractive when the
government is obliged to admit that it could not have found a few hundred
troops to send to Somalia. Britain must retain at least the option of
reinforcing its diplomacy with military might.
The Tories are not alone with their uncertainties. Labour has yet to fashion
a coherent foreign policy from the ashes of last year's election defeat. The
Europeanism which Mr Neil Kinnock put at the centre of Labour's strategy has
been undermined by its subsequent record on the Maastricht treaty. The
election of President Bill Clinton has led some to flirt again with
Atlanticism. What is left is confusion. But it is harder always for the
Conservatives to come to terms with Britain's waning influence.
Mr Douglas Hurd sought to negotiate the currents in a speech last week at
Chatham House. He suggested Britain should retain a prominent role in the
interlocking network of international organisations - from a reinvigorated
UN to the European Community and the Commonwealth - confronting
international disorder.
He foreshadowed yesterday's reprieve of two army regiments by arguing that
Britain should spend more on its diplomatic service and be ready to shave
less from its defence budget. But it must recognise also its diminishing
economic power by saying 'no' more often than 'yes' to new entanglements.
The speech won plaudits as a typically eloquent contribution. But it was
more convincing in its diagnosis than its prescription. It provided also
only a fleeting glimpse of the most uncertain dimension of British foreign
policy.
Mr John Major's meeting with President Clinton later this month will
generate endless analysis of whether the 'special relationship' has survived
the Tories backing for Mr George Bush. In reality the prime minister's
concern about the new administration is much more profound. What he wants to
discover above all is the extent to which President Clinton will hasten US
disengagement from Europe.
For more than a decade the Conservatives have seen the US presence in Europe
as a vital wedge between the Franco-German alliance. It has curbed the
ambitions of those in Paris and Bonn seeking distinctly European defence and
foreign policies.
If President Clinton decides to accelerate the run-down in US forces in
Europe - and by implication the priority Washington attaches to Nato - that
wedge will be removed. With it will go one of the principal props which have
allowed Britain to punch above its weight in the world.
The cross-currents then would be not simply be between those remaining hopes
that Britain might cling on to the illusions of empire or whether it must
accept with dignity a modest role on the world stage. The Conservatives
would face also the choice they most fear: between Europeanism and
Atlanticism.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Clash over council tax cuts fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HOWARD, the environment secretary, last night sought to allay
fears that the council tax to be introduced in April would prove to be more
burdensome and unpopular than its predecessor, the community charge.
He told the Commons that the support provided by the Treasury should ensure
that the burden on local taxpayers could be held down to 'fair and
reasonable levels'.
Strongly disputing this view, Mr Jack Straw, Labour's chief spokesman on
local government, forecast that the financial constraints imposed on
councils would result in a serious decline in public services and thousands
of job losses.
Mr Howard insisted that overall, after allowing for inflation, there should
be no need for councils to raise more money in 1993-94 than in the current
year.
He stressed that, if necessary, the government would use its 'capping'
powers to restrain excessive spending and hold down council tax levels. Mr
Howard said Pounds 340m would be available to provide transitional relief
for individual householders facing an 'excessive increase' in the payments
they were required to make to local councils.
His assurances won over at least one waverer on the Tory backbenches. Sir
Rhodes Boyson (C Brent north), who would have preferred retention of the
poll tax, said that after 'wrestling with his conscience' he had decided to
vote for the government. Sir Rhodes called for an undertaking that the
transitional relief scheme would operate for more than one year.
Mr John Redwood, minister for local government, said the provision made by
the government for 1993-94 - approved by a majority of 57 (308-251)  - meant
there was no need for compulsory redunancies in any well-run authorities.

<DATELINE>
   A CONSERVATIVE agenda for change
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
to the benefit system, education, housing, transport, crime policy and to
the honours system - was set out last night by Mr John Major, combining
economic liberalism with a reinforcing of 'the social cement that binds us
together'.
The prime minister said his beliefs would have been familiar to Burke,
Disraeli and Salisbury. He wanted to foster 'a national life in which merit
is rewarded, achievement respected, opportunity opened up and the individual
given power and choice. That is what I mean by a 'classless society'.'
His speech at the Carlton Club, London, stressed the importance of change
because, 'if we cling to outdated habits, rules and restrictions, we risk
the collapse of our economy and society'. But he also wanted Britain to keep
its links with the past:
'Some say that the glories of British history, the plays and sonnets of
Shakespeare, the works of Dickens and Trollope - even poor old Winnie the
Pooh - are irrelevant to the modern child . . . The destruction they have
wrought has been physical as well as emotional.'
In an apparent reference to the royal family, he said: 'Recently, the
institutions that embodied our nationhood have come under attack:
institutions in whose name our countrymen and women have been ready to make
the ultimate sacrifice of their lives. I sense a growing fear that we may
lose so much that is precious to this country.'
He added later that, as the year 2000 approaches, 'we need more than ever
that anchor of past experience and those institutions which give continuity
and a framework to our national life - the monarchy, Parliament, our
churches and voluntary organisations.'
Mr Major welcomed the fact that 'the days when people could be considered
somehow superior because of who they were, and not what they were, are
finally fading into history.'
He wanted to end barriers between blue collar and white collar and to raise
the esteem of vocational qualifications. The honours system would be
developed, 'to get rid of old, class-based distinctions' and reward
volunteers.
Conservatives were wary of over-government and unlike socialists did not see
the free market as a threat, he said.
'It is not where the free market pervades that ties of community are under
threat, but where the state owns and controls to the greatest extent. Look
at our suburbs and small towns and villages - where people, by and large,
own their own homes. . . The big problem lies elsewhere. It is from the
inner cities, where the state is dominant, that businesses have fled.'
He said rising crime had to be tackled. Change was needed in the police
force: 'The crucial test of our police forces is their ability to deliver
what the citizen wants: safety on our streets and security in their homes.'
New powers to take persistent young offenders off the streets and into
secure accommodation would be announced.
On the economy, Mr Major said: 'If we are to sustain sound public finance
and make progress towards our goals of lower personal taxation we must keep
firm control of inflation and take a rigorous approach to public spending.
It is always dangerously easy for the state to settle into habits of
spending which outlast their purpose and outrun their budgets.'
In housing, good private landlords had to be encouraged: 'But most young
people still want to own their own home, and Conservatives believe strongly
in helping them fulfil that ambition. I want more of them to have that
choice.'
The government had already opened the way to privately financed
infrastructure projects. He wanted to 'investigate still more radical ways
of financing a better road network between our cities.'
Mr Major added: 'I increasingly wonder whether paying unemployment benefit,
without offering or requiring any activity in return, serves unemployed
people or society well.
'Of course, we have to make sure that any conditions imposed improve the job
prospects of unemployed people and give good value to the country. But we
have already introduced this principle, for example through Restart, in a
limited sense for the long-term unemployed. I believe we should explore ways
of extending it further.'
He did not under-estimate the difficulties of change - 'giving people more
freedom means giving people the opportunity to make mistakes,' he said. But
it had been 'the genius of our party that we fashion change in the image of
our long traditions.'

MR JOHN MAJOR met senior colleagues yesterday for his first full discussion
of the pit closures since his return from India and the Gulf.
The small group of ministers most involved, however, is not in Downing
Street's updated list of cabinet committees, since it is counted as an ad
hoc group rather than a formal committee.
The same is true for the group under Lord Wakeham, the leader of the Lords,
which has been set up to look specifically at unemployment and possible
employment measures.
Instead, the only two new committees listed are EDX, the public expenditure
committee, which is chaired by the chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, and the
group on refugees from the former Yugoslavia, which is chaired by the home
secretary, Mr Kenneth Clarke.
EDX comprises Mr Lamont, Mr Clarke, Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade
secretary; Lord Wakeham, the leader of the Lords; Mr Tony Newton, the leader
of the Commons; Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister; and Mr
Michael Portillo, the chief secretary.
The refugees group comprises Mr Clarke; Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary; Mr Newton; Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary; Mr David
Hunt, the Welsh secretary; Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary;
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary; Mr John Patten, the education
secretary; Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary; Mrs Gillian
Shephard, the employment secretary; Mr Portillo; Sir Nicholas Lyell, the
attorney general; Baroness Chalker, the overseas development minister; and
Mr Charles Wardle, a junior home office minister.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Agency warns against Scots water
sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has been advised not to privatise the water industry in
Scotland, leaving its direction and regulation in the hands of local
authorities but allowing the private sector to become involved on a
franchise basis.
The advice comes from the Commission for Local Authority Accounts, the
equivalent of the Audit Commission in England and Wales. It is an
independent government-appointed body which watches over local authorities.
Its views usually carry weight with government.
The commission was responding to the Scottish Office consultation paper on
the Scottish water industry, currently run by the nine regional councils and
three islands authorities. The paper says change is needed because of the
coming reorganisation of local government and to pay for increased
investment. The options include outright privatisation.
The commission says that because water in Scotland is not seen as a
'commercial' commodity, a 'meaningful' partnership between the public and
private sectors is more likely to command public support than privatisation.
The private sector could be involved in capital construction projects and in
day-to-day running of services.
But local authorities should control and regulate the industry, keeping it
under democratic control and sending out bills with the council tax.
The commission highlights the number of disconnections carried out by
English water companies (disconnection is illegal in Scotland) and says: 'It
would not be difficult to take the view . . . that the generation of asset
and financial resources has featured with undue prominence' (in English
water companies).
The Scottish Office had received about 3,000 responses to its paper on water
when consultation ended on Saturday. Most publicised submissions have been
hostile to private ownership of the industry.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Calls for payment in BCCI collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPPOSITION MPs yesterday renewed calls for a government commitment to
compensate customers who lost money when Bank of Credit and Commerce
International collapsed.
Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, used Scottish questions to
demand an assurance the government would accept the advice of a forthcoming
select committee report if it recommended compensation should be paid.
He was supported by Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat MP for Ross
Cromarty &amp; Skye, who said he hoped the Scottish Office would take a more
'enlightened' view of the word compensation than the Treasury had in its
dealings with local councils.
But their appeals were sidestepped by Mr Allan Stewart, junior Scottish
minister, who said the government's response to the report would be a matter
for Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor.
The cross-party Treasury and Civil Service committee is expected to
recommend compensation for BCCI's former customers in a supplementary report
on the affair to be published later this month.
In a separate move, Mr Vaz stepped up his criticism of BCCI's liquidators
using a new parliamentary early day motion.
The motion expressed regret that Mr Christopher Morris - head of corporate
special services at Touche Ross and a joint BCCI liquidator - had 'failed to
justify his firm's astonishing and exorbitant fees'.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs press on property funds for
developers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE property developers could compete with housing associations for
Housing Corporation funds if ministers respond to pressure from Tory MPs and
council leaders.
Scottish Homes, the Housing Corporation's Scottish counterpart, already has
the ability to distribute funds to the private sector, and many within the
housing association movement in England believe that ministers would be
enthusiastic to extend that regime.
Some Tories believe also that the private sector should be able to tender to
manage housing association stock, as well as competing for funds to develop
properties.
The pressure on ministers reflects unease among urban Tory MPs and council
leaders that the largest housing associations have become too bureaucratic.
Sir Paul Beresford, Tory MP for Croydon Central and one of the backbenchers
most involved in the campaign, says that properties of some housing
associations are so widespread that their ability to manage large stocks is
called into question.
Groups of London Tory MPs have had meetings with Mr Michael Howard, the
environment secretary, and his colleagues to express their concern about the
way the housing association movement has developed.
One response from the backbenchers has been to suggest that all housing
association tenants should be given the right to buy. They recognise,
however, that the expansion of the private finance element in the Housing
Corporation's spending has made it more difficult to devise plans that are
seen to be fair.
Within the housing industry, the Tories' concerns are seen as not applying
to the majority of housing associations. Of the 2,177 housing associations
registered in England, only 11 have more than 10,000 units, and only about
140 have more than 1,000.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Charities fear impact of lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARITIES could be 'squeezed out of existence' by the National Lottery Bill
if the legislation is not amended, charities warned yesterday.
With MPs meeting for the first time today to begin detailed discussions of
the bill  - which should enable a national lottery to start by the end of
1994  - an intense lobbying campaign is under way to force changes.
Charity operators claim the lottery could reduce their own annual lottery
income of about Pounds 235m a year by Pounds 100m. Money lost on operating
budgets, they say, cannot be replaced by capital project financing envisaged
under the national lottery.
There is particular concern over plans to include an instant 'scratch-card'
element in the lottery, along the lines already run by many charities.
In a letter sent yesterday to MPs, UK Charity Lotteries  - the largest
charitable lottery operator, owned by a consortium of charities  - says the
bill would make the national lottery 'a heavyweight contender in the
marketplace' while throwing 'charitable lotteries into the ring with their
hands tied behind their backs'.
Mr Frank Flannery, chairman of the group, said charities should be helped to
compete for funds by allowing charity lotteries to offer bigger cash
winnings. It says the government must ensure that national lottery operators
do not bind retailers and distributors to exclusive arrangements, denying
charities the chance to sell their own tickets.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Spring holds out olive branch to
unionists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DICK Spring, Ireland's foreign minister, yesterday said he wanted to meet
Northern Ireland's unionist leaders about demands for constitutional change
in the republic.
But he failed to dispel the belief that formal talks on the province will
not re-start for some time.
Speaking after an Anglo-Irish conference in London, Mr Spring appeared to
offer an olive branch to unionists who insist as a pre-condition for talks
that Ireland would, if necessary, amend its territorial claim to Ulster.
'I believe that constitutional change will be necessary,' Mr Spring said.
He stopped short of promising that changes would be put to an Irish
referendum if agreement was reached on political arrangements in the north.
'At this stage I don't think we want to get bogged down over 'could be' or
'would be'.' He said it was important for dialogue to open but his
invitations are unlikely to be accepted by the unionist leaders.
Mr Spring also emphasised setting out a lengthy programme of work for the
regular Anglo-Irish conferences, held under the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement
and opposed by unionists because of the role they give Dublin in the affairs
of the north.
That probably reflected an expectation in London and Dublin that talks will
not resume until after May's local elections in the province, which have
begun to provoke inter-party rivalries.
No proposals have been discussed for a break in the conference meetings  -
almost certainly needed if talks were to resume. But Sir Patrick Mayhew, the
Northern Ireland secretary, said the absence of a planned suspension would
not be an obstacle if there was a desire for talks to resume. He is likely
to meet nationalist and unionist leaders in the province shortly.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Warning on cuts to housing budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUTS IN the government's housing budget threaten to reduce the quality of
homes for rent, force more tenants on to social security benefits and create
housing ghettos no better than the municipal housing estates of the 1960s, a
new campaign will claim today.
The Right to Build campaign will be launched by 15 housing associations at
today's annual meeting of association chief executives in Bristol. It is
likely to receive a warm reception from the executives, many of whom will
lose government funding for building new homes for rent if the cuts are
implemented.
In his Autumn Statement the chancellor reiterated the Conservative election
manifesto pledge of aid for 153,000 new housing association homes over the
next three years. But he announced that the housing association grant rate
would fall from about 72 per cent of the cost of each new home to 55 per
cent in 1995.
One consequence is that in 1995 housing associations will have to raise 45
per cent of the cost of each new home from the capital markets, rather than
28 per cent as now. This will make it much harder for associations to raise
the private capital they need. Tenanted property is normally valued at about
50 per cent of its cost so with a loan of 45 per cent it barely has adequate
security.
Mr Graham Buck of Samuel Montagu, the UK merchant bank, said: 'If
associations will be looking for more money I am not sure that there is the
institutional interest to lend more.'
Investors are likely to concentrate their funds on the most financially
sound housing associations. The Housing Corporation, which pays out
government housing grants, has anticipated this and prepared plans to reduce
the number of eligible associations from 600 to fewer than 90. The plan,
leaked shortly before Christmas, created uproar among housing associations.
Ms Sheila Button, chair of the Metropolitan Housing Association, said:
'Rationing funds to a few big housing associations seems to go against
everything the government has tried to do in breaking up big local authority
housing departments.'
Ms Leonie Cooper, chief executive of Rodinglea association, which
specialises in housing single people and students, said several of the
largest and most successful associations would be excluded from the new
'premier league'. She said: 'Special needs, co-operative and ethnic minority
associations are threatened, too.'
Builders fear that the reduced level of subsidy will mean lower quality
homes.
The higher level of private funding will also push up rents, to cover the
additional interest bill. Much of the extra rent will be covered by housing
benefit.
Mr Len Bishop, chief executive of Hyde housing association, one of the UK's
largest, said that as rents increase housing association developments will
become welfare ghettos with almost all tenants on benefit.
He said: 'The government will not save any money, because what it is taking
from housing associations with one hand it will have to pay back in
increased housing benefit.'

FT  04 FEB 93 / Warning on Scots water sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has been advised not to privatise the water industry in
Scotland. The Commission for Local Authority Accounts says the industry's
direction and regulation should stay in the hands of local authorities with
the private sector becoming involved on a franchise basis.
The commission, the equivalent of the Audit Commission in England and Wales,
is an independent body appointed by the government that watches over local
authorities.
It was responding to the Scottish Office consultation paper on the Scottish
water industry, run by the nine regional councils and three islands
authorities. The paper says change is needed because of the planned
reorganisation of local government and to pay for increased investment. The
options include outright privatisation.
The commission says that because water in Scotland is not seen as a
'commercial' commodity, a 'meaningful' partnership between the public and
private sectors is more likely to command public support than privatisation.
The private sector could be involved in capital construction projects and in
day-to-day running of services.
But local authorities should control and regulate the industry, keeping it
under democratic control and sending out bills with the council tax.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Contracts invited for attack helicopter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINISTRY of Defence yesterday opened the Pounds 1.5bn contest to supply
the army with attack helicopters.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, announced that companies
were being invited to tender for the contract. The move had been expected
last spring.
Three UK companies - Westland, British Aerospace and GEC-Marconi - are
pitted against each other, all promoting foreign helicopters.
Westland is linked with McDonnell Douglas of the US. Its Apache helicopter
is favoured by the army but may be thought expensive.
Its rivals are the Cobra Venom, a tailor-made version of the AH-1
SuperCobra, in which GEC is associated with the US manufacturer Bell
Helicopter, and the Tiger which is being developed by the Franco-German
Eurocopter consortium. Eurocopter has joined with BAe to bid for the UK
contract.
An outside bid comes from the Kamov Ka-50 Werewolf, a single-seat seat
Russian helicopter being promoted by Geneva-based Group Vector. However,
experts consider that Russian manufacturers' lack of experience with the
kind of in-service support required by British forces will weigh heavily
against it.
A contract had been expected in mid 1994 but this may now slip to 1995. The
helicopter is due to enter service in 1998.
About 100 of the helicopters are expected to be bought. But Mr Ian Andrews,
an MoD official dealing with army programmes, told the Commons defence
committee yesterday there had been no decision on numbers. It was 'by no
means certain' the army would also require a dedicated armed reconnaissance
helicopter.

FT  04 FEB 93 / M0 growth exceeds target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S narrow measure of money supply, M0, grew by a seasonally-adjusted
4.1 per cent in the year to January, narrowly exceeding the target range set
by the Treasury, for the first time since July 1990.
But the government did not draw any special conclusions from the increase
for the conduct of monetary policy because it was not matched by a similar
growth in retail sales and because of divergent trends in other monetary
indicators, including its broad money measure M4 and bank and building
society lending.
The Treasury in its monthly monetary report said low interest rates could be
encouraging higher cash holdings and so fueling the growth of M0. It
estimated that past cuts in interest rates 'may have added as much as 2 per
cent to M0's increase over the last 12 months'.
Revised Bank of England figures yesterday showed that bank and building
society lending to the private sector fell in December by Pounds 74m after a
drop of Pounds 86m in November, reinforcing the evidence of weak demand for
credit.
The Bank's estimate that this so-called M4 lending had increased by a lower
than expected Pounds 200m in December was one factor that prompted Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, to cut bank base rates last week to 6 per cent from
7 per cent.
Mr Lamont yesterday met Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank governor, for
their monthly assessment of monetary conditions. The Treasury released the
background report prepared for the meeting. This was in line with its new
policy of openness adopted after the exit from the European exchange rate
mechanism.
The report suggested that contrasting movements of M0 and M4 could reflect
the effects of low interest rates on M0, a divergence between consumer
spending, which has gradually been strengthening, and continued caution by
households and companies about borrowing for investment.
The increase in M0 was in line with City expectations following an
exceptionally strong 1 per cent rise in notes and coin in circulation, its
main component, between December and January. Last month's 0.9 per cent rise
in M0 compared with December lifted the annual rate of M0 growth above the
government's 0 per cent to 4 per cent annual target range. M4, by contrast,
fell by 0.1 per cent in December bringing annual growth to 3.7 per cent in
the year to December, below its 4 per cent to 8 per cent 'monitoring range'
set in November.
Other parts of the report gave backing to last week's interest-rate cut. It
said that forward-looking information from wage settlements and the
Confederation of British Industry's industrial trends survey 'indicated
further downward pressure on inflation in the pipeline'. There were few
obvious signs of sterling's depreciation since September affecting producer
output prices, or retail prices apart from petrol.
The report acknowledged that recent monthly data on demand and activity was
disappointing. But it added: 'Overall there is no evidence that activity in
the second half of 1992 was weaker than forecast in the Autumn Statement'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OIL from the wrecked Braer tanker contaminated 2.5m farmed salmon worth
Pounds 35m, the Shetland Salmon Farmers' Association said yesterday.
The fish were in pens in 16 fish farms in the exclusion zone the government
imposed off the west coast of Shetland after the Braer ran aground. The fish
will remain in the cages and will be monitored by scientists.
About half the affected salmon would have been ready for harvesting now, and
the rest would have been ready next year. The association stressed that the
remaining 75 per cent of Shetland fish farms were free of contamination and
unaffected by oil.
Scientists from the Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department
said all the salmon from inside the exclusion zone which were tested were
'tainted or badly tainted' with oil. But all the salmon from outside the
exclusion zone which were tested were uncontaminated.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Caution on 'grey area' in tendering: Guidelines on
contracting out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT departments have been advised to take legal advice every time
work is put out to tender to determine whether the contract will be covered
by European Community laws protecting the jobs and conditions of employees
in mergers and acquisitions.
The Cabinet Office expects to issue guidance in the next few months on the
application to market-testing of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of
Employment) 1981 regulations.
The regulations implement the EC's 1977 acquired rights directive that
decisions in the European Court of Justice extend to contracting out of some
public services.
When the Tupe regulations apply the contractor must take over employees on
their existing terms and conditions. The 50-fold increase in the
government's market-testing programme has led to widespread confusion in
departments over when the regulations apply.
The Cabinet Office guidance will seek to clarify when the Tupe regulations
apply to contracting out. It is also co-ordinating the legal advice given to
departments through a group of departmental lawyers meeting under the aegis
of the Treasury solicitor.
Officials believe there remains a grey area in which it is difficult to
predict whether the regulations apply. The Cabinet Office therefore
recommends that legal advice be sought on each department's market-testing
programme case by case.
There are no plans to indemnify contractors who win contracts believing that
the regulations do not apply and subsequently find they do. Lawyers
specialising in employment law have recommended such indemnities to protect
contractors from uncertainties over the regulations' scope.
Britain's largest local authority, Strathclyde regional council, has decided
to specify that the Tupe regulations apply to all contracts compulsorily
tendered competitively.
The Department of National Heritage has signed an agreement with Sema Group
to provide all the information technology for the new department. The Pounds
3m a year contract is believed to be the first time a government department
has completely out-sourced its IT function.

FT  04 FEB 93 / CBI warns Lamont of raising taxes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry yesterday warned Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, against putting recovery at risk by raising taxes in his Budget
on March 16.
Sir Michael Angus, CBI president, told a meeting of the CBI London region:
'Rises in personal taxation rates would set back consumer confidence at the
very time when it is at its most fragile.'
He said that any increase in corporate taxes 'would jeopardise the capital
investment which is so vital if the UK is to see a sustained period of
growth during the nineties'.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Electricity prices likely to fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES that electricity prices may fall from April were increased yesterday
when National Grid said the amount it charges for using the electricity
transmission system would be pegged, Michael Smith writes.
Although changes to the pricing structure mean grid charges to some
consumers will rise, the company said users will on average pay no more.
National Grid agreed to keep price rises to 3 percentage points below
inflation after Mr Stephen Littlechild, industry regulator, called for lower
charges.
The company said yesterday it had set charges for connection to and use of
the grid at levels aimed at recovering about Pounds 12m less for 1993-94
than the maximum allowed under the price control.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Ofgas to force delivery switch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFGAS, the gas industry regulator, is taking legal steps to force British
Gas to transfer a Pounds 1.5bn gas supply contract to National Power's
station at Little Barford, Bedfordshire, instead of the Didcot site for
which it was earmarked.
National Power has put plans for two 680MW stations at Didcot, Oxfordshire,
on hold while uncertainty surrounds the market for gas-fired power because
of the government's energy review, National Grid said yesterday.
National Grid, which is owned by the 12 regional electricity companies, also
said that Southern Electric had shelved plans for a 351MW power station at
Fawley.
National Power asked British Gas last May to transfer its 500m-therm,
15-year gas contract from Didcot to Little Barford where construction of a
680MW station began last year and which should be operational in 1995.
However, since British Gas's supply contracts all specify a delivery site,
the company said it would need legal advice about changing the destination
of the gas.
Ofgas gave the go-ahead to change the site later last year, but British Gas
still demurred because of the political sensitivity surrounding gas-fired
power generation.
Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas chief executive, said the company was reluctant
to make any changes in its gas contracts at present.
'In the middle of the debate about the future of the coal industry, any
precipitate action would be tantamount to contempt of parliament,' he said.
After a formal complaint from National Power in December, Ofgas has started
legal proceedings against British Gas. The regulator should be in a position
to serve an enforcement order on the company by March. 'We've given them
every opportunity to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion but now we'll have
to force them,' said Ofgas.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Alcohol abuse 'costs business Pounds 2bn a year'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYEES who refuse to accept counselling for drink problems are
increasingly likely to face the sack, the charity Alcohol Concern said
yesterday when it released results of a survey on alcohol in the workplace.
Alcohol abuse costs UK industry at least Pounds 2bn a year, according to the
Centre for Health Economics at the University of York. This figure takes
into account the cost of sickness absence, unemployment and premature death,
but excludes other social and National Health Service costs.
More than 40 per cent of the organisations questioned by Alcohol Concern
said there was a ban on drinking during company time, while nearly 35 per
cent said there was a prohibition on alcohol on their premises. At nearly
half of the companies with bans, restrictions also applied to senior
management, the survey found.
British Rail, London Underground and London Buses all rigidly apply drinking
bans, as do several other bodies with heavy responsibility for public
safety.
More commonly, companies either expect employees to use their own judgment
about moderating their drinking, or have restrictions which apply to
business premises only. For example Unilever accepts the normal use of
alcohol for 'social purposes' and has alcohol on sale at its staff
restaurants and the social club at its London headquarters where 1,200
employees are based.
British Telecommunications, with its workforce of more than 160,000, does
not allow alcohol on company premises, apart from exceptional circumstances
and then a member of top management has to give written permission.
The survey found that problem drinkers were disciplined in more than 70 per
cent of organisations if they refused help but nearly all said they kept
jobs open for employees during treatment. More than 40 per cent had sacked
workers for drunkeness or breaching company rules on alcohol.
Nationwide building society, which has nearly 14,000 workers, is an example
of one organisation where employees could face the sack if they refuse
counselling. There is no overall alcohol ban but a written policy states
that if staff fail to accept help, and if work performance and the society's
public image are affected, 'the society will have no recourse other than to
instigate disciplinary action'.
Only a small proportion of organisations screen employees, the survey found.
Just 6 per cent said they screened the whole workforce, while 5 per cent
were selective. Of those that did so, 18 per cent screened on a random
basis.
The survey sample was drawn from organisations that had been in contact with
the charity's workplace advisory service or were known to have policies on
alcohol. More than 80 bodies took part, 80 per cent of them with more than
1,000 employees.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Receivers called in at Yugo importer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK importer of Serbian-built Yugo cars has gone into administrative
receivership, leaving 60,000 owners and the dealer network with fading hopes
of securing adequate supplies of replacement parts.
Zastava (GB)  - based at Reading in Berkshire  - which was controlled by the
Serbian export/import agent BSE Genex and traded as Yugo Cars, has seen its
supply of cars and replacement parts dry up since the UN imposed sanctions
on Serbia in May.
Only 2,000 cars were sold last year, compared with nearly 10,000 sales a
year in the late 1980s.
Just a handful of employees were left at the Reading headquarters when the
receiver was called in, compared with a peak of 125 during the height of
Yugo's sales success.
The receiver, Mr Keith Selley of Robson Taylor, the Bristol and Bath based
accountants, said yesterday he expected to complete a sale, possibly today,
of Zastava's assets  - mainly spare parts and a few vehicles.
Many of the Yugo dealers are trying to stay viable through second-hand car
sales and servicing, but the network has begun to break up, with some
switching to other makes.
The Yugo factory, at Kragujevac near Belgrade, has laid off most of its
workforce, with some reports indicating that it has switched part of the
facility to making armaments.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Oil rig builders warn of 3,000 more job losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL RIG fabricators warned yesterday that 3,000 jobs were expected to go in
the next three months as work in the UK section of the North Sea continues
to dry up.
The number of workers employed by offshore fabricators, including
sub-contractors, has halved to 10,000 since September, the Offshore
Manufacturers' and Constructors' Association (OMCA) said yesterday.
The association, along with representatives of North Sea oil and gas
operators, met Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
yesterday, to warn of the possible devastation if the government interfered
with gas-fired power station projects as part of its energy review.
'We expressed fears of an exodus of oil industry investment to other parts
of the world,' said Mr Harold Hughes, director-general of the UK Offshore
Operators Association, which has said 55,000 offshore and support jobs are
at risk if new gas projects do not go ahead.
A trade and industry select committee recently suggested that the government
look very carefully at approving further gas-fired power stations and
consider restricting gas-fired generators to supplying peak electricity
demand.
The OMCA warned job losses would be greater and that some construction yards
would face extinction if coal jobs were to be protected at the expense of
gas production.
Mr Bill Allison, its chief executive, said: 'In the long term 3,000
permanent jobs  - on top of the 3,000 expected to go in the next three
months  - could be lost by fabricators alone if the committee's
recommendations are accepted.'
Mr Arthur McQuillan, general manager of Amec Offshore, said the company's
Tyneside Yard had already halved its workforce to 2,000.
Mr Jim Franklin, managing director of McDermott Scotland, said it had
employed 3,500 at its peak last year but expected to reduce its labour force
to less than 100 by April.

FT  04 FEB 93 / School testing prompts concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASSESSMENT of pupils by teachers too often fails to tally with exam results,
the Schools Examinations and Assessment Council said in a report yesterday.
The report, based on teacher assessments of 14 year olds in maths and
science, will reinforce the government's determination to press ahead with
nationwide testing of pupils studying under the national curriculum in
England and Wales.
It comes amid growing controversy over the future of the curriculum in
English, and over this summer's English tests for 14 year olds.
Plans expected to be agreed today by the National Curriculum Council,
another government agency, will advocate a 'return to basics' in the
curriculum, with greater emphasis on spelling, grammar, punctuation and the
speaking of 'standard English'.
The teachers' unions think the English curriculum is too prescriptive and
are threatening industrial action if this year's tests for 14 year olds are
made compulsory, as intended.
A survey of English teachers in 145 grant-maintained schools by the
145,000-strong Association of Teachers and Lecturers found more than
two-thirds in favour of a boycott unless the government agreed not to
publish the results.
Mr Peter Smith, association general secretary, said: 'We are not opposed to
testing; we are opposed to the government's plan for compulsory testing this
year and the results being published in league tables.'

FT  04 FEB 93 / Ward denies hiding Pounds 5m from Guinness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR THOMAS Ward, the US lawyer who advised Guinness on its 1986 takeover of
Distillers, finished giving evidence at his trial yesterday.
Mr Ward, who denies stealing Pounds 5.2m from the company, rejected a
prosecution claim that he had concealed the payment from the Guinness board
because it had been dishonestly taken.
Asked by the judge why he later transferred Pounds 3m of the money to the
Swiss bank account of Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chief
executive, Mr Ward repeated he was putting the money aside for tax
liabilities.
He was worried about the financial security of US banks, even though his law
firm kept both its own, and clients', money in a Washington bank. It had
never occurred to him to open his own account with a British bank, he said.
The trial continues today.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Pound's fall puts up food prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING'S sharp fall in the past few days adds to the upward pressure on
food prices which has been developing since the pound left the European
exchange rate mechanism in the autumn. The full impact is likely to take
several months to show up in the shops.
Many leading manufacturers have announced higher prices in recent weeks.
McVitie's, part of United Biscuits, has raised its biscuit prices by 5 per
cent. Northern Foods, Marks &amp; Spencer's largest food supplier, aims for an
increase of between 6 per cent and 8 per cent by April.
Food manufacturers say the rises are needed to cover the higher costs of raw
materials which are imported or governed by Common Agricultural Policy
support schemes. The cost of some basic commodities, such as sugar and
flour, had risen by about 15 per cent before sterling's latest decline.
Many of the increases announced by manufacturers are facing stiff resistance
from leading supermarket chains, which face increasingly strong price
competition, particularly from the growing ranks of discount retailers.
Recession has caused many consumers to 'trade down' to cheaper brands and
pro-ducts.
When supermarkets agree to nominal increases in list prices they are said to
be whittling away much of the benefit to suppliers by insisting on bigger
volume discounts, more generous price promotions and special offers.
Some big retail chains are also said to have been accepting price rises for
branded products, but refusing to pay more for competing 'private label'
items  - often supplied by the same manufacturer  - which they sell under
their own name.

FT  04 FEB 93 / The DAF Crisis: Battle-weary Heseltine rolls with the
punches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT TOOK Mr Michael Heseltine's predecessor at the department of trade and
industry a matter of weeks to learn the perils of the job.
After a number of near-misses Mr Peter Lilley instructed his private office
to create a file marked simply 'Impending Disasters'. He hoped it would
provide early-warning of the next, inevitable, catastrophe to hit one of the
most accident-prone departments in Whitehall.
Mr Michael Heseltine has not told us whether he kept the file open when he
moved across to the DTI last year.
But either way it would not have saved him from the political fall-out from
the threatened collapse of Leyland-Daf. In the political parlence of
Westminster, the fiasco over the government's coal closure programme was a
blunder, the financial problems of the truck maker an accident.
The difference has done little to soften the damaging impact on Mr Michael
Heseltine's reputation. Six months ago he was one of the strongest figures
in Mr Major's cabinet, a member of the inner circle trusted to pull the
hottest coals from the political fire.
It is not only the Labour party that has been reminding Mr Heseltine of his
promise at last October's party conference to intervene 'before breakfast,
lunch and dinner' to support British industry. Right-wing Tories who bear a
grudge over his destruction of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's premiership are
gleeful about his inability to match the words with deeds. Mr Heseltine's
brand of industrial interventionism was never directed at bailing out
companies such as Leyland-Daf. But his enemies are happy to blur the
distinction between policy designed to promote industrial innovations and
one directed at propping up lame-ducks.
For his part the trade and industry secretary has begun to look
battle-weary, leaving his colleagues wondering whether he is any longer
interested in the day-to-day grind of politics.
It is much too early though to write off a man who has proved one of the
most resilient politicians of his generation. Leyland-Daf has delivered
another blow. But Mr Heseltine learnt long ago to roll with the punches of
politics.

FT  04 FEB 93 / The DAF Crisis: Payments agreed by British bankers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH bankers yesterday travelled in groups to an emergency meeting of
Daf's bank creditors held in Amsterdam.
'It's a question of safety in numbers', said one banker. 'We don't want to
be mugged outside the meeting by angry employees'.
By the middle of yesterday afternoon, they had agreed to provide Daf with Fl
60m (Pounds 22.2m), which they hope will be sufficient to pay wages and meet
the company's other trading expenses for a month.
During that time the receivers of Daf's European businesses will review the
long-term prospects of the company's operations.
Total indebtedness of the company is in excess of Fl 3bn. (Pounds 1.1bn).
However, there is a vast difference in quality between different elements in
the debt.
The loans most at risk are the Fl 900m which banks have lent to the
manufacturing operations. Of this, approximately Fl 800m has been provided
by a consortium of nine banks, led by the Dutch bank, ABN Amro and including
Rabobank of the Netherlands, Generale de Banque of Belgium, Credit Lyonnais
of France and three UK banks; Barclays, Lloyds and National Westminster.
The syndicated loan, in its current form, was signed in June of last year,
and is to a certain extent covered by collateral held on the bank's behalf
by a Dutch trust.
The scale of losses faced by these banks can be gauged by examining the
sacrifices which Daf had been asking them to make, as part of its vain
attempt earlier this week to save itself from receivership.
Under the rescue plan, which Daf formulated together with the management
consultant firm, AD Little, and the accountants, Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte,
the banking syndicate was being asked to provide Fl 50m in a short term
bridging loan. He was being asked for at least a further Fl 100m in further
loans over the coming two or three years and was also being asked to convert
Fl 100m of debt in equity.
Other creditors in the firing line are the investment banking arms of the
Dutch government and the Flemish regional government, which last December
provided loans of Fl 67m and BFr2.2bn (Pounds 44m) respectively.
Under the rescue plan, holders of preference shares and of Fl 150m in bonds
would also have been asked to convert part of what they are owed into
ordinary shares.
However, the bulk of Daf's debt, more than Fl 2bn, is believed to be less at
risk. These are loans made to Daf's finance subsidiaries, which lease Daf's
vehicles to customers.
Daf's ability to pay these loans does not depend directly on the health of
its manufacturing operations. So long as finance company customers, who are
users of Daf vehicles, continue to make lease and instalment credit
payments, then Daf's finance companies should be able to make bank payments.
Part of the finance company bank debts, some Pounds 180m, was securitised
and sold in the form of bonds to institutional investors by UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew, the securities firm, in December.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, said yesterday it saw no
reason to consider lowering the top triple-A rating accorded the bonds.

FT  04 FEB 93 / The DAF Crisis: Government stance over subsidy remains
complex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE THE collapse of Daf was announced on Tuesday, the government has been
adamant that the company cannot be helped from public funds. The true
position may be slightly more complex.
The official position is that government aid of any sort would be disallowed
by Brussels, particularly in an industry with such a history of competitive
subsidy as motors. According to the Department of Trade and Industry, the
only allowable source of funds is regional grants (technically, regional
selective assistance, or RSA).
RSA grants are for individual investment projects, with strict criteria. The
plant must be located in an assisted area; it must be commercially viable;
it must need assistance to go ahead with the project; the project must
contribute to the regional and national economy; and it must either create
jobs or safeguard them.
Daf's Leyland plant qualifies on most criteria. However, as Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, told the Commons on Tuesday, Daf
applied for Pounds 450m of such assistance just before the general election
in April. It was told it could only have Pounds 18m, and did not pursue the
idea.
Mr Heseltine also told MPs: 'Were there to be a request for short-term
working capital . . . such a request could be put to my department by a
myriad of different companies in the motor industries and many others.'
The European truck industry has received assistance from individual
countries in the past, however. The most striking instance is Leyland
Trucks. When it was sold to Daf in 1987, the government wrote off almost
Pounds 600m of debts and accumulated losses. The figure was to have been
higher, but the EC intervened.
Similarly, in October Daf received a state-backed loan of Fl67m from the
Dutch government and a further loan of BFr2.2bn from the Flemish regional
government. No commercial banks were involved and the governments had the
option to convert the loans into shares.
Assuming the loans were on a commercial basis, it could be argued that no
subsidy was involved. However, of the three governments involved with Daf,
the UK was the only one not to contribute.

FT  04 FEB 93 / The DAF Crisis: Leyland may offer low-cost production base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
TRUCKMAKERS are accustomed to lurching from feast to famine, but as the
industry heads into one of its leanest periods on record, any potential
buyer for Leyland-Daf - or parts of it - will have to think hard before
taking the plunge, in spite of the company's attractions.
The company has a highly regarded pan-European distribution network with
around 1,300 sales and service outlets. Access to such a distribution system
would be highly valued by any truck producer seeking to enter the European
market from outside the region.
Leyland-Daf has a share of nearly 8 per cent of the west European truck
market, putting it in sixth place, but it is in the UK that it has
established a commanding presence since its takeover of Leyland Vehicles in
1987.
At the same time Leyland-Daf has a relatively modern truck range and has
made substantial investments in new products in the last two years. Last
year it launched a new range of medium/heavy duty trucks, the 75/85 series,
which was the result of a four-year investment programme worth more than
Pounds 170m.
Last autumn Leyland-Daf began a search for a 'strategic alliance' and began
negotiations with Mercedes-Benz, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz
of Germany. Mercedes-Benz quickly insisted that it was not willing to take
an equity stake in Leyland-Daf, but it has admitted that detailed
negotiations have taken place over an exchange of components or products.
Leyland-Daf's operations in the UK represent a mixed challenge for any
buyer. The plant at Leyland, Lancashire, is relatively modern, produces a
competitive range of light-duty trucks, and has a large potential capacity.
It could offer an attractive low-cost production base in Europe, in
particular for producers with a high cost base in Germany.
By contrast, the van operation in Birmingham appears much more at risk. The
plant, formerly British Leyland's Freight Rover van operation, is old and
the product range is also rather out-of-date in spite of recent efforts to
revamp it.
The future of this plant is in question. Leyland-Daf entered a joint venture
with Renault of France three years ago to develop a new van range for the
mid 1990s. Around 50 Renault engineers are working in Birmingham, and the
two companies have formed a joint venture, Van Technology, to develop the
new product.
Renault said yesterday it was studying the 'repercussions' on the van
project of Leyland-Daf's problems. Privately Renault has been well aware of
the growing financial crisis at Leyland-Daf and has been seeking to prepare
contingency plans.
The truck operations are most likely to be rescued from outside Europe.
Paccar, the US producer, showed a strong interest in a possible deal with
Leyland Vehicles when British Leyland was seeking to shed the truck and van
operations in 1986-87, before the merger was finally agreed with
Leyland-Daf.
However, Paccar has only a minor presence in the European market through
Foden, the specialist UK heavy truck maker.
The pan-European distribution network with its particular expertise in heavy
trucks could also provide the entry ticket to Europe for one of the leading
Japanese producers, Hino (Toyota), Nissan Diesel, Mitsubishi or Isuzu. The
Japanese presence in the European heavy truck industry is negligible and
analysts have always argued that the lack of a pan-European service network
would make such entry prohibitively expensive.

FT  04 FEB 93 / The DAF Crisis: Arthur Andersen partners appointed as
receivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop, partners in Arthur Andersen, the
sixth-largest accountancy firm, were yesterday appointed as receivers to
Leyland-Daf's principal UK subsidiaries.
They have three months under UK insolvency law to hold a creditors' meeting.
During that time they may be able to hold a number of the trading companies
together and sell them as operating businesses.
The receivership is not affected by the jurisdiction of the courts in the
Netherlands, where the Leyland-Daf holding company is based, or by those in
Belgium. The management is applying for protection from creditors in both
countries.
In practice, the receivers are likely to work closely with their
counterparts in these countries.
The appointment of the British receivers prevents any creditor being able to
launch separate legal proceedings to seize the company's assets and recover
outstanding debts.
They have assigned a number of other accountants and insolvency specialists
from the firm to take control of the management of three UK operating
companies on six sites.
Unless they are granted an extension, the receivers will be expected to
provide a statement on the financial state of affairs at a creditors'
meeting by early May.
A creditors' committee would normally be elected at that time, and any
future negotiations - including monitoring the professional fees charged -
would be channelled through this committee.
In the meantime, they can expect a series of potential buyers for the Daf
businesses to come forward.

FT  04 FEB 93 / The DAF Crisis: Cab supplier lays off 80 workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 80 employees who usually make cabs for Leyland-Daf trucks were laid
off yesterday by Motor Panels, the Coventry-based automotive components
subsidiary of Mayflower Corporation.
In lay-off terms, they were the first significant casualties within the
components supply industry of the financial crisis that has taken
Leyland-Daf into administrative receivership.
But yesterday it was becoming apparent that the leading players in the truck
components industry would survive even a total collapse of Leyland-Daf.
The 80 laid off at Motor Panels represents less than 10 per cent of the
plant's workforce. Mr Terry Whitmore, chief executive of Mayflower's
automotive products group, said last night: 'We have already taken the
necessary steps to minimise our exposure to Leyland-Daf's problems. We also
find it pretty difficult to believe that a way forward won't in the end be
found for the company.
'But if they do stop trading, there's 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the
market that will still be there - and we will do our best to get that
substitute business.'
Cummins Engine, the US-owned engine manufacturer that has supplied the
diesel engines for a number of Leyland-Daf's models also said its
manufacturing operations in the UK would not be undermined by even a total
loss of the business.
Land Rover, a leading supplier to Leyland-Daf, could lose orders for about
6,000 engines a year installed in Leyland-Daf vans. But it said last night
this represented less than 10 per cent of Land Rover's engines output.
Like many other dealers, Mr Andrew Milne, managing director of Scotia
Leyland-Daf in Scotland said he had received a high level of customer
support in recent days - no customers had cancelled orders and the business
was continuing to service vans and trucks as usual.
'People have been buying Leyland-Daf for years and years. The original
customers are like a club,' he said.
Nevertheless, with allegations circling that the banks had pulled the plug
on the company even before Monday's announcement, many dealers expressed
anger at the government's handling of the events.
'The bank was already bouncing the cheques on Friday - one of ours was
bounced,' said a dealer, who refused to be named. He believes that all 177
of the jobs at his factory were now at risk.
'We had no support from the British banks or the government. It just
typifies the sickness in British industry,' he added bitterly.

<TEXT>
THE DAF crisis dominated the headlines of daily newspapers in the
Netherlands yesterday with both the banks and the government assigning blame
to each other for the failed restructuring.
Behind the scenes, however, strenuous efforts were under way to salvage the
situation and a mood of cautious optimism prevailed in Eindhoven, a city
badly hit in recent years by lay-offs and restructuring, about the
possibility of resurrecting Daf's core truckmaking operations.
Workers arrived yesterday morning to their jobs as usual but production was
quickly slowed by a shortage of supplies.
'No suppliers are willing to deliver without a direct payment,' said Mr Crit
Pingen of the FNV union. 'You need to bring bags of money to the factory
gate, then you can have what you want. At this moment, there's nothing
coming in or going out of Daf.'
Meanwhile Daf's 1,400 workers at the company's plant in Westerlo, Flanders,
Belgium, were pinning their hopes on possible plans to save the group's
heavy and medium truck operations.
The Westerlo plant manufactures axles and cabs for the heavier Daf vehicles.
A further 100 staff are employed by the commercial office at Aartselaere in
Flanders, the northern Flemish-speaking part of Belgium.
A decision to rescue the business would provide some safeguards for Daf's
employees in Belgium. But even before Tuesday's announcement that the group
had filed for court protection from creditors, Westerlo was laying off staff
temporarily because of the general slowdown in business.
Mr Achiel De Backer, Daf's personnel manager at Westerlo, said that
production had not been stopped, but he added: 'It may be that we have to
take that decision in the following days, because we could be short of
components.'
'It's the financial people who are deciding about our future at the moment,'
he added.

FT  04 FEB 93 / The Daf Crisis: Management buy-out proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MANAGEMENT buy-out of part of Leyland-Daf's UK business was proposed
yesterday by Mr Ian McKinnon, former head of Leyland Bus, Tony Jackson
writes.
Mr McKinnon was manufacturing director of Leyland Trucks from 1981 to 1985.
In January 1987 he led a Pounds 4m buy-out of Leyland Bus, which was then
losing Pounds 30m a year. In the following year the business was sold to
Volvo of Sweden at a large but undisclosed profit.
Mr McKinnon, who is now with Alcan, the aluminium group, said he would
propose to buy only the truck plant at Leyland in Lancashire, employing
2,000 of Leyland-Daf's 5,500 workforce. The van operation in Birmingham and
the Albion plant in Glasgow would be excluded.
Mr McKinnon said he would be joined in the venture by Mr George Newburn,
former manufacturing head of Leyland Bus and formerly a plant manager with
Leyland Trucks.

THE DAF debacle dominated the headlines of Holland's daily newspapers
yesterday with both the banks and the government assigning blame to each
other for the failed restructuring.
Behind the scenes, however, strenuous efforts were under way to salvage the

Some 200 Westerlo employees demonstrated at the Antwerp office of ABN Amro,
the Dutch bank which leads Daf's banking consortium, in the hope of
persuading the consortium to grant the emergency short-term funding needed
to shore up the ailing vehicle-maker. A number of workers said they would
continue a sit-in at the Antwerp office until the bank's Amsterdam
headquarters replied to their demands.
Mr De Backer said yesterday that his staff were not angry with the Daf
management but were arguing 'about the decisions taken above our heads'. He
added: 'It's the financial people who are deciding about our future at the
moment.'

THE ACCOUNTANTS appointed yesterday as administrative receivers to
Leyland-Daf's principal UK subsidiaries have three months under insolvency
law to hold a creditors' meeting.
Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop, partners in Arthur Andersen, the
sixth-largest accountancy firm, were appointed yesterday afternoon.
They may well be able to hold a number of the trading companies together and

They have assigned a number of other accountants and insolvency specialists

FT  04 FEB 93 / The Daf Crisis: Unions fear for future of plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION LEADERS last night accused the UK government of collusion in the
collapse of Leyland-Daf. They fear that Leyland-Daf's plants in the UK will
be sacrificed to save its production facilities in continental Europe.
Mr Tony Woodley, national auto industry secretary of the TGWU general union,
said he had 'reliable information' that a new company was being established
with financial backing from the Dutch and Belgian governments to save the
plants in continental Europe and leave the British operations 'to swing in
the wind'.
He said that Belgian and Dutch employees of Leyland-Daf were being told
their jobs will either be safeguarded or they will receive attractive
redundancy packages, thanks to the intervention of their governments. The
company denied the accusation last night but Mr Woodley said that he was
standing by his claim.
'The government must now surely change its indifferent attitude to the fate
of the Leyland-Daf operations in Britain', added Mr Woodley. 'It must invest
the resources necessary to give our workers the same chance as those in
Belgium and Holland to prove they can produce world-beating trucks and
vans.'
Union leaders are demanding an early meeting with the receivers  - Arthur
Andersen  - at Leyland-Daf to discuss ways of saving all its UK plants from
permanent closure.
Mr Derek Bullen, works convenor at the plant at Leyland, Lancashire, said
that after meeting a representative of the receiver he 'had the feeling'
that a viable plan would be brought forward to keep the plant open.
'My first impressions are that he does not appear to want to come in and
shut things down,' he said.
Union officials are pressing Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, to intervene to try and save the British plants. 'Heseltine
invented the word intervention but he does not seem to know how to do it. He
has to intervene to help or we will see thousands of lay-offs,' said Mr John
Allen, a national official of the AEEU engineering and electricians' union.
Mr Heseltine said yesterday the government was 'ready to work closely' with
the company, the receivers, the banks and other interested parties 'to
mitigate as far as possible the impact on UK jobs'. But he ruled out any
loans or subsidy to keep the plants in the UK open.
National officials from all four unions at Leyland-Daf are due to meet this
morning to co-ordinate their response to the crisis. Some believe the
Leyland truck plant  - one of the most modern in Europe  - will be saved but
the rest of the UK operations will be shut down.
They point to the serious knock-on effect of the liquidation of the UK
plants. The TGWU estimates that at least 15,000 jobs could be lost  - with
10,000 going at suppliers  - if all Leyland-Daf plants close, saying this
would cost Pounds 87m in redundancy payoffs.
Workers at the Leyland plant are planning a lobby of parliament, petitions
and marches to save their jobs. Mr Ian Hayes, chairman of white-collar
unions at the plant, said: 'We have got to keep the pressure up. We have
fought many battles before to save factories from closure. What we need now
is a real awareness in the community here that we are on the brink of going
under.'

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas of Mexico has removed one of his new appointees in
a move seen as consolidating a harder government line towards negotiations
with opposition parties.
Ms Beatriz Paredes, former number two in the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary party (PRI), has been ousted as Interior Ministry
under-secretary and made ambassador to Cuba.
The government described the change, just 17 days after installing a new
team at Interior, as a progressive step. An official said the president was
responding to criticism that there 'was excessive PRI presence in the
Interior Ministry'.
However, analysts saw the abrupt shift as further evidence of a hardening of
the ministry's line against negotiation with opposition parties. 'Beatriz
Paredes was viewed as a progressive force in the ministry. Her removal shows
there is unlikely to be conciliation this year or next,' said one
commentator.

Canadian Trade Minister Michael Wilson has written to the Mexican government

FT  04 FEB 93 / Swift passage likely for family leave bill: Clinton set for
first legislative victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FAMILY leave bill in the US yesterday began what looked like a rapid
passage through both houses of Congress as Republican attempts to modify and
amend it failed to muster sufficient votes.
The bill, twice vetoed by former President George Bush, would require
companies with more than 50 employees to provide up to 12 weeks' unpaid
leave for family exigencies, such as illness of a relative and childbirth.
In the morning, the Senate rejected by 67 votes to 33 - wider than the 57:43
Democratic majority - the alternative Republican proposal to institute tax
credits to companies to cover the cost of family leave. Later it voted down
a series of Republican amendments. The House was to take up the measure and
Mr Richard Gephardt, Democratic leader, predicted easy passage.
Senate Republicans also decided yesterday morning to force a vote on the
controversial question of retaining the ban on homosexuals in the military,
a move designed to pre-empt President Bill Clinton's order for a six-month
review of the issue.
But they did not decide whether to add such a proposal to the family leave
bill or to offer it as a stand-alone amendment. In any case, they conceded
that they probably did not have the votes to pass such a measure. Senator
Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat and an opponent of gays in the military, said
flatly he would not support the Republican move.
Passage of the bill would provide President Clinton with his first
legislative victory, though it would hardly be a momentous one and would
serve as no guide to the far tougher battles to come on economic and social
policy.
The White House also confirmed yesterday that Mr Clinton was considering
lifting the ban on the government hiring the air-traffic controllers who
went on strike in 1981. President Ronald Reagan's breaking of that strike
was an early landmark of his first term.
Mr Clinton's press secretary also confirmed what had been the case since
Monday, that the regular daily briefings would no longer be televised live,
with the exception of special occasions. The practice was unpopular with
many White House correspondents and did not always show the media or the
chief spokesman, Mr George Stephanopoulos, in the most favourable light.
Last, and also predictably, the Senate intelligence committee yesterday
unanimously approved the nomination of Mr James Woolsey to be the next head
of the Central Intelligence Agency.
A full Senate vote is expected today.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SENATOR Sam Nunn was in a magnanimous mood on television yesterday morning.
He said of President Bill Clinton: 'I admire him greatly, I think he's going
to be a terrific leader.' They might disagree on the admission of
homosexuals to the US military but the views on both sides were 'sincerely
held' and there ought to be no spill of animosity into other important
issues. 'Contrary,' he added, 'to what you may have read.'
For Mr Clinton, this was a useful olive branch from a fellow-Democrat who
has emerged as his first and biggest opponent in Washington. Mr Nunn made
clear he would oppose any Republican attempts to codify the existing ban on
homosexuals by tagging an amendment to this effect on to the popular family
leave bill. Later in the morning he so voted in the Senate.
But what the senator from Georgia, chairman of the armed services committee,
gives he can also take away. He had enough to say yesterday to serve a
warning to the president not to commit the cardinal sin - failure to
consult.
Joint protestations to the contrary, there are many in Washington who do
think bad blood exists between the senator and the president. Mr Nunn, a
proud man and sometimes dour, is assumed to have harboured presidential
ambitions of his own, now damped down by the arrival of another southern
Democrat in the White House.
He was never the warmest supporter of Mr Clinton during the presidential
election last year, absenting himself from the campaign in his home state at
the height of the Gennifer Flowers affair last spring. In the early summer,
when Mr Clinton was running third behind President George Bush and Mr Ross
Perot in the polls, Mr Nunn did not exactly discourage speculation that he
might be available as a compromise candidate.
Mr Clinton has a long political memory. His preference for Congressman Les
Aspin over Mr Nunn for the post of secretary of defence in the new
administration may well have been influenced by presumed slights from the
senator, as well as by knowledge of the difficulties he might have with Mr
Nunn in the Pentagon over gays in the military and the more pressing
questions of defence budget cuts and reorganising the armed services.
Mr Nunn's views on both issues - and his close relationship with General
Colin Powell, head of the joint chiefs of staff and a formidable political
operator in his own right - will still create problems for the president in
the months ahead.
Yesterday, Mr Nunn was more inclined to change the subject, commending Mr
Clinton's renewed focus on economic and social policy issues. Still, he
warned that any economic stimulus in the US had to be accompanied by
commensurate deficit reduction proposals over the longer term, and he
preferred putting higher taxes on social security pensions to suspending
cost-of-living adjustments.
Even on the issue of gays in the military, on which his committee is to hold
hearings soon, he warned: 'I may take into account things I have not yet
thought about.' In the present mood, that is about as much as Mr Clinton
could have expected.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Independents win seats but no power: Fujimori consolidates
grip on Peru's institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE years ago, television presenter Ricardo Belmont was elected mayor of
Lima, heralding a period of turmoil for Peru's traditional political parties
and marking the emergence of the independent candidate.
Last Friday's national municipal elections not only saw Mr Belmont
comfortably re-elected but confirmed the political trend he initiated in
1989.
Independents swept into office across the country. In Lima, home to a third
of the nation's voters, established parties picked up only half-a-dozen of
40 council seats. Former president Fernando Belaunde's Popular Action party
and ex-president Alan Garca's Apra party were reduced to a handful of
regional strongholds.
Both had boycotted November Congressional elections in protest against
President Alberto Fujimori's seizure of power last April. Also, the Marxist
left suffered a crushing national defeat.
The elections were good news for Peru in two respects. First, the level of
political violence was sharply reduced. Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso)
guerrillas, their organisation weakened since last September's capture of
their leader Abimael Guzman, threatened voters and killed 20 candidates in
the run-up to polling.
But, compared to 1989, when elections were postponed in a quarter of the
country because of guerrilla violence, Friday's voting was largely peaceful.
Second, these municipal elections fulfil the pledge made by Mr Fujimori to
the Organisation of American States last May of a full return to democracy.
OAS observers appear satisfied with the process.
In theory, the way should now be clear for friendly countries to
re-establish flows of economic assistance frozen in the wake of Mr
Fujimori's institutional coup.
But Mr Jorge Camet, the new economy minister, cancelled his trip to
Washington this week for talks with Peru's new support group. Peru needs
Dollars 410m to cover a 1993 balance of payments deficit.
Without it, the letter of intent presented to the International Monetary
Fund and arrangements with the World Bank for clearing immediate arrears
would collapse, as would prospects for Dollars 1.4bn in fresh credits over
the next three years through the IMF extended fund facility.
So far, the only firm commitments are from support group co-leaders Japan
and the US, which together will put up half the total. Government officials
hope Canada and assorted European countries will provide the remainder.
Last week's elections, however, have not dispelled international community
scepticism, even though Mr Fujimori has earned praise for his speedy
transformation of one of the continent's most protectionist and statist
economies into one of its least regulated.
However, that economic liberalism has been accompanied by political
authoritarianism. Several countries, including Germany, expected to be a key
member of the support group, remain unconvinced about adequate progress on
issues such as human rights.
The US State Department recently protested over threats to press freedom and
its January report on continuing human rights violations caused renewed
concern.
Mr Fujimori's abrasive campaign against virtually every Peruvian institution
has led to mass sackings of judges, the dismissal of tens of thousands of
state employees, and the premature removal of senior army officers who might
not see eye to eye with him. Three weeks ago, the presidential axe fell on
Peru's widely-respected diplomats, causing widespread rancour.
On Tuesday, two lawyers who have acted for Shining Path leaders were
convicted of treason and sentenced to life imprisonment for serving as links
between their clients and the guerrilla group. Both men belonged to the
Democratic Lawyers' Association.
Justifying his actions, Mr Fujimori claims Peru's institutions are corrupt
and inefficient. In broad terms, he is probably right and his attacks help
maintain his approval ratings at an impressive 60 per cent. But, so far, he
shows no sign of building on the rubble of the institutions destroyed.
Rather, he increasingly depends on the armed forces (now largely purged of
dissidents) and the National Intelligence Service which he frequently
praises in public. Observers comment that the new constituent Congress is
proving to be a simple extension of, rather than a check on, the executive.
Also, Mr Fujimori has encouraged the proliferation of the political
independents who triumphed last Friday. 'It's the old divide and rule
strategy,' commented one senior foreign diplomat in Lima.
All winners, whether former left-wingers abandoning the stigma of a party
label, opportunists or decent neighbourhood workers, scrupulously eschewed
ideology.
No-one in today's Peru, even the traditional parties, denies the need for
political renovation. But analysts query whether hundreds of independent
candidates and ballot papers whose complexity means more invalid than valid
votes constitute the 'authentic democracy' Mr Fujimori had promised.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Leaders tackle US campaign spending spree
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEMOCRATIC congressional leaders met President Bill Clinton at the White
House yesterday to discuss how to reform the financing of US political
campaigns.
Spending limits for congressional campaigns, curbs on contributions from
political action committees (PACs) representing lobbyists, and greater
disclosure requirements for lobbyists were all expected to be on the agenda.
The issue stirs fierce popular emotions among US voters convinced that most
of their elected representatives are in the pockets of lobbying groups that
contribute to their campaigns, but a solution will not be easy to achieve.
Leaders in the House of Representatives have revived a reform bill, vetoed
last year by President George Bush, which would have imposed voluntary
spending limits on candidates in exchange for partial government funding.
The bill would also have limited 'soft money' donations through political
parties, but done little to curb the influence of PACs, which many reformers
see as the root of the problem.
Most Republicans object in principal both to spending limits and to public
financing of campaigns, but Democrats, too, fear that the proposed measures
could cost them seats in the 1994 congressional elections by limiting the
advantage in fund-raising enjoyed by incumbents.
A main obstacle to campaign finance reform is a Supreme Court ruling that
mandatory limits on spending infringe the constitutional right to free
speech.
That means that any attempt to limit spending  - House and Senate races last
year are estimated to have cost a total of Dollars 504m (Pounds 333.7m)  -
must be voluntary. The carrot of public finance, which already exists for
presidential campaigns, is therefore virtually inescapable.
US voters, however much they want candidates to stop taking money from
lobbyists, appear reluctant for the government to pick up the bill.
This leaves the way open for the very wealthy, such as Mr Ross Perot, the
independent who financed most of his presidential campaign last year out of
his own deep pocket, or Mr Michael Huffington, a Californian Republican who
broke the congressional record by spending Dollars 5.4m, mostly his own
money, to win a House seat last year.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Harder line in Mexican change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas of Mexico has removed one of his new appointees in
a move seen as consolidating a harder government line towards negotiations
with opposition parties.
Ms Beatriz Paredes, former number two in the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary party (PRI), has been ousted as under-secretary at the
interior ministry and made ambassador to Cuba.
The government described the change, just 17 days after installing a new
team at interior, as a progressive step. An official said the president was
responding to criticism that there 'was excessive PRI presence in the
interior ministry'.
However, analysts saw the abrupt shift as further evidence of a hardening of
the ministry's line against negotiation with opposition parties. 'Beatriz
Paredes was viewed as a progressive force in the ministry. Her removal shows
there is unlikely to be conciliation this year or next,' said Ms Denise
Dresser, a professor at Mexico's technological institute (ITAM).
The ministry's other under-secretary, Mr Cesar Augusto Santiago, former PRI
electoral chief, will be kept on but, it is claimed, without responsibility
for electoral matters. Most of the criticisms of the recent appointments at
interior ministry were directed at him, rather than at the respected Ms
Paredes.
The government's claim to be concerned about maintaining the appearance of
impartiality in government officials was not helped by the appointment of Mr
Emilio Chuayffet as the PRI candidate to be governor of the state of Mexico.

   LONDON, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SENATE committee claimed yesterday the drug industry had broken its
promise to restrain price increases voluntarily. The Senate ageing committee
cited a report suggesting that eight of the top 31 drug groups had increased
prices at more than three times the inflation rate last year.
The study, whose methodology was challenged by the US Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association, also claimed 19 groups had increased prices at
double the rate of inflation.
Senator David Pryor of Arkansas, a Democrat and the committee's chairman,
said the report showed drug price inflation had been consistently higher
than the general rate of inflation.
He claimed it showed drug companies had failed to fulfil promises that they
would limit price increases. Voluntary price restraints were clearly not
working, he added.
The eight companies mentioned were Merck, Pfizer, Marion Merrell Dow, Du
Pont Merck and Sterling-Winthrop of the US, as well as the American arms of
Glaxo and ICI of the UK and Hoffman-La Roche of Switzerland.
Mr Pryor said a drug costing Dollars 1 in the US would cost 67 cents in
Canada and 60 cents in Europe.
The report claimed Glaxo's US arm had increased prices by 4.4 per cent
during 1992. This was contested by the company which said its overall
increase for the year to June 30 had been 1.8 per cent, well below the 3 per
cent general inflation rate.
Glaxo said the study had failed to consider the issues of volume and
discounts. It was important to look at the units sold of each drug as well
as list prices.
Du Pont Merck claimed its increases had been less than 2.9 per cent on a
weighted average basis. Merck said it had increased prices by 3.1 per cent
and by 2.9 per cent if rebates and discounts were included. That compared
with the report's alleged increase of 5.5 per cent.
Pfizer claimed its increases last year were less than 2 per cent, while ICI
said its drugs price inflation had been 3.6 per cent on a volume-weighted
basis and 2.1 per cent after deducting rebates.
Price gouging by pharmaceutical companies has been a favourite theme of Mr
Pryor's since he took over as chairman of the Senate special committee on
ageing in 1988.
President Bill Clinton's campaign manifesto promises to eliminate tax breaks
for pharmaceutical companies that raise prices more quickly than personal
incomes, and to discourage them from spending more on marketing than on
research and development.
It is unclear, however, how these pledges will be integrated in the overall
reform of the US health-care system.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Israeli PM defiant over right to deport: Peace talks still
in doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, insisted yesterday that Israel
retained the right to carry out future mass expulsions of Palestinians and
implied that the US had condoned the deportation in December of 400 alleged
Islamic militants to Lebanon.
His remarks, during a defiant speech to an angry parliament, seemed certain
to deepen Palestinian rejection of an earlier compromise offer by Israel on
the expulsions and further complicate prospects of resuming Middle East
peace talks which the US wants to reconvene within weeks.
His offer to bring home around 100 of the 400 Palestinian deportees stranded
in Lebanon has already been rejected by Palestinians who insist they will
not return to the negotiating table until every deportee is brought back.
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, is to visit the region
later this month to try to achieve an early resumption of the peace talks,
Mr Amr Moussa, Egypt's foreign minister, said in Cairo yesterday.
Responding to criticism of his compromise on the expulsions from right-wing
opposition MPs, Mr Rabin said: 'The principle remains of our ability to
remove for a limited time hundreds of inciters, leaders, organisers. You
never succeeded in doing that.'
Washington's acceptance of the compromise offer 'created a groundwork of
understanding for a subject that America in principle opposed and opposes.
But it accepted this reality - and in unprecedented dimensions,' he said.
The Clinton administration says Monday's offer by Israel to repatriate a
quarter of the deportees immediately and shorten to no more than one year
the exile of the remainder removed the need for any further action by the
United Nations Security Council to enforce resolution 799 calling for the
immediate return of them all.
But Mr Rabin's remarks are certain to stiffen the Palestine Liberation
Organisation's insistence that only full compliance with resolution 799 will
suffice to restart peace talks.
One of the key concerns of both the PLO and Hamas, the Islamic
fundamentalist organisation to which most deportees allegedly belong, is to
ensure that the expulsions do not create a precedent for future mass
deportations, perhaps the most sensitive political issue in the occupied
territories.
Palestinian leaders in Jerusalem yesterday summoned western diplomats to
warn that they would not accept any early call to resume peace negotiations.
'We told them that if they issue invitations to the talks, they know our
participation is suspended. We cannot continue the peace process before all
the Palestinians return,' said Mr Saeb Erekat, a senior delegate to the
talks.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, acknowledged that continuing the
talks with Syria, Lebanon and Jordan without the Palestinians was
unrealistic.
Reuter adds from Washington: Diplomats said yesterday the US had been forced
to call off Middle East peace talks on regional issues scheduled for next
week because of the dispute over Palestinians deported by Israel.
Two sessions were due to convene on February 9, one in Rome on regional
economic issues and the second in Washington on arms control. A session on
refugees was scheduled the following week in Oslo.

provision is extremely weak. The charter condones the disenfranchisement of
the majority,' the ANC said in a statement.
Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee published a draft human rights charter on
Tuesday that outlaws discrimination, but provides for capital punishment and
detention without trial.
The rejection came as angry taxi drivers yesterday continued their protests.
They stoned buses and attacked bus drivers in Soweto, the biggest black
township. Police tried to stop the protest spreading to central
Johannesburg.
Two people have been killed and dozens injured in running battles between
police and the protesting taxi drivers. The drivers allege they are
constantly harassed by police and seek government subsidies.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Japanese key interest rate cut to 2.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Tokyo Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of Japan early today cut its official discount rate from 3.25 per
cent to 2.5 per cent in response to intense political and business pressure
for a stimulus to the economy.
The central bank's decision was immediately welcomed by Mr Hajime Funada,
the economic planning minister, as a timely and appropriate step which would
promote further declines in market interest rates and bank lending rates.
The Ministry of Finance said it had no plans for additional steps to
stimulate the economy.
The Japanese government had also come under strong international pressure to
boost domestic demand and raise imports, and Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US
treasury secretary, said the move would help spur world economic growth.
Following the announcement, made at an emergency meeting of the central
bank's board, the Bank of Japan said the cut 'should provide a sufficient
basis for achieving stable growth'.
Its governor, Mr Yasushi Mieno, said that the expected recovery in Japan's
economy and corporate profits would have a positive impact on Tokyo stock
prices in the long run.
At mid-morning in Tokyo today the Nikkei market average was up slightly
after early sharp gains.
Expectations of a rate cut rose yesterday when Mr Mieno, who has become
known as a tough financial disciplinarian, said there was a need to support
an economy which had fallen into a worse-than-expected condition.
The new rate is the same level as the low reached during the peak of the
bubble economy between 1987 and 1989. Today's cut marks the bank's
acceptance that the downturn in the economy has spread well beyond the real
estate and financial services sectors badly hit by the bubble's collapse.
There were growing signs that small businesses in regions not affected by
the bubble were also being hit.
This is the sixth cut since September 1991, when the official discount rate
stood at 6 per cent. The last reduction, of 0.5 percentage point, was six
months ago. Since then the economy has fallen close to outright recession.
Employers' leaders have signalled that they do not believe the historic low
of 2.5 per cent is sacrosanct.

PRESIDENTIAL guards fought pockets of rebel troops in Zaire yesterday and
Belgium intervened in an effort to force President Mobutu Sese Seko to
surrender power, grounding a planeload of his money, AP reports from
Kinshasa.
The US, France and Belgium sent a joint message to Mr Mobutu saying they
'forcefully insist' that Zaire's dictator of 27 years surrender his powers
to his arch-rival, Etienne Tshisekedi, the prime minister.
Mr Mobutu 'has the blood of more than 300 people on his hands,' Mr Willy
Claes, Belgian foreign minister, said of victims of riots that erupted last
Thursday when soldiers were paid with new banknotes that shopkeepers
refused.
Mr Tshisekedi, head of the pro-democracy transition forced on Mr Mobutu by
Western donors, said at least 1,000 people had been killed, mainly regular
troops, in attacks by presidential guards.
More than 1,500 foreigners have been evacuated from Zaire since the French
ambassador was killed last week.
On Tuesday, presidential guards at the state broadcasting centre had
repulsed an attack by rebel soldiers, hours after fighting at the airport
had killed 45 troops, a European security source said.
Yesterday, for the first time, Belgium moved against Mr Mobutu in Europe,
grounding a plane full of new banknotes he had printed in Britain. Zairean
opposition leaders want European governments to seize Mr Mobutu's wealth to
press him to give up power.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Mitsuzuka - one putt away from premier: LDP faction leader
is out of the bunker and on course to win
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE politicians are fond of comparing their fortunes to those of
golfers. A year ago Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka was trapped in a deep bunker. His
faction in the ruling Liberal Democratic party was falling apart, and other
leaders were settling old rivalries by excluding his allies from senior
government posts.
Now Mr Mitsuzuka is a short putt from the prime ministership. The turmoil
within the LDP has left him with the largest faction, and he heads the
party's Policy Affairs Research Council, which is leading debate on
constitutional and political reform. It is a comeback highlighting the
importance of what Japanese politicians call 'the recovery shot'.
The present tasks for Mr Mitsuzuka, 65, are to stay out of scandal's way and
project a statesman-like image. In the quest for that image he has recently
been pressing the case for political reform.
Yesterday Mr Mitsuzuka told Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister: 'We need
political laws to stop corruption, like those introduced by Gladstone in
1883 (The Corruption and Illegal Practices Act).'
The comment recognises that the expense of Japanese politics tempts players
to take illegal donations and provide unethical favours, as was the case
during the Tokyo Sagawa scandal. Mr Mitsuzuka yesterday insisted that the
scandal involving a trucking company was 'a thing of the past' and 'of
interest only to academics'.
He may be underestimating the anger of ordinary Japanese over the affair,
which involved payments to leading politicians and the prosecutors' lenient
treatment of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the former 'godfather' of Japanese politics,
who was fined only Y200,000 for the illegal receipt of Y500m (Pounds 2.7m).
But it is true that Japanese prosecutors have closed the casebook on Sagawa.
The public does appear to be losing interest in the case, with the result
that Mr Miyazawa's popularity is on the rise, from the depths of 12 per cent
at the height of the scandal to around 20 per cent.
Faction heads such as Mr Mitsuzuka are fortunate that new political groups
are struggling to get funds from recession-hit Japanese companies, while an
imperial wedding scheduled for June has provided a welcome distraction from
scandal.
In professing his enthusiasm for political reform, Mr Mitsuzuka said the
country's multi-seat constituencies were the cause of Sagawa-like scandals
and should be a replaced by a single-seat system similar to that of Britain.
Yet a cheaper political system would undermine the power of patronage that
comes from running a faction and dividing up constituencies with other
faction heads.
Mr Mitsuzuka admits that political reform may 'hurt me personally', but
change is necessary because 'politics is a public thing and we must think of
the next generation'. But he has also suggested in recent days that the
reforms need not be introduced rapidly.
Both Mr Mitsuzuka and Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister and the other
likely candidate for the leadership, have hinted that Mr Miyazawa may run
for a second term as prime minister when his term expires in September. Yet
Mr Miyazawa often appears to lack confidence and has been considered an
uninspiring leader at a time of political and economic crisis.
Not that Mr Watanabe or Mr Mitsuzuka will necessarily provide enough
inspiration to ensure the longer-term survival of the old order, but the
collapse late last year of the Takeshita faction, then the largest, has left
them at the helm of the party's destiny.
The health of Mr Watanabe has been questioned while Mr Mitsuzuka argues that
his experience as a foreign and trade minister qualify him to handle a tense
trade relationship with the US. He said yesterday that 'it is no surprise'
that bilateral tension has risen with the coming of a new US president,
since Mr Bill Clinton had campaigned on economic issues and Japan appears to
be one of those issues.
But Mr Mitsuzuka will need to work to erase a popular perception that his
faction is 'right wing' and, perhaps, not the best to be presiding over a
sensitive debate on a wider role for the Japanese military. And he is
thought by some colleagues to lack the negotiating skills necessary to
secure the passage of important legislation.
Mr Mitsuzuka can claim credit for being the first Japanese leader to caution
the Chinese government over its military build-up. During a visit to Beijing
late last year he expressed concern over plans to expand naval offensive
capacity and the rapid upgrading of technology by the People's Liberation
Army.
'We are not too accommodating towards China. I tell the Chinese at every
opportunity that it is not in their interests to have the world against them
on the issue of human rights,' he said.
On the debate over the so-called 'peace clause', Article Nine of the
constitution, which renounces the use of force to settle disputes, Mr
Mitsuzuka said changing the constitution, technically, was a very simple
matter. 'All we have to do is add a new section to the existing Article Nine
explaining that a United Nations request would override that clause.'
However, he acknowledged that winning public support for such a change is a
'delicate problem'. He suggested that 80 per cent public approval will be
needed before the constitution is changed, or added to before Japan can take
a more active international role.
Having prospered, so far, from the upheaval within the LDP, the
newly-confident Mr Mitsuzuka quoted Mr Mikhail Gorbachev. In assessing the
need for further change in Japan, he said, those who do not respond
'adequately' will be 'left behind by the flow of history'.

ANGOLA'S embattled government made a desperate plea for help yesterday,
calling on the international community not to abandon the country.
The appeal is likely to fall on deaf ears. Both the government in Luanda and
the rebel Unita movement are to blame for the resumption of a brutal civil
war which has cost up to 10,000 lives since last November. Besides, with the
cold war over, Angola no longer has strategic value for major powers.
Both warring factions also seem unwilling to make the necessary concessions
to bring the conflict to an end. Peace talks in Addis Ababa last weekend
failed to agree a ceasefire in the conflict, which flared after Unita had
refused to accept the elections held in September and the government then
took the opportunity to launch a bloody purge of Unita in the cities.
The former Marxist government and Unita remain locked in the bitter
personal, tribal and ideological rivalries which fuelled the 1975-1990 civil
war. Diplomats say there is little hope of concrete results for a second
round of talks due to take place next week, and the United Nations is
scaling down its presence and preparing to withdraw from the country in
April if no progress has been made towards peace.
In the meantime, there is little respite for Angola's 10m people or for the
mineral-rich economy of a country which could become one of Africa's richest
and spur an economic revival throughout southern Africa. Up to 1m people are
facing starvation this year as the fighting disrupts aid operations.
The oil industry, which produced 550,000 barrels a day last year and is the
backbone of the war-crippled economy, has been severely hit by the renewed
civil war.
Unita has captured Soyo, which is Angola's second-biggest oil centre,
causing a loss of 90,000 barrels per day, worth more than Dollars 1.5m
(Pounds 990,000) a day.
Unita has also threatened to attack offshore oil platforms in the oil-rich
enclave of Cabinda, which produces two-thirds of national output.
The Cabinda Gulf Oil Company has been evacuating scores of expatriates. This
week, Unita kidnapped 15 Angolan oil workers in the Cabinda region.

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE South Korean government predicted yesterday that its tense relations
with North Korea will ease later this year.
Progress in inter-Korean relations has been blocked for the past year by
Pyongyang's refusal to allow Seoul to make challenge inspections of
suspected nuclear weapon facilities.
South Korea and the US will also resume their suspended annual 'Team Spirit'
military exercise in March in an effort to force Pyongyang to make a
concession. North Korea has responded by breaking off talks on nuclear
inspections and other issues with Seoul.
But senior Seoul officials meeting on the unification issue said yesterday
that North Korea would ease its stance once the exercises were over because
of the need to revive its troubled economy. Seoul estimates that the North
Korean economy contracted by 5 per cent in 1992 due to an oil shortage that
is hampering industrial production.
In spite of the political stalemate between the two Koreas, Mr Kim Dal Hyon,
the North Korean deputy prime minister, met executives of several big South
Korean conglomerates, including Samsung, Daewoo and Lucky-Goldstar, in
Beijing two months ago to discuss investment in North Korea.
North Korea has also recently made attempts to improve relations with Japan
and the US to attract foreign investment.

BELGIUM yesterday decided to start withdrawing its paratroops from Congo's

violence in the Zairean capital Kinshasa had already been evacuated, AP
reports from Brussels.
'The government has decided to start the retreat of its troops in
Brazzaville on Friday,' a government spokesman said.
He said that 600 Belgians remained in Kinshasa after 864 had been
repatriated with government help in the wake of the riots that swept the
city this week.
Heavy weapons fire erupted late on Tuesday and tracers could be seen over
Kinshasa's skyline, but no information was available on the circumstances of
the firing.
Zaire's opposition said on Tuesday that President Mobutu Sese Seko's special
forces had killed at least 1,000 people, mainly regular army troops after
soldiers rioted to protest at being paid in new banknotes that they
considered worthless.
Belgium yesterday impounded a cargo of the new notes in Ostende after
Zaire's transitional government asked for the move, the Belgian Foreign
Ministry said, Reuter reports from Brussels. 'The transitional government
asked the Belgian government not to authorise the departure of the plane
with its cargo to Zaire and to seize the banknotes,' the statement said. The
banknote is the highest denomination in Zaire but is worth less than two
dollars.

DRAFT rules designed to reduce technical barriers to international trade
will block, and even reverse, government efforts to raise environmental
standards, the World Wide Fund for Nature said yesterday.
A WWF report on the proposed new Technical Barriers to Trade agreement,
negotiated in the 112-nation Uruguay Round, says the accord would prohibit
some environmental rules and open others to challenge as trade-restricting.
Regulations on the use and transport of toxic chemicals, factory pollution
and vehicle emissions could be weakened by the new rules.
The WWF report underscores reservations already expressed by the US and
other countries about the draft TBT text, which aims to ensure technical
regulations and standards do not create unnecessary barriers to trade.
The draft recognises that countries should not be stopped from taking
measures to protect consumers or the environment. But the draft also
requires countries to use international standards, where they exist, unless
they can show these are inappropriate or ineffective.
The US wants revised wording that would stipulate countries' rights to set
environment, consumer and safety standards above international norms. The US
and environmental groups have similar concerns over a draft Uruguay Round
agreement dealing with measures to protect plant and animal health.
Mr Charles Arden-Clarke, WWF policy analyst, said yesterday that the US
change would be an improvement but it did not tackle the fundamental
problem, in that the TBT accord gave precedence to free trade over
environmental protection.
The agreement, which would apply to most if not all 105 members of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), would replace the present
voluntary code, which has 37 signatories.

TALKS on a standby programme which could unlock an extra Dollars 3bn (Pounds
1.9bn) International Monetary Fund loan could start when Russia confirms it
will act decisively on macroeconomic stabilisation and structural reform, Mr
Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, told Izvestiya yesterday.
The world would 'not understand' if Moscow agreed an ambitious programme but
did not implement it. Western financial support would only be forthcoming if
Russia acted to strengthen monetary and financial policy.
It would have to ensure 'the money stays in Russia and does not immediately
end up in bank accounts in Zurich, Paris or London'. Moscow should stop
hyperinflation 'at any price'; many democrats had been 'killed' by it. Any
programme would have to suit not just the Fund, but be accepted by Russian
society. The west had delivered all the Dollars 24bn package promised to
Russia last year except for a Dollars 6bn rouble stabilisation fund.
Russia had received debt relief worth Dollars 7.2bn, plus Dollars 12.6bn
fresh credit from other countries, the EC, the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, and finally a first Dollars 1bn from the
Fund.
Russian exports fell 25 per cent last year to Dollars 38.1bn in sales
outside the former Soviet Union, the official Goskomstat statistics agency
reported.

THE MAYOR of Rome and city council resigned yesterday, after a councillor
was arrested in a bribery inquiry, Reuter reports from Rome.
Mayor Franco Carraro, a Socialist and former minister in Italy's national
government, said the decision had been made with 'profound pain. It has
become clear the political conditions no longer exist for this city council
to continue working,' Mr Carraro, elected in 1989, said.
On Tuesday, the Rome councillor in charge of urban planning was arrested by
finance police. Three other councillors were arrested last year and charged
with accepting bribes for public contracts. Magistrates are investigating
dozens of politicians in a bribery scandal sweeping the country.

</HEADLINE>

DRAFT rules designed to reduce technical barriers to international trade
will block and even reverse government efforts to raise environmental
standards, the World Wide Fund for Nature said yesterday.
A WWF report on the proposed new Technical Barriers to Trade agreement,
negotiated in the 112-nation Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks,
says that the accord would prohibit some environmental regulations and open
others to challenge as being trade-restricting.
Mr Charles Arden-Clarke, WWF policy analyst, said yesterday the draft TBT
agreement would 'cripple national environmental policies and counter efforts
to conserve the Global Commons.'
Regulations on the use and transport of toxic chemicals, factory pollution
and vehicle emissions could be weakened by the new rules.
The WWF report underscores reservations already expressed by the US and some
other countries about the draft TBT text, which aims to ensure that
technical regulations and standards do not create unnecessary barriers to
trade.
The draft already recognises that countries should not be prevented from
taking measures to protect consumers or the environment.
But the draft also requires countries to use international standards, where
they exist, unless they can show that these are inappropriate or are
ineffective.
The US wants revised wording that would stipulate countries' rights to set
environment, consumer and safety standards above international norms. The US
and environmental groups have similar concerns over a draft Uruguay Round
agreement dealing with measures to protect plant and animal health.
Mr Arden-Clarke said yesterday that the US change would be an improvement
but it did not tackle the fundamental problem in that the TBT accord gave
precedence to free trade over environmental protection.
The TBT agreement, which would apply to most if not all of the 105 members
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), would replace the
present voluntary code, which has 37 signatories.

FT  04 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Groupe Bull offshoot to share US air force
order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZENITH Data Systems, the personal computer arm of Groupe Bull of France, and
Government Technology Services Inc. of Chantilly, Virginia, have been
jointly awarded a controversial Dollars 724m (Pounds 479m) contract to
supply personal computers to the US air force.
The award of the contract, known as Desktop Four, should end one of the
longest-running sagas in recent military procurement history. Ironically,
the contract, for about 300,000 personal computers, was placed under new
Pentagon procedures designed to speed procurement.
Zenith, of Hernden, Virginia, has been a subsidiary of Groupe Bull, the
troubled French computer manufacturer since 1989.
Government Technology Services Inc is a large systems integrator and
equipment supplier specialising in the government market. The award of the
contract seems to be a victory for those who were critical of an earlier
decision, which was announced last summer, to give the contract in its
entirety to Zenith.
Protests came from competitors including Apple Computer and Electronic Data
Systems.
Just before last Christmas, to the consternation of Groupe Bull and Zenith,
some of the protests were upheld, throwing the future of the contract into
confusion.
The protests were upheld on the grounds that Zenith's monitor screens did
not comply with the Trade Agreements Act designed to ensure substantial US
labour content in products sourced abroad and that the Air Force had not
considered sufficiently the advantages of sourcing from more than one
supplier.
It is still not clear what proportion of the order will go to each company.
It is understood, however, that the terms of the contract provide each
company with a licence to sell its products to the Air Force.
Each will be forced to fight for its share of the overall contract.
The Air Force said yesterday that the computers, printers, software and
other equipment will be supplied by the companies by February 1998.
Some 370 bids for the contract had been received, along with 22 proposals.
The award comes as a great relief to Groupe Bull which is still losing money
and which was counting on Desktop Four to generate revenues, re-establish
its credibility and show that foreign ownership was no bar to doing business
with the US government.
It is not know yet whether the disappointed competitors will appeal one more
time against the latest decision.

<TEXT>
ROMANIA'S fast-growing private sector, concentrated in trade and services,
contributed more than 25 per cent to gross domestic product last year, the
national statistics commission's preliminary report for 1992 says.
The 400,000 private companies and businessmen registered since 1989 handled
32 per cent of imports and 26 per cent of services last year, doubling their
share of retail sales to 45 per cent.
But private-sector growth failed to offset the continuing state-sector
decline, with GDP falling about 15 per cent to Dollars 510 (Pounds 337) per
head, making Romania the poorest country in Europe after Albania.
Industrial production, more than 90 per cent state-controlled, fell 21.8 per
cent last year, contributing to a 54 per cent drop in output since 1989.
Agriculture, where privatisation has been faster, saw a 9.2 per cent fall in
output. The report cites shortages of raw material imports as a main cause
for the falls.
A 13.6 per cent increase in exports helped narrow Romania's trade deficit to
Dollars 938m, down from Dollars 1.3bn in 1991. Top exports in 1992 included
metals and metal products, textiles and chemicals.
The budget deficit jumped to 3.6 per cent of GDP, against 1.5 per cent in
1991. Inflation fell to 199 per cent, down from 265 per cent in 1991. But
devaluation since the summer has pushed up import costs.

NEGOTIATIONS on a standby programme which could unlock an extra Dollars 3bn
(Pounds 1.9bn) International Monetary Fund loan could start as soon as
Russia confirms it will take decisive action on macroeconomic stabilisation
and structural reform, Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, said
yesterday.
He told Izvestiya newspaper that the world would 'not understand' if Moscow
repeated what it did last year: agree an ambitious programme but not
implement it.
But he added that western financial support would only be forthcoming if
Russia took action to strengthen monetary and financial policy.
It would also have to take steps to ensure that 'the money stays in Russia
and does not immediately end up in bank accounts in Zurich, Paris or
London'.
Mr Camdessus also called on the government to stop hyperinflation 'at any
price', saying that many democrats around the world had been 'killed' by it.
In a likely reference to the political backlash against the IMF in Russia
last year, Mr Camdessus was also at pains to stress that any programme would
have to suit not just the Fund, but would need to be trusted and accepted by
Russian society.
He said the west had delivered all the Dollars 24bn package promised to
Russia last year except for a Dollars 6bn rouble stabilisation fund.
Russia had received debt relief worth Dollars 7.2bn, plus Dollars 12.6bn
fresh credit from other countries, the EC, the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, and finally a first Dollars 1bn from the
Fund.
Russian exports fell 25 per cent last year to Dollars 38.1bn in sales
outside the former Soviet Union, the official Goskomstat statistics agency
reported yesterday.
The final results for 1992 crown a year which started with initial
government hopes for an export boom, soon followed by an attempt by the
Foreign Economic Relations Ministry to suggest that exports had stabilised
to 1991's level.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Hungary signals state utilities sell-off this year

<TEXT>
HUNGARY, anxious to maintain the momentum of foreign investment and
privatisation, is to sell its main national utilities this year, the
government announced yesterday.
Telecommunications, gas distribution and electricity sectors, as well as the
state-owned commercial banks, all stood on the threshold of privatisation,
said Mr Tamas Szabo, minister for privatisation.
Big western European gas utilities, France Telecom and British Telecom have
already examined their Hungarian counterparts; and Bayerische Landesbank,
the Bavarian bank, expressed an interest in taking a stake in Hungary's
Magyar Kulkereskedelmi Bank.
The authorities have given no precise timetable but Mr Szabo said that the
transactions would get under way this year and some could be completed
before the end of the year.
Hungary needs the 'big projects' to take up the running from consumer goods
and food companies which have provided the momentum for privatisation so
far. The finalisation of large deals is essential if Hungary is to follow up
last year's foreign investment inflow of an estimated Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds
1.18bn) and privatisation proceeds of Ft67.6bn (Pounds 553m).
The large transactions are particularly important at a time when Hungary  -
which has accumulated more foreign capital than the rest of eastern Europe
put together  - faces competition from Poland and the Czech Republic.
Budapest's ambitious programme for utility privatisation depends heavily on
the government's ability to draw up and pass through parliament legislation
setting regulatory frameworks for each sector. Potential investors'
valuations of their acquisition targets hinge on price regulation and so far
only a telecommunications act is in place.
The privatisation of Hungary's four large state-owned commercial banks
similarly rests on the implementation of a coherent strategy to
'consolidate' institutions' bad loans. The Finance Ministry, at odds with
the privatisation authorities, is reluctant to countenance a debt write-off
sufficiently generous to make the banks attractive to investors.
The ministry, under pressure from an International Monetary Fund delegation
currently in Budapest, is worried about the budgetary consequences of a debt
write-off.
The authorities, torn by internal divisions, have delayed a formal
announcement that Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment bank, has won
the hotly-contested mandate to advise the government on privatisation
strategy for the banking sector.
The drive to privatise the utilities and banks must also contend with a
heightened political sensitivity about foreign economic domination, much in
evidence at the recent annual congress of the Hungarian Democratic Forum,
the governing centre-right party.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Mediators push Bosnia peace plan: Vance and Owen seek to
overcome Washington's reservations

THE international mediators for a settlement of the Bosnian conflict, Mr
Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, continued their uphill battle yesterday to win
the UN Security Council's and the US's endorsement for their peace plan.
In the face of what appear to be serious reservations by the Clinton
administration about aspects of the plan deemed to favour the Serbs, the
mediators have adopted a remarkably robust stance to hammer home their view
that the proposed solutions are fair and equitable.
Lord Owen in particular has not hesitated in newspaper and TV interviews to
pour ridicule on the arguments of members of the American political
establishment who, while calling for international military intervention to
stop the killing of Bosnian Moslems, do not seem to be prepared to send
ground troops to Bosnia.
Calls for the lifting of the UN arms embargo to help the Bosnian Moslems
have been given equally short shrift by Lord Owen, who has pointed out that
such a move would lead not only to an intensification of the fighting, but
would not be accepted by the British or the French, let alone the Russians.
The consensus that has been built up in the Security Council since the end
of the cold war could thus be completely wrecked.
Even Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN's representative and a former US Secretary of
State, has lost his customary calm under persistent criticism of his
negotiating stance. He treated a suggestion at a press conference at the UN
on Tuesday that he was appeasing the Serbs as 'absolute hogwash' which made
him 'pretty damned angry'.
From Mr Vance, that is fighting talk.
The mediators, whose plan has been approved by at least four of the five
permanent members of the Security Council, were due to continue their
consultations with the other 10 Council members yesterday.
Laura Silber adds from Belgrade: The UN met Croat and Serb leaders from the
enclave of Krajina yesterday, amid clashes in the disputed territory and
throughout Bosnia Hercegovina. Serb commanders in Krajina accused Croat
forces of pushing forward across UN lines, Belgrade radio said.
Mr Boro Martinovic, a member of the self-styled Krajina government,
yesterday confirmed that UN officials were meeting both sides in an attempt
to begin talks towards ending the clashes. He said Krajina's Serb leaders
had been invited to attend talks at the UN. 'But we continue to insist Croat
forces unconditionally withdraw to the confrontation line, as called for by
the Security Council,' he added by telephone from Knin, the mountain-top
centre of Krajina.
In Bosnia the UN High Commissioner of Refugees suspended humanitarian
convoys along the route from the southern city of Mostar to Sarajevo. A
UNHCR relief convoy on Tuesday was shelled in a valley near Mostar, killing
one person and seriously wounding another. Croatian radio blamed the attack
on Serb forces.
Further south, the radio said Serb forces yesterday launched a
counter-offensive on the Mostar-Stolac lines. In a conflicting report, Srna,
the Bosnian Serb news agency said Croat forces had launched the attack.

THE controversy over loss of foreign investment in France deepened yesterday
when two US companies - the paper group Kimberly-Clark, and a subsidiary of
S C Johnson, the maker of cleaning products - both confirmed reductions in
their operations.
Eurofab, an S C Johnson offshoot which makes Johnson's Wax near Tours, is to
close with the loss of 193 jobs by June, to concentrate production at larger
and cheaper sites at Mijdrecht in the Netherlands and Frimley in Britain.
This was part of a European restructuring plan announced by S C Johnson last
September, in which plants in Spain and Portugal will also close with the
loss of 400 jobs out of a European workforce of 3,250.
The group wanted 'to concentrate production on high volumes and leading edge
technologies, allowing the optimisation of quality and the creation of
integrated supply chains. The level of investments needed is such that not
all European production sites could benefit,' it said.
Kimberly-Clark, meanwhile, is to cut 312 jobs at a plant near Rouen, one of
its two French plants. About 150 workers will remain at the plant, which
makes paper handkerchiefs, kitchen towels, hygiene products and industrial
rags. The US group is investing FFr80m (Pounds 9.86m) to update the plant,
and concentrate its European production of Kleenex there. No jobs are being
transferred abroad.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Italy to cut discount rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of Italy is to cut its discount rate today from 12 per cent to 11.5
per cent. The move follows publication yesterday of figures showing
inflation last month at 4.3 per cent a year, the lowest in more than five
years.
The discount rate, last cut on December 23, is now down by 3.5 percentage
points from the 15 per cent high during September's currency crisis.
Nevertheless, real interest rates remain high by EC standards.
The January inflation figure compares with 4.8 per cent a year in December
and an average of 5.4 per cent for all of 1992.
The latest fall reflects the effects of recession and the success of
government policies to keep down prices.
Ahead of the rate cut the lira slipped to L1,528.86 from L1,517.18 against
the dollar yesterday and was virtually static against the D-Mark at L930.25,
compared with L930.50, according to the Bank of Italy's indicative rates. In
spite of the lira's fall since floating last September, consumer prices have
not so far shown the effects of higher import prices.
The rate cut had been widely expected and bankers suggested yesterday the
Bank of Italy had merely been awaiting developments in the currency markets
following the UK interest rate cuts last week and the weekend devaluation of
the Irish punt.
The commercial banks meanwhile have been strongly criticised by industry for
retaining high margins and high interest rates despite lower inflation. The
Bank of Italy itself is in the throes of finalising new regulations for
commercial banks, reducing the ratio of deposits to be placed as obligatory
reserves with the central bank.

THE European strategy for developing wide-screen cinema-quality television
risks being overtaken by different technologies and may have to be revised,
according to EC commissioner Mr Martin Bangemann.
The EC's industry commissioner, who now has responsibility for
telecommunications, said the objective of European high-definition
television (HDTV) would not be abandoned, and the Commission would not
renounce its five-year Ecu500m (Pounds 406m) 'action plan' to develop HDTV.
'We can't reinvent the world every day,' he said.
The original objectives of the action plan have been thrown into doubt in
recent months by British opposition to the strategy. The UK believes the
cost of the plan is not justified and that the full HDTV standard backed by
the Commission - known as HD-Mac - could soon be overtaken by digital norms,
which can be used for terrestrial as well as satellite broadcasts.
Mr Bangemann said: 'At this stage we don't see any signs of the UK showing
more flexibility.'
In those circumstances, the Commission might have to revise its strategy,
taking into account that digital technology could become a feasible
alternative to HD-Mac within three to four years.
He suggested a revised action plan might concentrate funds on the
development of wide-screen television equipment, 'flat' television sets with
liquid crystal displays, and the production and conversion of programmes
which could be broadcast in the wide format.
There seems to be a growing realisation even among supporters of the HD-Mac
strategy that further delay will undermine the Commission's original
objectives. This week, Philips, the Dutch equipment manufacturer, said it
would not move to production of HD-Mac television sets unless funding became
available for programmes in the same standard.
Mr Bangemann stressed that he had not yet discussed his ideas with industry
and member states. If he attempts to change the strategy too radically he
will face fierce opposition from the Netherlands and France. They are
solidly behind their manufacturers, Philips and Thomson, both of which have
invested heavily in HD-Mac technology.

<TEXT>
THE German government is to press ahead with draft legislation to implement
its planned solidarity pact for east Germany, after Chancellor Helmut Kohl
failed to reach agreement on sharing the burden yesterday with the premiers
of the 16 federal states.
The battle over how to finance the soaring cost of subsidies to east Germany
has now been postponed to a full-scale conference between the central
government and the federal states, scheduled for March 11 and 12, the two
sides announced last night.
In spite of the recognition that there are profound differences between
them, and the government's insistence that it will now press ahead with its
own plans for a supplementary budget, and longer term spending cuts, there
was relief at the willingness to keep negotiating on an overall agreement.
The need for both the central government and the states to agree on a
comprehensive package of budget cuts in the west, in order to finance
subsidies in the east, was undoubtedly underlined by Mr Helmut Schlesinger,

Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, prime minister of the state of Saxony, in east Germany,
and a Christian Democrat like Mr Kohl, said everyone accepted the need to
agree a package. He said that they were not simply arguing over dividing up
budget cuts, but over a complete new system of public spending in the
country.
The tussle is focused on a budget gap of DM110bn (Pounds 46bn) calculated
for 1995, the year when a new division of taxes, and financial subsidies to
the poorest regions, has to be agreed between central government and the
states in both east and west. Until then, subsidies to the east are being
borne by the German Unity Fund, largely financed by borrowing on the capital
markets.
The new system will then dictate the distribution of funds between east and
west.
The decision to table draft legislation in the cabinet on March 4, the day
after Mr Kohl returns from a trip to the Far East, is influenced by the
government's determination to maintain the pressure on all the parties to
the proposed pact, and not allow it to be delayed by the complex debate over
burden sharing.
There is growing confidence in government circles that a reasonable
compromise can be reached in wage talks with public sector workers, which
reopened in Stuttgart yesterday. A settlement of around 3 per cent, with
inflation still above 4 per cent, would be a great relief to both central
and state governments.

DENMARK will hold its second referendum on the EC Maastricht treaty on May
18, national radio reported, Our Foreign Staff writes.
The date fits in with British government plans for the Maastricht bill's
passage through the Commons. Ministers have reassured Euro-sceptics that the
third reading would not take place until after the Danish referendum. If the
referendum had been delayed beyond May this might have meant holding the
final Commons vote before the Danes' decision was known.

<TEXT>
DENMARK'S central bank yesterday increased a key interest rate as the krone
came under strong pressure on foreign exchange markets.
Central banks intervened at several European centres to support the currency
at its floor against the Irish punt, Dutch guilder and D-Mark.
Pressure on the krone has built up since the Irish punt was devalued within
the ERM last weekend. But Mrs Marianne Jelved, economy minister in Denmark's
new Social Democratic-led administration, said the government would not
waver in its support for the currency.
She warned speculators: 'It will be expensive not to listen to what I am
saying.'
The Danish Nationalbank increased the rate at which it buys certificates of
deposit from the commercial banks from 11.5 to 13 per cent.
The Danish government yesterday presented a set of gloomy forecasts,
predicting higher unemployment, lower growth and a larger budget deficit
than predicted by the outgoing government.
Alice Rawsthorn adds from Paris: The Bank of France made a slight reduction
in the cost of short-term borrowing, cutting the overnight interest rate
from 12 per cent to 11.9375 per cent.
The five- to 10-day rate, suspended last month, has been reintroduced. It
was set at 12 per cent, compared with 10 per cent in January.
The central bank hopes that the commercial banks will interpret yesterday's
slight cut in short-term rates as a signal that they should hold base rates
steady in expectation of further reductions.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Social dumping - hardly an open and shut case: The arguments
about switching jobs between countries are not so simple
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOMSON Consumer Electronics, the state-owned French group, last year
rationalised its European operations by closing its Ferguson television
plant in Gosport, southern England, with the loss of more than 3,000 jobs.
The event scarcely merited a mention at the time on either side of the
Channel. But some British trade unionists are now recalling it, as the
acrimonious dispute over the transfer of work from Hoover's plant in eastern
France to Scotland rumbles on.
This sort of cross-channel sniping reflects how completely relations between
British and French unions have broken down.
But it also illustrates the difficulty facing unions in dealing with the ebb
and flow of jobs across the European Community as a wave of
recession-induced restructuring begins.
Following the British opt-out from the Maastricht social chapter, and the
subsequent devaluation of sterling, many continental European workers and
politicians fear that capital will be sucked into the 'Hong-Kong of Europe'
at their expense.
The propaganda material of Britain's inward investment agencies certainly
stresses the relative freedom of Britain's 'hire and fire' workplace culture
and the relatively low labour costs.
But the reality is that neither the opt-out nor the devaluation were factors
in Hoover's decision to shift some jobs to Scotland.
Britain has always had a relatively unregulated labour market which used to
be qualified by strong trade unions, now considerably weakened. British
wages are also low by EC standards, but the real advantage enjoyed by the UK
is low non-wage labour costs.
These are usually about 15 per cent of wage costs compared with more than 50
per cent in many other EC countries. That is partly because the UK pays for
health care through general taxation while employers have to bear a large
part of health care costs in several continental countries.
This clearly was just one factor in Hoover's decision but it is not
something that the social chapter directly affects.
Mr William Foust, president of Hoover Europe, said yesterday that non-wage
labour costs of only 10 per cent in Scotland, compared with 45 per cent in
France, was a factor in the company's decision. But the decision was also
influenced by the fact that the Scottish plant had spare capacity.
Hoover's decision is unlikely to herald any significant increase in
Britain's comparative advantage. It is based on long-established factors
which Hoover, a particularly footloose US investor in Europe, has often
found attractive in the past.
Britain has always been the most popular destination for new international
investment within the EC (see chart) and that has not changed markedly in
recent years.
Until German car workers started to worry about the Japanese car industry
investing in Britain, new international investment had not been the source
of much tension, and is unlikely to be much of an issue over coming years as
that new investment will not be plentiful.
On 'beggar-my-neighbour' industrial restructuring within the EC, where one
country loses jobs and another gains them, things are more complex.
But as the Thomson Electronics case illustrates, Britain has often lost out
in such restructuring precisely because it is easier and cheaper to close
plants in Britain than in most EC countries.
In the Thomson case at Gosport the average redundancy payment was Pounds
7,000 compared with Pounds 47,000 in Spain. In Holland, Spain, and Germany
agreement on a redundancy package has to be reached with workplace
representatives before closure is allowed.
If, for example, British Leyland Daf decides to keep open its Belgian and
Dutch plants and close only its British plant, as seemed possible yesterday,
that differential cost of redundancy is likely to be a factor.
Britain also loses out from its relatively low skill base and poor
educational standards, one reason behind Ford's decision to switch more of
its R&amp;D work to Germany.
The 'social dumping' theory that capital will flow to areas where labour is
cheapest and least protected, dragging down labour standards elsewhere, has
scarcely materialised in the EC because low wages are usually cancelled out
by low productivity.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Brussels expected to clear Hoover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, has asked the
Brussels civil service to investigate whether Hoover's relocation of jobs
from Dijon in France to Cambuslang in Scotland infringes any EC regulations.
The investigation follows a complaint from France, which the Commission must
examine.
Mr Delors and Mr Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner, are to meet
a delegation of workers from Hoover's Dijon plant in Brussels today, by when
the Commission is expected to have concluded that it has no grounds to act
in the controversy.
While officials in Brussels strongly criticise the fact that Hoover's new
Scottish workers will have no access to pension rights and sickness benefit
for the first two years of their contracts, most contend that the jobs
transfer breaks no rules.
Nevertheless, Mr Delors is expected to use the Hoover case to press hard for
a relaunch of the EC's social action programme, aimed at raising working
conditions and rights, when the new Commission is invested by the European
Parliament next week.
On Monday Mr Delors attacked the practice of 'job-poaching' by the levelling
downwards of workers' rights in order to attract invest ment.
Though he did not mention the UK or the Hoover case, French ministers
meeting in Brussels did. The Commission president is also likely to raise
the case at a European Socialist conference on jobs and growth in Brussels
today.
Aides to Mr Delors say cases such as Hoover are bringing the EC further into
discredit among workers unhappy about the Community's inability to generate
growth and jobs.
One senior French official at the Commission remarked that 'this looks very
bad for Delors in France,' where he is believed still to nurse political
ambitions to succeed President Francois Mitterrand.
The Commission's social affairs directorate was yesterday examining whether
the Hoover deal infringed highly technical clauses in the 1980 insolvency
directive. These relate to adequate protection for workers in the
hypothetical event of insolvency, and in this case focus on Hoover's use of
surpluses in its UK group pension fund to invest in the company.
Officials acknowledge they are going through the motions, since the
existence of the surplus indicates full coverage were Hoover to close.

FT  04 FEB 93 / French promise to make Hoover pay dear: David Buchan in
Dijon discovers why the switching of jobs to Scotland touched such a raw
nerve
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
'IT IS social dumping, and it's shameful,' says a striker, stamping his foot
yesterday outside Hoover's Longvic plant which is to lose most of its jobs
to a more compliant Scottish workforce.
'We've nothing against the Scottish workers, just against Maytag (Hoover's
owner) and the British government for not signing the European Social
Charter,' adds another worker. 'The big lesson of the Hoover affair,' says
Mr Jean-Claude Quentin, secretary general of the local Force Ouvriere trade
union, 'is that social dumping does not necessarily come from south-east
Asia, but from among us Europeans.'
What is social dumping? Mr Richard Rankin, marketing director of Hoover
Europe, says he is not sure. For him, Hoover has simply made a business
decision to stem the red ink on its European operations by shifting all its
vacuum cleaner production to its Cambuslang plant near Glasgow. This will
entail the loss of 650 jobs at Longvic on Dijon's outskirts, but Hoover says
it will save 25 per cent on its costs by having all vacuum cleaners made in
one place.
What is clear to everyone in France, as Mr Rankin ruefully acknowledges, is
that 'we have upset - and provoked a powerful reaction from - the French
government, and we will have to deal with it.'
That is an understatement. Egged on by all political and union leaders, the
French government has asked the European Commission to investigate whether
Hoover was unfairly or illegally bribed with social and financial
concessions, into shifting production to Cambuslang, and made clear that it
will make Hoover pay dear for its decision.
It is not clear whether Hoover will be able to carry out its decision. The
government, for example, says the Hoover redundancies will be among the
first to be affected by the new law sponsored by Mrs Martine Aubry, the
labour minister who is also the daughter of Mr Jacques Delors, the European
Commission president. This law requires employers to produce alternative
employment plans for redundant workers, and that without the approval of the
government, and effectively of the unions, redundancies will be legally
invalid.
Why has the Hoover affair struck such a raw French nerve? It is not just
that unemployment is bumping up against the 3m threshold less than two
months before a general election, or that it is another sign that high
interest rates and a strong exchange rate are killing the French economy.
Other foreign companies are quitting France for lower cost venues, including
the UK, with far less fuss.
What has aroused French fury is the public concessions made by Scottish
workers to win 400 extra jobs at Cambuslang. These include limited period
contracts for new workers, constraints on their right to strike, a freeze on
regular pay this year and cuts in overtime pay rates, flexible working time
and practices and the introduction of video cameras on the factory floor.
To the French, this is a clear case of the competitive undercutting of
worker pay and standards to attract investment, or social dumping as it is
catchily known on the continent.
Not surprisingly, the Hoover management contests this. Mr Rankin says the
company's decision to shift to Scotland was made on its calculation that it
would cut costs by a quarter and that this calculation does not include the
Cambuslang workers' concessions. The other key factor, says Mr Rankin, was
the fact that social charges amount to 40 per cent of the payroll in France
and only 15 per cent in the UK. Actual pay rates in the two countries are
similar, as was the government aid offered.
Why then did Hoover press its Cambuslang workers so hard? 'We have
responsibilities to our customers to produce as efficiently as possible, to
our shareholders to save their money, and to our workforce,' Mr Rankin says.
'You may not think we have exercised this last responsibility in regard to
the Dijon workforce, but we have in regard to Cambuslang and our total 3,600
workforce in Europe.'
But Hoover never sought similar concessions from its French workforce. Why
not? 'The savings were so great in shifting to Cambuslang that the Dijon
workforce would have to have made enormous concession to offset these,' Mr
Rankin says. Hoover would not, in any case, have found the Longvic workers
pliable. Mr Jean-Marie Groscolas, distribution manager at Longvic and leader
of the protesting workforce, says they offered to freeze their pay this
year, but would have flatly refused any other concessions.
Alternative job prospects for the Hoover workers are not promising. The
Burgundy region jobless rate has risen sharply in the last year.
None the less, its prosperity remains well above that of the Glasgow region.
That economic gap explains much of the different attitude of the workers of
Scotland and Burgundy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, yesterday admitted receiving
a FFr1m (Pounds 120,000) interest-free loan from a businessman later charged
with insider dealing. He said he had acted properly.
The incident, unearthed by the satirical newspaper Le Canard Enchane, could
damage Mr Beregovoy's image in the run-up to the March parliamentary
election, though he has acted within the law and limited the impact by
openly acknowledging the loan.
Mr Beregovoy has built a reputation for integrity. He launched a campaign
against political corruption last year, when he tabled an abortive bill to
ban business donations to political parties. His own Socialist grouping
rebelled against the plans, on the grounds that they would leave the party
short of cash, and ensured they were watered down.
Mr Beregovoy told Le Canard Enchane he accepted the loan in September 1986
from the late Mr Roger-Patrice Pelat, to go towards the purchase of a flat
in Paris. He declared the loan to the tax authorities and repaid it in
advance, following Mr Pelat's death in 1989.
Mr Pelat, a friend of President Francois Mitterrand, was charged with
insider dealing in 1988, after making a profit on buying and selling shares
in Triangle Industries before its acquisition by Pechiney, the French
state-owned aluminium and packaging group. Mr Pelat died before a trial
could be held.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government is to press ahead with draft legislation to implement
its planned solidarity pact for east Germany, after Chancellor Helmut Kohl
failed to reach agreement on sharing the burden yesterday with the premiers
of the 16 federal states.
The battle over how to finance the soaring cost of subsidies to east Germany
has now been postponed to a full-scale conference between the central
government and the federal states, scheduled for March 11 and 12, the two
sides announced last night.
In spite of the recognition that there are profound differences between
them, and the government's insistence that it will now press ahead with its
own plans for a supplementary budget, and longer term spending cuts, there
was relief at the willingness to keep negotiating on an overall agreement.
The need for both the central government and the states to agree on a
comprehensive package of budget cuts in the west, in order to finance
subsidies in the east, was undoubtedly underlined by Mr Helmut Schlesinger,
the president of the German Bundesbank, who attended yesterday's talks
between Mr Kohl and the 16 state premiers.
Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, prime minister of the state of Saxony, in east Germany,
and a Christian Democrat such as Mr Kohl, said everyone accepted the need to
agree a package. He said that they were not simply arguing over dividing up
budget cuts, but over a complete new system of public spending in the
country.
The tussle is focused on a budget gap of DM110bn (Pounds 46bn) calculated
for 1995, the year when a new division of taxes, and financial subsidies to
the poorest regions, has to be agreed between central government and the
states in both east and west. Until then, subsidies to the east are being
borne by the German Unity Fund, largely financed by borrowing on the capital
markets.
The new system will then dictate the distribution of funds between east and
west for the foreseeable future.
The decision to table draft legislation in the cabinet on March 4, the day
after Mr Kohl returns from a trip to the Far East, is influenced by the
government's determination to maintain the pressure on all the parties to
the proposed pact, and not allow it to be delayed by the complex debate over
burden sharing.
There is growing confidence in government circles that a reasonable
compromise can be reached in the ongoing wage talks with public sector
workers, which reopened in Stuttgart yesterday. A settlement of around three
per cent, compared with a current inflation rate running still above four
per cent, would be a great relief to both central and state governments.
Arbitration also starts in the east today on the dispute between engineering
workers and employers on long-term wage contracts: the employers are
fighting to delay payment of a 26 per cent pay rise, due on April 1, and
equalisation of eastern and western wages from April, 1994.
Reasonable wage deals on both fronts would be seen as a crucial contribution
to the so-called 'solidarity pact,' in exchange for which the government is
ready to prolong its subsidies of eastern manufacturing industries.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of France yesterday made a slight reduction in the cost of
short-term borrowing  - a sign of growing confidence that pressure on the
franc is abating.
Yesterday's changes include a cut in the overnight interest rate from 12 per
cent to 11.9375 per cent.
The 5 to 10 day rate, suspended last month, has been reintroduced.
It was set at 12 per cent, compared with 10 per cent in January.
The overnight and 5 to 10 day rates are the mechanisms with which the Bank
of France influences money market rates.
When the franc came under pressure in January the bank suspended the 5 to 10
day rate to reduce liquidity in the markets.
However, this also left the French commercial banks, most of which have held
base rates at 10 per cent since mid-December, with higher borrowing costs.
Some of the smaller regional banks have already raised base rates to around
11 per cent. The authorities are increasingly concerned that larger banks
will follow.
The central bank hopes that the commercial banks will interpret yesterday's
slight cut in short-term rates as a signal that they should hold base rates
steady in expectation of further reductions.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Travellers count the cost of pounds in their pockets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH travellers changing pounds at hotels and foreign exchange dealers in
the US and Europe yesterday may wish they had stayed at home, writes Michael
Skapinker, Leisure Industries Correspondent.
Travellers to France who last summer divided French franc prices by 10 to
reach their rough sterling equivalent were yesterday being offered FFr7.73
to the pound at the George V hotel in Paris.
That was for travellers' cheques. Anyone rash enough to visit Paris with
sterling notes would have received FFr7.62 to the pound. That would buy a
bar of chocolate, with a little change, or a double espresso in a boulevard
cafe.
Britons in Germany with recent memories of dividing local prices by three
were in for a similar shock. At the Dom hotel in Cologne, holders of
sterling were being offered DM2.18 to the pound for either cash or
travellers' cheques.
Thomas Cook's bureau de change in Frankfurt was offering DM2.31 for
travellers' cheques and DM2.29 for cash.
But unlike the aftermath of Black Wednesday, when the pound left the
European exchange rate mechanism and some establishments refused to accept
sterling, most hotels said they would exchange pounds at the rates quoted.
Thomas Cook said it always advised British tourists to buy dollar
travellers' cheques before visiting the US as it was often difficult to
change foreign currency there.
UK travellers could get Dollars 1.35 for their pounds at Thomas Cook's
central New York branch, but the company said: 'They're not keen.'

FT  04 FEB 93 / Sterling slides to record lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, JAMES BLITZ and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING FELL yesterday to record lows against the D-Mark, the yen and its
trade weighted index in one of its most turbulent days since leaving the
European exchange rate mechanism in September. It also slipped below eight
French francs before closing slightly firmer.
Senior ministers insisted last night that the government would 'keep its
nerve' in the face of the latest turmoil on the markets. With the collapse
of Daf, the Dutch-based truck manufacturer which has big UK operations,
delivering a further blow to the fragile prospects for economic recovery,
there is no appetite in Downing Street for a rise in interest rates to
stabilise the pound.
But some of Mr John Major's cabinet colleagues acknowledged that an
acceleration in the pound's slide would threaten the credibility of the
government's anti-inflation strategy. If monetary conditions were no longer
consistent with sustained, non-inflationary growth, Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, would have little choice but to increase the cost of borrowing.
Paradoxically, hopes of lower interest rates continued to flourish in the
City following last week's lowering of base rates in spite of government
efforts to damp expectations of further cuts from 6 per cent. Equities moved
higher, with the FT-SE 100 index gaining 1.39 per cent to close at a record
2,873.8, up 39.4.
City economists accused the government of pursuing a policy of 'benign
neglect' and 'glorious indifference' towards the pound. But officials
insisted that the government was monitoring the exchange rate and giving it
full weight in assessing monetary conditions.
Mr Lamont discussed the pound's fall with Mr Major at their regular weekly
meeting and also met Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of
England, for their monthly assessment of UK monetary conditions. In
discussions with aides, Mr Lamont again made clear that he had no plans to
cut interest rates before the Budget on March 16. The latest indications are
that he is also unlikely to cut rates in the wake of the Budget.
In its latest monetary report, which was prepared for the chancellor's
meeting with Mr Leigh-Pemberton, the Treasury noted that sterling had fallen
by 5.5 per cent against its trade weighted index since the middle of
January. It said that so far there were 'few obvious signs of sterling's
depreciation affecting producer output prices or retail prices, apart from
petrol'.
However, the report was completed on Tuesday, before yesterday's slide in
sterling. The pound touched new lows of DM2.355 and Y177.35 in early morning
trading in London.
Sterling closed in London at DM2.36, down 1 1/2 pfennigs on the day, and at
FFr8.0025. It also fell to a 1993 low of Dollars 1.4255 against a strong
dollar before closing in London at Dollars 1.434, down more than a cent on
the day. At one point, sterling fell to a record low of 76.5 on the index.
In New York, sterling closed at Dollars 1.435, at DM2.3606 and at
FFr7.799845.
Turbulence in London was matched in other European centres, where heavy
selling of the Danish krone pushed it to its ERM floor against three
currencies and raised new doubts about the future of the European monetary
system.
In these circumstances, dealers and economists were divided on whether the
pound would extend its fall. Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist of James Capel
&amp; Co, said steady interest rates on the money markets indicated that 'it is
not a classic sterling crisis'.
However, Mr Avinash Persaud, a currency economist at UBS Philips &amp; Drew, was
very pessimistic. 'There is a risk of a vertical fall for sterling,' he
said.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Daf wins Pounds 22m temporary lifeline from bank creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAF'S NINE leading bank creditors yesterday threw a temporary lifeline to
the beleaguered Anglo-Dutch commercial vehicle maker by granting it Fl 60m
(Pounds 22m) in new bank funding.
Daf, which has a workforce of 12,650, was forced to file for protection
against its creditors on Tuesday after running up losses of Fl 800m in the
past three years.
The new bank funds would allow Daf to pay wages and meet other trading
expenses for a month. In that period, the receivers of Daf's European
businesses, operating under UK, Dutch and Belgian insolvency law, will
review the long-term prospects of the company's operations.
Administrative receivers were appointed late yesterday to Daf's main UK
operations, while in the Netherlands strenuous efforts were under way to
salvage the Daf operations.
Dutch government officials met union leaders and provided guarantees that
the Daf payroll would still be met for the coming month. The government
would act as a short-term financier in the unexpected event that the bank
consortium, led by ABN Amro, failed to provide the bridging finance.
It is understood that an attempt is being made to create a new company in
the Benelux countries, which could include Daf's present medium and heavy
truck production units based there. It is unclear if any of the UK
operations would be included.
Mr Koos Andriessen, Dutch economic affairs minister, said he believed Daf
could survive in a concentrated form but warned of painful job cuts.
A spokesman for Mr Luc Van den Brande, who heads the Flemish regional
authority, said the receivers were considering liquidating the old company
and regrouping its heavy and medium truck activities in a new business.
Other plans were also being considered.
The Dutch administrators, Mr Louis Detering, of Eindhoven, and Mr Friso
Meeter, of Rotterdam, were unavailable for comment.
In the UK, Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop, two partners at
accountants Arthur Andersen in London, were appointed administrative
receivers to the three principal UK subsidiaries of Daf. The company has a
workforce of about 5,500 in the UK, mainly in Leyland and Chorley,
Lancashire, Birmingham, Thame and Glasgow.
Mr Talbot said trading would continue in the companies and he hoped to
develop a strategy to ensure the survival of the businesses and their sale
as going concerns. He would not comment on the prospects for employees, but
said his staff would be working closely with both management and unions. Mr
Talbot's appointment covers Leyland Daf, Leyland Daf Holdings and Leyland
Trucks. It does not cover Leyland Daf Finance.
A management buy-out of the Leyland truck plant in Lancashire was proposed
yesterday by Mr Ian McKinnon, a former manufacturing head of Leyland Trucks,
who led a buy-out of Leyland Bus in 1987 and sold it to Volvo the next year.
The surprise provision of new bank funds came from a banking syndicate led
by the Dutch bank ABN Amro and included Rabobank of the Netherlands,
Generale de Banque of Belgium, Credit Lyonnais of France and three UK banks,
Barclays, Lloyds and National Westminster. NatWest has taken charge from ABN
Amro of the process of co-ordinating bank creditors in the UK.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, said on BBC radio
yesterday: 'The government stands ready to work closely with Leyland DAF,
the receivers, the banks and other interested parties to mitigate as far as
possible the impact on UK jobs.' But he said the government would not offer
a loan to subsidise losses.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, has written to Mr Martin
Bangemann, EC commissioner for industrial affairs, urging him to intervene.
He asked the commissioner to bring together the three member countries
involved to find a common approach to save Daf.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Major hints at work-related unemployment benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night held out the prospect of workfare-style schemes for
the unemployed and hinted at a review of the benefits system as part of a
re-examination of spending priorities.
In a wide-ranging speech on his personal vision of Conservatism, the prime
minister also warned of government action on road pricing and police reform.
Mr Major said he was questioning whether paying unemployment benefit
'without offering or requiring any activity in return' served either society
or the jobless well.
Referring to the Restart training programme that removes benefits from
non-attenders, he said: 'I believe we should explore ways of extending it
further.'
Mr Greville Janner, Labour chairman of the cross-party employment select
committee, last night wrote to Mr Major asking if he was merely 'kite
flying' ideas for a workfare-style programme and, if not, to give evidence
to the committee on his proposals.
Labour signalled its opposition to such a programme. Mr Donald Dewar, social
security spokesman, said the unemployed should be given the incentive and
opportunity to earn their keep, not punished for the misfortune of being
unemployed.
Mr Major promised a re-examination of long-term expenditure trends, and
reaffirmed the goals of sound public finance, lower personal taxation, firm
control of inflation and 'a rigorous approach to public expenditure'.
In a reference interpreted as signalling a fresh look at benefits, he added:
'It is always dangerously easy for the state to settle into habits of
spending which outlast their purpose and outrun their budgets.'
He said it was the Conservatives' task in the 1990s to break down class
barriers, raise the status of vocational qualifications and expand choice in
schools.
He also argued for respect for individual achievement and the gradual
evolution of traditional political institutions from the monarchy and
parliament to churches and voluntary organisations. As an example of this
need for evolutionary change, the honours system should be reformed to
stress merit. 'It is time to get rid of old, class-based distinctions,' he
said.
His words suggested that he plans to pre-empt the Labour party, which is
engaged in a fundamental re-evaluation of its policies on tax and benefits,
including those for the unemployed.
Other policy developments signalled in the speech included reforms to
teacher training, custodial sentences for persistent young offenders,
further deregulation and government help for business by means of opening
doors to markets.
A party aide said the latter aim was to bolster trade initiatives through
government-to-government contacts such as last week's prime ministerial tour
in India and the Gulf.
His speech, at the Carlton Club in London, was firmly placed in the context
of updating party thinking to address issues of the 1990s. It attempted to
yoke Disraeli's concept of 'one nation' Toryism with warnings of the dangers
of big government to support Mr Major's goal of building a classless society
of responsible individuals and 'a nation at ease with itself'.
Mr Major said the paradox Conservative politicians had to face was that
change was essential to preserve the best aspects of society. He stressed
that the era of deference was 'out of date, damaging and divisive'.

FT  04 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES of a cut in interest rates in both the UK and Germany, along with
speculation that Denmark and France may leave the ERM, helped reverse
Tuesday's decline in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
But for a brief decline in the first 15 minutes of trading, the March
contract on the FT-SE which opened at 2,839, moved ahead on the interest
rate hopes and talk of the ERM withdrawals, pulling the underlying cash
market sharply forward.
Buying at the higher levels was seen throughout the day and was further
boosted by a strong Wall Street and March finished at 2,889, a jump of 52 on
the previous day's close and at a 17-point premium to the underlying cash
market. Turnover was a reasonable 9,735 contracts by the close.
In traded options, turnover improved on Tuesday's levels to reach 31,794
lots against 25,119. The FT-SE 100 option saw business of 11,877 trades.
Among stock options, it was Hanson that led the league table. It had traded
2,064 contracts by the close. It was followed by Thorn EMI with turnover
raeching 1,301 lots. Bid speculation in TSB ensured that the options had a
busy day. Some 1,187 lots were dealt in TSB with the June 180 calls the
busiest series with a total of 700 lots.
Glaxo which traded 1,184 contracts and British Aerospace in which 1,101 lots
were dealt were also busy.

FT  04 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Revived rate hopes bring new peaks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURMOIL in European currencies provided the driving forces behind a powerful
advance to new highs in the UK equity market yesterday. Share prices
extended their gains in the second half of the session when rumours
circulated that the Bundesbank might succumb to pressures from other ERM
counties and cut rates by a full point this morning. A cut in German rates
would open the way for further reductions in UK base rates, analysts
believe.
The FT-SE Index gained 39.4, breaking through previous intra-day and closing
peaks for a final reading of 2,873.8. Heavy volume across the full range of
equities also took the FT-SE Mid 250 Index to a new high of 3,023.6, up 28.3
on the day. London was encouraged at the close by widespread gains on Wall
Street as it began its new trading session.
The fall in sterling to new lows against the mark, French franc and the yen,
quickly drove shares in Britain's leading export groups ahead. Sterling was
also perceived to be signalling expectations of another cut in UK base
rates, the stock market electing to discard the rejection of such plans
issued by Downing Street at the beginning of the week.
The combination of a further effective devaluation of sterling with more
interest rate reductions proved to be a strong stimulant for equities. The
advance was checked briefly following news of an annualised increase of 4.1
per cent in M-0 domestic money supply last month, but found renewed strength
later as attention turned to the ERM currency pressures.
Trading volume remained high, but the Seaq total of 851m shares compared
with 854.7m in the previous session. However, with the attention swinging
back to the blue chip export-led international stocks, the proportion of
non-Footsie shares traded fell to 56 per cent yesterday from around 63 per
cent earlier this week. Retail business remained high on Tuesday, returning
a value total of Pounds 1.5bn.
Yesterday's upswing in the stock market was led by strong gains in
interest-related stocks, with property shares again extending the recovery
prompted by the renewed optimism on base rates. Banks, where loan books
would benefit if doubtful debtors are helped by lower interest rates, also
strengthened and insurances also stood out.
Market strategists sounded almost helpless in the face of the market's
renewed strength but agreed that the FT-SE could easily challenge 2,900 very
soon  - unless the mood changes. Fears that depressed sterling may soon show
through in the form of higher prices for imported goods were expressed.
The stock market is now trading on a multiple of around 18 times existing
earnings. But Mr Roger Palmer of Kleinwort Benson Securities pointed to
higher earning expectations for 1994 which would bring ratings down to
around 12.8. 'London still looks the most attractive of all the major
markets,' he said.
The excitement generated during the second half of the session brought
spectacular gains among the financial stocks. Dealers were cautious
regarding some of the more speculative reasons put forward for gains in the
sector.
Oil shares rounded off a strong session with further gains on the back of
the strong opening on Wall Street.

FT  04 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Bid talk lifts TSB to record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER wave of takeover speculation drove TSB shares to a record high
yesterday as dealers reported exceptionally heavy turnover in both the
stockmarket and the options market, where it was the fourth heaviest traded
stock.
At the close, TSB shares were 7 higher at 177p with turnover of 15m among
the highest daily totals recorded in the stock since its October 1986 market
debut.
Yesterday's market rumours suggested a number of potential predators for the
bank. Lloyds, always mentioned as a potential bidder when takeover stories
develop in the bank sector, was seen as a possible bidder, as was Credit
Lyonnais, the French bank and Germany's Commerzbank. Bayerische Vereinsbank
was also mentioned.
While not dismissing takeover possibilities, many bank specialists viewed
the stories with suspicion. 'TSB is a recovery stock but the short term
outlook remains poor,' said one. Another suspected that much of the recent
interest represented little more than income funds buying for the dividend;
the stock goes ex the 3.25p dividend on February 15.
ICI adrift
US drug pricing worries and technical factors combined to depress ICI
shares, which were also hit by an element of profit-taking following a rise
of more than 100p since Christmas. They closed a net 16 off at 1134p.
Initially analysts said US investment bank Goldman Sachs was trying to sell
4m ICI shares as part of a big programme trade. Goldman was unavailable for
comment.
Later, there was a reaction to reports that a US congressional hearing was
expected to list ICI as one of seven drug companies that have broken public
promises to hold price increases below the rate of inflation in 1992.
However, ICI's US pharmaceuticals unit said yesterday that it would limit
1993 price increases on all of its products to a maximum of 4 per cent.
Some UK sector specialists were surprised at the strong performance of Glaxo
in the light of the US worries. However, the recent shift in currency had
left the New York equivalent of the shares worth about 635p on Tuesday night
and the relative cheapness prompted very heavy US buying. Glaxo rose 10 to
665p with heavy turnover of 10m shares.
Hanson sought
Conglomerate Hanson moved forward 5 1/2 to 262 1/2 p on exceptionally heavy
volume of 14m shares, with one international equities dealer arguing that
the stock had broken through a barrier and would now have a clear run to
270p. US analysts like the company for its yield and some UK houses,
including Natwest Securities, prefer the group to rival BTR. Many believe
that the diminishing attractions of a large cash pile at a time of low
interest rates makes it very likely that Hanson will do something with its
famed Pounds 8bn 'war chest' within the next month or so.
BTR, which is viewed as a prime rights issue candidate, was marked up
sharply at the close as a sizeable buyer entered the market. The shares
ended the day 14 higher at 566p.
Retail tax worry
Press comment on the possibility of VAT being levied on foodstuffs in the UK
kept food retailers under a cloud. While many analysts believe the move to
be too politically sensitive, and also the worst alternative to taxing such
items as books and children's clothes, the possibility has not been entirely
dismissed  - as yesterday's underperformances showed. Among the fallers,
Argyll Group lost 5 to 383p, J Sainsbury 4 to 578p and Tesco 4 to 257p.
Food manufacturers fared little better as a heavy tome from Nomura advised
investors to go underweight in the sector in the wake of imminent margin
pressure. Only Unilever escaped the house's negative stance, the shares
advancing 17 to 1148p. Bucking the trend were Booker which lifted 12 to 433p
as Kleinwort Benson reaffirmed its positive stance, Tate and Lyle, up 8 to
414p as UBS Phillips and Drew said buy and Unigate, ahead 9 at 325p on
speculative buying.
Bank shares continued their recent outstanding performance, with the FT
Actuaries banks sector up 2.9 per cent compared with the Footsie 100's 1.4
per cent gain. The prospect of further cuts in interest rates, recovery in
the UK economy and an end to free banking were said to have driven the
sector higher, although some analysts warned that prices had run too far too
fast. 'There is a genuine worry that once the results season is over the
shares will disappoint,' said another analyst.
The weakness of sterling was behind the strong rise in HSBC, which rose 19
to 577p. Barclays added 20 to 459p, Lloyds recovered from an uneasy opening
to close 6 better at 560p and NatWest jumped 19 to 581p. Royal Bank of
Scotland edged up 4 to 249p, still responding to the recent visit by
analysts to the group's Direct Line insurance operation. Reports of an
imminent flotation of the business were viewed as wide of the mark.
The absence of much-rumoured rights issues saw composite insurances race
ahead with the sector index moving up 3.4 per cent. Commercial Union, the
only composite expected to record a profit for 1992, jumped 17 to 624p. Sun
Alliance added 14 to 346p.
Speciality chemicals group Laporte fell 5 to 649p ahead of an announcement
that it had gained 78.3 per cent of glue manufacturer Evode and its
recommended offer for the company was unconditional. Evode shares were a
penny weaker at 133p.
In a buoyant drinks sector, Guinness surged 18 to 475p helped by the rumour
that France was to leave the ERM. The group has a 24 per cent cross-holding
in the French luxury goods company LVMH. UK interest rate cut hopes aided
Bass and Whitbread, which jumped 14 to 604p and 11 to 467p respectively.
Grand Metropolitan rose 5 to 440p as Kleinwort Benson reiterated its buy
stance.
Rank Organisation shrugged off worries over the new accounting procedures
and added 12 at 720p. Presentations to institutions in Scotland helped Thorn
EMI gain 19 to 844p. A large line of stock overhung Ladbroke most of the day
and the shares closed 2 adrift at 203p.
Shares in British Aerospace moved sharply ahead after a tentative start on
speculation that the company was about to announce an order for Hawk jets
from Oman. Early weakness in BAe was due to the financial collapse of Dutch
commercial vehicle maker DAF in which it holds a 16 per cent stake.
Having shaken off the early gloom, sentiment was further lifted by the
return of talk in some circles that GEC would launch a bid for BAe. Shares
in BAe closed 13 up at 287p in trade of 6.5m, while GEC moved 9 ahead to
301p with volume reaching 11m.
Truck maker ERF Holdings was seen as a beneficiary of the demise of DAF and
the shares jumped 26 to 231p. Specialist engineer Trinity Holdings which
came to the market in October 1992 at 120p, was also said to be another
beneficiary of the collapse. The shares gained 11 to to 183p.
Triplex Lloyd eased 2 to 171p, after the company announced a Pounds 17.3m
rights issue.
United Newspapers lifted 6 to 529p as SG Warburg reaffirmed its positive
view, believing the worries over a VAT charge being imposed on newspapers
has been discounted and that United will be helped by its US exposure.
Reuters Holdings to benefit from a Goldman Sachs recommendation. The shares
recovered 23 to 1427p.

FT  04 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Good company results give
equities a lift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
A COMBINATION of strong corporate results, the successful completion of
Chrysler's huge share offering on Tuesday, and firmer stock-index futures,
provided US stock markets with a big lift yesterday, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 45.12 at 3,373.79,
near its highs for the day. The more broadly-based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended
4.63 higher at 447.19, a new record, while the Amex composite finished up
2.71 at 414.89, and the Nasdaq composite 3.53 firmer at 708.65. Trading
volume on the NYSE was heavy at 345m shares.
There was no single factor behind yesterday's big gains. The markets,
however, were delighted at the way Chrysler's Dollars 1.78bn stock sale went
on Tuesday. Strong demand from investors pushed up the price of the offering
late in the day, allowing the carmaker to issue more shares, making it the
second largest public stock offering in US history. The decision by
Standard&amp;Poor's, the big ratings agency, to upgrade its ratings on
Chrysler's debt yesterday also boosted sentiment.
Other factors driving prices higher were more strong fourth quarter
earnings, notably from Salomon and Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing, higher
bond prices, and demand for stock-index futures in the Chicago derivatives
markets. The economic background was also positive, with the string of
recent bullish data pointing to solid growth. in 1993.
Chrysler was the most heavily traded stock, with more than 15m shares
changing hands following Tuesday's offering. At the close the stock was up
Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 38 7/8 , slightly higher than the price at which the
46m new shares were sold.
Salomon jumped Dollars 3 to Dollars 40, a 52-week high, after reporting
fourth quarter profits of Dollars 143m, a big turnaround from the Dollars
29m loss incurred at the same stage of 1991.
Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 100 3/4
after the company announced fourth quarter net income of Dollars 289m, up
from Dollars 259m a year ago. Although the latest figures were affected by
one-off gains, charges and writedowns, the special factors cancelled each
other out.
JC Penney jumped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 77 in busy trading after Mr Wayne
Hood, an analyst with the broking house Prudential Securities, upgraded his
recommendation on the retailer's stock from 'hold' to 'buy'.
In the Nasdaq market, lesser-known stocks lifted the composite index to
record levels. Jimbo's Jumbos rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 6 1/4 after
Chock Full O'Nuts agreed to sell its 73 per cent stake for Dollars 7 a
share.
Canada
TORONTO share prices closed higher in heavy trading, following the trend set
in most major world markets.
The 300 composite index gained 22.20 points, or 0.67 per cent to 3,344.03.
Advances led declines 379 to 273, volume of 51.79m shares compared with
46.51m on Tuesday, and trading value was CDollars 440.1m comapred with
CDollars 379.4m.

FT  04 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo rises ahead of
land auction result

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE PRICES surged on expectations of today's discount rate cut, but the
Nikkei average lost most of the gains on profit-taking to close marginally
higher, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average ended 35.72 ahead at 17,222.03. The index, which dipped
to the day's low of 17,214.21 in the morning session, shot up to a high of
17,419.18 on reports of a possible 0.75 percentage point cut in the discount
rate this week.
Volume rose to 340m shares from 244m and gains led declines by 651 to 309,
with 187 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose
5.79 to 1,307.60, its seventh consecutive rise. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50
index fell 0.76 to 1,062.8.
Prices remained firm for much of the session on speculation of a rate cut
from 3.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent, which would match the all-time low seen
during the so-called 'bubble boom' from 1987 to 1989. On the money market,
rates on three-month certificates of deposit fell to a record low of 3.25
per cent, although profit taking took the yield on the 10 year No 145
benchmark bond up by 6 basis points to 4.34 per cent.
Equity investors took profits after the intraday rise. Valuations for the
current market, with the Nikkei at an price-earnings ratio of 55, are also
regarded as too expensive by some investors.
Some leading banks were higher on hopes of larger profit margins after a
discount rate cut. Short covering also helped to boost prices. Industrial
Bank of Japan rose Y10 to Y2,430 and Sakura Bank gained Y10 to Y1,200.
Kyocera expanded the previous day's losses, falling Y50 to Y4,310. Concerns
over a lawsuit filed by IBM of the US against Kyocera's use of its software
programs depressed sentiment. Isuzu Motors was the most active issue of the
day, rising Y8 to Y380.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 104.04 to 18,673.09 in volume of 43.4m
shares.
Roundup
Political considerations weighed on a number of the region's markets.
HONG KONG closed higher, although business slowed to a crawl in afternoon
trading. Investors were awaiting the results of a government land auction
which produced record prices, but came after hours.
The Hang Seng index finished 48.27 ahead at 5,710.80 in turnover of
HKDollars 1.6bn. Shares derived early strength from the view that Governor
Chris Patten's medical treatment could take some of the heat out of the
Sino-British row over the territory's political future, at least for the
time being.
AUSTRALIA was restrained by uncertainty over the date and outcome of the
federal elections; the All Ordinaries index was unchanged at 1,530.2 in
turnover up from ADollars 193m to ADollars 238m.
Coles Myer - outdone in sales growth for the first half by its rival
retailer, Woolworths - fell 5 cents to ADollars 4.50. Nine Network Australia
shed 11 cents to ADollars 2.65, concerned that it might soon face
competition from cable television.
SINGAPORE turned lower. The Straits Times Industrial index fell 8.29 to
1,637.59 in volume of 139.52m shares after setting record highs on three
consecutive days. SEOUL picked up after late intervention by institutional
investors and the composite index firmed 12.16 to 678.34.
KUALA LUMPUR was broadly higher after an uncertain start, extending
Tuesday's gains. The composite index rose 10.86 to 639.24. JAKARTA was led
up by the banking sector as the composite index rose 10.86 to 639.24.
BANGKOK saw selective buying in some big banks and properties take the SET
index 5.46 higher to 975.26.
TAIWAN rose for the fourth straight day in a rally sparked by an easing of
political tensions after Premier Hau Pei-tsun announced he would resign. The
weighted index, which was up about 50 points at one stage, closed 11.10
ahead at 3,553.36.

FT  04 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Buenos Aires eases back after
rollercoaster ride - Prospects for Argentine equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA was never going to be a smooth ride, but even hard bitten players
of the developing world's equity markets have had an uncomfortable time over
the last few months.
After crashing 48 per cent in the second half of 1992, and then recovering
strongly through until mid-January, the market has seen its upward surge
peter out. Yesterday the Merval index closed at 413.38, 3 per cent down
since the beginning of the year.
Brokers, eternal optimists, say that this will be the year when Buenos Aires
finally breaks with its speculative past and starts growing into a mature
capital market. Although they have been saying this for a long time, and
even though Argentines still play the market as if it were a casino, as long
as Argentina's free market reforms remain on track its equity markets will
probably remain attractive.
Mr Eduardo Tapia, director general of Baring Securities Argentina SA, doubts
that there much chance of a repeat of the 1991 boom which drove prices up by
372 per cent, because investors' funds, resources and new share issues
waiting to hit the market will cancel each other out. 'There will not be a
boom,' says Mr Tapia, 'but a positive trend all along the year.'
This hypothesis has its weaknesses. Argentine shares are not exactly cheap.
Baring's forecasts indicate a price earnings ratio of 13.1 for the market
this year, against 16.9 for 1992. On the other side of the coin, there is no
underestimating Argentines' herd instinct. On Friday, within minutes of the
government announcing new measures deregulating financing markets, share
prices began rising, to close 9 per cent up in the day.
Argentines account for two-thirds of market turnover. As soon as they notice
foreigners entering the market in force, which is widely believed to signal
a change in market fortunes, they too frantically pile in and push prices to
unsustainable levels.
This situation could lead to a sharp downward correction which would shake
the market, deflect capital from Argentina and discourage new companies from
entering the market. About three dozen new companies are in the pipeline for
a market debut at the moment.
The greatest fear of all surrounds President Carlos Menem's determination to
amend the constitution, which bans re-election of incumbents, and so stand
for re-election when his term ends in 1995. To do so, he must sweep
congressional elections slated for this autumn and win two-thirds of the
seats in the lower house of Congress.
Investors worry that Mr Menem will slacken his reforms to win the elections.
Alternatively, defeat could fatally damage his authority. Any sign of
political compromise or weakness could lead to a massive capital outflow,
further undermining confidence.
Pessimists point to the government's failure to win passage through Congress
of key labour and social security reforms. Trade unions, which still retain
considerable influence, are successfully resisting both measures, which
would reduce companies' costs and create a private pension fund system, the
basis of any modern stock market.
Disquiet over Mr Menem's future is likely to grow in the second half, as
election day approaches and as the overheated economy, which the government
says grew 9 per cent in 1992, settles down to growth of about 3-4 per cent.
But analysts say that this scenario should not be overrated. The
government's credibility is based on maintaining the pace of reform.
Devaluation of the overvalued peso is also ruled out for political reasons
and because Argentina's big companies - traditionally, powerful supporters
of a cheap peso - have taken on heavy hard currency debts.
Companies that restructure are going to be OK', says Mr Christopher
Ecclestone, equities analyst at the Buenos Aires brokers Elizalde &amp; Cia.
Argentina's big companies are undoubtedly embarked on a 'dramatic reform
process', he says, but he warns local investors, in particular, not to hold
their breath. Argentina set out two years ago on a road that took 20 years
to bear fruit in Chile, and 10 years in Mexico.

FT  04 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Funny money prospects intrigue
Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospect of funny money extending into more European equity markets
excited dealers in some bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
However, international observers noted that the thrill of it all seemed
largely absent in Dublin, three days after the Irish devaluation took place.
PARIS rose by 2.1 per cent on talk of a franc devaluation. In spite of deep
scepticism among traders, the CAC 40 index closed 36.83 higher at 1,824.14,
featuring gains in shares with large US operations or dollar earnings.
Michelin moved against the trend on talk of earnings downgrades, although
BNP denied that it had cut its earnings forecasts for the tyremaker. The
shares fell FFr3 to FFr184.10. Among a general rise in blue chips, oils
extended their gains on the strong dollar with Elf FFr14.80 higher at
FFr347.80 and Total FFr5.10 better at FFr231.50.
NatWest Securities observed yesterday that the market had underperformed its
European counterparts, although it had posted a rise since its low last
October. NatWest forecast a 15 per cent appreciation in Paris over the next
twelve months.
DUBLIN's ISEQ overall index fell 19.62, or 1.5 per cent to 1,324.44.
FRANKFURT majored on the prospect of a restrained wage round in West
Germany, the DAX index closing 18.44 higher at 1,601.53, its strongest
finish since August last year.
There was renewed speculation about interest rates although Mr Reinhard
Fischer of Paribas Capital Markets thought that the Bundesbank would adopt
'salami tactics', with interest rate cuts coming in very thin slices this
year.
Turnover climbed from DM5bn to DM6.6bn, the recently resurgent Siemens by
far the most active stock in DM1.34bn as it rose another DM8.30 to DM614.80.
However, there was bigger share price upside in construction and retailing,
regarded as recently underperforming sectors with earnings potential. Gains
were led by Hochtief and Holzmann, up DM45 and DM37 to DM1,023 and DM888
respectively, and by Kaufhof, DM15 better at DM426.
AMSTERDAM saw Daf marked down to FL 1.65  - 64 per cent below Monday's Fl
4.55 close  - as the shares resumed trading in the unofficial sector of the
bourse. By the close, the price had picked up to Fl 1.80.
Overall the bourse was mixed with the CBS Tendency index down 1.2 at 96.8.
Daf's problems again depressed its creditors. ABN Amro, estimated to have
lent Fl 1.25bn to the truckmaker, dipped 40 cents to Fl 51.30; ING, which
has a 10.6 per cent Daf holding, shed 10 cents in early trading but picked
up to end unchanged at Fl 58.40.
Reports that Fokker was seeking a Fl 1bn loan from the Nationale
Investeringsbank, in case Deutsche Aerospace abandons its takeover plans,
left the Dutch aircraft maker Fl 3.30 lower at Fl 10.20.
Nedlloyd, the transport company, fell Fl 2.50 to Fl 26.30 after rumours,
denied by the company, that its banks were halting its credit lines.
KLM fell Fl 1.90 amid concern over results due today.
MILAN was mixed with domestic investors dominating trading. The Comit index
edged 0.51 lower to 490.99.
A generally bullish trend in much of the industrial sector passed Olivetti
by as the share fell L64 lire to L1,899 following Tuesday's confirmation
from Mr Carlo De Benedetti, its chairman, of a 1992 operating loss of
L300bn-L350bn.
Montedison fixed unchanged but rose to L1,220 after-hours and its parent
Ferruzzi Finanziaria was L55 ahead at L1,205 on renewed speculation that it
was planning to sell its Farmitalia Carlo Erba subsidiary to Kabi Pharmacia,
the pharmaceutical arm of Sweden's Procordia which refused to comment.
STOCKHOLM turned lower as the white goods maker, Electrolux, said that it
plans to halve its 1992 dividend, leaving investors concerned that other
companies could follow suit. Electrolux B shed SKr13 to SKr212 on the
dividend cut and the Affarsvarlden index fell 6.0 to 902.6.
Volvo B was the day's most heavily traded issue, falling SKr5 to SKr375 in
turnover of SKr124m, partly on concern about possible US import tariffs on
cars.
Ericsson moved in the opposite direction, adding SKr2 to SKr177 as it
announced a new SKr1.2bn defence contract. Procordia rose SKr3 to SKr175.
ZURICH had a mixed day and the SMI index rose 1.9 to 2,120.6. SBC bearers
rose SFr7 to SFr337 in response to the Tuesday's announcement that had
lifted parent company net profit and planned to switch its certificates into
bearer shares and to split the registered shares.
MADRID rose strongly in active trade, supported by strong foreign buying.
The general index closed 2.42 higher at 236.40, a new high for the year.
Volume was strong, although down from Tuesday's Pta26.6bn at around Pta19bn.
Telefonica was highly active as it hit an intraday record high of Pta1,360
before subsiding to Pta1,330, up Pta15. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) also
attracted overseas fund managers, impressed with its fourth quarter
earnings. BBV shares rose Pta100 to Pta2,860.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Sudden return to turbulence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURES inside the European exchange rate mechanism intensified yesterday
after the Danish krone fell to its floors against 3 of the system's
currencies in a sharp burst of speculative selling, writes James Blitz.
The comparative calm that followed the devaluation of the Irish punt was
rudely shattered as the krone became the sixth currency in the ERM to be
threatened with devaluation.
The krone had spent the first two days of this week on its ERM floor against
the Irish punt. Yesterday, in the most turbulent day on the foreign
exchanges since the autumn currency crisis, the Danish currency fell to its
floors against the Dutch guilder and the D-Mark, despite a rise in Danish
interest rates and heavy central bank intervention.
After ERM trading closed yesterday, the krone was trading at DKr3.8954 to
the D-Mark, narrowly above its ERM floor of DKr3.9016.
The outlook for the Danish currency looked grim last night, partly because
Danish investors had sold their currency in large quantities, a sign of
acute currency weakness.
The Belgian franc's fall to third from bottom of the ERM grid also indicated
how serious tensions in the ERM have suddenly become.
The Belgian currency's fortunes are closely linked to the D-Mark's. But
yesterday, 3 month Belgian francs were trading about 20 basis points above
3-month D-Marks, a sign that investors may be looking for a premium against
the break-up of the ERM.
The pound dropped to historic new lows against the D-Mark and the Japanese
yen in European trading. It closed in London at DM2.3600, down 1 1/2
pfennigs on the day and at FFr8.0025 against the French franc.
The pound also slumped during the day to a new 1993 low of Dollars 1.4255
against a dollar which itself reached a 9-month high against the D-Mark. The
pound closed in London at Dollars 1.4340, down more than a cent on the day.
Yesterday's selling of the pound appeared to be short-term interbank
speculation rather than investment fund selling.
Mr Mark Austin of Midland Global Markets said that sales had been
'sporadic.' 'I would be surprised to see the pound go down from here in the
near term,' he added.
Mr Avinash Persaud, a currency economist at UBS Philips and Drew, was
extremely pessimistic about the pound because money market dealers have
already discounted a 100 basis point cut in base rates by the summer.
The fall, he said, could only be explained by a loss of confidence in the
government's strategy and a belief that it was pursuing a policy of 'benign
neglect.' towards the exchange rate.
'There is a risk of a vertical fall for sterling which would have a very
serious impact on financial markets,' he said.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Money Markets: Still looking for a cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS in the sterling money market assumed that the prospects of another
UK rate cut before the March budget were diminishing after the pound fell to
historic new lows against the D-Mark yesterday morning, writes James Blitz.
The UK authorities announced that they would be closely monitoring
sterling's exchange rate as the currency fell to a historic new low on its
trade weighted index.
The implication was that the currency's fall could be of sufficient concern
to ward off another rate cut in the next few months.
However, far from assuming that there would be no more rate cuts, dealers
simply took the view that the cut to 5 per cent was more likely in the
summer rather than the spring.
The March short sterling contract fell 9 basis points to a low of 94.21,
before closing at 94.30. At this level, it assumes that 3-month money at
budget time will be at 5.70 per cent.
The September short sterling contract rose 5 basis points to close at 94.80.
At this level, it assumes 3-month money will be at 5.20 per cent by the
autumn, a level that is clearly compatible with 5 per cent base rates.
The shape of the futures yield curve indicates that rates should rise after
September. However, the curve in the sterling cash market continued to
decline down to about 5 3/4 per cent for 1 year money.
Dealers in European interest rate markets were more overtly concerned about
currency tensions inside the European exchange rate mechanism.
One-month French francs touched 13 per cent as the Danish krone fell to its
floor against the D-Mark. The March French franc contract fell 24 basis
points from its opening level to close at 88.50.
The Bundesbank was slightly more generous than had been expected in its
weekly repo, accepting a lowest bid of 8.57 per cent.
But neither this, nor the absence of concrete news on the public sector wage
talks in Germany, indicated what the Bundesbank will do at its council
meeting today on rates.
Any bullishness was founded on the idea that pressures in the exchange rate
mechanism made a cut in official rates more likely at today's council
meeting to restore calm.
The March Euromark contract closed up 5 basis points at 92.14.

<TEXT>
MR VIKTOR Khlystun, Russia's agriculture minister, said yesterday the state
would need to spend far more than the Rbs160bn (Pounds 185m) announced last
week in extra subsidies to help farmers feed the country.
If the ailing budget could not be stretched any further, Mr Khlystun
proposed levying a 3 per cent tax on the profits of enterprises in other
sectors of the beleaguered economy to raise money for agriculture, which
remains dominated by state and collective farms.
Mr Khlystun said Rbs600bn was needed just to help peasants meet fuel and
equipment bills so they could get on with sowing. That was because much of
their revenue existed only on paper because they were still owed money by
other debt-burdened enterprises.
He said the problems were particularly acute in milk and meat production,
which had fallen by 18 per cent last year, compared with a general decline
in agricultural output of 8 per cent.
He said he would propose a more effective mechanism for distributing
subsidies in a couple of months. 'If you produce better quality meat for
instance, you will get a higher subsidy,' he told a news conference. His
ultimate goal was to shift subsidies from producers to consumers but he said
that would not be possible until the country developed a social welfare
system capable of distributing subsidies to the worst off in society.
Agriculture has been severely affected by a 'scissors crisis' under which
the price of finished goods, including agricultural equipment, had risen
more sharply than prices paid to peasants.
Before last week's package, initially estimated to cost Rbs160bn, Russia's
budget deficit for 1993 has been projected at Rbs3.5 trillion (million
million), the amount the government sees as the limit for lowering it to 5
per cent of gross domestic product from unofficial estimates of 10 to 15 per
cent last year.
Mr Khlystun said government farm subsidies, expected to reach Rbs430bn in
the first half of this year, would 'not be significantly higher' than the
Rbs128bn promised and paid for the whole of 1992, if inflation was taken
into account.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Options pit move lifts Fox
coffee trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING VOLUME in robusta coffee futures and options contracts has soared at
London Fox since its new options pit was opened at the end of last year.
Mr Robin Woodhead, who took over as chief executive of the troubled exchange
in October last year, said yesterday that he was extremely pleased with the
increase in volumes, which had followed positive action by the exchange.
Coffee options turnover hit a record 28,666 lots for January, the first full
month of trading in the new pit. This marked a 63 per cent rise on December
 -itself a record month. Trading in the underlying futures contract, which
was only 63,000 lots last November, reached 112,524 lots in January.
Cocoa options also showed strong growth, trading 11,925 lots in January, the
best month since March 1991. Cocoa futures traded 142,178 lots, up from a
figure of 83,515 in December and 136,737 in November.
The options pit was moved to a position in between the coffee and cocoa
futures markets on December 14, and a wall between the two markets was
removed. 'We believe the relocation has resulted in a significant increase
in both options and underlying futures trading,' said Mr Woodhead.
The London Fox chief executive plans to focus on increasing business in the
core contracts at the exchange, which was in the doldrums for more than a
year after a scandal in its now defunct property futures market.
The exchange has just received 'a detailed and exhaustive study' of the
sugar market from Landell Mills, the commodity consultants. Mr Woodhead said
that the exchange hoped to make a decision on the future of its raw sugar
market by the end of March.
The contract, which has switched from floor trading to screen trading and
back over the past couple of years, has on some days registered no volume.
The International Petroleum Exchange yesterday approved the extension of the
forward trading range on its gas oil contract - widely used by airlines to
hedge jet fuel prices - from nine months to 18 months as from March 12. The
IPE said the move was made in response to demands from industry users.

of up to 5%

WEST GERMAN agricultural profits are set to decline by up to 5 per cent this
year despite a modest recovery last year, the German government said
yesterday in its annual agricultural report.
Average agricultural profits rose by 4.3 per cent to DM47,721 (Pounds
20,000) per agricultural enterprise in the year ending June 1992. The rise
was mainly a reflection of the higher prices of items such as pigmeat and
milk and partly offset the 16 per cent plunge in farm income recorded the
previous year.
However, the agricultural ministry expects this year's profits to fall by up
to 5 per cent again due to a general decline of agricultural prices and last
year's drought.
The German Bauernverband, the farmers' union, called the forecast
over-optimistic and said farm revenues were likely to decline by between 5
and 10 per cent in 1993.
Mr Gunther Bredehorn, agricultural policy spokesman for the government
coalition Free Democrats party, added that West Germany's agricultural
revenues were also likely to be further affected by the government's plan to
reduce direct income subsidies to farmers.
According to the plan, farm subsidies should be reduced for three years by
DM360m a year, starting in 1993. The proposal is part of the Solidarity Pact
which is currently being debated and aims to force government, industry and
trade unions into finding ways to finance recovery in the eastern part of
the country.
Output statistics are not yet available for the farm sector in the former
East Germany, which has virtually collapsed since unification. As far as
farm jobs were concerned, the number of full-time agricultural workers
dropped from 312,000 in 1991 to 174,000 last year.
The number of agricultural enterprises in the east increased last year as
large formerly state-owned farms are being restructured, with over 18,000
agricultural enterprises now registered there. Of these, 41.6 per cent
consists of farms between one and 10 hectares. In the West, the number of
agricultural enterprises continued to decline, dropping in 1992 by 2.8 per
cent to 582,000.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Knives out for UK potato scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT MINISTERS are determined to sweep away the UK's present potato
marketing scheme, despite this week's setbacks to the necessary legislation.
The reverse came when a cross-party alliance of peers twice voted against
the government's advice in the Lords on Tuesday night, backing first a move
to protect the scheme ahead of an impending European Community declaration
and then an amendment requiring a poll of registered producers before the
Potato Marketing Board could apply for approval of a successor scheme.
Ministers believe there is scope for common promotion and research and
development within the industry, but are convinced they should move swiftly
to end the current marketing regime.
Their resolve has been hardened by this week's cabinet deregulation seminar,
chaired by prime minister John Major, in which ending the present scheme was
among the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food's main contributions.
This week's developments come ten weeks after the PMB's future was called
into question by the emergence of proposals for a lightweight Ecu1.5m
(Pounds 1.2m) EC potato regime aimed at harmonising the different mechanisms
applied in member states in the run-up to the Single European Market.
Though final decisions on how to deal with the issues on which the
government was defeated have not yet been reached, the priority for
ministers is expected to be removing the new requirement for a producers'
poll.
It is understood the government might accept some restriction on the timing
of the end of the regime, which is dependent on EC decisions.
The government's commitment to changing the scheme, which it holds
responsible for rising imports of processed potato products, has been
underlined by Mr David Curry, the agriculture minister, in the face of
concerted cross-party opposition from MPs with potato-growing constituents.
It would be sacrificing the interests of UK potato farmers 'if we agreed a
scheme in which everyone in the Community could plant what they wanted. . .
but the United Kingdom alone was pegged back by acreage quotas,' Mr Curry
argued.
But Mr Bill Walker, Tory MP for Tayside North where 46 per cent of the
Scottish potato crop is grown, has warned that if the present scheme were
scrapped, 'the probability is that. . . farmers will be forced into
cereals'.
Low prices have led to substantial PMB intervention in the market this year,
increasing the strength of many farmers' allegiance to the existing regime.

St Lucia's banana exports to Britain last year reached 133,000 tonnes, 2,100

writes Canute James in Kingston. The island is the largest producer in the
Windward group of the eastern Caribbean, and its earnings from exports last
year were USDollars 68.1m, some Dollars 10m more than 1991'. Mr Elijah
Marquis, chairman of the St Lucia Banana Growers Association, said earnings
would have been higher but for the devaluation of sterling.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Israeli citrus growers given
state aid after exports fall 36%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S parliamentary finance committee has approved Dollars 25m in
emergency state aid to the country's citrus industry, which has been hit
this season by a 36 per cent fall in exports caused by a damaging
combination of low yields at home and depressed prices abroad.
Traditionally the star in Israel's legendary 'blooming desert' agricultural
industry, the reality for the citrus sector in recent years has been a story
of declining export earnings as inputs such as water grew in price while
growers failed to keep pace with demand for popular high-value 'easy peeler'
and sweeter varieties.
This season, yields have been slashed by prolonged spells of cold weather
during the blossoming late last winter. Production of shamouti oranges, the
standard variety that with grapefruits makes up the majority of Israeli
output, is down by around 30 per cent, according to growers.
At the same time, prices have slumped in European markets, the main
destination for Israeli fruit. Mr Menashe Davidson, chief executive of the
Mehadrin Group, Israel's biggest exporter, said the price of fresh fruit had
fallen by some 15 per cent while the price for juice concentrate had tumbled
by a third compared with last year to less than USDollars 1,000 a tonne.
Initial reports showed fresh fruit exports up to the end of January, the
height of the harvest, totalled 8.2m boxes, compared with 12.9m at the same
stage last year. Mr Davidson estimated Israeli exports for the whole season
would total 250,000 tonnes, compared with 320,000 last year. About 45 per
cent of output goes for export as fresh fruit, 45 per cent goes as
concentrate and the remainder to the local market.
Mr Davidson said Israeli products had been undercut by low-priced orange and
grapefruit concentrates coming from Brazil and Florida, while sales of
deciduous fruits such as apples had increased sharply in Europe, cutting
into demand for fresh citrus products. He said Israeli producers had also
suffered from the weakening of the UK and Scandinavian currencies, two of
their chief markets.
Over the past decade, the annual value of citrus exports to Israel has
fallen from about Dollars 250m to less than Dollars 150m in some years. In
the same period, industrial exports (excluding diamonds) have grown to about
Dollars 8bn a year.
But the ministry of agriculture says the citrus industry still accounts for
40,000 jobs in total and needs the Dollars 25m state aid to help it weather
a temporary crisis.
Officials acknowledge that part of the problem is structural. The proportion
of citrus exports made up of higher-value, more water-efficient modern
varieties has grown rapidly in recent years to more than a third of the
total, but progress has not been fast enough to blunt competition from
countries such as Morocco and Spain.
Some of this season's difficulties are attributed to the squeeze imposed on
less efficient growers by the liberalisation of export marketing last
season, which removed the shelter of fixed prices for producers imposed by
the old monopoly Citrus Marketing Board.
But Mr Davidson rejects hardline critics who argue that Israel should cut
back hard on an industry that they say in effect exports subsidised water,
which Israel cannot afford. 'What we have to do is be more efficient and
produce better products. We can do it,' he says.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: North Sea storms halve
Norwegian crude oil output

<TEXT>
NORWEGIAN North Sea crude oil production was cut by half yesterday as raging
storms forced the closure of the Statfjord and Snorre fields, and sharply
cut output from the Gullfaks field, said Statoil, the Norwegian state oil
company.
Norway normally produces a daily average of 2.3m barrels of oil but
extremely high waves prevented crude tankers from loading oil from buoys at
Statfjord and from Gullfaks as storage capacity had reached its limits at
the two fields.
Statfjord also stores oil from the 100,000 barrel-a-day Snorre field.
Gullfaks was producing just 15,000 barrels yesterday, compared with its
normal daily output of 491,000 barrels.
A Statoil spokesman said the weather forecast did not bode well for the
resumption of full production until at least Friday, when crude oil tankers
might be able to commence loading if waves subside to 4.5 metres or less. He
said that storms had created the worst conditions in 20 years for offshore
crude oil loading by tankers.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: No extra money to ease EC
reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community's new agriculture commissioner, Mr Rene Steichen,
warned yesterday there would be no extra money to meet the wish-lists of
European farm organisations in the wake of last year's reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy.
Mr Steichen was presenting price proposals for the coming farming year,
which were approved by the European Commission yesterday after barely 15
minutes of procedural discussion.
This unaccustomed speed was because the prices of the main commodities were
predetermined by last year's reform of the CAP, which embodies heavy price
cuts over the next three years, for which farmers will be compensated in
direct income payments. Most products outside the reform will have their
prices rolled over from last year.
The CAP will cost some Ecu35.1bn (Pounds 29m) this year, up over Ecus3bn,
and Mr Steichen warned that 'room for manoeuvre as far as additional demands
are concerned is virtually non-existent'.
He cited the cost of financing the reform, and a tighter farm spending
ceiling because of lower-than-expected EC growth, as two reasons for fiscal
stringency. But he also implicitly blamed EC farm ministers for overriding
commission recommendations and retaining the costly 'switchover' mechanism.
This gives price increases to most farmers each time an EC currency is
devalued, leading to price rises of over 20 per cent in the past six years.
After the last six months of currency turbulence, the commission estimates
that 'switchover' will cost Ecus1.15bn this year and Ecus1.55bn in 1994.
Yesterday's message was particularly unwelcome in Paris. The French
government, facing defeat in next month's general assembly elections, was
hoping for additional concessions for its farmers to sugar the pill of the
CAP reform, and the controversial cuts in subsidised exports the EC will
have to make under the Uruguay Round world trade liberalisation negotiations
if these are concluded this year.
Copa, the EC big farm lobby, denounced the price proposals as 'an additional
burden on European farmers'.
Price cuts under the CAP reform will fall most heavily on cereals, which
commission officials say could come down by as much as 22 per cent on this
year's market, on their way to a reduction of about a third over three
years. This cut is supposed to be distributed more evenly over the three
years, but adjustments to the intervention regime and changing standards
between different types of grain will reduce prices faster, officials say.
The main battleground when farm ministers meet here next week is likely to
be the proposed reduction in the milk quota. This should be of 2 per cent
spread over 1993-94, but is controversial because Italy, which produces an
illicit 2.5m tonnes over its quota, is likely to get an extra 900,000 tonnes
provided it reduces the rest.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After minor fluctuations around the 500 cents mark for the AWC market
indicator since sales were resumed in Australia, there was a more definite
decline on Tuesday. This took the indicator down by 10 cents and established
a new low for the 1992-93 season, 488c/kg. Withdrawals by growers were
heavier, approaching 20pc at the two centres. Sterling weakness has obvious
relevance to UK users of imported wool and prices have been advanced, but
business, whether home trade or export, is poor enough to make even these
increases difficult to establish.

GOLD came under pressure on the London bullion market, slipping below
Dollars 329 a troy ounce in thin trading. Support was expected around
Dollars 328  - 'but if there's no recovery from here then it might put
itself under pressure,' said one dealer. A break through Dollars 328 could
take the price down to around Dollars 325. London COCOA finished near the
day's lows, but held above support at Pounds 723 for May. Losses were
largely driven by bearish sentiment on charts, particularly in New York,
although London was underpinned by continued sterling weakness. London's
robusta COFFEE largely recouped earlier losses by the close, boosted by a
resumption of this week's upward trend in New York. The market mood had
become much more constructive in the last few days, dealers said. COPPER
continued to encounter difficulty in making upside headway on the LME. But a
steady undertone emanated from escalating violence in Zaire and the Mexican
copper refinery strike, dealers said.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: Danish bonds tumble as currency pressures
resurface
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DANISH government bonds tumbled yesterday as the Danish currency came under
heavy selling pressure, reigniting the tensions within the European exchange
rate mechanism.
The Danish central bank raised the rate on its repurchase operations from
11.5 per cent to 13 per cent in order to defend the krone, and several
European central banks intervened in the foreign exchange markets to help
support the currency and prevent a devaluation.
Denmark's economy minister ruled out a devaluation of the krone, saying it
would be defended at all costs against increasing attacks from currency
speculators.
THE German government bond market ended higher on the day, buoyed by hopes
that the public sector unions would agree to a low wage increase this week,
allowing the Bundesbank to ease rates.
Dealers noted strong demand for medium-dated paper, which led to a
steepening of the yield curve. The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened
at 93.26, moved up to a high of 93.38 before ending at around 93.35.
FRENCH government bonds closed higher, even though the currency came under
pressure again and money-market rates remained relatively high.
The Bank of France announced yesterday it had reopened its 5-10 day lending
facility - which was suspended on January 5 - offering funds at 12 per cent
for five-day periods. The yield on the 8 per cent bond due 2003 moved from
7.84 per cent to 7.80 per cent.
Elsewhere in Europe, Dutch government bonds rallied on news that the Dutch
finance ministry plans to allow open-market trading in stripped components
of publicly-issued 30-year government bonds.
UK government bonds closed slightly higher after a volatile day in which the
market shrugged off sterling's weakness in the foreign exchange markets.
Dealers noted some foreign interest in gilts, suggesting that overseas
investors think sterling may be close to its low and expect to see an
appreciation in sterling assets.
The Bank of England said two of its tap stocks had been exhausted yesterday.
JAPANESE government bond prices fell sharply yesterday as investors sold
futures ahead of the interest rate cut announced early today. The bond
market had been anticipating the Bank of Japan's decision to cut the
Official Discount Rate by 75 basis points to 2.5 per cent. Hopes of a cut
pushed rates on three-month certificates of deposit to a record low of 3.25
per cent, down from 3.43 per cent.
The Japanese government bond market climbed to a five-year high earlier this
week and the prospect of a rate cut prompted investors to take profits
yesterday.
The futures contract fell half a point from 109.73 to end at 109.24, the low
of the day. The yield on the benchmark No 145 opened at 4.3 per cent and
closed at 4.355 per cent, just off the low price of the day.
US Treasury prices yesterday firmed at the long end after the Treasury - as
some investors had hoped - announced it was cutting the size of the long
bond issue in next week's refunding auctions.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/16 at 104
7/8 , yielding 7.218 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was up  1/32 at 100, to yield 4.233 per cent.
There was much speculation recently over whether the Treasury would change
the refunding mix by cutting the size of the long bond issue (and increasing
the amount of shorter-dated securities sold accordingly) in order to reduce
the cost of financing the budget deficit.
That speculation proved on target and prices gained further ground at the
long end after the Treasury announced that for its latest refunding round,
it was cutting the amount of its 30-year bond issue from Dollars 10.25bn to
Dollars 9.25bn. The Treasury also said it would study the possibility of
further changes in the borrowing mix at a later date.

THE Shanghai Stock Exchange may attempt to unify with the Shenzhen Stock
Exchange, AP-DJ reports from Hong Kong.
China's official Xinhua news agency quoted the Shanghai exchange president,
Mr Wei Wenyuan, as saying he would 'enhance links' with the Shenzhen stock
market. He suggested that a joint computer system would expand the business
of both markets and erase some problems for investors.
Currently, the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets operate independently and under
different rules. Shanghai operators have previously indicated an interest in
bridging co-operation with Shanghai.
Shanghai's transaction volume hit a record Yn23.95bn (Dollars 3.99bn) in
January and was 18 times above January 1991's level. Last year, turnover in
Shanghai was Yn64.8bn, seven times higher than the year earlier.
The first initial public offer this year of a company on the Shenzhen bourse
has been planned for listing this month.
The simultaneous launch for both the domestic and foreign markets of Chiwan
Harbour shares will be internationally lead-managed by Standard Chartered
Asia and domestically by China Merchant Bank Securities.
The issue will raise a total of between Yn200m and Yn250m.
Standard Chartered and China Development Finance will underwrite the offer.

FT  04 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: EIB completes shelf
registration for yen issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Investment Bank yesterday completed the first shelf
registration for yen-denominated bonds, potentially lowering its borrowing
costs in future by shortening the time it takes to launch yen issues.
The arrangement, which is intended to cover all of the bank's expected yen
borrowing this year of more than Y200bn (Dollars 1.6bn), will make it
possible for the EIB to seek bids from underwriters and then launch a yen
issue on the same day, an official said.
The process takes two days at present, due to the need to obtain Ministry of
Finance approval for the lead-managers and co-managers to the issue.
The bank has now obtained the Japanese authorities' permission to use any
managers selected from a pre-notified list of some 50 to 60 banks, doing
away with the need for specific authorisation for each issue.
The shorter time between inviting bids and choosing underwriters should
prompt banks to submit more competitive bids, the EIB official said. 'If
counter-parties are on risk for less time, it should lead to finer pricing,'
he said. The official added the relationship between yields in the Japanese
government bond, Euroyen and swap markets worked in a less predictable way
than in some other currencies, and that this added to the costs when banks
or the EIB wanted to hedge any Euroyen position. This further discouraged
banks from submitting the tightest possible bids.
The shelf-registration, arranged by Nikko Europe, covers an initial Y250bn
of bonds. Last year, the EIB raised around Y200bn in the Euroyen market,
making it the second-largest borrower behind the World Bank.
The agreement also follows the recent trend for borrowers to reduce their
issuing costs by standardising the documentation of their Eurobond and
medium-term note issues. The EIB's arrangement is expected to reduce the
fees on each individual transaction from around Pounds 30,000 to some Pounds
10,000.

FT  04 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Sterling reverse FRNs prove popular
with institutional investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was a rush of sterling reverse floating-rate notes totalling Pounds
300m yesterday as issuers tapped the current demand for instruments which
will allow investors to benefit from falling UK interest rates.
Syndicate managers said they were the first sterling reverse FRNs to be
underwritten in the public domain.
The paper proved popular with institutional investors who believe that
sterling interest rates are set to fall further this year.
All three issues are believed to have been swapped, leaving the issuers with
a normal floating-rate liability.
Goldman Sachs kicked off with a three-year Pounds 100m issue for Abbey
National, the UK bank, which was snapped up quickly. It was followed by the
Halifax Building Society, the largest UK mortgage lender, which raised a
similar amount via UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. In the early afternoon, Goldman
arranged a further deal for Eksportfinans, the Norwegian import-export
agency.
The basic terms on the three deals were virtually identical. Each was priced
at par, with the first coupon fixed at 7 per cent for the first six months.
Thereafter, the semi-annual coupon will be fixed at 12.375 per cent minus
six-month Libor.
Mr Jonathan Nicholls, director, corporate finance and capital markets at
Abbey National, said that yesterday's issue followed the bank's strategy of
having a mix of medium-term notes and that the structure lent itself well to
this maturity.
Syndicate managers said there was a limit to how much more paper could be
issued in the near term because the swaps transactions linked to yesterday's
deals had resulted in less favourable conditions in the swaps market.
However, they did not rule out further issues, or variations on yesterday's
structure, in view of the healthy demand from investors.
The current climate prompted Bayerische Vereinsbank to re-open its Dollars
100m collared 10-year FRN, issued early in January, and raise a further
Dollars 75m.
Elsewhere, the European Investment Bank (EIB) issued DM500m with a 6.625 per
cent coupon and priced at 101.10. The five-year issue was described as
tightly priced and was trading at 99.43/48 late in the day to yield 6.75 per
cent, just outside the fees.
The stream of Canadian dollar deals continued yesterday. The CDollars 125m,
10-year offer from the city of Montreal and CDollars 300m three-year paper
from Export Development Corp were both said to be aggressively priced with
respect to comparable Canadian government bonds, and distribution was
reportedly slow.
Syndicate managers said much of the recent Canadian dollar paper remained
unplaced and that spreads had widened as a result.
For example, the spread on Credit Foncier de France's CDollars 200m deal
launched last Friday was now at 53 basis points, compared with an initial
45.

FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Behind Paris's marriage of money
and chic - Alice Rawsthorn examines the merger between Yves Saint-Laurent
and Elf-Sanofi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE opulent Salon Imperial at the Inter-Continental Hotel in Paris resounded
with applause last week when Mr Yves Saint-Laurent, one of France's most
famous fashion designers, mounted the stage for a standing ovation at the
end of his haute couture show.
Mr Saint-Laurent has been showing couture in Paris for more than 30 years,
but last week's collection was special. It was his last as an independent
designer before YSL, his company, merges with Elf-Sanofi, the
pharmaceuticals and cosmetics arm of Elf-Aquitaine, the flagship French oil
group.
YSL has struck a complex share swap agreement whereby its perfumes will be
taken over by Elf-Sanofi, but the fashion business will continue to be run
by Mr Pierre Berge, who co-founded the company with Mr Saint-Laurent.
At first glance, the deal makes sense for both parties. Elf-Sanofi has been
expanding in perfume to augment its pharmaceutical interests. It now has a
portfolio of brands, including Nina Ricci and Fendi, which provide FFr3.2bn
(Dollars 581m) of its FFr19bn annual sales.
But Elf needs to increase its perfume portfolio, preferably with a
prestigious brand, if it is to continue to compete for distribution in the
increasingly consolidated retail sector against powerful players such as
L'Oreal and LVMH of France as well as Estee Lauder of the US.
YSL has the prestige that Elf lacks. Its scents, including Opium and Rive
Gauche, represent roughly FFr2.5bn of its FFr3bn annual sales. It also needs
new inward investment. The growth of the big groups, such as L'Oreal and
LVMH, has raised the stakes in fashion and beauty. It now costs up to
Dollars 50m to promote a new perfume worldwide. This is imposing intense
financial pressure on independents, like YSL, which barely broke even in the
first half of last year.
In theory, last week's deal should give YSL and Elf what they want  - money
and chic, respectively. In practice, though, things might prove more
difficult.
The challenge for Elf is to launch new YSL fragrances. It has the necessary
financial resources, but has taken on YSL at a difficult time. The French
fashion designers have seen sales fall by 20 per cent in real terms from
their 1990 peak to FFr4.3bn in last year. The global beauty market has been
relatively static for two years.
Elf also has the problem that, although YSL is still prestigious, it is
these days less obviously in the forefront of fashion. Mr Saint-Laurent's
era as an innovator is rooted in the 1970s, when his most successful scents,
Rive Gauche and Opium, came out. His classic style, beloved of haute
bourgeoise Parisiennes, is not always in step with the informal fashions of
the 1990s. This may make the YSL name less marketable for Elf when it tries
to launch new perfumes in the future.
There is also the question of what will happen after Mr Saint-Laurent, now
56 with a history of poor health, retires. Elf might be able to revive YSL
under a new designer, as Chanel has done with Mr Karl Lagerfeld. But other
houses have found the transition more difficult, notably Balmain and Lanvin,
which have experienced a series of design and management changes.
These difficulties are aggravated by the prospects for YSL's personnel
within the Elf empire. Mr Saint-Laurent is seen as unpredictable even in the
histrionic Paris fashion world. Mr Berge is called Pierre le Panthere in
French business circles for his autocratic style. Until now, they have been
free to run their company exactly as they wished.
What occurred in the Scherrer house shows how difficult it can be for
fashion entrepreneurs to adjust to a more buttoned-down corporate life. Mr
Jean-Louis Scherrer, the founder, stormed out before Christmas after a row
with its new owners and the house is now mired in legal suits.
Mr Berge insists there is no possibility of that scenario recurring at YSL.
Even so, the spectre of Scherrer provided an ominous backdrop to Mr
Saint-Laurent's last independent couture show.

SEARS Canada, one of the two biggest Canadian retail groups, lost CDollars
91m (USDollars 72m), or CDollars 1.04 a share, in 1992 on sales 3 per cent
lower at CDollars 4bn.
Last year's Christmas shopping season was disappointing, Sears said. In
1991, it lost CDollars 29m. The latest period included CDollars 46m in
restructuring charges.
Retailers can now open on Sundays in Ontario and Quebec. Over the past 15
months the Canadian dollar has fallen 12 per cent against the US dollar. Mr
Joseph Reddington, Sears president, said these factors had reduced the flow
of Canadians crossing the border to shop in the US.
Sears Canada has closed two catalogue distribution centres. Birks, the
Canadian jewellery chain will get a cash infusion from Italy's Borgosesia
group. It will keep 38 stores open, having closed 73 stores last year when
it sought bankruptcy protection.

FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Mercedes Benz invests DM800m on
research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERCEDES-BENZ, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, is to invest
DM800m (Dollars 490m) to build a new technical centre in Germany for the
development of future car models.
The research and development centre will play a crucial role in the German
carmaker's plans, announced last week, to transform its strategic product
policy.
During the 1990s, it wants to change from being a traditional maker of
exclusive luxury cars into an 'exclusive full-line manufacturer offering
high-quality vehicles in all segments of the market'.
Mr Dieter Zetsche, Mercedes-Benz director for car development, said that the
company planned to concentrate all new vehicle design, development and
engineering operations at only two locations, instead of the present 18
sites in south-west Germany.
The new technical centre will be built at Sindelfingen in south-west
Germany, near Mercedes-Benz's main domestic car assembly plant. It is
planned to begin operations in 1996 and will have a workforce of around
4,500.
The design and development of engines and transmissions will be concentrated
at the group's Unterturkheim plant in Stuttgart.
The carmaker's plans for the new technical centre are a belated recognition
that it has fallen behind its rivals in the efficiency of its development
and engineering operations.
BMW, its rival German luxury car maker, opened an integrated DM1.1bn
research and engineering centre in Munich at the end of 1989.

MINNESOTA Mining &amp; Manufacturing yesterday reported increased fourth-quarter
earnings of Dollars 289m, or Dollars 1.32 per share, up 11.5 per cent from
Dollars 259m, or Dollars 1.18 per share, in the same 1991 quarter. The
company said strong domestic volume helped boost fourth-quarter results,
with its industrial and consumer sectors showing gains.
US sales volume gained 8 per cent, while international volume was up 6 per
cent. In dollar terms, worldwide sales were Dollars 3.375bn, up from Dollars
3.224bn in the same period last year. Mr L. D. DeSimone, chairman, said the
quarter's earnings were limited by economic weakness abroad.
For the year, earnings were Dollars 1.23bn, or Dollars 5.63 per share, up
6.8 per cent from Dollars 1.15bn, or Dollars 5.26, in 1991, on sales of
Dollars 13.9bn, up from Dollars 13.3bn in 1991. The latest full-year results
include a charge of Dollars 3m, or 2 cents per a share, for required
accounting changes.

FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Italians return to loans market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN borrowers are returning to the international syndicated loans market
after an absence of several months.
So far, a handful of medium and long-term credit institutions has tapped the
loans market with relatively small deals, but bankers expect several more
financial institutions and some corporate names to seek international
syndicated credits over the next six months because of their relatively
heavy borrowing needs.
While the cost to Italian borrowers of raising money from international
banks is in some cases higher than in early 1992, bankers believe that as
more Italian names return to the market, pricing on Italian deals should
start to edge lower.
Italian borrowers have been virtually barred from the syndicated loans
market since last July when Efim, the state industrial holding group, went
into liquidation. Italian and foreign banks are owed L9,500bn (Dollars
6.22bn).
Initially, the Treasury proposed to repay the Efim loans using bonds with
below-market interest rates, in a deal which was resisted by the banks. The
Treasury has now agreed to repayment in full, although international banks
are still waiting for their money.
The Efim debacle meant that few international banks were willing to lend to
Italian names  - which have traditionally been frequent users of the
Euromarkets  - in the second half of last year.
However, now that some bankers are satisfied that the problems concerning
Efim will be resolved, Italian borrowers are eagerly seeking funds in the
international syndicated loans market.
Some of the deals launched in the last few weeks have been quite generously
priced, bankers said, in order to woo back lenders. For example,
Meliorconsorzio launched a DM37m seven-year loan paying a margin of 75 basis
points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor) and participation fees
of 30 basis points for DM4m amounts.
One of the banks involved said that, as this was one of the first
'post-Efim' Italian deals to be launched, the deal carried a slight premium,
and reflected the market's perception of the borrower's creditworthiness.
The deal was successfully syndicated with the amount increased to DM57m.
More tightly priced was Monte dei Paschi di Siena's loan, originally set at
Ecu 50m but raised to Ecu 110m. Bankers appeared content with the margin of
52.5-57.5 basis points over Libor and the maturity of 10 1/2 years, despite
initial concern that the terms might prove too tight.
Since the completion of these deals, other Italian names have come to the
market. Mediocredito Lombardo, a medium-term credit institution, has
launched a Dollars 50m, two-year loan paying 35 basis points over Libor,
which lead manager Sumitomo has said may be increased to Dollars 100m.
Other borrowers include Credito Fondiario e Industriale, which has launched
a five-year Ecu100m loan priced at 65 basis points over Libor with
participation fees of between 22.5-37.5 basis points, and Istituto Nazionale
per il Credito Edilizio, a medium-term mortgage institution.

FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Rustenburg falls 65.5% on lower
metals prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSTENBURG Platinum Holdings, the world's biggest platinum producer,
yesterday reported half-year results well below analysts' expectations.
Pre-tax profit fell by 65.5 per cent to R168.7m (Dollars 54.54m), earnings
per share were down 49.8 per cent to 87.9 cents, and the dividend is to be
cut by 28.5 per cent to 62.5 cents a share.
Mr Barry Davison, managing director, said the second-half performance would
depend on metals prices. Present prices for all the metals produced by
Rustenburg, except palladium, were below those of the first half and could
not be expected to rise until there was a substantial improvement in the
world economy.
Asked about the potential sale of 38.4 per cent of Johnson Matthey of the
UK, the sole marketing organisation for precious metals produced by
Rustenburg, by Charter Consolidated, the UK conglomerate, Mr Davison said
his company had been in touch with both companies 'and we are happy with
what is going on.'
He said that neither Rustenburg nor any of the other platinum companies
managed by Johannesburg Consolidated Investment were directly involved in
the negotiations about the JM stake.
Mr Davison noted that the half-year dividend would be covered 1.4 times by
earnings, 'which is a lower cover than has formerly been the case at the
interim stage.' But Rustenburg was not changing its dividend policy and it
was unlikely that cover for the full-year would drop below 1.4 times.
Gross sales for the six months to December 31 slipped by 5.8 per cent to
R1.413bn, mainly because of a 34 per cent drop in the rhodium metal price,
compared with the same period of 1991, and a 15 per cent fall in nickel
prices.
Capital expenditure for the period was R176.9m, down from R240m, and
included R34.8m (R109.3m) for expansion projects.

property development site on the Kowloon Peninsula in an auction held by the
Hong Kong government.
World won the bid for the 1.7m sq ft site in Diamond Hill in the face of
competition from all of the colony's leading property developers, including
Cheung Kong, New World Development and Sun Hung Kai Properties.
The deal is to be shared evenly between three of World's listed companies  -
World International, Wharf Holdings, and Hong Kong Realty and Trust.
Mr John Hung, director of Wharf, said the group would 'create the only mega
purpose-built retail centre under one roof in that region'.
It plans to build retail and residential property on the site.

FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Time Warner files plan to raise
Dollars 1.5bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIME WARNER, the leading US media and entertainment group, yesterday offered
fresh evidence of its aggressive move to reduce the cost of debt and
preferred stock dividends when it said it had filed a shelf registration
with the Securities and Exchange Commission to raise up to Dollars 1.5bn.
Over the past few weeks, Time Warner has raised Dollars 3.5bn in debentures
and spent the proceeds repurchasing the Series D preferred stock which was
issued after Time and Warner Communications agreed to merge in 1989.
Some Dollars 3.1bn of Series C preferred stock remains outstanding, and Time
Warner said yesterday it planned to use the next Dollars 1.5bn it raises to
redeem some of these securities.
The Series C and D stock in 1991 cost Time Warner a total of Dollars 579m in
dividend payments, dragging the company into loss despite healthy operating
earnings.
The debentures being issued to replace the Series C and D preferred stock
have maturities ranging from five to 40 years. Analysts believe Time
Warner's financial strategy will eventually shift from redeeming preferred
stock to the disposal of non-strategic assets in order to raise funds to
reduce bank debt.

TRENCOR, the Cape-based transport and trading company, is to gain control of
W&amp;A, a diversified South African consumer and industrial group, through a
capital injection of R350m (Dollars 113.6m).
The deal brings together two of South Africa's largest companies not
controlled by the country's big mining houses or financial institutions.
The two groups yesterday announced that companies in the W&amp;A group -
comprising FS group, FSI corporation, Waicor and W&amp;A - would launch rights
offers to raise at least R500m.
Trencor would invest R350m by underwriting the offers and taking up rights.
Trencor and a management consortium led by its controlling shareholder, Mr
Jeff Liebesman, will exercise joint control of W&amp;A at board and executive
levels and will appoint an executive chairman.
Trencor, which has a market capitalisation of about R2.7bn, is one of the
most highly-rated stocks on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange with a
price/earnings ratio of 21.
W&amp;A, with a market capitalisation of about R210m and a p/e ratio of 3.3, has
long had a poor rating.

FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Joss takes the hot seat at
Westpac - The problems facing the bank's new chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTPAC Banking Corporation, the troubled Australian bank, has a rule that
only the chairman can be questioned by shareholders at its annual meeting.
It is a convention that will be welcomed by Mr Robert Joss, the Californian
banker appointed last week to Westpac's vacant chief executive's chair.
Mr Joss, a vice-chairman of Wells Fargo, the San Francisco-based regional
bank, was not present at Westpac's vitriolic annual meeting, which ended
last week after more than 16 argumentative hours spread over two days. But
after studying Westpac over several weeks, he will know for certain what
many shareholders already suspect: that things are likely to get worse
before they get better.
Mr John Uhrig, the no-nonsense miner who took over as chairman of Westpac in
October, gave much the same message to shareholders at the annual meeting,
warning that it would be 'unwise to assume that we will not have to contend
with further setbacks.'
Westpac shareholders have become all too familiar with bad news over the
last year as the bank has been hit by a catalogue of disasters which reads
like the script for a banker's nightmare.
The year started with bad publicity about risky foreign currency loans and
embarrassing leaked letters; it continued with a failed ADollars 1.2bn
rights issue; and it ended with net losses of ADollars 1.5bn (USDollars
810.3m) for the year to September, after writing off bad debts of ADollars
2.6bn.
Five directors quit in October, including Sir Eric Neal, chairman, followed
in December by Mr Frank Conroy, chief executive, after a boardroom row over
his recovery plan. Meanwhile, Mr Kerry Packer and an associate joined the
board after acquiring 10 per cent of the shares, and promptly walked out of
their first board meeting after another row.
Mr Joss, who will inherit the mess when he arrives in Sydney later this
month, will be uncomfortably aware of the giant shadows cast over Westpac by
the enigmatic Mr Packer and the AMP Society, Australia's biggest financial
institution, which owns 15 per cent of the bank.
Both Mr Packer and Mr Ian Salmon, managing director of AMP, have made clear
that they want to see a rapid improvement in the bank's fortunes. But there
seems to be little agreement about how the new chief executive should go
about it.
Mr Conroy, a long-time Westpac executive who had held the top job for just
14 months, produced a recovery plan which initially commanded the support of
the entire board.
Under the Conroy plan, the bank would have cut costs and increased revenue
by ADollars 300m by September; cut its non-interest expense to total income
ratio from 70 per cent to 58 per cent over three years; and reduced gross
assets by about ADollars 10bn from ADollars 110bn.
Mr Conroy quit because the board, under pressure from Mr Packer, wanted him
to speed up the restructuring. But the board balked at Mr Packer's plans to
put the shake-up in the hands of his American lieutenant, Mr Al Dunlap, who
has acquired the sobriquet 'chainsaw' for his zeal in slashing the costs of
Mr Packer's private companies.
Mr Joss says his broad strategy is to refocus the bank on its Australian
retail operations, which he believes can be sharpened up sufficiently to
close the gap between Westpac and National Australia Bank (NAB), which has
an expense-to-income ratio of 57.5 per cent. US analysts say he is highly
regarded for the part he played in guiding Wells to recovery from similar
problems to those that face Westpac.
'It was a team effort, but he certainly played a big part in it, and that
will stand him in good stead when he takes over at Westpac,' says Mr Ray
Soifer, banking analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
But with no clear guidance from the board, it is not clear how Mr Joss will
approach Westpac's three main problems:
Poorly-performing international assets. Westpac has about 48 per cent of
gross assets outside Australia, split fairly evenly between the US, Europe,
New Zealand and Asia. The worst performing assets are in Europe and the US,
where Westpac's inferior credit-rating, caused by its bad debt problems,
makes it impossible to compete with domestic banks.
'They need to run these assets down as quickly as they can,' says Mr Craig
Drummond, banking analyst at JB Were in Melbourne.
'But it is no good just sticking all the capital back in Australia because
of the competition from NAB. So it has to be handled very carefully.'
Poor return on assets and higher-than-average expenses. Since Mr Conroy's
departure, Westpac has indicated that it is considering reducing staff by up
to 20 per cent, or 4,000 people, to help drive down its expenses-to-income
ratio. Redundancies on this scale would bring the bank's staffing into line
with NAB, but if it is done too quickly it could damage the bank's core
retail activities.
'In spite of all its problems, Westpac's share of the domestic loans and
bills market has remained unchanged at about 17 per cent,' says Mr Drummond.
'The bank has to move quickly to protect that market share, but if it moves
too quickly it will damage the retail franchise, and that is the heart of
the business.'
Bad debts. The key problem is the weak Australian commercial property
market, which has significantly reduced the underlying assets against which
many bad debts are secured. Mr Conroy tried to clear the decks last year.
But Westpac is due to revalue its property portfolio in March, and analysts
say the crucial Sydney market has fallen by more than 10 per cent since the
last revaluation in March 1992.
The revaluation, one of the 'further setbacks' feared by Mr Uhrig, is likely
to cut a further ADollars 600m from Westpac's property portfolio.
Westpac shareholders went away from last week's annual meeting less than
convinced that the worst is over, but ready to give the new chief executive
a chance.
Can he deliver? 'Wells Fargo managers are among the best the US has,' says
Mr Campbell Chaney, banking analyst at Sutro and Co in San Francisco.
'Several have gone on to clean up other banks, and Joss is equally capable
of doing that.'
Westpac shareholders will be waiting anxiously to see whether this judgment
is correct. If it is not, Mr Uhrig can expect another rough ride at next
year's annual meeting.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TWO US companies have declared an interest in bidding for New Zealand Rail,
the government-owned railway that is being offered for sale internationally.
Strong interest is rumoured from other overseas interests, including Sea
Containers, the UK rail and ferry operator.
To date, only the two US companies, Railroad Development Corporation, a
Pittsburg railway group, and Burlington Northern, a Texas rail operator,
have announced they are considering buying New Zealand Rail.
The sale of New Zealand Rail is expected to fetch up to NZDollars 400m
(USDollars 210.5m). The government hopes to complete the sell-off by the
middle of this year, and has appointed Booz Allen and Hamilton, the
international management consultancy, to handle the sale.
Mr Robert Pietrandrea, chairman and vice-president of Railroad Development
Corporation, said New Zealand Rail was a 'unique' operation that had defied
conventional wisdom by making money out of passenger services. It was also
one of the few railroads in the world that was profitable.
Railroad Development Corporation is owned by Hawthorn Group, which also has
property, media and other interests. It also runs freight lines in Argentina
and manages a 1,000km line between Omaha and Chicago.
It has been reported that Sea Containers may be part of a consortium being
put together by the New Zealand-based Owens Group, one of New Zealand's
biggest road and port transport companies. A group of New Zealand port
companies, including the Auckland, Tauranga and Lyttelton port companies, is
also preparing to bid in order to retain ownership in New Zealand hands.

FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Trencor gains W&amp;A for R350m

<TEXT>
TRENCOR, the Cape-based transport and trading company, is to gain control of
W&amp;A, a diversified South African consumer and industrial group, through a
capital injection of R350m (Dollars 113.6m).
The deal brings together two of South Africa's largest companies not
controlled by the country's big mining houses or financial institutions.
The two groups yesterday announced that companies in the W&amp;A group  -
comprising FS group, FSI corporation, Waicor and W&amp;A  - would launch rights
offers to raise at least R500m. Trencor would invest R350m by underwriting
the offers and taking up rights.
Trencor and a management consortium led by its controlling shareholder, Mr
Jeff Liebesman, will exercise joint control of W&amp;A at board and executive
levels and will appoint an executive chairman.
Trencor, a very low profile company, has produced good results over a number
of years, while W&amp;A has struggled to shake off problems of excessive levels
of debt.
Trencor, with a market capitalisation of about R2.7bn, is one of the most
highly-rated stocks on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange with a price/earnings
ratio of 21. W&amp;A, with a market capitalisation of about R210m and a p/e
ratio of 3.3, has long had a poor rating.
Mr Liebesman said yesterday that the proceeds of the rights issue would be
used to redeem debt and would reduce significantly the group's gearing. The
compatibility of the two groups' interests would create promising business
opportunities, particularly in export-related and international fields. Mr
Liebesman said the disposal of non-core assets would continue.

MARUTI Udyog, jointly owned by Suzuki Motor, the Japanese minicar producer,
and the Indian government, is developing a small car for export to Europe,
Reuter reports from New Dehli.
Mr RC Bhargava, Maruti managing director, said the Maruti Y-2, a four-door
hatchback with a one litre engine, would be be unveiled after trial
production begins in April.
Maruti plans to manufacture about 70,000 of the cars a year by the end of
1994 and about 50,000 will be for export, Mr Bhargava said. The rest will be
sold locally.
'Europe will be the right market for this car,' Mr Bhargava said, adding it
would be fuel-efficient and meet European emission standards.
The Y-2 would replace Maruti's 800cc model currently sold in Hungary, Italy,
Poland and Portugal.
Mr Bhargava said he expected the Y-2 to compete against Fiat, Peugeot and
Renault compacts.
Maruti exported 23,000 of its 800cc model, the largest selling car in India,
in the year to March 1992. Exports for 1992-93 are expected to be only about
16,000, because of the war in the former Yugoslavia, which used to be a
large market.

FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Inco slips to Dollars 28.9m loss
on poor nickel price
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SLIDING nickel prices pushed Inco, the West's biggest producer of the metal,
to a sizeable fourth-quarter loss, despite a vigorous effort to contain
costs.
The Toronto-based company's loss reached USDollars 28.9m, or 28 cents a
share, up from a deficit of Dollars 5.8m, or 7 cents, a year earlier.
Fourth-quarter revenues slid to Dollars 627m from Dollars 710m.
The latest figures include after-tax expenses of Dollars 9.7m for production
shutdowns and Dollars 8.1m for severance pay. The biggest drag on earnings,
however, was a drop in average nickel prices to Dollars 3.01/lb in the final
three months of the year, from Dollars 3.55 a year earlier and Dollars 3.47
in the third quarter. Copper prices were also lower.
The company ascribed the fall in nickel prices to the surge in exports from
Russia and 'reduced demand' in some consuming countries.
The fourth-quarter performance was the worst of the year and resulted in a
loss for 1992 as a whole of Dollars 17.6m, or 21 cents a share, compared to
earnings of Dollars 82.6m, or 74 cents, in 1991. Revenues for the year
dipped to Dollars 2.61bn from Dollars 3.05bn.
Weak nickel prices have forced the company not only to cut back output, but
also to tighten cost controls.
Nickel deliveries fell to 473m lb last year, from 507m lb in 1992.
Fourth-quarter shipments were down to 122m lb from 125m lb. Gold shipments
fell especially sharply, from 23,000 ounces to 9,000 ounces.
Inco said that its nickel unit production costs fell by 14 per cent in the
fourth quarter compared to a year earlier.
Capital spending will be trimmed to about Dollars 225m this year, from
Dollars 234m last year and Dollars 440m in 1991.
The company said it plans to further reduce costs 'to a level which,
initially, should permit this business to break even in today's difficult
conditions and, over time, provide for a return to profitability'.

ALLIED-SIGNAL, the US high-technology company, yesterday reported a 33 per
cent increase in fourth-quarter earnings, excluding special items, and
forecast a 12 per cent to 18 per cent rise in 1993 earnings per share.
The company has been enjoying strong profits growth since the arrival as
chairman in July 1991 of Mr Larry Bossidy, who has been carrying out a major
restructuring.
Allied-Signal reported fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 153m, or Dollars
1.09 a share, compared with earnings of Dollars 115m, or 83 cents, in the
same period of last year, excluding unusual items. Including unusual items,

a share, up 65 per cent on 1991's earnings of Dollars 342m, or Dollars 2.51,
before unusual items.

tax, the company recorded a 1992 net loss of Dollars 712m, or Dollars 5.05 a
share.
In the fourth quarter, income from aerospace business rose 17 per cent to
Dollars 75m, mainly due to productivity improvements. Automotive was up 20
per cent at Dollars 36m and engineered materials was up 58 per cent at
Dollars 49m.

UPJOHN, the US pharma-ceuticals group, yesterday reported a 13 per cent rise
in its fourth-quarter 1992 net earnings, to Dollars 154m, or 86 cents a
share.
Mr Theodore Cooper, chairman and chief executive, said the group achieved a
solid performance in 1992 despite numerous challenges - including a 45 per
cent decline in worldwide sales of Halcion, the controversial sleep
medication.
The Michigan-based company said the profits figure excluded the cumulative
effects of accounting changes adopted in the quarter. Revenues in the
quarter showed a 9 per cent improvement at Dollars 989m.
For the whole of 1992, Upjohn had net profits of Dollars 562m, a 4 per cent
increase on 1991 results. Revenues were 7 per cent higher at Dollars 3.64bn
in 1992.
After including special restructuring charges and the reserves related to
accounting changes, Upjohn's 1992 net profit was Dollars 312.2m, or Dollars
1.74 per share, compared with Dollars 525.1m, or Dollars 2.87, in 1991.
Consolidated US sales were Dollars 2.3bn in 1992, some 6 per cent better
year-on-year. Non-US sales were 8 per cent improved at Dollars 1.4bn,
amounting to 38 per cent of total revenues.
Pharmaceutical sales outside the US surpassed Dollars 1bn for the first time
and were 8 per cent higher in 1992. Agricultural division sales were 6 per
cent up in 1992.
At the close on Wall Street, Upjohn's share price was Dollars 29 3/4 , up
Dollars  3/8 .
Eli Lilly, the US drugs company, reported 1992 fourth-quarter net earnings
of Dollars 311m, unchanged year-on-year. The company said a Dollars 46.1m
pre-tax charge related to a research and marketing alliance was included in
the 1992 quarter.
Sales in the quarter were Dollars 1.65bn, up from Dollars 1.57bn. For the
whole of 1992, Lilly earned Dollars 827.6m before special accounting
charges, compared with Dollars 1.3bn of net income in 1991.

FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Exxon chooses new chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXXON, the largest US energy group, said yesterday that Mr Lee Raymond, the
president, would be named this spring as the new chairman, succeeding Mr
Lawrence Rawl, who will reach the mandatory retirement age of 65.
Mr Raymond, who is 54 and first joined Exxon as a production research
engineer in 1963, will in turn be succeeded as president by Mr Charles
Sitter, a senior vice-president and director of Exxon.
The retirement of Mr Rawl, to take effect on April 28, the date of Exxon's
annual shareholders' meeting, may indicate a change of style at the top of
the big US oil and gas company. Mr Rawl is best known in the US as the Exxon
leader who was harshly criticised by the media in 1989 for what was
considered his arrogant, and even nonchalant, attitude to the Exxon Valdez
oil spill in Alaska, one of the worst US environmental disasters.
Mr Raymond, who is also a director of J. P. Morgan, the blue-chip New York
bank, has held a wide variety of positions at Exxon and is active at the
Council on Foreign Relations. In the 1960s and 1970s, he worked at Exxon's
US company and was later responsible for Exxon's international supply and
transportation of petroleum products and crude oil and for running former
Exxon affiliates in Aruba and Venezuela.
Between 1979 and 1981, Mr Raymond was president of Exxon Nuclear Company. He
later presided over Exxon's operations in the Caribbean, central and South
America, becoming president of the Exxon group in 1987.
Mr Sitter, who is 62, is responsible for Exxon's chemical business as well
as the treasury and tax functions of the group.

FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: US drugs group eyes Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARION Merrell Dow, the US pharmaceuticals group, is looking for a
substantial pan-European acquisition, according to senior company
executives.
The aim of any acquisition would be to increase sales in its European
prescription drugs and over-the-counter non-prescription businesses. The
group generates about 30 per cent of its turnover outside the US, and about
23 per cent in Europe.
Marion Merrell Dow would also like to acquire manufacturing capacity, says
Mr Ronald Irwin, chairman and managing director of Marion Merrell Dow's UK
operations.
The group's British production site was acquired by Procter &amp; Gamble, the US
consumer products group, when it bought Richardson-Vicks in 1986. Marion
Merrell Dow now uses contract manufacturers.
Mr Irwin says the group has considerable cash reserves to make an
acquisition. Cash and short-term investments at the end of last year were
Dollars 414m.
However, another route available to the company might be a merger. Merchant
bankers are known to have approached at least one leading British
pharmaceuticals group suggesting such a deal.
Any European acquisition would compliment Marion Merrell Dow's purchase last
year of the Berlin-based pharmaceuticals group Henning.
In 1991, the US group attempted to acquire Nicholas Labs, the European OTC
business of the US company Sara Lee, which was eventually bought by Roche of
Switzerland for Dollars 790m.
The US group needs to drive earnings through acquisitions. US patents for
its two leading products, Cardizem and Seldane, are due to expire within the
next two years.
Sales of Nicoderm, its nicotine patch, together with those of Nicorette
nicotine gum, increased 122 per cent last year. However, they are expected
to slow this year.

<TEXT>
CHEMICAL Waste Manage-ment, a partially-owned subsidiary of Chicago-based
Waste Management, said fourth-quarter earnings fell to Dollars 8.7m, or 4
cents a share, from Dollars 12.2m, or 6 cents, in the 1991 quarter.
The 28 per cent earnings tumble reflects a Dollars 15m, or 7 cents-a-share,
after-tax charge associated with the formation of Rust International, a new
global environmental services company. Rust will be majority-owned by
Chemical Waste Mangement.
Chemical Waste's fourth-quarter results were further weakened by a 5
cent-per-share charge linked to its majority-owned subsidiary, The Brand
Companies. The Brand Companies, which will become part of Rust
International, took a charge on a write-down of its asbestos abatement
business.
Revenues were also down for the quarter, at Dollars 354m, compared with
Dollars 370m in the fourth quarter of 1991. Chemical Waste said the sales
declines were the result of a fall-off in special projects.
For the year, Chemical Waste reported earnings of Dollars 126m, or 63 cents
a share, before accounting changes, up from Dollars 100m, or 49 cents, in
1991. Full-year sales were Dollars 1.5bn, up from Dollars 1.3bn in 1991.

branches and assets

<TEXT>
CITICORP, the largest US commercial bank, yesterday said it had agreed to
sell to Norwest, a regional US banking group, 59 branches and most of its
assets in Arizona.
Citicorp said the sale of the branches, Dollars 2bn of deposits and Dollars
2.3bn of assets in Arizona was the result of an evaluation which determined
that owning Citibank Arizona was no longer strategically necess-ary.
Terms of the trans-action were not disclosed, but the bank said the deal
would have 'no mater-ial financial impact.'
Citicorp did say it would take some 'modest write-offs' as a result of the
deal.
The Arizona interests, once part of Citicorp's ambition to develop holdings
across the US, were bought by Citicorp in two stages in 1986 and 1988.
In 1988, Citicorp acquired assets from the United Bank of Arizona from
Standard Chartered Bank of the UK for between Dollars 200m and Dollars 250m.
Citibank of Arizona, based in Phoenix, is engaged in retail and community
banking activities.

FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Eastman Kodak back in the black
with Dollars 299m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EASTMAN Kodak, the photographic equipment company, reported fourth-quarter
net earnings of Dollars 299m, compared with a Dollars 400m loss a year ago,
and forecast its latest restructuring plan would produce a solid increase in
1993 operating earnings.
The company, with a lacklustre profits record in recent years, has been
showing signs of a more aggressive approach to its problems, including the
announcement of 2,000 redundancies.
Mr Kay Whitmore, the chairman, reiterated the company's penitential tone
when he declared that from now on Kodak would 'better align our structural
costs with realistic volume projections. We will view the world as it is,
and not as we might wish it to be. And our view will be fixed on increasing
shareholder value.'
The fourth-quarter earnings worked through at 92 cents a share and compared
with a loss of Dollars 1.23 a share in the same period of 1991, when the
company took after-tax restructuring charges of Dollars 597m, or Dollars
1.84.
Revenues rose 6 per cent to Dollars 5.40bn from Dollars 5.08bn.
For the full-year net earnings were Dollars 1.15bn, or Dollars 3.53 a share,
compared with Dollars 17m, or 5 cents, a year ago.
The 1991 figures were reduced by Dollars 1.03bn of after-tax charges, while
in 1992 a Dollars 152m beneficial accounting change was almost offset by
Dollars 141m of restructuring charges.
However, Mr Whitmore acknowledged that 'with sluggish volume and cost
inflation putting pressure on operating margins, the sale of certain
investments was a large factor in the net earnings gain' for 1992.
In the fourth quarter the imaging business produced earnings of Dollars
316m, against a 1991 loss of Dollars 189m, while the information business
suffered a loss of Dollars 12m, down from a loss of Dollars 65m, excluding
restructuring charges.

The company has been enjoying strong profits growth since the arrival as
chairman in July 1991 of Mr Larry Bossidy, who has been carrying out a major
restructuring.
Allied-Signal reported fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 153m, or Dollars
1.09 a share, compared with earnings of Dollars 115m, or 83 cents, in the
same period of last year, excluding unusual items. Including unusual items,
fourth-quarter net income totalled Dollars 138m, or 98 cents a share. Sales
totalled Dollars 3.1bn, up 2 per cent.
For the full year. Allied reported earnings of Dollars 566m, or Dollars 4.02
a share, up 65 per cent on 1991's earnings of Dollars 342m, or Dollars 2.51,
before unusual items.
After special changes in accounting for retiree health benefits and income
tax, the company recorded a 1992 net loss of Dollars 712m, or Dollars 5.05 a
share.
Mr Bossidy said the group expected to record net income of between Dollars
4.50 and Dollars 4.75 a share in 1993.
'Our 1992 earnings per share surpassed the high end of the range we had
forecast, cash-flow for the year improved by Dollars 545m, and the company's
productivity increased by 5.6 per cent,' he said.
In the fourth quarter, income from the aerospace business rose 17 per cent
to Dollars 75m, mainly due to productivity improvements. Automotive was up
20 per cent at Dollars 36m and engineered materials produced income of
Dollars 49m, up 58 per cent.

DONOHUE, a Canadian newsprint producer, returned to profit in the final
quarter of 1992 with higher shipments, higher prices, a lower Canadian
dollar and strong construction timber markets.
Profit for the quarter was CDollars 2.4m (USDollars 1.88m) or 7 cents a
share, against a loss of CDollars 38.5m, or CDollars 1.20, a year earlier.
This was on sales of CDollars 137m, against CDollars 110m. For all 1992, a
loss of CDollars 14.7m, or 47 cents, compared with a loss of CDollars 58m,
or CDollars 1.80, on sales of CDollars 520m, against CDollars 470m.
North American newsprint price discounts are due to be reduced by 7 per cent
from April 1 but market pulp prices continue to be weak. Donohue is
controlled by Quebecor, North America's second largest commercial printer.

net loss

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BfG BANK, the German bank majority-owned by Credit Lyonnais of France, made
a net loss of DM1.1bn (Dollars 681m) last year as a result of a significant
increase in provisions against problem-country risks.
At the operating level, the bank raised its group profits by about DM100m
from DM144m in 1991.
It is aiming for a further increase in operating profits during the current
year, assuming falling interest rates in Germany.
Until the end of last year, BfG was owned by the Aachener und Munchener
Beteiligungs insurance group and the BGAG trades-union holding company.
Majority-control was acquired by Credit Lyonnais, the large state-owned
French bank, in a deal that valued BfG at DM2.1bn.
The bank said that it had increased its provisions against doubtful-country
debts to 75 per cent from 50 per cent of the total exposure. It also
increased the absolute number of countries covered.
The provisions accounted for DM910m of the DM1.1m net loss, the bank said.
BfG traditionally had strong business links with the eastern bloc, which
left it with a high level of bad and doubtful debts, although the bank said
that it had been able to reduce the level of provisioning against domestic
loans during the course of the past year.
Without giving any details, it said that trading profits had increased while
the level of securities write-offs had declined.
These preliminary details were released in Paris to coincide with the Credit
Lyonnais general meeting to approve the acquisition. Full details will be
published in March.

FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Salomon lifted by strong figures
from brokerage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SALOMON'S share price rose sharply yesterday after the company reported
fourth-quarter profits of Dollars 143m following a strong showing from
Salomon Brothers, its Wall Street securities brokerage, which offset heavy
losses at its Phibro Energy operations.
In the same quarter a year ago, Salomon incurred a net loss of Dollars 29m.
The strong final quarter took Salomon's full-year earnings for 1992 to
Dollars 550m, up from Dollars 507m a year earlier. Last year's profits would
have been a record Dollars 714m, but for the Dollars 164m special after-tax
charge the company recorded in connection with the 1991 US Treasury auction
scandal. Salomon's earnings in 1991 were also affected by charges related to
the scandal.
Investors applauded Salomon's results, bidding up the stock to close at
Dollars 40 on the New York Stock Exchange, a net gain of Dollars 3.
The markets were particularly impressed by the record operating profits at
the brokerage unit Salomon Brothers, both for the final quarter and for the
year.
The brokerage firm made pre-tax profits of Dollars 503m in the fourth
quarter (after a Dollars 67m charge to cover personnel relocation expenses),
and Dollars 1.4bn in the full year, proving that it has recovered from the
negative impact of the 1991 Treasury auction scandal.
The company said that results from proprietary and customer-related trading
activities had been especially strong.
However, the parent group earnings were once again held back by another
disappointing showing from its energy trading and refining operations, which
were merged into Salomon at the end of last year as part of a restructuring
and reduction of the lossmaking Phibro Energy unit.
The Phibro Energy division, which covers oil and oil products trading and
ship chartering, incurred a loss of Dollars 181m in the fourth quarter and
Dollars 194m in the year, which included special charges to cover the
withdrawal from certain business lines.
Phibro Energy USA, the oil refinery operation, recorded a loss of Dollars
31m in the quarter, which took total pre-tax losses for 1992 to Dollars 47m.
This reflected, Salomon said, the weak demand for energy products and the
narrow margins in the refining business. Phibro Energy Production, which
covers Salomon's interest in the White Nights oil production joint venture
in Russia, also lost money last year.
Salomon's expenses rose sharply in the fourth quarter and full year, to
Dollars 761m and Dollars 2.8bn respectively.
The increases were primarily attributable to a big rise in salary and
bonuses at Salomon Brothers, where employee compensation is tied to the
company's earnings performance, and to higher occupancy costs following the
consolidation of the brokerage firm's New York locations.

<TEXT>
MITSUBISHI Heavy Industries, the Japanese shipbuilder and machinery maker,
has cut its pre-tax profit forecast for the year to March by 6.7 per cent to
Y140bn (Dollars 1.1bn) as a decline in capital spending by Japanese industry
has slowed machinery orders, writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo.
Sales for the current year are now forecast at Y2,480bn, about the same as
last year and 1 per cent lower than originally forecast. Net profits are
forecast at Y88bn.

USF&amp;G, the troubled Baltimore-based insurer, yesterday reported an after-tax
profit of Dollars 13m in the fourth quarter of 1992, compared with a loss of
Dollars 40m in the same period of 1991, writes Nikki Tait.
The figures  - which include no realised investment gains, compared with a
Dollars 16m surplus a year earlier  - leaves USF&amp;G with an after-tax profit
of Dollars 28m for the year, against a Dollars 176m loss in 1991.

BFG BANK, the German bank majority-owned by Credit Lyonnais of France, made
a net loss of DM1.1bn (Dollars 681m) last year as a result of a significant

At the operating level, the bank raised its group profits by about DM100m

The provisions accounted for DM910m of the DM1.1m net loss, the bank said.
BfG traditionally had strong business links with the eastern bloc, which
left it with a high level of bad and doubtful debts.
Shareholders injected DM1bn over 1990 and 1991 to enable the bank to provide
against about 50 per cent of questionable debts of DM3.2bn at the end of
1991.
The increased provisioning was agreed to as part of the deal with Credit
Lyonnais.
The French bank has injected DM1.2bn into its new German subsidiary in order
to bolster its balance sheet.
It said that it had been able to reduce the level of provisioning against
domestic loans during the course of the past year.
Without giving any details, it said that trading profits had increased while
the level of securities write-offs had declined.

<TEXT>
ALCATEL, the world's leading supplier of telecommunications equipment, and
Sprint, the third-largest US long-distance telephone company, have agreed to
form a Dollars 300m turnover joint venture in data communications systems.
The new company, Alcatel Data Networks, will sell equipment and systems to
large public and private data communications networks, such as France
Telecom's Transpac, already among the 300 network operators that form the
partners' customer base. Other customers include telecommunications
carriers, service providers, state agencies, international businesses,
airlines and railways.
This will be among the top two companies in the world in the specialised,
but fast-growing, field of wide area data networks, or data communications
between separate sites, said Mr Jozef Cornu, Alcatel vice-president
responsible.
It will have an estimated 25 per cent world market share, in competition
against the data communications divisions of Northern Telecom of Canada,
Ericsson of Sweden and Germany's Siemens. The European market for this kind
of equipment is worth Ecu2.3bn per year in Europe and growing at 20 per cent
annually, said Mr Cornu.
Alcatel Data Networks, based in Paris, will be 51 per cent controlled by
Alcatel, which is providing the chairman, Mr Pierre Guichet, and 49 per cent
held by Sprint, but it will be jointly-managed.
Sprint is expected to provide about Dollars 180m of sales in the first year,
with the remaining Dollars 120m from Alcatel. It will employ 1,000 people,
700 from Sprint and 300 from Alcatel, drawn from the US partner's network
systems department and the equivalent branch on the French side.
The group will distribute each partner's products and provide both companies
with the complete range for their own distribution. They will also
co-operate on the introduction of equipment based on so-called asynchronous
transfer mode, a way of speeding up transmission of pictures, voice and data
along shared lines. 'This will allow us to increase our size and
competitiveness in a key, growing market segment,' said Mr Cornu.

buy-out

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GTE of the US has sold its GTE Sylvania International lighting operations in
a management buy-out. The new company, Sylvania Lighting International,
inherits a business ranked third in European lighting with a worldwide
turnover last year of Dollars 650m.
Terms of the deal have not been disclosed, but GTE said it was raising about
Dollars 1.1bn from the buy-out and the separate sale of its North American
lighting activities to Osram, a subsidiary of Siemens. The buy-out, covering
operations in Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Australia, was
financed by an investment consortium led by Citicorp Venture Capital.
In Europe, which accounts for 80 per cent of sales, Sylvania Lighting
International produces and markets lamps and fixtures under the brand names
Claude, Concord, Le Dauphin, Linolite, Lumiance and Sylvania. It claims an
average market share of just over 10 per cent, behind Osram and the market
leader Philips, but is more strongly placed in individual country markets
such as France.
Mr Norman Scoular, Sylvania's chief executive, formerly chief executive of
FKI, the UK-based electrical engineering group, hopes to improve the
company's indifferent performance by better use of technological resources
and more streamlined, decentralised management.
To that end, Sylvania has a technological assistance pact with its North
American counterpart, giving it unlimited access to the product and process
technology of that group and of Osram, the new owner.
Mr Scoular said yesterday the Geneva-based company, which has 6,300
employees, would be pursuing growth areas within a largely stable market.
These included compact fluorescent lighting using thin tube lamps, which are
increasingly displacing the traditional incandescent light bulb.

SWISS Bank Corporation, Switzerland's second-largest bank, has disclosed
that parent company net profits in 1992 rose 6.6 per cent to SFr805m,
(Dollars 551.3m) enabling it to maintain its dividend.
The bank forecast last July that profits would be flat this year because of
the unfavourable economic environment and the exceptional costs of absorbing
acquisitions.
However, it said fourth-quarter trading revenues were exceptionally good and
significant extraordinary gains were made from sales of assets.
Total assets stood at SFr172bn at the end of last year, up from SFr169bn a
year earlier.
The bank said it would seek shareholder approval at the annual meeting in
April to eliminate its participation certificates, converting them into
bearer shares at the rate of one-for-one. It would also seek to split its
registered shares two-for-one.
'This will ensure the preponderance of the registered shares in terms of
voting, as is required under the Bank Act . . . as proof of Swiss control,'
the bank said.
The directors will propose that shareholders have the choice of receiving
their dividends in the form of shares as well as cash.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHEIKH Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, who as Kuwait's finance minister strongly
influenced the activities of the Kuwait Investment Office, has withdrawn
from the Investcorp organisation consortium which is attempting to buy and
reorganise Circle K, the bankrupt US convenience store chain.
However, the Arizona-based retailer added that Investcorp  - an investment
organisation with offices in Bahrain, London and New York, and a sizeable
shareholder in the likes of Saks Fifth Avenue and Tiffany  - had said that
it would provide the equity funding. There was no immediate response from
the Circle K bondholders, who have been urging a rival reorganisation plan.
The situation at Circle K has been mired in controversy for months.
Investcorp, via a vehicle called CK Acquisitions, put forward a proposal to
buy Circle K, which runs about 2,900 stores in the south-west, for Dollars
399.5m. This scheme was opposed by bondholders, who submitted a rival plan.
Since the end of 1992, the bondholders have been arguing that the CK
Acquisitions scheme was jeopardised by the involvement of Skeikh Ali Khalifa
in the Investcorp-led consortium.
Their lawyers filed an emergency motion with the bankruptcy court in
January, urging more information about the finances of the Sheikh and those
of Mr Javier de la Rosa, the Spanish financier. The bondholders seized upon
a scandal surrounding investments in Spain by the KIO in the late 1980s.
These were managed by Mr de la Rosa. Sheikh Ali Khalifa, although not
directly involved in the KIO's Spanish investments has been indirectly
criticised in Kuwait for allowing the KIO, while he was finance minister, to
risk large sums of money in Spain.
Sheikh Ali Khalifa and Mr de la Rosa were stockholders in CK, and were
reported to be players at Grupo Torras, the lead company in the KIO's
Spanish operation.
The statement yesterday from Circle K gave no explanation for Sheikh Ali
Khalifa's withdrawal from the CK Acquisitions consortium, but said that
Investcorp 'has satisfied Circle K and the principal creditor constituencies
that CK has the financing necessary for the successful completion of the
purchase.'
'We look forward to confirmation hearings set for April 7 which will signal
the end of Circle K's bankruptcy,' it said.

FT  04 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Springboard for a jump into international
markets - Jacobs Engineering's ambitions for the future of Humphreys &amp;
Glasgow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECENT purchase of Humphreys &amp; Glasgow, one of the most famous names
among UK process plant contractors, has given Jacobs Engineering Group of
the US a springboard for its European ambitions.
Terms were not disclosed, but the takeover by the eighth largest engineering
and construction contractor in the US is the most important in the industry
since Trafalgar House acquired Davy in the summer of 1991.
The immediate circumstances of the takeovers are different  - Davy was laid
low by one disastrous contract while H&amp;G has been struggling to make money
in a generally difficult business climate for UK process plant contractors
 -but the underlying trends are similar.
Big European and US clients, says Mr Noel Watson, Jacobs' president, are
investing on both sides of the Atlantic, and want contractors to be able to
handle the job wherever it is built. But the relationship only works if the
contractor stays close to the customer.
The takeover unites two very different companies. H&amp;G, founded 100 years
ago, was a private company run for more than 40 years by the eccentric Mr
Ambrose Congreve, son-in-law of its founder. It hit problems in the 1970s
and was acquired by Enserch, the US energy company, in 1983.
Pasadena-based Jacobs, meanwhile, has grown from a one-man consultancy
founded by Dr Joseph Jacobs in 1947 to a company with 14,000 employees, and
revenues last year of Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 700m). Publicly-quoted, the
company is one of the world's few 'pure plays' for investors in the risky
business of E&amp;C contracting.
The deal seems to makes sense for both companies. Enserch was a good parent
from a financial perspective, says Mr Frank Hart, H&amp;G's managing director,
but could not provide the additional benefits of a common process
contracting background.
Also, the sale in February of H&amp;G's offshore contracting business left the
company at 'a pretty uncomfortable size' of about 450 employees, excluding
its 40 per cent-owned Indian business, Humphreys &amp; Glasgow Consultants
Private.
'Worldwide, the industry is splitting into two, large broadly-based
contractors and niche contractors,' says Mr Hart.
Mr Watson also sees clear benefits from the takeover. Jacobs has principally
been a domestic US contractor, with only 10 per cent of its work coming from
overseas, but after a period of unprecedented growth at home Mr Watson now
sees stronger growth in Europe, and wants a bigger international market
place. A further acquisition on the Continent is a possibility.
Jacobs had established an office in the Irish Republic in 1974 after
building a plant there for Syntex, the US pharmaceuticals group. But now Mr
Watson wants to be able to serve big European clients on their home
continent as well as in the US.
Similarly, Jacobs wants to follow more of its US clients when they invest in
Europe  - such as Intel for which Jacobs is building a Dollars 175m wafer
fabrication plant at Kildare.
To do this Mr Watson and Mr Hart aim to marry the skills of H&amp;G and Jacobs,
so that each can help the other on both sides of the Atlantic. H&amp;G bring
Jacobs its expertise in methanol and ammonia technology, while both
companies are strong in fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals where the growth
prospects are strongest.
One of Jacobs' strengths is in environmental engineering and clean-up work.
This is a big business in the US and Mr Watson hopes to export the expertise
to Europe. Cleaning up sites after military activity is one of Jacobs'
specialities, which could be put to use in eastern Germany following the
withdrawal of the former Soviet Army.
Mr Watson is also keen to win contracts financed by the Dollars 500m that
the US Congress has earmarked for environmental clean-up work in the
Commonwealth of Independent States.
Not all of this will happen overnight, but the process of interchanging
skills has already begun, and is a crucial element in improving H&amp;G's
financial performance.
The Croydon-based company has been losing money for several years  - one
reason why Enserch lost patience  - while Jacobs' net earnings have soared
from Dollars 6.5m in 1988 to Dollars 26.6m in the year ended September 30.
With the integration of the company under way, Mr Hart believes H&amp;G could be
in the black from mid-year.
Market conditions look like working in the company's favour  - Mr Hart's
trip round the UK with Mr Watson suggested customers were showing a little
more confidence.

FT  04 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Holliday gears up for future growth - As
the chemicals company approaches its flotation Richard Gourlay looks at its
history and prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FLOTATION this March of Holliday Chemical Holdings, the synthetic
dyestuffs and speciality chemicals company, has conjured up a memory of the
past. With the cost of debt tumbling for companies strong enough to part
banks from their cash, equity is becoming an expensive way of raising
capital.
As a result, a subtle change of attitude towards high gearing may be
emerging. After three years in which high debt levels have been as
acceptable in the City as smoking before the Queen, gearing  - the financial
engineers' best friend  - may be about to stage a come back.
Mr Michael Peagram, chairman and chief executive of Holliday, is pondering
exactly these issues with his advisers but jokes that he would hate his
company to have net cash in the bank.
He can only afford the luxury of this debate as he approaches a flotation,
which will value the company at about Pounds 140m, because of Holliday's
impressive history.
Over the five-year period since Mr Peagram, a doctor of Chemistry, led a
management buy-out of Holliday Dyes &amp; Chemicals, sales have risen five-fold
to an estimated Pounds 100m in 1992.
Operating profits over the same period have grown to about Pounds 13.6m,
partly as a result of five acquisitions. But Mr Peagram is also at pains to
point out that the company has grown organically every year by 10-15 per
cent and last year by 20 per cent.
This organic growth is the secret to Holliday Chemical's appeal and the
reason, City observers say, why Mr Peagram's acquisitive ways are likely to
receive a warm welcome among investors.
According to Mr David Ingles, chemical analyst at stockbrokers James Capel,
the Holliday management has developed a knack not only of spotting and
acquiring companies, but running them efficiently and imaginatively.
Often these companies have performed noticeably better under Holliday than
their previous owners. Examples include the acquisition from Hickson
International in 1987 of James Robinson and William Blythe, the metal salts
company, bought in 1991 also from Hickson.
As the company has grown, Mr Peagram says he has stuck to a strategy of
building large shares of niche markets and avoiding direct competition with
the major chemical companies.
Holliday's transition into quoted life will be facilitated by the fact that
Mr Peagram and a number of the group's companies have already been in the
public arena. He was managing director of Croda Chemicals Division until
1985 when he took a 25 per cent stake in Holliday Dyes and Chemicals, a
loss-making company with sales of Pounds 8m.
Two years later, Peagram led a management buy-out of Holliday backed by
institutions including 3i. The transaction left Mr Peagram with a 28 per
cent stake.
This stake is likely to be reduced to approximately 20 per cent. The
flotation should raise about Pounds 60m, half of which will go to the
existing investors; some Pounds 30m would be used to substantially reduce
debt to about Pounds 19m, against equity of about Pounds 41m.
This is where the debate begins over the shape of Holliday's balance sheet.
Raising about Pounds 60m would lead to relatively high gearing - about 50
per cent. Mr Peagram says this is not high when viewed in the light of the
nine times interest cover.
However comfortable the market might be with this level of debt  - and it
does still focus on balance sheet gearing, not just interest cover -
Holliday could face problems with further expansion.
Mr Peagram has said he is not interested in acquisitions smaller than about
Pounds 10m. But if Holliday paid Pounds 20m for a company, and took a
goodwill write-off equal to about Pounds 10m, gearing could easily rise
above 100 per cent.
Mr Peagram says he is aware of this problem. Holliday's balance sheet is
already weakened by write-offs taken at the time of earlier acquisitions, he
says. If he wanted to make such an acquisition, he would have to convince
the City he was telling a good story.
The solution of raising more money at flotation, however, goes against the
grain with Mr Peagram.
That said, Holliday does not anticipate making any acquisitions imminently.
'There is not a lot that we are not able to do now,' says Mr Peagram. 'We
probably will raise more at various times but there is no acquisition
contemplated.'
He says that even if he was so-minded, an acquisition would not be
physically possible until the back end of the third quarter because the
flotation has taken up so much time.
Mr Peagram is also aware that some City observers will compare Holliday with
another speciality chemicals company that grew rapidly through acquisition
but fell heavily from grace last year  - MTM.
While MTM's problem stemmed from the fact that large amounts of profit were
an illusion, Mr Peagram is well prepared to highlight other differences.
He says he likes to sleep at night and has adopted very conservative
accounting policies; among the techniques MTM employed was the
capitalisation of project development costs. He would be reluctant to sell
any of his companies; the MTM stable was forever changing. Holliday's board
is relatively unchanged; at MTM, board seats changed frequently.
And Richard Lines, MTM's founder and chairman, had a very clear objective,
says Mr Peagram: 'He wanted to have a billion dollar turnover.'
Mr Peagram says his objectives are altogether more modest  - just as long as
he is not forced to head a company that has no debt.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the 12 months ended December 31 1992 net asset value per share at
Castle Cairn Investment Trust rose by 14.2 per cent, from 43.58p to 49.78p.
That reflected the trust's substantial commitment to overseas markets
maintained throughout the year, as well as the surge in the UK equity market
over the last four months of 1992 prompted by the departure of sterling from
the ERM.
The revenue account showed total income of Pounds 243,000 (Pounds 222,000).
Earnings per share worked through at 0.85p (0.79p) and the dividend is 0.8p
(0.75p).

FT  04 FEB 93 / UK Company News: 37% increase lifts Seacon to Pounds 2.3m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Improved results in all its divisions enabled Seacon, the USM-traded
transport and freight group, to lift turnover 6 per cent and pre-tax profit
37 per cent in the year ended September 30 1992.
In view of the increase and to mark the group's confidence in the future  -
Mr Chris Roth, chairman, thinks 'the recession has bottomed out'  - the
dividend is raised from 4.2p to 5.1p with a final of 3.1p.
Earnings per share improved from 12.05p to 15.92p.
In percentage terms the largest profit increases were achieved by Seacon and
Forestrans.
At the end of the year sterling was devalued. However, for the bulk of the
period the steady sterling/D-Mark relationship and declining fuel prices
helped the fleet to be operated more efficiently.
Mr Roth said profits for the first quarter of the current year were
marginally down, after being affected by adverse weather conditions in
October and again last month.

FT  04 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Northumbrian Foods delays announcement of
interims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHUMBRIAN Fine Foods, the biscuit and snacks group, set the stock market
a puzzle last night. It was to have announced interim results yesterday but
during the day made last minute cancellations of meetings set up with
analysts and the press.
After the stock market closed yesterday, with the shares unchanged on the
USM at 19p, the company announced it was 'involved in discussions in respect
of a reorganisation of the group'. These talks 'are to be concluded shortly.
'They are expected to have a material effect on the group's interim results
for the six months to September 30.'
No further explanation was forthcoming from the group, although the mystery
may be solved today.
The group's shares have fallen from 43p last June when Mr Richard Adams, the
then chairman and chief executive, resigned. A new chief executive, Mr Henry
Roberts, was appointed in October.
Analysts suggested that the talks might be with the group's bankers and the
new man may be trying to raise some cash, although a rights issue is said to
be out of the question. They speculated that the group was trying to sell
part of the business or that the interim figures might be affected by
provisions relating to a reorganisation.
The group had an exceptional charge of Pounds 550,000 in the 1991-92
accounts, and also made adjustments to the balance sheet relating to the
acquisition in 1991 of John J Lees, a confectionery maker, for Pounds 4.8m.

FT  04 FEB 93 / UK Company News: WMI jumps 49% to Pounds 144m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WASTE Management International, the UK-listed overseas arm of Waste
Management of the US, has maintained its rapid growth helped by
acquisitions.
It announced pre-tax profits ahead 49 per cent, from Pounds 96.4m to Pounds
143.7m, for 1992. Fourth quarter profits rose 36 per cent, from Pounds 30.1m
to Pounds 40.9m.
Mr Edwin Falkman, chief executive, said the results were 'very satisfying'
against a difficult economic background. During the year the group made 25
acquisitions and raised Pounds 438m through a listing of 20 per cent of its
shares. Waste Management and its subsidiaries retained 80 per cent.
Turnover increased 34.5 per cent to Pounds 816.6m (Pounds 606.9m). Almost
half the rise came from acquisitions with the remainder stemming from volume
and price increases, especially in the Netherlands, France and Italy.
Europe remained WMI's most important market, accounting for 77 per cent of
turnover, while the proportion of sales in Italy declined from 46 per cent
to 38 per cent as other markets grew.
Full year operating margins improved from 15.4 per cent to 15.7 per cent,
although fourth quarter margins were affected by lower contributions from
new acquisitions and seasonal factors.
Earnings were up 30 per cent to 23.3p (17.9p), partly reflecting the
increased share capital since the initial public offering in April. WMI has
said it will not pay dividends during its present, acquisition driven phase.
This is likely to last for at least two or three years.
The shares, which were listed at 585p, jumped 27p to 762p.

FT  04 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Kalon expands in Europe with Pounds 20m
French deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KALON, the paints group, has expanded into the Continent with the
acquisition of Novo Holdings and Novodec, its main trading subsidiary and
the largest private label paint supplier in France.
The consideration amounts to FFr161m (Pounds 19.8m), including Pounds 2.2m
of debt.
The acquisition comes five months after Kalon failed to acquire Manders
(Holdings), its rival paint maker, in a hostile all-share offer valued at
Pounds 106.1m at the launch of the bid.
Some Pounds 14m of the French acquisition is to be funded by the allotment
of almost 12m new ordinary shares at 117p apiece and the balance in cash.
At the December 31 1992 year-end, Kalon had net cash balances of Pounds
12.3m: the pro forma effect of the acquisition will reduce that figure to
Pounds 6.5m.
Mr Mike Hennessy, group managing director, said that the deal and the price
had been 'well received' in the City.
The shares rose 1 1/2 p to 123 1/2 p before the announcement and remained
static since.
Kalon accompanied the news of the acquisition with a forecast that 1992
profits - after interest and before both the Manders bid costs of Pounds
1.5m and tax - would be not less than Pounds 13m, an advance of at least 41
per cent on last time's Pounds 9.2m. It added that it intended to to pay a
final dividend - for which the newly allotted shares would rank - of 2.2p to
make a total of 3.2p (2.2p).
Mr Hennessy said the acquisition of Novodec was 'a perfect fit'. He said it
was in the same position as Kalon in 1988: 'strong in private label paints,
but without any trade paint or decorative sundries business'. Founded in
1975 by Galeries du Papier Peint and Windeck Paints - which ironically was
acquired by Manders in December 1991 for Pounds 5.66m - Novodec was managed
by Mr Graham Burke, who in 1982 became the majority shareholder. The French
arm of 3i acquired a 22 per cent stake in 1990.
Under Kalon's ownership, the management will remain the same with the
exception of Mr Burke, who is retiring and will be replaced as chairman by
Mr Hennessy. He said Mr Burke had sold to Kalon, because it knew the
business and its management and because Mr Burke wanted to preserve what he
had created.
Novodec employs 140 people. Its paints sell throughout France, mostly in
hyper- and supermarkets and DIY sheds. Post-tax profits for 1992 are
expected to be FFr12m.

FT  04 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Triplex seeks Pounds 17.3m via rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRIPLEX LLOYD, the industrial engineering group, is asking shareholders for
Pounds 17.3m through a 1-for-4 rights issue at 140p a share to finance
expansion in its power and automotive and engineering divisions.
The price has been pitched at a discount of 33p to the overnight share price
of 173p. It is just 7p above the bottom of the shares' 1992-93 trading
range.
The rights issue is the second move in a financial reorganisation of the
group. Last month it raised Dollars 35m (Pounds 23.1m) through a private
placement on the US capital markets and, in the process, switched most of
its short term debt into medium and long term borrowings at fixed rates of
interest.
The cash call, first contemplated last October, constitutes what Mr Colin
Cooke, chairman, called 'a recharging of our batteries.'
Mr John Foley, managing director, said: 'We now have cash at fixed rates and
the size of balance sheet to finance expansion and some small add-ons as
well.' The immediate effect, however, is to reduce gearing.
This had increased to 70 per cent, from 60 per cent last September, because
of capital expenditure and increased needs for working capital.
It is expected to drop after the rights issue to just over 20 per cent, then
rise to a peak of over 40 per cent for two years, before declining again.
Triplex Lloyd will be spending the proceeds over two years. Much will be
devoted both to expanding and to raising the technological level of casting
operations, both in the UK and the US.
The spending emphasises the group's policy, evident over the last two years,
of concentrating on the development of its power and automotive and
engineering businesses. This places a question mark over the future for the
building products division.
The new shares will not attract the interim dividend, payable later this
month, but will receive the final for the year to March 31 1993. The
directors said they ex-pected to hold the final dis-tribution at 4.5p,
maintaining total payments for the year at 7p.
However, the group would not expand further on trading prospects for the
current year; at the time of the interim statement last December it said
that prospects for the power division were rosy  - there were 'substantial
opportunities for growth'  - while it was cautious about the automotive and
engineering sector and had seen no sign of an upturn in the building
products market.
COMMENT
The City expects pre-tax profits for the current year to be about Pounds 7m,
roughly the same as in 1991-92. Short of any quick economic upturn,
shareholders looking for a profits boost will have to rely on the ability of
the management to carve out a larger market share in the power and
automotive component markets. This is happening to some degree now but the
process is unlikely to accelerate until the investment programme has worked
through. That points to a quiet current year but greater excitement
thereafter.

FT  04 FEB 93 / UK Company News: BICC completes purchase of KWO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BICC, the cables and construction group, yesterday announced it had
completed the purchase of KWO, Germany's third largest cable maker.
KWO has been bought for DM58m (Pounds 24m) from the Treuhandanstalt, the
agency responsible for privatising industry in eastern Germany.
The company, located around the industrial heartland of east Berlin, makes
telecommunications cabling, signalling equipment and power cables. Nearly a
fifth of its turnover is exported to eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union.
Mr David Hingston, managing director of the newly named KWO Kabel, said BICC
was also committed to capital spending of DM80m by the middle of 1994, as
part of the 'huge restructuring costs' involved in making KWO competitive
and profitable.
The Treuhand has borne the cost of redundancies as the workforce has been
cut from 8,000 three years ago to 2,200.
Last year, KWO recorded turnover of DM320m, 'a low figure because of the
restructuring,' Mr Hingston said. He added that the new company was expected
to increase turnover to DM400m next year.
The management, which is largely British but will be predominantly German by
the end of this year, stressed it was determined to increase productivity.
Productivity is currently two thirds, and wages 60 per cent, of western
German levels. The KWO acquisition has provided one of the outlets for the
Pounds 154m BICC raised in a rights issue last May. It also bought a North
American cables company and increased its stake in GEGC of Spain.
About 40 per cent of the turnover in BICC Cables (a separate division from
the North American and Australasian cables operations) comes from
continental Europe. The group had total turnover of Pounds 3.79bn in 1991.

FT  04 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Founding family reduces Stakis stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Stakis family is reducing its stake in Stakis, the hotels and casinos
group founded by Sir Reo Stakis, by taking up only a small proportion of the
Pounds 28m rights issue announced last week.
Yesterday the joint brokers, Smith New Court and Allied Provincial, placed
21.29m of the family's rights shares at 9 3/4 p each. The effect will be to
reduce the family stake from 24 per cent to 18 per cent.
Privately, company officials welcome the chance to increase institutional
shareholdings in the group, which returned to marginal profit last year.

FT  04 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Simon sells European consultancy for Pounds
10.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIMON Engineering, which last August put its environmental division up for
sale because of falling profits and worries about its dividend, yesterday
announced the sale of its European environmental consultancy business to
Northumbrian Water for Pounds 10.5m.
This follows last month's Pounds 14.2m disposal of its water and waste
treatment arm to Thames Water.
The group, however, has been unable to find a buyer for the third part of
its environmental division, the North American consultancy. Mr Brian Kemp,
chief executive, said that would now be retained as a 'profitable, stand
alone business'.
Analysts welcomed the sale, which would cut forecast year-end net borrowings
of nearly Pounds 100m, equal to gearing of about 80 per cent. However, the
change of heart on the North American division was seen as inconsistent and
will reduce the overall proceeds expected from the disposal programme. The
arm, known as Hydro-Search, was acquired for Pounds 6.7m in 1991.
Simon is due to announce results for 1992 next month. Pre-tax profits are
expected to fall from Pounds 18.3m to between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m
because of recession in its process engineering and access divisions.
Speculation that it will have to cut the dividend, which was uncovered last
year, knocked the shares from a high of 301p to a low of 70p last year.
Yesterday, they gained 2p to 137p.
Net borrowings have almost doubled from Pounds 51m at the interim stage.
This was mainly the result of advance payments in the process engineering
division and devaluation of sterling, which increased the amount of US debt.
The disposals will reduce borrowings by about Pounds 30m because Thames
Water assumed Pounds 6m of debt in its acquisition. Both sales should be
completed when the results are announced but will not be reflected in the
balance sheet.

FT  04 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Hillsdown sells poultry operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HILLSDOWN Holdings, the food group, has sold its Sandycroft poultry
operation to Marshall Food Group, a private company based in Newbridge,
Midlothian.
The price was not disclosed, but is thought to be under Pounds 10m.
Marshall is one of the largest poultry processing concerns in the UK and
also makes convenience foods. It achieved turnover in the 1990-91 of Pounds
141m.
Hillsdown bought Sandycroft, which has 24 farms, a hatchery, a processing
plant and a breeder unit, as part of the acquisition of JP Wood from Unigate
a year ago.
The group said the sale was part of reorganisation of its own and Wood's
capacity. That programme was not complete but Hillsdown said it was within
timetable and budget.
The poultry market had been suffering from competitive imports until
sterling left the Although the currency's fall meant feed costs were higher,
Hillsdown said the improvement in the industry had helped its reorganisation
programme.
Hillsdown shares were unchanged at 148p.

FT  04 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Airtours shares slip below underwritten
level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Airtours, locked in a Pounds 212m hostile bid for rival holiday
company Owners Abroad, yesterday slipped back below the level at which its
partial cash alternative has been underwritten.
In thin trading, the shares closed down 4p at 284p, below the 288p price at
which Barclays de Zoete Wedd and British Linen Bank have underwritten the
issue.
Owners Abroad's share price was unchanged at 116p, a 10p premium to the
current value of Airtours' paper offer.
City analysts said technical swapping from Airtours ordinary shares to
convertible stock could explain part of the fall from a level of about 300p
last week.
The fall could also reflect growing anticipation that the Department of
Trade and Industry will not recommend Airtours' bid for referral to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
A referral could mean that Airtours will withdraw from the bid. If
successful, Airtours and Owners Abroad would have combined sales of about
Pounds 1.6bn  - a dramatic increase in the size of the company.
Even if there is no referral, the Owners Abroad share price suggests
Airtours may have to increase its 3-for-8 share offer, or sweeten the deal
to include a more generous cash alternative.

FT  04 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Application of FRS 3 hitting teething
troubles says Capel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEETHING troubles are beginning to appear in the application by companies of
FRS 3, the new accounting standard on the profit and loss account, City
analysts James Capel said yesterday.
In a circular distributed to clients, the firm warned that a number of
variations were creeping in to the implementation of the standard by
different companies.
It stresses that users of accounts should not rely on the sub-totals shown
in the new-style profit and loss account any more than on the new volatile
earnings figure.
Capel, which has produced a detailed analysis of the effects of the new
accounting standards, reiterates that earnings will be substantially higher
under FRS 3 than the existing format.
Capel said that the ratio for industrial quoted companies in 1991 was 9 per
cent lower using its own 'continuing earnings' figure than using the figure
calculated by FRS 3. It is 7 per cent lower for 1992.
Mr Paul Walton, a Capel analyst, said there was a risk that companies would
take advantage of FRS 3 to present their results in the best possible light.
The Capel document cites BOC, which by highlighting its early adoption of
FRS 3 and a large goodwill write-off, attracted little attention to a
substantial provision it made to rationalise its healthcare business.
Capel also announced its own formulae for calculating a continuing earnings
figure and a cash flow per share figure
Its earnings per share figure will take the FRS 3 earnings figure and
exclude costs in closure or withdrawal from a business segment, gains or
losses on disposals and some other specific unusual items.
Its cash flow figure will take net cash inflow from operations, add returns
on investment or servicing of finance, and deduct tax, dividends paid and
movements in working capital.
It hints that the Accounting Standards Board's forthcoming discussion
document on acquisition accounting due out next month may well limit any
revaluations to certain assets such as properties, and to larger and listed
companies.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Thames Water to lead Dollars 700m Turkish project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM led by Thames Water has won one of the largest overseas water
resources projects to be awarded to a UK water company since privatisation
in 1989.
Thames and its Turkish and Japanese partners are expected shortly to sign
the implementation agreement for a Dollars 700m (Pounds 488m) construction
project at Izmit, north-west of Istanbul. Under the build, operate and
transfer (BOT) scheme, Thames will manage the water supply system for 15
years.
Mr David Luffrum, group finance director, said the contract was 'ideal' for
Thames, which has been building up its consultancy and contracting business
under its subsidiary PWT Worldwide. 'It's the first BOT water project in
Turkey and a one-off at this stage, but there could be further
opportunities.'
Several UK water companies have looked at overseas projects since
privatisation, partly to earn non-regulated profits and develop businesses
outside their core. Thames has already won several smaller projects in
Europe, while North West Water is involved in consortia with design and
management contracts in Malaysia and Australia.
The Turkish project includes completion of the Yuvacik dam, where work was
halted five years ago after cash shortages. The dam will be linked with two
pumping stations and more than 100km of trunk mains. Most of the water
supplied will be used in Izmit with the remainder being pumped to Istanbul.
Construction will be undertaken by PWT, which has contracts worth about
Dollars 290m, and two Turkish construction companies, Gama Endustri
Tesisleri Imalat ve Montaj and Guris Insaat ve Muhendislik.
The consortium shareholders include: Izmit Municipality (30 per cent),
Thames (25 per cent), Gama and Guris (25 per cent), Mitsui and Sumitomo of
Japan (10 per cent) and others (10 per cent). The consortium will provide
about Dollars 115m in equity, with the remainder due from export credits and
commercial banks. The project plan assumes operations will begin in 1997.
Mr Luffrum said Thames started discussions with the Turkish side in 1990.
'It's higher risk and higher reward than the utility business, but it is
what Thames is set up for,' he said.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Fokker shares fall 24% after request for Fl 1bn loan

SHARES in Fokker, the hard-pressed Dutch aircraft manufacturer, lost a
quarter of their value on the Amsterdam bourse yesterday after the company
said it had approached the Nationale Investeringsbank (NIB), the Dutch
state-owned bank, for a loan of between Fl 800m and Fl 1bn (Pounds 377m).
The move intensified fears that Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the aerospace
subsidiary of Germany's Daimler-Benz group, was considering abandoning its
plan to acquire a controlling stake in the Dutch company. It was also taken
as a sign of mounting financial difficulties at Fokker.
Fokker shares closed 24.4 per cent lower yesterday at Fl 10.20. The shares
were also dragged down by concern over the collapse this week of Daf, the
Dutch truckmaker.
Although Dasa said yesterday it was still interested in taking control of
Fokker, the German company is understood to be demanding a restructuring of
the provisional agreement signed at the end of October, saying the Dutch
group's financial and business position has deteriorated since then.
Dasa agreed to pay DM800m (Pounds 340m) for a 51 per cent stake in the Dutch
manufacturer of regional and commuter aircraft as part of its strategy to
create a European regional aircraft consortium. But the German group is
understood to believe that the capital injection from the Dutch authorities
agreed under the original proposal is now insufficient.
Dasa is anxious to avoid repeating with Fokker the embarrassment of having
to refinance a company shortly after completing its acquisition as happened
after it bought Dornier, the German aircraft maker.
However, it is willing to increase its own capital commitment to the company
if the Dutch government increases its cash support. The total capital
required is believed to be in the region of Fl 400m.
The Dutch government has indicated its willingness in principle to a change
in the agreement, but Dasa's requirements may prove too onerous. Dasa is
believed to be threatening to walk away from the deal if the transaction is
not restructured.
Dasa did not have access to all Fokker's accounts when it signed the
original agreement. It is believed to have been particularly concerned about
Fokker's backlog of unsold aircraft and has become worried about
deterioration in the aircraft market.
Dasa believes that Fokker's decision to seek the financing from the NIB
confirms its own assessment of mounting financial difficulties. Fokker said
yesterday that the request for a new loan would have been made irrespective
of the outcome of negotiations with Dasa.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Electrolux cuts dividend by half on poor outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ELECTROLUX, one of the world's leading white goods manufacturers, began
Sweden's corporate reporting season on a gloomy note yesterday when it
announced it was halving its 1992 dividend to SKr6.25 a share.
The move, which is almost certain to be followed by other hard-pressed
Swedish companies, came in spite of virtually unchanged profits of SKr1bn
(Pounds 87m) for the year.
The company said it was making the cut because of the uncertain market
outlook, particularly in Europe, and worse than expected conditions over the
past year.
Mr Anders Scharp, chairman, said: 'We have had three weak years, when we
held the dividend, and we cannot be optimistic about the coming year.
Although we are expecting a better year in the US, in Europe we are faced
with declining demand in some countries, currency changes, high real
interest rates, and political unrest.'
It is the first time the company has cut its dividend in at least 30 years,
and takes the payout back to its 1984 level.
Last year profit after financial items slid to SKr1bn from SKr1.03bn as
turnover rose to SKr80.4bn from SKr79.0bn. Operating income fell 13 per cent
to SKr2.25bn while earnings per share after tax dropped to SKr2.50 from
SKr5.20.
Electrolux said income grew in North America but declined in Europe.
The dividend cut pushed the group's share price down SKr13 to SKr212 and set
the tone for the Stockholm bourse, where shares traded lower.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Rate falls prompt novel debt instrument
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMAND from investors looking to preserve their income following recent
falls in UK base rates yesterday prompted the first public issue of
sterling-denominated instruments which pay a higher return as interest rates
fall.
This follows last week's launch of a wave of novel debt instruments by UK
building societies which were also aimed at satisfying demand for
higher-yielding sterling paper.
Yesterday, Abbey National, the Halifax Building Society and Eksportfinans,
the Norwegian government's import-export agency, each issued Pounds 100m
worth of so-called 'reverse' floating-rate notes. The yield on these notes,
for which there is a minimum investment of Pounds 100,000, increases each
time interest rates fall.
The notes offer the holder a fixed return of 7 per cent for the first six
months. For the rest of the notes' three-year life, the coupon will be fixed
at 12 3/8 per cent minus six-month Libor (London Inter Bank Offered Rate),
which stood at 5 7/8 per cent yesterday.
An official at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, which arranged the deal for the Halifax,
said there was good demand for the issue from domestic and continental
institutions, especially income and money-market funds which were having
difficulty in finding high-yielding sterling investments.
Last week, the Leeds Permanent Building Society launched the first
sterling-denominated 'collared' floating-rate notes, followed closely by
Bradford &amp; Bingley and Halifax. These issues, each of Pounds 100m, offered
investors a minimum interest rate (floor) and a maximum interest rate (cap).
Under this structure, the holder receives a higher return than current money
market rates, but will not benefit if rates rise above the level of the cap.
The warm reception to yesterday's reverse floating rate notes reflected a
growing feeling among investors that UK rates are set to fall further, in
spite of government denials of media reports that further cuts are already
planned.
The issuers are believed to have taken steps to protect themselves against
paying out more to the note holders in the event of a base rate cut through
a series of transactions in the swap market, which has left them with
floating rate liability.

FT  04 FEB 93 / A time for companies to stand up for their rights: Maggie
Urry analyses reasons behind a possible shortage in the supply of capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCORDING to stock market gossip, there is a flood of rights issues coming.
The rise in the market has enticed companies to raise new equity capital, to
bolster balance sheets, finance recovery or fund acquisitions.
But there are doubts as to how much investors are prepared or able to stump
up for new equity. There is concern that the government's heavy borrowing
programme in the 1993-94 fiscal year will 'crowd out' companies and take
cash needed by industry for recovery.
Says one senior corporate financier: 'My advice to clients is: 'If it's
there, grab it'.' Another says: 'We are advising clients to go early.'
One large Scottish institutional investor is gloomy about prospects for
issues. He says institutional liquidity levels are low and thinks that by
next month these investors' appetites for new equity may already be fading.
After that only companies with a particularly good case for raising money
will get issues away.
Institutional cash is not the only source of funds for investment in
equities and government stocks, but it is the most reliable, as private and
overseas investors are more fickle. Although cashflows into institutions
have risen in the past couple of years  - in spite of pension fund
contribution holidays  - the demands on cash, especially from the
government, have risen more quickly.
In round numbers, NatWest Securities, the stockbroker, estimates
institutional cashflow this year will be about Pounds 40bn. It estimates
that net gilt sales in the 1993 calendar year might be Pounds 38bn or Pounds
39bn. But a further Pounds 11bn will be accounted for by equity issues,
including rights, the expected ICI demerger issue, flotations and government
sales of shares, less cash put back into the market through takeovers. On
these numbers supply of capital does not match demand.
This year the crunch could come after April as the government needs to fund
the huge public sector deficit in the coming fiscal year.
So far this year three companies have made Pounds 100m-plus equity issues:
Asda, the superstore operator with a Pounds 347m rights; Burton, the fashion
retailer with a Pounds 161m rights; and Wessex Water with a rights and other
funding raising Pounds 144.5m.
Numerous others have been named by rumourmongers as likely candidates for an
issue, often because their balance sheets are strained and seem to need an
injection of equity. But while the list of potential issuers is long, that
of successful issues is likely to be shorter.
Both Asda and Burton were able to point to recovery programmes initiated by
new management as a justification for raising money. Both had 'rescue'
rights issues in 1991  - now they are making recovery issues, and were well
received.
As well as rumours of more retailers making cash calls, the market can
expect rights issues from 'traditional manufacturing companies', says one
banker.
The insurance sector is also seen as a probable source of issues. These
companies can point to a coming cyclical upswing which is well understood by
investors.
Investors' patience is likely to be much thinner with companies which want
to raise cash to repair balance sheets weakened by reduced profits and asset
write-downs. The key may be a change in management. The reaction could be
'Why give money to the people who got us into this mess,' one banker says.
This may exclude many of the rumoured issuers. While the contracting and
construction sector is thought of as needing new equity, many of these
companies will find it hard to give investors good reasons for putting up
more cash.
Nor are they prepared to contribute to companies' 'war chests', although an
actual deal at the right price would find sympathy, as Wessex Water's cash
call did.
Companies which are already struggling to pay dividends  - and perhaps have
a problem with surplus advance corporation tax too  - are unlikely to find
investors receptive to being offered yet more shares which will add to the
payout bill.
The good news may be, though, that the corporate sector's need for new
equity to repair tattered balance sheets is not as bad as might be expected,
according to Mr Michael Hughes, head of Barclays de Zoete Wedd's economics
and strategy department.
He says that industrial and commercial companies' flow of funds which moved
into deficit in 1986, and reached its worst point in 1990, has been
improving as a result of earlier rights issues and efforts to conserve cash
such as cost cutting. He is optimistic it could move into surplus in 1993.
Average balance sheet gearing is a normal 25 per cent, he says, although
income gearing has been more of a problem when interest rates were high and
profits under pressure.
But, Mr Hughes warns, the cost of equity capital is now high in spite of the
level of the stock market. Dividends are paid out of after-tax profits, but
debt is serviced from pre-tax profits. With the market yielding 4.3 per cent
and base rates at 6 per cent there is not a lot to choose between debt and
equity even on a short-term view. When future inflation is taken into
account, equity issued now could turn out expensive.
Companies could look for alternative sources of funds. They might lock into
fixed-rate borrowings, or raise cash by making disposals. Some could follow
Northern Foods, the dairy and foods group, into the convertible market. It
obtained long-term debt at 6.75 per cent, which can convert into shares at
an 18 per cent premium.
There could also be a rash of so-called '5 per cent placings', the maximum
allowed without formal clawback arrangements and done at much narrower
discounts than rights issues.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Germany halts new arms contracts as part of review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, yesterday announced a
standstill on all new defence contracts, and the cancellation of plans to
buy a DM3bn (Pounds 1.27bn) high-altitude US electronic reconnaissance
system, as part of a total review of defence spending.
He told the defence committee of the German Bundestag, the lower house of
the parliament, that he had ordered the review, to be completed by the end
of March or early April, in an effort to find substantial further savings in
the defence budget. Cuts of DM860m must be made this year, and of DM700m a
year from 1994 to 1996, to help pay for increased spending in east Germany.
The minister said no contracts would be exempted from the review, including
that for the redesigned European Fighter Aircraft, being built jointly with
the UK, Italy and Spain.
The move to freeze all contracts, which will also affect any existing
spending plans containing review clauses, will endanger thousands of jobs in
the German defence industry, according to an official of IG Metall, the
engineering workers' union. He called on the government to produce a
coherent concept for conversion of defence production into civilian
manufacture.
The cancellation of plans to buy the so-called Lapas aerial reconnaissance
system, with some DM800m already spent on its development, is likely to
cause a political backlash in the US. The electronic system is manufactured
by E-Systems, of Greenville, Texas, while the high-altitude aircraft
designed to carry it was being produced by a German company, Grob Luft und
Raumfahrt, in Bavaria.
Signature of the government-to-government contract for the system was
abruptly called off by Mr Ruhe last month when it emerged that allegations
of possible corruption were under investigation by the Bonn state
prosecutor's office.
Mr Max Streibl, prime minister of Bavaria, a former inspector of the
Luftwaffe and two senior officials in the arms procurement division of the
defence ministry have all been accused of taking free holidays at the
expense of the Bavarian aircraft manufacturer.
Mr Ruhe's move to freeze all new defence spending, and cancel the Lapas
contract entirely, may for a while divert political attention from the
charges.
Mr Ruhe told the defence committee: 'We can no longer afford to take special
account of domestic, or regional political, or economic factors.' Reduction
in the personnel of the Bundeswehr would take longer to have a significant
effect on budget spending, and so further cuts in equipment contracts must
be instituted.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Rifkind reprieves 3,000 jobs in army about-face
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday sought to head off growing pressure to reverse army
cuts by announcing the reprieve of 3,000 uniformed jobs and the cancellation
of two regimental mergers.
The army, now about 145,000-strong, will be reduced to 119,000 instead of
the controversial 116,000 target set by the government in 1991.
But Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, said in a Commons statement that
the size of the armed forces should not be permanently fixed. He promised to
keep army strength 'under close review in the light of changing
circumstances'.
The surprise change of mind by the government appeared calculated to take
the wind out of the sails of the Commons defence committee, which is to
publish a highly critical report next week calling for the army cuts to be
frozen while requirements are reconsidered.
Officials, however, said adjustments to the 1991 plans had been under
consideration for some months. The Ministry of Defence will have to find
savings of Pounds 80m in other areas of its budget to meet the annual cost
of the change in manpower plans.
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, the defence committee's Conservative chairman, welcomed
the changes, although next week's report would call for 'substantially
more'. He said the government should be prepared to raise numbers further if
UN requirements increased.
Mr David Clark, Labour's def-ence spokesman, described the changes as 'panic
measures' and said they reflected the lack of a national strategy for
defence.
The announcement that four infantry regiments would be saved from
amalgamating into two were greeted with loud cheers from MPs. The Cheshire
Regiment, now in central Bosnia, was due to merge with the Staffordshire
Regiment in September, and the Royal Scots, the oldest 'line' regiment in
the army, was set to join with the King's Own Scottish Borderers in October
next year.
The army will be left with 40 infantry battalions instead of the 38
previously planned. Until recently there were 55. The reprieve will also
allow other units to be brought up to strength.
Mr Rifkind said the streamlining of support services and the hiving off of
some activities should release a further 2,000 personnel for front-line
units.
Reorganisation has meant the gap between emergency tours of duty in Northern
Ireland or overseas is down to about 15 months. Mr Rifkind said the measures
would increase the interval to 17 months this year, and eventually it would
be more than the previous target of 24 months.

FT  04 FEB 93 / Low EC growth threat to Emu: Warning from Brussels over risk
to economic union plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LOW GROWTH in 1993 and 1994 threatens the EC's plans for economic and
monetary union, Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner, said
yesterday.
'The big risk is that there is no growth. If there is nothing to improve the
growth rate, there could be some doubts about the (economic convergence)
criteria for some countries,' the Danish commissioner told reporters.
He was commenting on the European Commission's annual economic report for
1993, published yesterday, which forecasts growth of 1.8 per cent in the
Community next year, following 0.8 per cent this year.
Britain has suffered the longest economic downturn in the post-war era, the
report says. However, the UK economy is showing 'hopeful signs' of a
recovery, with growth forecast at around 1.5 per cent this year and 2.6 per
cent in 1994.
The Commission also predicts that unemployment in the Community will rise to
11 per cent this year, and 11.5 per cent in 1994 - meaning that about 18m
people in the EC could be out of work next year.
Mr Christophersen conceded that the poor growth outlook raised questions
about whether member states could meet the tough criteria on economic
convergence outlined in the Maastricht treaty as a precondition for economic
and monetary union. He repeated calls for Germany to cut its interest rates
to stimulate a recovery.
The Commission has generally avoided statements which could be viewed as
challenging Emu's credibility. While Mr Christophersen said he was confident
that a majority of states would be ready to sign up to Emu in 1997, he
acknowledged there was a 'strong link' between EC efforts to promote growth
and the implementation of the Maastricht's convergence programmes.
The Commission's annual report, which was approved at yesterday's weekly
meeting of the Commission, shows that only four countries - Denmark, France,
Ireland and Luxembourg - met Maastricht's budget deficit criteria last year.
The EC deficit average increased from 4.6 per cent of GDP in 1991 to 5.3 per
cent in 1992. The UK public finances showed a marked deterioration, with the
deficit shooting up from 2.8 per cent of GDP in 1991 to 6.2 per cent in 1992
and a likely 8.3 per cent and 8.2 per cent in 1993 and 1994 respectively.
Differences between member states' inflation records narrowed by about 0.7
per cent to 4.6 per cent, but these were less favourable than in the US and
Japan. Recent devaluations inside the European exchange rate mechanism
threaten to revive inflation among member states, the report says.
At the Commission meeting yesterday, several commissioners were reported to
have expressed concern about continuing instability inside the ERM, and
'social dumping' - whereby workers' rights are downgraded to attract
international investment.
Mr Karel van Miert, EC commissioner for competition policy, said a balance
had to be struck between liberal economic policies and social policy. His
remarks reflected frustration over the UK's opt-out on Maastricht's social
protocol.
Mr Christophersen warned about the risks of 'renationalisation of
macroeconomic policy' undermining Emu - a coded attack on the UK's decision
to float sterling.

FT  04 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Sterling bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The bandwagon theory that interest rates are heading lower is gaining
momentum. Yesterday's spate of reverse floating rate notes in the Eurobond
market is an outright bet on easier money to come. If short rates actually
rise the value of the bonds will be quickly eroded. A week is a long time in
the bond market; only a few days ago investment bankers were touting
collared FRNs. These offered protection against falling interest rates and
some gain if the government is forced to tighten the monetary belt. Whatever
the protestations of the prime minister, the bond market now senses a
determination to move rates lower.
Even so, overseas investors who bought yesterday's offerings were taking an
optimistic view of both interest rates and the exchange rate. Sterling
stabilised yesterday. However, without some help from Germany, it is still
unclear whether Mr Major can engineer a further large cut in base rates
without precipitating a full-blooded sterling crisis. Buyers of reverse FRNs
could eventually find themselves looking at a currency gain, only at the
expense of higher interest rates.

FT  04 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Waste Management
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
European investors have always been wary of Waste Management International.
The flotation of a 20 per cent stake last April was over-subscribed, but US
institutions took more than their fair share. The westward drift of the
share register has been evident ever since. Despite yesterday's impressive
full year figures, investors might be forgiven for being disoriented by the
whirl of acquisitions. The suspicion remains that WMI will be hard pressed
to maintain its rate of growth.
In theory, the long-term investment argument in favour of waste management
is compelling. Privatisation of waste collection and disposal shows no sign
of abating. Tighter regulation by governments should work to the advantage
of the bigger and better-capitalised operators. On that basis, a 50 per cent
rise in pre-tax profits will doubtless please the company's admirers, but
they still need stout hearts.
Although margins widened again, the company admits the process can only be
taken so far. Customers may also be less willing to accept price rises this
year as continental Europe moves into recession. That suggests the
acquisition programme will have to accelerate from the 25 deals completed
last year. Thanks to a rich parent and high multiple, that can probably be
financed without undue reliance on bank debt, but there is clearly a risk of
Waste Management buying some rubbish. In a litigious and uninsurable
business like waste management, mistakes can be costly. Since WMI pays no
dividend, the shares will look all the more exposed if growth prospects are
called into serious doubt.

FT  04 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Electrolux
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As Europe's largest manufacturer of fridges and washing machines, Electrolux
is a sensitive barometer of consumer confidence across the continent.
Judging by yesterday's annual results, Europe's shoppers are a pretty
dispirited bunch. Demand was especially weak in the Nordic countries and
Spain. Germany remained resilient but has now begun to soften. There is no
sign of improvement in the UK.
This bleak outlook prompted Electrolux to halve its dividend after
persevering for two years with an uncovered pay-out. Its shares fell 6 per
cent as a result. The news struck an ominous note for other Swedish
industrial groups at the start of their reporting season. Dividend cuts from
other groups, such as SKF and Stora, are now taken as read.
Electrolux can do little to improve its lot. It has already extensively
rationalised its operations and cut its workforce by 10 per cent. Its
fortunes depend upon a pick-up in demand. The one bright spot is the US, but
Electrolux has a comparatively small share of that market and is burdened by
expensive dollar borrowings. The better corporate news from Sweden will come
from the likes of Asea, Ericsson and Astra, which operate in more resilient
markets and may benefit more from the krona's devaluation.

FT  04 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Currencies under fire
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The equity market obviously enjoys a scare on the currency front.
Yesterday's 39 point gain in London owed something both to the weakness of
sterling itself and to the strains which have resurfaced in the ERM. The
former, though, carries a degree of risk. A weaker pound may help produce
some export-led growth but yesterday morning provided a cautionary reminder
that sterling's fall could easily run out of control, forcing the
authorities to back away prematurely from their easy money policy. Although
the UK has left the ERM, its position would be more secure if tensions
within the system forced a cut in German interest rates. The continental
economic outlook would improve, creating brighter export prospects. Pressure
on sterling would abate, and with it the inflationary threat from unilateral
depreciation.
From this perspective, currency developments in Europe yesterday were good
and bad news. The pressure on the Danish krone is clearly serious. Like
Ireland before it, Denmark is suffering from a severe loss of
competitiveness against its main trading partners. A belief that this could
so undermine the system that the Bundesbank would be forced to cut rates
prompted sharp gains on the Paris and Frankfurt equity markets. The bad
news, for those looking for lower rates, is that it may take some time for
the situation to become critical. Pressure on the French franc is not yet
severe enough to warrant action by the Bundesbank at today's council meeting
 -especially since it has been signalling continuing dissatisfaction with
events on the domestic front.
Lower short-term rates in Europe would also help channel overseas flows into
the UK gilt market, reducing the funding pressure on domestic institutions.
There were tentative signs yesterday that sterling's weakness had prompted a
flicker of foreign interest in gilts, but nothing like the flood required to
cover next year's deficit. One must not exaggerate. A decisive shift in
German policy, if it came, would not be a panacea for the UK. But its
problems would look a lot less daunting than they do at present.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Woolsey spies new targets for the CIA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CIA faces greater challenges in the future than it did during the cold
war, according to Mr James Woolsey, President Bill Clinton's choice to run
the US intelligence agency.
In Senate confirmation hearings yesterday. Mr Woolsey said he would try to
find ways of cutting his agency's budget - still a classified figure but
thought to be about dollars 28.5bn a year - but not to the point of
weakening US intelligence gathering capabilities.
In his prepared statement he said, 'yes, we have slain a large dragon' in
the former Soviet Union. 'But we now live in a jungle filled with a
bewildering variety of poisonous snakes, and in many ways the dragon was
easier to keep track of.'
He thought the CIA's own structure, which he said was prone to 'excessive
compartmentalisation', did not always help in dissemination of necessary
intelligence.
Several senators, all predisposed to confirming him in office, agreed with
this analysis. They drew particular attention to the question of the CIA's
involvement in economic and commercial intelligence.
On Monday, Mr George Stephanopoulos, chief White House spokesman, said Mr
Clinton wanted the agency 'to focus more on economic intelligence, which is
where the real competition is now'.
Senator John Warner, the Virginia Republican, conceded 'the growing number
of views' advocating that the US follow the European lead in this respect.
But, he added, 'these proposals raise serious doubt about the proper role of
the US intelligence community, as well as questions concerning the companies
which would receive such information, and their status as US or
foreign-owned companies'.
But Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat, while agreeing that the
question was 'troublesome,' urged Mr Woolsey to 'grapple with it' and come
up with some 'definite policy'.
While diplomatically neutral in his response to these comments, Mr Woolsey
is known to be interested in the area of economic intelligence.

FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Write-downs could top Pounds 1bn - Size of
contractors' provisions may undermine recovery financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S 10 biggest construction companies are expected to announce
provisions of between Pounds 650m and Pounds 700m when they publish annual
results later this year, according to latest City forecasts.
Warburg Securities and Barclays de Zoete Bevan say the scale of the
provisions, following substantial write-downs last year and in 1990, could
seriously undermine the ability of some companies to raise capital to
finance a recovery.
Total provisions from the sector may top Pounds 1bn when write-downs from
small and medium housebuilders and construction companies are included.
The biggest provision, totalling Pounds 250m, is expected to be made by
Tarmac's construction, property and housing operations.
Wimpey, following warnings issued by the company last month, is expected to
make provisions of Pounds 120m. Taylor Woodrow is expected by both brokers
to make write-downs of about Pounds 65m.
Costain, Amec and Trafalgar House are also forecast to make sizeable
provisions.
The findings provide further bad news for banks which lent large sums in the
late 1980s to finance commercial property and housing developments which in
some cases have fallen below the value of the original loan.
Mr Mark Stockdale, construction analyst for Warburg, said: 'The bulk of the
provisions this time are likely to be against commercial property
developments. This compares with previous years when companies mainly were
writing down housing developments.'
He estimated that the top 20 builders in the four years between 1989 and
1992 between them wrote-off Pounds 800m from the book value of housing land
and developments.
Mr Amarjit Chhina, construction analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said:
'The provisions will make already damaged balance sheets even weaker. It
will make plans for any refinancing even more difficult.'
Construction companies, he says, will need cash to replenish housing stocks
and land banks as the housing market starts to pick up.
Banks, however, may be reluctant to lend more to operations which have
already seen their book value reduced by many millions of pounds as property
and housing prices have fallen sharply.
Shareholders, for the same reason, may be reluctant to support a rights
issue particularly for those construction companies which had issues in
1991, ostensibly to finance a recovery. In many cases this money has been
used to offset cash losses and reduce borrowings.
Construction companies will also find it difficult to use their contracting
operations to generate cash with UK construction output forecast to fall by
a further 2 per cent this year following falls of 6 per cent and 9 per cent
in the two previous years.

Japanese carmaker Mitsubishi seems to have scored an own goal by luring
German soccer star Franz Beckenbauer away from Mercedes- Benz to be its
chief pr 'personality' in Europe.
There were loud grumblings among Dutch fans attending this week's opening of
Mitsubishi's glitzy new European headquarters in Amsterdam. As Mitsubishi is
also making its European manufacturing debut through a joint venture with
Nedcar, the Dutch government-backed carmaker, wouldn't it have been better
to have given the job to the Netherlands' legendary Johan Cruyff, instead of
hiring an expensive German transfer?

FT  03 FEB 93 / Heron acts to cut advisers' fees in restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERON, the property and trading company negotiating a Pounds 1.4bn debt
restructuring deal with its banks and bond holders, has acted to limit the
'cost spiral' involved in the process.
Heron's decision has implications for other companies in similar talks also
facing huge fees for professional advice.
Since talks started in March last year fees have totalled nearly Pounds 40m.
Heron, Mr Gerald Ronson's private company, said it would no longer pay fees
it did not regard as essential to the refinancing.
Heron also said it planned to present final proposals to creditors by the
end of this month. The group said it could not comment on rumours that a
revaluation of its properties, being prepared as part of the documentation
for the deal, showed a further fall of Pounds 100m since March last year.
But its first public mention of an end-February deadline appeared designed
to quash speculation that the talks were being held up by creditors' concern
about property values.
In order to preserve cash resources, Heron said, it would 'no longer be
responsible for fees of advisers other than those which in (Heron's) view
are essential to the restructuring process'.
It had had to devote 'disproportionate resources' to verifying data already
prepared under due diligence procedures.
Heron stressed that its Heron Corporation subsidiary in the UK, which
includes the housebuilding and automotive divisions as well as property
companies in the UK, France and Switzerland, had substantial cash resources
and positive net assets.
As well as paying its own advisers, such as lawyers, merchant bankers and
accountants, Heron was obliged to 'fund and deal with the queries of more
than 17 other firms of advisers representing creditor groups'.
It said that the time and money being devoted to this was 'not in the
interest of the company's creditors and could potentially threaten the
successful completion of the restructuring'. Without the refinancing the
group would be forced into receivership.
Heron said this decision, taken at the weekend, would 'protect the interests
of creditors by bringing the cost spiral of the debt restructuring process
to an end'.

FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: Fyffes tops expectations with
advance to IPounds 28.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FYFFES, the Dublin-based fruit wholesaler, reported a 5.26 per cent increase
in pre-tax profits from IPounds 27.1m to IPounds 28.5m (Pounds 29.3m) for
the year to October 31, on turnover down 13.8 per cent to IPounds 524m.
The company said it believed the results represented 'a significant
achievement in the light of more difficult trading conditions this year', a
view endorsed by analysts in Dublin who said the results were slightly ahead
of expectations.
Sales volume had actually increased, the reduced turnover reflecting low
fresh produce prices in the UK market, and stiff competition in the European
banana market.
Mr Carl McCann, group finance director, said that the withdrawal of sterling
from the ERM last September and its subsequent devaluation had also deflated
the profit and turnover figures, 'as most of our business is done in
sterling'.
He said that the translation difference was 16 per cent, the results in 1991
being calculated at an exchange rate of 92p to the pound, while the 1992
results were calculated at 109p to the pound.
The company said it expects sales in the mainland European market to grow in
1993 as a result of its deal with Saba Trading in Sweden to supply 'a
substantial part of their banana requirements under the Fyffes label' and
which also allows Fyffes to take a stake in Saba's Dutch and Spanish
distribution subsidiaries.
The company also drew attention to the fact that it has now obtained the
right to use the Fyffes trademark worldwide 'which is essential to the
development of our international business in the new single market in
Europe'.
Mr McCann said that the new EC banana regime, which will come into force in
July, 'may make it more difficult to get direct volume growth, and will mean
we will have to focus more on acquisition'.
The company has a IPounds 100m cash hoard, most of it currently on deposit
in the Dublin market where it has been able to attract high interest rates
during the currency crisis.
Brokers in Dublin said this should improve profit figures for 1993, as
should the punt's devaluation this week and improved trading conditions
throughout the EC.
Earnings per share were 5.9p (6.73p) and a 10 per cent increase in the final
dividend to 0.8978p is recommended, making a total of 1.2527p.

FT  03 FEB 93 / NUM wins ruling over pit ballot
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INDUSTRIAL tribunal yesterday ordered British Coal to pay Pounds 10,000
compensation to the National Union of Mineworkers for refusing to allow a
pithead ballot two years ago over the use of private contractors in tunnels
at Ellington Colliery, Northumberland.
By the time a postal ballot had been held the contractors were working
underground.

<TEXT>
IBM, the US computer group, has joined other US high-technology companies
waging an intellectual property war with Japan by filing suit against
Kyocera, the bioceramics and electronics company, for alleged copyright
infringement.
IBM claims Kyocera infringed its copyright covering its basic input/output
system (PC BIOS) and is demanding Y18.7bn (Pounds 103.3m) damages.
Kyocera responded by stating that the BIOS it uses in its machines is a
programme that the company developed independently of IBM's programme.
IBM's move comes after nearly three years' negotiations between the two
companies. IBM said it was bringing the court action in Tokyo partly to
counter possible criticism in Japan of a biased judgment if it should win
its case in a US court.

FT  03 FEB 93 / BP arm in energy deal with Ford
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BP ENERGY, a subsidiary of British Petroleum, has won a contract to manage
the energy requirements of Ford's Halewood plant on Merseyside - the largest
ever UK contract energy project.
The move could save the plant more than Pounds 1m a year on its Pounds 11m
fuel bill for 210MW of energy - equivalent to the heating requirements of a
small town.
As well as obtaining the cheapest deal, BP Energy will make any changes in
the plant's energy systems, such as the construction of a combined heat and
power plant, if they provide cost savings.
BP Energy's responsibilities at Halewood include steam production for making
gear boxes, high-pressure hot water for air conditioning, compressed air for
manufacturing, electricity and water distribution systems and all heating
and ventilating at the plant.
Mr Nick Coleman, managing director of BP Energy, said: 'Out-sourcing energy
operations is now an option which more major industrial companies are
seriously considering.'
The contract energy management business is in its infancy but with most UK
utilities now privatised more companies are turning to specialist managers.
BP Energy is targeting all industrial, commercial and public-sector sites
with energy demand greater than 2MW - a market where energy costs exceed
Pounds 9bn.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Mexico's air traffic control deal flies into flak: The award
of the contract for the country's new system has called up a storm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S crowded air corridors are one manifestation of the country's
economic recovery. But air traffic is growing far faster than the economy,
and that is putting Mexico's air traffic control system under immense
strain.
Some 700 flights a day used Mexico City airport last year, with commercial
traffic 32 per cent up on 1991. The air traffic control system was designed
in the late 1970s to handle less than half that.
The computers used by the system in the main air traffic control centres are
not integrated, so as a result operators have to talk to each other through
a hotline about flights passing from one zone to another.
Mexico's air traffic control agency last year began briefing air traffic
technology companies on plans for a radical upgrading of the system,
including - most importantly - the integration of the system's computers.
However, the awarding of the prestigious contract to the two European
companies which installed the current system has brought strong protests to
the Mexican government from competing US and Canadian companies. IBM,
Westinghouse and Raytheon's Canadian subsidiary have formally complained
about alleged irregularities in the tender process which resulted in the
award of the Dollars 21.1m contract to Thomson of France for the data
processing system and Alenia, a subsidiary of IRI of Italy, to provide the
radars.
The tender, announced in August, was cancelled at the last moment on
November 19 because, according to the official explanation, none of the
seven contenders complied with the technical specifications. Seven bids to
supply data processing equipment and radars were made: IBM, which bid only
to provide data processing equipment, Calmaquip offering Westinghouse
technology, Raytheon Canada, Thomson, Plessey (Siemens), Toshiba of Japan
and Alenia.
Mr Roberto Kobeh, head of Seneam, the state company in charge of air traffic
control, said experts from his agency, the Mexican Institute of
Communication, an independent government body, and the Canadian company
Martin Marietta signed a document outlining where the companies had not
complied with the tender requirements. He showed such a document to an FT
reporter but would not let him read it in full, nor identify where these
companies were not complying.
However, an agent acting for IBM claims he was told before the cancellation
that the tender would be called off unless he paid money. According to the
agent, Mr Kaveh Moussavi, an Oxford-educated entrepreneur with homes in the
US and UK, three men - apparently Mexican officials - arranged to meet him
in his hotel, the Nikko in Mexico City. They initially asked for Dollars 1m
and then for lower amounts, according to Mr Moussavi, eventually suggesting
a donation to the Mexican government's anti-poverty programme, Solidarity.
Mr Moussavi says he declined to entertain the proposals of the men whom he
described as well-informed about the tender. He told them that if they were
officials seeking a bribe or were going to pay over the money to officials,
it was illegal under US law for a US company to make such a payment. There
is no independent corroboration of the meeting.
IBM, Calmaquip and Raytheon vehemently deny that their bids did not comply
with the tender requirements. Mr Armando Paz, chief financial officer of the
Miami-based Calmaquip, said: 'Westinghouse and IBM use the newest, most
advanced technology in the world. . . If someone says you do not comply that
is unacceptable and you fight to the end. It is a slight to our reputation.'
IBM in its protest says: 'Contrary to the evaluation reported in the
referenced letter, IBM believes it is fully compliant with the
specification.' Raytheon is of the same opinion.
An IBM spokesman also said the protest argued that the government, in
awarding the tender, had failed to take account of the cost of the system
over its lifetime - including maintenance and spares - which Seneam had
originally said would significantly influence its decision. According to the
US company, the second tender was awarded only on the basis of the system's
acquisition cost.
In the first tender offer, the protesting companies and diplomats who have
seen the relevant documents say Thomson offered to supply the computers for
the air traffic control system at Dollars 33m - making it by far the most
expensive system on offer. IBM says it offered Dollars 21.5m in the first
offer, with Raytheon offering still less.
Mr Kobeh of Seneam says the Dollars 33m figure is too high, and that Thomson
offered to supply the computers at Dollars 25m. Thomson refused to comment
on this or any other matters relating to the case.
The government called a second round of bids in December with reduced
specifications. There was consternation among competitors when the winning
Dollars 13.2m bid by Thomson for the computer system was made public. 'I
can't see how any company can reduce its bid by that amount of money,' says
Mr Paz.
The other contenders reduced bids by a maximum of 9 per cent, against the
reduction of 47 or 60 per cent by Thomson in the computer bids. Together
with Alenia's winning Dollars 7.9m radar bid, the combined bid was just
Dollars 600,000 below the next-lowest combined bid of Dollars 21.7m by
Raytheon.
Calmaquip says it believes Thomson did not comply with specifications in the
second bid, since the Thomson system is not fully operational in another
country - one of the conditions of the tender. Mr Kobeh said Thomson's basic
technology is used in many parts of the world, but claimed all of the
systems offered were tailor-made to suit Mexico's needs.
Thomson's refusal to comment has made it difficult to know whether some of
these claims reflect the frustration of US companies of not being able to
offer such attractive terms as a state-owned European group, such as
Thomson. Aggressive pricing in such tenders is not unknown and may simply
reflect the importance of the business for the European company.
If, as Mr Kobeh claims, there were no irregularities in the bidding process,
the unwillingess of the Mexican authorities to release promptly all the
relevant documents has left the US and Canadian companies feeling cheated.
At the least, the bitter complaints and report of requests for money in a
hotel room feed a common - if still to be substantiated - view that
favouritism and corruption clouds awards of many government contracts in
Mexico.
Nafta will over time open up most of Mexico's public sector procurement to
US and Canadian companies. But critics of Nafta have long argued that as
long as corruption plays an important part of business, companies that play
by the rules will not benefit fully from such market opening.
While the business climate has improved immeasurably in Mexico in recent
years, corruption remains a way of life for many well-placed lower and
middle-level officials, and is rife in the police force, and parts of the
judiciary. If a company loses a contract for not influencing the right
people, it will find it difficult to use Mexico's legal system to recover
damages. And if corruption comes to light, it is often when the official
concerned is out of political favour. Those blessed with a powerful patron
usually remain well-protected.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Multinationals furious over Mexican contract
</HEADLINE>

   MEXICO CITY, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE multinationals have formally complained to the Mexican government
about alleged irregularities in the awarding of a Dollars 21m contract for
the renewal of Mexico's air traffic control system.
The complaints come at a sensitive time for Mexico as the North American
Free Trade Agreement awaits ratification by the US Congress and the
legislatures in Mexico and Canada.
The agreement, which is expected to have an awkward passage in Washington,
is meant to open up most procurement for the Mexican public sector to US and
Canadian companies.
IBM, Westinghouse and Raytheon's Canadian subsidiary allege that an initial
tender to replace the system was unjustifiably cancelled. They also claim
that they lost a second tender to a rival bid which had been reduced by an
inexplicably large margin and did not comply with the tender requirements.
The air traffic control contract was awarded in December to the two European
companies responsible for Mexico's current air traffic control system:
Thomson of France will provide the new data processing system and Alenia of
Italy the radars.
The complaints are being investigated by the office of Mexico's General
Comptroller of the Federation, which monitors how Mexican government money
is spent. They have been delivered by the US and Canadian embassies in
Mexico and, according to those involved, are unusual in their ferocity.
The comptroller's office declined to comment on the allegations until it had
time to review the documents relating to the two tenders.
The initial tender for the prestigious contract to replace the 14-year-old
system was announced in August, but cancelled abruptly on November 19. The
reason given for the cancellation was that none of the seven bidding
companies had complied with the tender requirements.
This has infuriated the US and Canadian companies which claim world
leadership in the technology, and deny that they failed to comply in any
material way with the almost 200 requirements.

FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: IBM aims to dominate market in
workstations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines aims to become the world leader in the
Dollars 9bn computer workstation market by 1994, executives of the US
computer company said yesterday.
They were introducing aggressively priced new workstation models, among
which was a Dollars 4,000 desktop workstation priced to undercut competing
colour graphics workstations from Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard.
IBM also unveiled powerful parallel-processing systems that achieve
supercomputer-level performance using up to 64 of the microprocessor chips
used in IBM's workstations.
The new products signal an effort by IBM to capitalise on reduced
instruction set computing (Risc) technology, which was invented in its
research laboratories but which competitors, such as Sun and
Hewlett-Packard, have been quicker to exploit.
'There should be no doubt that we intend to be very competitive and very
aggressive in this market,' said Mr Bill Filip, IBM vice-president and
president of its Advanced Workstations and Systems business.
But IBM, which first entered the market for Risc workstations three years
ago, is trailing Sun, with an estimated 32 per cent of the world market, and
Hewlett-Packard with 20 per cent.
According to Dataquest, the US market research group, IBM was in third place
in the workstation market with an 18 per cent share in 1992. Mr Filip said
that IBM workstation revenues rose by between 30 and 35 per cent last year
and that sales growth in the first quarter was outpacing last year's.
IBM has entered a crowded field of companies sometimes using hundreds of
standard microprocessors to achieve performances equivalent to mainframe and
supercomputers.

FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: BA set to market some USAir
internal flights 'as its own'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways plans to market certain flights to internal US destinations
operated by USAir, in which it has invested Dollars 300m, 'as though those
services were BA's own'.
It will also put its own logo and signs over check-in facilities at airports
from which these services depart.
The UK-based carrier will make clear to customers that these 'code-share'
flights - which will carry the airline designator code of both carriers -
are being operated by USAir, the sixth-largest US carrier.
These are some of the critical details of a proposed 'code-share' agreement
between the two airlines, spelt out in a copious filing made late on Monday
with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Also in the filing are details of the revised investment agreement between
the two companies. This reveals that USAir will seek to divest its US-UK
routes as soon as possible, and that BA will apply to take over the
Charlotte-London, Pittsburgh-London and Baltimore-London services, using
USAir pilots and cabin crew.
The aim is for the two companies to share profits from the routes but, if
this is not feasible, BA will pay USAir up to Dollars 50m over a five-year
period.
The 'big three' US carriers - American, Delta and United - successfully
utilised some of the 'small print' contained in an earlier SEC filing by BA
to lobby against the British carrier's previous plan to invest Dollars 750m
into USAir in return for a 44 per cent equity interest.
BA has since revised that proposal, injecting Dollars 300m into USAir in
return for securities which can convert into a 19.9 per cent voting interest
in USAir. The new investment agreement allows BA to invest another Dollars
200m over the next three years, and a further Dollars 250m over the
following five years.
Yesterday, the big three US carriers were taking some comfort from comments
made by the new transportation secretary, Mr Federico Pena, that the Clinton
administration viewed issues arising from the 'interface' between US
carriers and foreign markets as a 'very high priority' and was 'currently
looking at the creation of a special group which will help us evaluate the
status of the airline industry.'

FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: GM to take accounting charge of
Dollars 20.8bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors, the struggling US carmaker, is to take a Dollars 20.8bn
after-tax charge to comply with a new standard of accounting for the
post-retirement health benefits of employees.
The company also announced it would be taking a much larger-than-expected
fourth-quarter charge relating to its plan to sell a significant proportion
of its stake in National Car Rental Systems.
This is now expected to work through at Dollars 744m after tax. The company
previously suggested a Dollars 300m charge might be necessary. It said the
increase related primarily to the write-off of goodwill on NCRS' books.
All US companies have to adopt the new accounting standard, but GM's charge
is expected to be by far the biggest of any corporation, because of both the
company's size and the age profile of its workforce.
GM stressed the charge - which works through at Dollars 33.38 a share, and
will be applied retroactively to January last year - is a non-cash item
which will not affect the company's cash flow or ability to pay dividends.
However, it will cause a major dent in the equity on the company's balance
sheet.
The accounting standard, FASB 106, involves changing from a system of
recognising the cost of retiree health benefits when the money is paid out,
to a system of recognising the expense when the obligation is incurred.
Companies could choose either take a charge for catching up on past
obligations in one go, as GM has done, or amortise the cost over 20 years.
Mr Richard Wagoner, chief financial officer, said GM had decided on a
one-time charge.
Companies also have an additional ongoing annual charge, which GM said would
amount to Dollars 1.4bn, or Dollars 2.05 a share, in 1992.
The size of the charge was no surprise to Wall Street, since GM had
signalled that it faced an obligation of roughly this size. The only
question was whether it would take it in one go, or over 20 years.
Mr Wagoner said GM continued to be encouraged by recent trends in its
loss-making North American operations and continued to aim for break-even
there in 1993 before interest, tax and FASB 106 expenses.
GM also elected two new non-executive board members: Dr Louis Sullivan,
president of the Morehouse college school of medicine who was health
secretary under President Bush; and Mr John Bryan, chairman of foods group
Sara Lee.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Ward says he put Pounds 3.2m in Swiss bank for tax bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR THOMAS WARD, the US lawyer who advised Guinness on its takeover of
Distillers, paid Pounds 3.2m into the Swiss bank account of Mr Ernest
Saunders, the company's former chief executive, to put money aside for his
tax bill, he told the Old Bailey yesterday.
He owed the US tax authorities about Pounds 3.2m and wanted to keep this
money separate from the rest of the Pounds 5.2m success fee that Mr Saunders
had paid him, Mr Ward told the jury.
He said in evidence that he wanted to place the money in a Swiss bank
because he had always thought them 'the most secure banks in the world'. As
a foreigner it would have been difficult for him to open a Swiss account
himself.
He told Mr Andrew Trollope QC, his counsel, that Mr Saunders had agreed to
allow the use of his account to deposit the money. Mr Ward denies a single

for Distillers.
Later, cross-examined by Mr Victor Temple, prosecuting, Mr Ward agreed that
the agreement between him and Mr Saunders over his Pounds 5.2m fee was never

'It was simply the way this business (Guinness) was run,' he said.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Ex-SAS man tells jury of NCP spying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SECURITY company hired by National Car Parks to spy on Europarks, its main
business rival, prolonged its industrial espionage to earn more money from
NCP, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday.
Preliminary investigations into Europarks by KAS, the security company set
up by Sir David Stirling, founder of the Special Air Service, indicated the
company was winning car park contracts fairly by undercutting NCP, the court
heard.
Europarks was not winning business by obtaining confidential information
about NCP as its rival had initially suspected.
Identified only as Mr C, a former consultant with KAS agreed the contract
had been revived as an 'earner' on the initiative of Mr Kenneth Edwards, a
KAS finance director, and others.
Mr C, a former SAS soldier, said he had then briefed Ms Jane Turpin, a
former Army captain, on security procedures before she was planted as a mole
in Europarks' organisation. Mr Simon Hewitt, then a manager with KAS, and Mr
Edwards had separately told him of their intention to use Ms Turpin to 'get
the information or to see if there was any information'.
Mr C agreed that the management of KAS, which he had once regarded as the
'Rolls Royce' of security companies, was more than 'a bit of a shambles'.
Mr Hewitt and Mr Gordon Layton, NCP chief executive, both deny conspiring to
defraud Europarks by dishonestly acquiring information relating to its
business affairs between January 1987 and January 1989.
Earlier Mr David Paterson, another former KAS employee, described how he
wrote a feasibility report outlining a possible covert operation to gain
information about Europarks and its personnel as well as another project to
identify security deficiencies in NCP.
He also described his attempts to secure a job with Europarks using a false
curriculum vitae which left out his work as a policeman and
counter-insurgence intelligence operative in Rhodesia. He admitted deceiving
Europarks but he had regarded the NCP project as the legitimate activity of
a security company.
The trial continues today.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Second rescue for Faroe Islands bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Danish government has put up DKr350m (Pounds 36.3m) to rescue the
largest bank on the Faroe Islands, Sjovinnubanken (Fisheries Bank), from
collapse, the second time the Danes have had to help within a few months,
writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. The North Atlantic island group,
population 47,000, is a part of the Kingdom of Denmark but enjoys extensive
home rule.
The islands have been plunged into crisis by a combination of high
government spending programmes and a decline in income from fisheries, which
account for 97 per cent of export earnings.
The Danish government propped up the privately-owned Sjovinnubanken with
DKr500m last autumn, on condition that the islands' government sought the
advice of experts from the International Monetary Fund on a policy to
restore the economy.
This week's support for the bank was made conditional on a reduction in the
fisheries fleet, tax changes, and a halt to public investment programmes.
The islands' crisis follows large expansion of the fisheries fleet and
filleting factories in the 1980s, encouraged by direct and indirect
government subsidies, and an ambitious investment programme.
The investments were financed by borrowing heavily abroad, with the result
that the net foreign debt at the end of 1991, at DKr8.1bn, was about
DKr175,000 per inhabitant.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fairhaven International yesterday announced the final verdict of the court
judgment between its 36 per cent-owned Nishika Group and Minnesota Mining
and Manufacturing Company.
Fairhaven, a specialist within the oil, gas and petrochemical construction
industries, was seeking damages from 3M after it changed the emulsion
formula of its 3-D print material, causing Nishika 3-D photographs to fade
and lose colour.
The value of the final judgment against 3M is Dollars 29.9m (Pounds 19.8m),
which includes the initial award of Dollars 25.5m made on December 31 for
damages plus pre-judgment interest.
3M may appeal against the judgment but will have to pay interest of 10 per
cent on the full Dollars 29.9m until it is settled.

FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Dixons installs new chief at US offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIXONS, the electrical goods retailer, has replaced the head of Silo, its US
subsidiary which last month announced mounting losses.
Mr Robert Sirkis, who was appointed president in September 1991, has left
the company and been replaced by Mr Peter Morris, Dixons group property
director.
Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman, said Mr Morris was 'a better man for the job. He
has a greater knowledge of what we want to do'.
Analysts said the appointment suggested Dixons was taking closer control of
Silo. Most of the original US senior management has now been replaced and
more decisions are being taken in London.
Dixons bought Silo in 1987 for Dollars 320m and, as with several other UK
retailers in the US, has seen its investment perform poorly. Silo was hit
hard by the US recession and last month announced operating losses of Pounds
14.9m in the 28 weeks to November 14.
Silo is closing 45 of its 225 stores, which is likely to cost Dollars 40m
(Pounds 26.4m), and full year operating losses are likely to exceed last
time's Pounds 16.9m. Some analysts do not expect the company to return to
profit for several years. 'They are making the effort to sort it out, but
long term problems of over eager expansion and poor store location remain,'
one said.
Mr Morris, 45, joined Dixons in 1988 but is not well known in the industry.
He is a member of Dixons retail management group of senior managers, but not
of the main board. He has recently spent time in the US overseeing Silo's
property review and will take charge of the company's disposal programme,
which Mr Kalms described as 'well under way', and store remodelling.
Dixons shares gained 3p to 226p.

years, is to become under-secretary general for political affairs as part of
a reorganisation programme initiated by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the

Mr Goulding's successor will be his Ghanaian deputy, Mr Kofi Annan. Mr
Goulding, a former member of Britain's UN mission and later ambassador to
Angola, replaces Mr Vladimir Petrovsky, a former Soviet deputy foreign
minister, who moves to Geneva as head of the UN European Office.
Mr Antoine Blanca, current UN chief in Geneva, will be returning to the

effective on March 1.
Mr Boutros Ghali will soon have to replace Mr Dick Thornburgh, former US

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BLACKS, Arabs and Asians are suffering racist violence in western Europe at
the hands of the very security forces who should be protecting them, Amnesty
International says in a report released today, Reuter reports from London.
The human rights group says police across the continent have taken part in
bloody racist attacks and treated ethnic minorities in a degrading manner.
'We know of people being badly beaten up, a 14-year-old asylum seeker having
his arm broken, a motorcyclist being run down by a car and then beaten up by
the driver - all assaulted not by racist organisations but by police
officers,' the report says.
Amnesty says it is 'pitifully rare' for police officers to be brought to
justice for such behaviour.
It urges governments to take firm action against torture or ill-treatment by
police and other security forces. It recommends pre-employment screening of
police officers for racist attitudes and dismissal where appropriate for
those who persist in racial discrimination.
Amnesty cites cases in nine European countries, including Britain, France,
Germany, Italy, Austria and Denmark.
In Austria, Amnesty names a man of Egyptian descent who was singled out by
police for jay-walking within a group of European pedestrians.
When the man refused to pay a fine he was subjected to racial abuse by the
officers, beaten up and pushed through a window while in custody. No police
officers have been prosecuted.
In Italy, a Somali asylum-seeker was rushed to hospital last year after
being beaten unconscious in police custody, Amnesty says.
'In the present climate, with racial attacks on the increase and racist
groups growing in size . . . failure to act is tantamount to condoning
racist crimes in society at large,' Amnesty says.

<TEXT>
THE government yesterday attempted to reassure passengers that the so-called
network benefits of a single national railway would not be lost as a result
of fragmentation by franchising.
The national timetable would be preserved, it said. So would
through-ticketing, making it possible to book tickets from principal
stations in one franchise area to stations in other franchise areas.
However, this would not be possible for all journeys, such as those
commencing at unmanned stations.
Railcards giving discounts to disabled people would be continued as a
special concession.
The Department of Transport offered no guarantees on the continuation of
other benefits such as bargain fares. But Mr John MacGregor, transport
secretary, said it would be in the commercial interests of private sector
train operators to get more passengers on to the railways by offering
attractive fares.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Auditors called to account: The DTI is studying the results
of one year of professional self-regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Within the next few days, senior Department of Trade and Industry officials
are to issue their verdict on the future of audit regulation in the UK. For
the accountancy profession, their conclusions are unlikely to be comforting.
The first year of the new self-regulatory regime for auditors ended last
October. The government is now considering the outcome in advance of a
fuller review of the system at the end of this year.
What emerges is a picture of failure by many parts of the profession to meet
the standards it has set for itself. Equally important, far wider concerns
over the scope and provision of audits and the mechanisms for their
regulation have been put under the spotlight.
Auditing - the annual independent scrutiny of a company's accounts - was
first enshrined in UK law in the middle of the last century in response to a
series of financial scandals. It became mandatory at the turn of the century
for all incorporated companies - those which limit liability to assets of
the business.
But the question of who audits the auditors was not addressed until far more
recently. It was only in 1989 that a new UK companies act - generated by
requirements in the EC's eighth company law directive - introduced the
requirement for regulation of the profession.
A regulatory regime was set up by October 1991, to be overseen by the DTI
but run by the accountancy profession's own bodies. All firms and individual
practitioners who wished to audit companies had to register with one of five
bodies: the three chartered accountancy institutes covering the UK, the
chartered association of certified accountants, or the association of
authorised public accountants - a small group outside these bodies.
The reports submitted to the DTI by the five bodies have raised concerns
over the quality of auditing. They examine a significant number of
complaints mainly by companies or investors over issues such as the level of
fees, lack of response to correspondence and inadequate audit work.
Inspectors from the five professional groups identified problems in a high
proportion of both random visits and those triggered by complaints. From 158
random visits to auditors by the three chartered bodies, just 11 firms
passed all of a series of questions on audit independence, control, training
and methods. As one senior regulator says: 'I'm not happy. It's no use
sweeping it under the carpet. Serious action has to be taken.'
Those views are echoed by Mr Harry Youngs, head of practice regulation at
the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants. 'The results don't come
as any great surprise,' he says. 'One of the biggest problems for a
significant minority of small practitioners is competence. The standards in
the large firms have not always been reflected at the smaller end.'
Two recent surveys of audit practitioners have shown that many have been
forced to make fundamental changes to their systems and procedures to meet
the requirements of the regulatory regime.
Publicly, the regulators are playing down the findings of the reports. They
say that random monitoring only got fully under way in the second half-year
of the new regime, from last spring. Once firms understood that mechanisms
had been introduced to monitor standards, many quickly improved their
performance.
Mr Colin Brown, head of the chartered accountants' audit regulation policy
co-ordinating committee, says: 'It is too early to make any final judgments.
There are elements that need to be remedied and they are being remedied.'
Other regulators stress that many auditors judged unsatisfactory had not
delivered poor-quality audits. Rather, they did not have adequate
documentary records to back up their conclusions. However, the reports of
the five bodies provide little evidence to support this view.
What they do show is the highly segmented structure of the auditing
profession. There are nearly 14,300 separate registered audit firms and
practitioners in the UK (a firm counts as one, no matter how many audit
practitioners it employs). But just 161 firms audit all companies quoted on
the London Stock Exchange, and eight firms alone audit three-quarters of
them. If another tier of 1,300 large, unquoted companies is added, there are
still only about 300 firms carrying out the audits. All the other auditors
share the remaining 1.1m limited liability companies.
Auditing standards have been focused on the few large firms which carry out
the vast majority of audits on leading UK companies. But they have been
applied equally to the large number of small firms and their many, less
significant clients. The imbalance revealed by the figures in the reports is
fuelling calls made over the past year by chartered accountants and small
business groups that statutory audits should be abolished for small
companies - a position currently being examined by the DTI.
The submissions have also raised questions about how effective monitoring is
proving. 'The problem is trying to find one set of standards to suit
everyone, which are going to get under the surface of the big firms and not
overload the small ones,' says Ms Stella Fearnley, an lecturer at
Southampton University.
One difficulty is assessing quality when many of the most important auditing
issues are based on subjective judgment and rarely committed to paper.
Ensuring consistency of standards across a large firm with many offices is
equally troublesome. A possible solution may be peer review by partners in a
comparably sized firm.
Another concern highlighted by the reports is the highly complex structure
of regulation. The three chartered bodies have a single joint monitoring
unit which inspects firms and then refers any problems to their three
separate registration and disciplinary committees. The certifieds have their
own monitoring unit, which also carries out supervision for the authorised
accountants.
The existence of separate bodies is a legacy of fiercely independent
professions with their own qualifications and practices. But it creates
difficulties in ensuring that audit regulation is consistently applied.
The target number of visits and the time spent on them varies. The
certifieds have pledged to inspect each auditor every five years. The
chartereds have only made this commitment for the auditors of listed
companies. Their current plans - ratified by the DTI - allow them to inspect
just 150 of the remaining firms each year, which means that they will take
60 years to cover all practitioners.
There is a final, wider issue: whether the profession can police itself
effectively. While many auditors have been criticised in the three reports,
the number against whom action has been taken is smaller (see chart), and
none of the disciplinary proceedings is open to public scrutiny.
All the bodies are caught between two roles which may be incompatible - as
regulators upholding the public interest and as trade associations
representing their members' interests. On one hand, they face rising
regulatory costs - totalling more than Pounds 4m last year - which are
passed on to their members in annual registration fees and compliance costs.
On the other, any threat of withdrawing audit authorisation could jeopardise
their members' livelihoods. Both may increasingly threaten to compromise
their ability to act independently.
Add to that, growing public scepticism towards auditing in the light of
recent corporate frauds and collapses, and the demand for accountants to be
independently regulated so they can be seen to be independent may yet prove
irresistible.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Letter: Railway privatisation in Britain and Germany
similarly flawed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JORG SCHIMMELPFENNIG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his letter (January 29) Mr Godward correctly points to the
simplicity of the German rail privatisation proposal which, by reducing the
uncertainty among both train makers and would-be private train operators, is
less damaging than the British one. Nonetheless, both plans are basically
flawed in the very same way. By requiring the rail-track authorities to earn
a commercial return on their assets, or at least to break even, both higher
fares and line closures will become unavoidable, in contrast to the
assurances given by the transport secretary, Mr John MacGregor.
This not only puts the rail travelling public, already suffering from
chronic under-investment in the rail system, at a further disadvantage. It
makes rail freight uncompetitive ('SNCF hints it may sue over UK rail plans'
January 29) and results in an overall loss of benefit. This is because
natural monopolies, as is well known from basic economic theory, have to be
subsidised, that is, sell their services at below average costs, in order to
allocate them with economic efficiency.
Of course, there are some gains to be expected from rail privatisation. As a
number of both theoretical and empirical studies show, private enterprises
are on average more cost-efficient than their public counterparts. The main
reasons are that in the public sector there is more bureaucratic waste and
managers lack incentives to employ cost-reducing measures. However, it is
far from clear whether the benefits to be gained from increased cost
efficiency can outweigh the loss of efficiency in allocating services. There
is nothing wrong with running a railway along commercial lines once the
overall goals have been formulated. But the goals themselves should not be
allowed to be confused with those arising from commercial viability. As the
Beeching experience from the 1960s has shown, the damage inflicted by a
misguided railway policy might become irreparable.

FT  03 FEB 93 / A line in the marsh: A cautionary tale of Europe's future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From where he stood, leaning against the cornice of the bay window, the
prime minister could just read some of the banners as the parade passed up
Whitehall: 'Stop fascism now'; 'Hands off Listonia'; 'Today Listonia,
tomorrow London'.
Wearily he turned to face the room where his colleagues were awaiting a
decision they knew only he could take. Foreign policy was, after all,
Douglas Hurd's acknowledged forte. It was the reputation he had built up as
foreign secretary, steering British interests through the rocks and
whirlpools of the 'new disorder', that had made him the obvious choice to
lead the national government formed after the UK economy collapsed in 1994.
It quickly became clear that Hurd was the only Tory prime minister Labour
would serve under, and no one objected to his keeping the foreign office as
well. His success in dissuading the Clinton administration from blundering
into Bosnia in its first year was generally admired, not least in the
British and US armed forces, who believed he had saved them from a
Vietnam-like quagmire.
And now, Douglas knew as he looked round the anxious faces at the cabinet
table, they were relying on him to do it again. The Listonian crisis was
getting out of hand. Those TV pictures of villages laid waste by Cossack
'irregulars', who everyone knew were operating from bases in Russian
territory, had brought in massive postbags for every MP.
Why was that, Douglas wondered, refilling his cup of Earl Grey tea to give
himself a moment's more thinking time. After all, destroyed villages in
eastern Europe were a pretty familiar sight. Even back in 1993 he had told
the Royal Institute of International Affairs that 'there is nothing new in
mass rape, in the shooting of civilians, in war crimes, ethnic cleansing, in
the burning of towns and villages'. At that time such things still had a
certain power to shock when they happened in Europe and were shown on TV,
but surely we were past that by now.
Perhaps it was the swastikas daubed on the walls, or the fact that the male
inhabitants of all ages had been mutilated? Or was it the way the tabloid
press - so much of it now German-owned or influenced - was playing up the
story? Probably a bit of both, but in his view it was the truculent tone of
the new Russian regime that had done most to unsettle public opinion. Not
only had it stopped pretending it was not involved in the events in Caucasia
and the Baltic; it had warned ominously that similar events would happen in
Ukraine if authorities there did not show more 'respect' for the Russian
population.
Slowly Douglas realised that someone in the room was speaking. It was
Ashdown, the secretary of state for defence - a man whose presence in the
cabinet Hurd regarded as the downside of coalition government. Putting him
at defence had been a clever move, of course. It meant he could rush around
visiting the troops, but was obliged to face the fact that there were simply
not enough of them to right all the world's wrongs.
All the same, Ashdown had been getting troublesome of late. He had a knack
of making speeches which, without actually contradicting government policy,
seemed to fan rather than soothe the mood of militant indignation that was
sweeping the country. Even Lady Thatcher was said to except him, privately,
from her constant excoriation of 'this spineless government'. And what was
he saying now? Something about having warned all along that the rot would
spread if it wasn't stopped in Yugoslavia.
Douglas adjourned the meeting for an hour and put through a call to
Washington. Not to the president: he had learnt quite early on that he could
not be sure of getting him on the line. It was more effective, in any case,
to work through Warren Christopher, a man who shared, to a large extent, his
own cautious and sceptical world view.
Yes, Warren confirmed, pressure was building up there too - on the Hill,
especially - for some kind of intervention. Something was needed to head it
off. A joint statement, perhaps, by the P3 - the three western permanent
members of the Security Council - to 'draw a line in the marshes'.
Fax machines whined in Downing Street, in Foggy Bottom and in the Elysee
Palace. President Chirac amended successive drafts to make it clear (i) that
Nato was not involved, (ii) that no military action was contemplated, and
(iii) that if military action was taken France would be present 'au premier
rang'. But by midnight Douglas was able to reconvene the cabinet and present
them with an agreed text, the careful phrasing of which gave him once again
that comforting glow of pride in British draftsmanship. It deplored
atrocities 'by all sides', and warned that 'the international community
would react with the utmost energy to any extension of the fighting,
particularly across state borders'.
When he had finished reading, colleagues pressed forward to shake Douglas's
hand. Now at last they had something concrete to offer at their weekend
surgeries. He waved away their congratulations, with the merest hint of
impatience, but allowed himself to accept a double whisky from Snodgrass,
the Downing Street butler.
Just as he raised the glass to his lips, the mahogany telephone on the
slightly worn green leather desk began to ring. It was Charles
Buffett-Brown, his private secretary in the Foreign Office. 'Sorry to bother
you so late, prime minister, but I thought you'd want to know. Russian
troops have crossed the Polish frontier.'
The column is a response to a short story by Douglas Hurd in a Sunday
newspaper

FT  03 FEB 93 / Letter: No place for Captain Bligh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN VAN MAURIK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was relieved, yet concerned to read Patricia Morrison's critique of
the Channel 4 Cutting Edge programme on John Ridgeway ('Macho harassment,
not management', January 27.
Relieved, because although it was compelling television I also found the
Ridgeway techniques unacceptable and it was good to feel the wind of common
sense blowing through her article.
Concerned, because as a management trainer and someone who runs leadership
and team building courses, using both indoor and outdoor development, I am
worried that the rest of us should be tarred with the 'exercise in sadism'
brush. Sensitively handled, outdoor training can be an important aid to team
development and individuals' growth as leaders.
It makes sense, however, that the exercises should be mentally challenging
rather than physically demanding and that the trainer should never
deliberately mislead course members.
The good trainer should facilitate other peoples' learning. This means
assisting their development, listening to them and encouraging discussion,
rather than playing the role of Captain Bligh.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Letter: German screen-based trading not limited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RALPH RISTAU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would like to set the record straight with regard to two claims that
were made in your article, 'Exchanges fight for the future across Europe',
(January 15).
First, it was suggested that, 'because of limitations of technology', DTB's
screen-based system would not be able to offer the same level of liquidity
as that available on Liffe. The fact is that no other exchange has increased
its turnover as rapidly as DTB. As a fully computerised exchange from the
start, DTB has doubled its trading volume every year since it was founded in
January 1990. Within its first year of operation, DTB became the European
market leader in options trading. In other words, DTB already has a very
liquid market, and the level of liquidity is still rising.
Second, it is not true that 'none of the world's largest futures contracts
are screen-based'. DTB's Bobl future is one of the world's highest-volume
interest-rate futures in the medium-term range. It has moved into the number
one position in Europe within one year.
Furthermore, the majority of the trading volume in cash instruments in
Europe is screen-based or telephone-based.
So, regarding our positive experience with advanced screen trading
technology at the DTB and Ibis (electronic trading facility for stocks and
bonds) in Germany and the impressive performance of screen trading elsewhere
in Europe it seems to be the right time to reconsider prejudices about it.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Letter: A more realistic view of attitudes among long-term
unemployed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From D J O'DRISCOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Peter Ashby's letter ('Recruitment subsidies likely to have only a
marginal impact', January 26) claims an insight into the minds of
(long-term) unemployed people.
Being a long-term unemployed person myself (whose one luxury is your
newspaper), and having done temporary work under the Community Project
Scheme and some social research interviewing, which included long-term
unemployed people, I feel that I can offer a rather different and, dare I
say, more realistic, view of the attitudes of unemployed people.
First, it is hard to believe that temporary work schemes can offer any hope
to unemployed people for the obvious reason that the job would offer no
security and the participant would enter the scheme with the knowledge that
they will be back at square one at the end of their contract. One can say
that such a scheme could re-instil the discipline of work that is destroyed
by unemployment, and can give something to the person to write in their CV.
But if there are no jobs out there what is the point of raising people's
hopes?
Mr Ashby voices the same old prejudice about the unemployed that the media
and politicians have been peddling throughout the 1980s: we are a bunch of
scroungers who should be forced to work for our pathetic 'income from
society'. Well, no new ideas there. He then goes on to claim that this has
some support among long-term unemployed people. Of course Mr Ashby and I may
move in different social circles, but I think that the majority of long-term
unemployed people would agree that what they need is work. And not for the
notion of having pride in having a job, but simply to have a part-decent
standard of living.
Perhaps Mr Ashby could take this into consideration when he next descends
from his castle in the sky, and come up with some real recommendations for
solving the plight of so many people.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Arts: 'Gomorra' in Vienna - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vienna as Gomorrah, in HK Gruber's new 'musical show' at the Volksoper. Not
that the local elbow-digs in Richard Bletschacher's libretto matter much;
for this Gomorra ('h'-less in German) might be any tidy, prosperous,
enlightened Western capital, and the fire and flood which destroy it are no
divine punishment, Old Testament style, but natural civic developments - set
by Gruber to infernally buoyant music.
The fable is too transparent to need commentary. Gomorra, a liberal
city-state with all modern comforts, is being visited by a representative of
Higher Authority. As his tour of inspection begins, a Presenter proudly
catalogues the innumerable fine things that Gomorrans own and cherish, and
above all their great volunteer Fire Brigade, entrusted with preserving
order and calm. (Distant cries from dissident Pyromaniacs are heard but
ignored.) The climax of the visit is to be a grand ball, for which the local
paper, 'Public Opinion', wants an appealing Princess to choose the
lottery-winner.
A freelance reporter and a photographer, Augustin and Flitzer, are sent to
find one in the overloaded asylum for Endangered Existences (the homeless,
the work-shy, dreamers, artists and musicians), a luxurious health-farm.
They find Gwendolyn, a Gastarbeiterin from the North. She and Augustin fall
into an irrelevant mutual rapture. In due course, transformed into a fashion
victim by the newspaper, Gwendolyn takes the stand at the ball; but first
Valentina, Augustin's recent paramour and daughter of the Chief Editor,
makes a bitter, rebellious scene - and then the Pyromaniacs strike with fire
at every corner of the city.
In Act 2, the warring popular forces take the foreground while the
individual characters recede. The Pyromaniacs, who profess no creed but a
vague sentiment for getting back to the land (wildly unrealistic, in the
circumstances), exult in the city-wide holocaust; the Fire Brigade retreats
underground to open the sluice-gates of the sewers, thus extinguishing the
blaze but unfortunately drowning almost everybody in the flood. The Higher
Authority man makes a suave departure by spaceship, without uttering a word
of judgment, and Augustin and Gwendolyn - raptly impervious to everything -
float away in a rubber dinghy to nowhere in particular.
Gruber's music underlines no moral, though his huge, swinging 'underwater
can-can' finale for the waterlogged citizens betrays a grimly apocalyptic
gloat. Gomorra, his longest work so far, pursues his disarmingly original,
post-modernist vein less than an equally impassioned one: 'dispassionate
music of merciless elegance', aimed deliberately at young, pop-oriented
ears.
The love duets - and Augustin's subversive paean to cigarette smoking,
punctuated by satisfied smoke-rings - rejoice in lazy, sexy syncopations.
The bass-lines rock overbearingly (Gruber made a notable career as a
double-bass); odd taped sounds are enlisted, and live swanee-whistles, and
at the end massed harmonicas in serene chords. Before that there are
music-boxes in chorus, and a long unison-strings plea, expressly
'reminiscent of Mahler or Berg' (as it certainly is, but also of
Schoenberg's Moses in his last despairing cry: 'O word that I lack]') broken
by hostile bangs on empty petrol cans.
Upon its neo-Broadway, neo-Weill grounds, Gruber's score developed
astringently and gorgeously. Among the Volksoper principals, Ildiko
Raimondi's Gwendolyn and Hans Helm's Fire Chief deliver their roles with
nicely expert wryness. Josef Luftensteiner's Augustin, properly droopy-eyed,
sounds like an operetta-artiste where a plaintive pop-voice would suit
better. The enthusiastic Valentina, Flitzer and pyromaniac Hilarius of Karin
Goltz, Josef Fortner and Adolf Dallapozza are too much out of raw stock.
Clasped (even rehearsed) within an overall frame, they do their nut but fail
to wring our withers.
Some blame must be attached to the British producer Mike Fields. Up to a
point, his vaudeville moppings-and-mowings for the multiple chorus were
silly/funny enough; but Act 2, where the music expands to full-throated
communal scale, looked far too bitty - it did not begin to match the
elegance nor the exuberant menace of the score. Nor did the Volksoper chorus
rise to the scathing precision of their music; they were indifferently
co-ordinated and scatterbrained.
Perhaps their focus was blunted by politeness. The Volksoper's Sunday
matinees are evidently populated by aged regulars, many of whom soon hobbled
out in dudgeon, or at least stuck fingers in offended ears, as the
(admittedly very loud) native ritual proceeded. The 'Greisenlied' chorus of
twitching wrinklies - 'We know all that, including so-called 'love']' ' got
a dampened reception. All the same, Gomorra invites and deserves a
production that will give full, various values to its crowd-content, which
is popular as could be.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Arts: CandoCo and NDT3 - Dance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Ideas about the limitations we impose upon performance - through age or
disability - were challenged in a double bill marking the opening of the
Spring Loaded free dance festival on Monday at the Queen Elizabeth Hall.
CandoCo is a group of dancers, three of whose members are confined to
wheel-chairs, though not confined as performers. Nederlands Dans Theatre 3
is a quartet of professional dancers in middle life, whose careers might be
supposed to be waning, if not waned. Its purpose is to show that there is
performing life after 40, though in view of the repertory on view retirement
might be considered a blessed relief.
NDT3's personnel for this visit were Martine van Hamel, Sabine Kupferberg,
Niklas Ek, Gerard Lematre. The two offerings were vexatious, and served with
malign skill to make the dancers look foolish. Jiri Kylian's No Sleep till
Dawn of Day featured the two women, a line of 18 wooden chairs, a lullaby
from the Solomon Islands (a miserable four-note phrase) and witless
fragments of activity that conveyed nothing so much as the fact that the
performers could do much better if given the opportunity. Mats Ek's Journey
(with two scores by Steve Reich; three painted, dull and ambulant flats),
found Lematre as a railway porter, the others as travellers. Niklas Ek was
more boyishly vivacious than his years should permit; Miss van Hamel wore an
unforgiveable red jersey tube. The movement was minimal, tiresome, and, as
far as I could discern, pointless.
A lengthy programme note by Mr Kylian offered pietisms about the value of
mature dancers. It is a platitude that experience brings technical wisdom,
mastery of the stage, and that these are of incalculable value. Curious,
then, that this repertory should so diminish the presence and skills of its
performers. I thought it especially sad that Martine van Hamel, a
distinguished and fascinating ballerina, should be seen in this galere. She
and her companions deserve much better. Many dancers have performed
magnificently into their 50s without NDT3's special pleading.
CandoCo avoids NDT3's mistakes. It neither patronises its artists, nor makes
them objects of a Poppy Day appeal for sympathy. Of course, we feel for the
disabled members of the troupe. Most especially we recall Celeste Dandeker,
a touchingly elegant dancer with the London Contemporary company, who broke
her neck during a performance of Stages 20 years ago. Confined to a
wheel-chair since then, she has found a way to continue as an interpretative
artist: Darshan Singh Bhuller's haunting film, The Fall, seen on television
two years ago, revealed her as a still potent figure.
With the dancer and choreographer Adam Benjamin as director, CandoCo
proposes a dance text - a corporate effort - which confronts ideas of
mobility, of how we expect people to move and how they may learn to move.
Wheel-chairs can be abandoned; the severely disabled can create vivid
emotional and dynamic situations away from their chairs as well as in them.
The able-bodied and the physically limited jointly prove that limits are
there to be overcome. It is on these terms inspiring, brave.
As choreography the piece - Flying in the Face of . . . - is uneven. Imagery
feeds from the special circumstances of its casting, often powerfully: a
duet for two men, one without legs, is astonishing both in its dynamic
outlines and in its psychological resonances. Because of the huge sincerity
of the movement, we believe and accept its structural premises. I found,
though, a lack of aesthetic purpose which a single choreographic decision
should impose. If I have a hope for CandoCo it is that a major creator be
invited to work with the group: its idealism and artistic bravery merit the
very best collaborators.
The Spring Loaded festival continues with 30 companies in various theatres
until April 10

Enoch Powell (C4, 9.45) is a repeat of a programme in which the eloquent old
statesman returns to Cambridge and reminisces about his life in the
university in the thirties and the profound and lifelong impact upon him of
A. E. Housman's lectures on textual criticism and classical literature.
The impact of the arrival of television on the workings of the fame machine
is explored in the fifth episode of Clive James - Fame in the Twentieth
Century (BBC 1, 9.30), although 'explored' is too serious a word for this
frivolous and banal series. It is mildly watchable in the same way as
rifling through old magazines but with the benefit (or otherwise) of
listening to James's inimitable one-liners. This week the line-up includes
Lucille Ball, Liberace, and Grace Kelly, and tyro politicians learning to
come to terms with the new medium.
Eastern Europeans have a passion for mushrooms, hence the title of the new
comedy drama serial dealing in East-West relations, The Mushroom Picker
which starts tonight (BBC 2, 9.25), starring Nigel Terry who played the
starring role in Derek Jarman's Caravaggio.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Arts: Monkey business at the zoo - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
I confess to having initially felt sceptical about The Ark (BBC 2, Tuesday),
Molly Dineen's four-part documentary of which the final episode will be
screened next week. Even as a neighbour, the Zoo's fate had left me fairly
cold beyond wondering in an idle way how much longer I will be able to watch
gratis, from the canal path, the crazy gallops of the Arabian oryxes.
It seemed that the elephant-traps were baited for any film-maker embarking
on a documentary about the Zoo which has been staring down the barrel of a
gun for two decades. Its imminent closure has generated a huge amount of
press coverage right up to the eleventh hour, which is where the Zoo
currently is. What could a necessarily out-of-date film about the zoo's
travail possibly achieve?
I have been confounded: The Ark has turned out to be a splendid example of
documentary making at its most subtle and rigorously controlled. The
dramatic pace is fierce, starting with the opening minutes showing the
miserable anxiety of keepers, one third of whom faced the sack, to next
week's final programme which will cover the inconclusive putsch of spring
1992. Not one trap has Ms Dineen fallen into. Few things lend themselves
more to kitsch than shots of apparently mournful orang-utangs gazing round
well-loved premises soon to be vacated for ever . . . And yet, the animals
are kept on a tight leash and never allowed to steal the show, either from
the human denizens of Regent's Park or from each other.
Last night's episode focussed on the arrival of two new Giant Pandas. After
a brief shot of the male panda tumbling winsomely about, we were back with
the meat of the matter, what the zoo-people thought. To the marketing
people, the giant pandas are a mini-boom to be milked for soft-drink
promotions and for the momentary upturn in gate-money. To the young keeper
in charge of invertebrates, a mission to breed the last members of a tiny
species of snail is no less valid than the sentimentalised conjunctions of
pandas.
As London Zoo's Director David Jones negotiates between the German and
Chinese authorities as to what should be done with any progeny of the happy
couple, the Young Turks give their views. They see the brouhaha over pandas
is merely another example of the world-wide hype and hypocrisy about saving
species. 'The panda is a political football'; breeding pandas, we were told,
is not in fact difficult if only governments would agree to pool their
pandas.
The Ark is, of course, a metaphor for Britain in the last 20 years, with the
pandas rather neatly playing the role of the marriage of Charles and Di.
Meanwhile, rot eats deep into the bowels of the Mappin Terraces and the
aquarium. At the end of last night's programme, a group of academic Fellows
of the Zoological Society (which legally owns the animals) has formed a
secret compact with the more intellectual keepers. Their aim is to throw out
the management team and derail its painfully-implemented survival package
for the Ark.
The irony of course is that these very keepers were the ones we saw in the
first programme successfully reapplying for their jobs and for promotion
because they were presentable, ambitious types, the kind of people who ought
to relish being 'empowered' by running their own budgets. Next week's final
episode sees the trap being sprung and the sympathetic Director failing to
ride the tiger. For all that, of course the Ark has continued to drift but
after Dineen's excellent series, who could remain wholly indifferent to its
plight?
Horizon; No Ordinary Genius (BBC 1, Monday) was a straight-forward exercise
in hagiography, yet none the worse for that. Scientists know about the
physicist Richard Feynman, who died in Los Angeles in 1988. They know about
him partly for his achievements over an extraordinary breadth of fields, but
partly too because of his whacky character. For many non-scientists,
however, the name Feynman meant little beyond, perhaps, recalling that he
was a Nobel prize-winner.
At first it seemed a little over the top to devote two programmes to
Feynman, but not by the time the time it reached the point where he was
taking on NASA as the outsider, the loose cannon, on the Challenger Inquiry.
At this time, Feynman was already seriously ill with the cancer which
eventually killed him at the age of 69. We could have heard a little more
about the zaniness of this free spirit, his infinite thirst for horse-play
which is part of the scientific legend.
However, the programme's real strength was the reminiscences of Feynman's
scientist colleagues, quietly spoken men through whose words we got not only
a vivid impression of the tireless genius of the man they admired, but also
of the compulsion, even the sheer aesthetic pleasure, which drives the best
scientists in their quest for understanding of the universe.
'Enough was enough. Armed force was out. Marxist agitation was in.'
Timewatch, BBC 2's fortnightly history programme, last week dealt with the
origins of the Provisional IRA. It aimed to be dramatic. Staccato
commentary, to convey the drama. Not many dates. The result was banal. Like
a tabloid newspaper.
Pity really. The Sparks That Lit the Bonfire ought to have been a cracker,
with notable interviews with leading Irish politicians in power at the end
of the 'sixties, members of the Republic's armed forces who brought the guns
and money into Ulster, and the men who watched the IRA split. As it was, the
commentary was unbearably vague and silly, and matters were not helped by
interventions from a terrible folk-singer. 'History took a fatal turn.'
Quite so, but let us hope the same is not now henceforth true of the
Timewatch series.
Lack of editorial rigour seriously undermined BBC 2's lavish and long
series, The Trouble with Medicine (Thursdays). Each programme strays hither
and yon in its travels around the developed world. What should be a
polemical inquiry into whether high-technology medicine regularly loses its
way. This week The Magic Bullet was as prone to side-tracking as the rest.
Fairly irrelevant to the grand theme were the Spanish herbalists frustrated
by the law in their efforts to peddle concoctions of leaves. Ludicrously so
was the encounter session, or some such gathering, of middle-class American
women who we saw weeping (literally) over the sins of the big, nasty drug
industry. What a very damp squib to lob at the drug manufacturers.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Arts: Worlds Apart - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Theatre Royal in Stratford East must be the friendliest theatre in
London. Many of its performances go straight back to the comedy shows like
Take It From Here that used to give such universal pleasure on the old BBC
Radio: full of silly jokes, some of which are very funny.
Worlds Apart, the new work by the theatre's resident writer Paul Sirett, is
far too good-natured to be much of a satire and too loosely structured to be
much of a play, but it would be difficult not to enjoy it. As the genesis of
a television series it would probably run for years, for there is no limit
to what the immigration officers at London's Heathrow airport might get up
to.
Heathrow is where the piece is set, or more precisely the SEA, which stands
for the secondary examination area. British immigration officials are the
'last blue line - after us, Armageddon]' They are there to stop foreigners
getting in, particularly if they are anything other than white and most of
all if they use the dreaded words 'political asylum'. Any bureaucratic
excuse will do to send them back.
The piece is quite clever about this. The word 'colour' is never mentioned
by the immigration authorities: the law is against discrimination of this
kind. Still, the old prejudice lingers on. Those held up for examination in
the SEA include a black American air force man coming for a weekend from
Wiesbaden, a successful East African Asian who has long been a British
citizen and was once voted young businessman of the year, a pregnant woman
from Zaire coming to see her husband, a not very white looking Spanish
dancer arriving for an international competition, and a Tibetan artist
trying to get away from Chinese persecution by having stowed away on a
freight plane from Angola.
Only the Tibetan is a genuine candidate for asylum. The authorities respond
by saying that he can stay if, in effect, he agrees to spy on other Asian
immigrants.
Worlds Apart is clever again in that the main conflicts take place more
between the detainees themselves than with the authorities. The East African
Asian, who has become more English than the English, takes a particular
dislike to the black American. The latter plainly does not think much of
Britain, regardless of colour.
The immigration officers are a less than homogeneous group as well. One of
them spends his time composing scripts for pornographic telephone calls.
Another leaks the presence of the Zairean lady to a liberal lawyer outside
the airport. The explanation for this lack of solidarity is that the officer
in question is not only gay; he is Welsh.
If the description makes the piece sound earnest, it is nothing of the kind.
One suspects there will be a lot of topical ad-libbing from night to night.
The East Africa Asian, played with effortless superiority by Madhav Sharma,
passes the cricket test. On Monday he commiserated with the English over the
dreadful collapse before the Indians in Calcutta: then he took a swipe at
the Pakistanis.
The Spanish dancer has had planted on her some photographs to be delivered
to a tabloid newspaper. Only the East African Asian recognises who is being
exposed and wonders what the Conservative Party is coming to. Like his
detention at the airport, he says it would never have happened under
Margaret Thatcher.
Some of the jokes are low. One of the women in the immigration service left
the police force because of sexual harassment. 'God, they must have been
desperate,' says one of the men. It is old radio comedy brought up-to-date
and made multi-ethnic, though still broadly unilingual. Jeff Teare directs
and while Sirett could take his talents to television there is huge pleasure
in seeing Worlds Apart on stage with a live script and a lively audience.
