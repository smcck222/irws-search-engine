FT  03 FEB 93 / Business and the Environment: Filthy fuels foot the bill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The 'greenness' of one kind of fuel over another has been hotly contested in
the debate on the future of the UK coal industry. But putting numbers on the
environmental damage done by each fuel type to clarify that debate is
notoriously difficult.
In the US many states have been forced to do just that by two decades of
ambitious environmental legislation: frequently they force utilities to
include environmental costs in their applications for new energy contracts.
A consultancy report* for the European Commission analysing the US
experience concludes that environmental costs add between 50 per cent and
100 per cent to the conventional 'economic' costs of generating electricity.
The report, prepared by the Association for the Conservation of Energy, says
that 32 US states 'have taken some action to account for environmental
externalities' - the costs normally 'external' to the electricity market's
prices. But the methods used to put money values on environmental damage
vary widely - as do the values themselves.
Most methods avoid 'damage cost assessment' - putting a figure directly on
environmental and health damage from pollution. That approach runs into
difficulty over the treatment of different probabilities of damage - how,
for example, to deal with the uncertainty over whether carbon dioxide
emissions are causing global warming or not.
Instead, most measure 'control costs' - the extra costs imposed by
legislation - and assume that the money value of environmental damage is
greater, or the law would not have been passed. This makes the figures easy
to find, but the report comments that it assumes unrealistically that
legislators accurately estimated environmental damage.
One study by the Tellus Institute, a US think-tank quoted by the EC report,
says US power plants face costs between 47 per cent and 103 per cent higher
than older plants because of new legislation. The conventionally-measured
cost of generating power with 'new coal' - stations equipped with filters
for nitrogen and sulphur oxides - is about 8.6 c/KWh (cents per kilowatt
hour), but air pollution legislation adds 4 cents, or 47 per cent.
The conventional cost of generating with existing coal, about 6.9 c/KWh,
rises with environmental costs to 14 cents, 103 per cent higher. Oil emerges
as the 'cheapest' on this basis, with conventional costs of 6.9 c/KWh and
total costs of 11.7 c/KWh.
That estimate emphasises the difficulty of international comparison: a
similar 'provisional' study of UK environmental costs published by the
Department of Trade and Industry in December had oil as the 'dirtiest'.
The report found too that there was wide variation at state and even
district level. California, which has some of the most stringent
environmental legislation in the US, has 'different externality values
across the state' because air pollution rules are set at regional level.
Environmental costs of building 'new coal' plants in California were around
6.7 c/KWh, the report says, more than 10 times those given by the Bonneville
Power Administration, the federal agency in charge of power for five
north-western states.
This is because BPA calculations are based on the alternative 'damage cost'
approach and exclude estimates of the damage caused to the atmosphere by
carbon dioxide emissions. The BPA felt it would be 'premature' to judge
whether global warming was occurring.
In a different attempt to address that uncertainty, New York state directed
that planning applications should not set costs of controlling carbon
dioxide emissions at more than 20 per cent of a low-cost technology such as
tree planting. As a result, it has some of the lowest figures for 'new coal'
externalities: only 1.4 c/KWh.
Despite the shortcomings of these estimates, the report concludes that the
attempts reduce the risk that future electricity customers will be hit
suddenly by the costs of cleaning up.

FT  03 FEB 93 / People: Broughton becomes BAT's heir apparent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time in its 90-year history, BAT Industries, the tobacco and
financial services group, is to split the roles of chairman and chief
executive.
Martin Broughton, 45, the non-smoking head of the financial services
division, has been appointed group chief executive and deputy chairman.
He will be accountable to Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman, for the management
of the group's operations and the development of business and financial
strategy.
Sir Patrick, 62, who has held both posts since 1982, says: 'Dividing the
roles of chairman and chief executive is very much a new and untried
development. The board will review its appropriateness in two or three
years' time when I intend to retire.'
Broughton, who takes up his new post on April 1, was the City's tip to
succeed Sir Patrick and the appointment was welcomed yesterday. Said one:
'It is an evolutionary move, maintaining the commitment to the core
businesses.' Broughton confirms that there would be no change of direction.
'Both tobacco and financial services are now growth businesses. There are
lots of opportunities to be seized.'
Broughton joined BAT in 1971, shortly after qualifying as a chartered
accountant, and spent the next three years working in four continents as a
travelling auditor for its tobacco operations. He held a variety of
financial positions before moving to Souza Cruz, the Brazilian tobacco
subsidiary, in 1980, becoming finance director in 1984.
A year later he transferred to the group's insurance business as first
finance director of Eagle Star. But he left in 1988 to join BAT Industries
main board as finance director before the insurance business began to run
into problems.
He joined the chairman's policy committee, the board's key executive body,
in January 1990, and later he assumed responsibility for group personnel and
was appointed senior finance director.
Eight months ago, he was appointed group managing director, financial
services, and chairman of Eagle Star.
Broughton has been a member of the CBI's economic affairs committee, and of
the urgent issues task force of the Accounting Standards Board since 1991.
He will head an executive management team whose other members will be Ulrich
Herter, managing director of the tobacco operations, and David Allvey, group
finance director.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Business and the Environment: Dam takes root
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vetiver, a coarse tropical grass, is the most practical solution to the
global problem of soil erosion, which destroys millions of hectares of
farmland every year, the US National Research Council said last week.
That conclusion vindicates a campaign by a small group of agriculturalists
in the World Bank's Asia division, who have been extolling the virtues of
vetiver for more than 10 years, in face of widespread scientific scepticism.
Vetiver, a native of India, is best known for the fragrance extracted from
its roots for use in soaps and perfumes. But, according to the NRC, a hedge
of vetiver planted across a hillside makes a superb 'botanical dam' that can
hold soil in place and withstand the run-off from torrential downpours over
a period of decades. Its roots go more than two metres into the ground and
the tough blade-like leaves grow two metres high.
One advantage of vetiver is that the grass exists in sterile forms which
stay in place for decades without spreading. In contrast, some other plants
used to curb erosion have rampaged out of control.
Although vetiver's native habitat is hot and humid, the plant is
astonishingly adaptable, says the NRC. It has performed well in poor soils
in dry countries and has even withstood frost in the southern US and China.
But the NRC calls for more research to breed varieties suitable for cold
climates.
'I was sceptical at first,' says Norman Borlaug - winner of a Nobel Prize
for his contribution to the 'green revolution' - who chaired the NRC
investigation of vetiver. 'But I've seen vetiver at work. And I know that in
these times of great ecological concern about what is happening to our soil
because of erosion, vetiver could indeed play a very useful role in many
places.'
The NRC calls for vetiver to be put into widespread use without delay. Field
trials should test a variety of new applications, including protecting roads
and railways from flooding and landslides. The grass is already being
planted in the Philippines to help re-stabilise roads destroyed by the 1990
earthquake in northern Luzon.

FT  03 FEB 93 / People: Witt - expanding with Slimma
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tim Dewhirst, great grandson of Isaac Dewhirst - the Yorkshire merchant who
gave Marks and Spencer its first big break - has been made executive
chairman of the Dewhirst Group, the oldest supplier to Britain's premier
high street retailer.
The promotion of the 39-year-old Dewhirst is part of a management reshuffle
which includes the appointment of the first chief executive from outside the
Dewhirst family - 39-year-old David Witt.
Witt (right), who only joined Dewhirst in September 1991, has a big company
background, and his swift promotion to chief executive is a sign that the
family-controlled firm is keen to strengthen its management. Having worked
for UDS Tailoring in the 1970s he joined Slimma in 1979 and rose to be a
main board director of its parent Tootal at the time of the Coats Viyella
takeover.
Dewhirst is famous more for its M&amp;S connections than its recent performance.
Isaac Dewhirst lent Michael Marks Pounds 5 to get his business started in
the 1880s, and although he turned down Marks' subsequent offer of a
partnership, put him in touch with his cashier - Thomas Spencer.
Today, Marks and Spencer has a market value of Pounds 8.6bn, while Dewhirst
is capitalised at less than Pounds 70m and is reliant on M&amp;S for 80 per cent
of its business. The combination of steady margin erosion in the 1980s and
heavy dependence on menswear fashions has meant that it has not always done
as well as some long-established M&amp;S suppliers. Two years ago it had to cut
its dividend for the first time in its history.
However, its fortunes appear to have turned with the 1991 acquisition of
Slimma. Not only did it bring in new management led by Witt, but it reduced
the company's reliance on the fickle menswear market. Its shares have more
than doubled since the rights issue to pay for Slimma.
Dewhirst takes over from Anthony Vice, former financial journalist and
Rothschild merchant banker, who has been keeping the chairman's seat warm
for him since 1988. Vice remains on the board as does James Dewhirst, who
has relinquished his role as non-executive vice chairman.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Business and the Environment: Smothering the vapours - VOCs
are the latest airborne villains and their control means costs but also
opportunities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Down at the low-technology end of manufacturing, even the humblest products
are caught up in the greening of industry.
Pressure to clean up the air is forcing a striking change in traditional
methods where solvents are used; that includes such mundane activities as
the manufacture of bottle tops and shoe soles. This is the result of an
international attempt, led by the United Nations, to reduce volatile organic
compounds in the air over Europe.
VOCs are the vapours given off by a range of chemicals used in industry,
such as solvents, and contained in consumer products, such as house paint
and petrol.
The compounds collect in the atmosphere and react with sunlight to form
photochemical smog and low-level ozone. These smogs irritate the breathing
system and can be particularly harmful to the health of young children, the
elderly, those with breathing complaints and people who exercise outdoors.
Some VOCs are implicated in global warming.
Western European countries have signed a UN treaty to reduce VOC emissions
to two thirds of 1988 levels by 1999. Each government is responsible for
devising plans to meet the target. Also, the EC is working on legislation to
force certain sectors like the petrochemical and oil industries to make big
cuts in VOC emissions before the end of the decade. UK law already controls
emissions from industrial printers and other users of ink.
Besides these official pressures, there are growing demands from retailers
and business buyers for products that do not pollute. But some industries
complain that the cost of compliance is too high, while others argue over
who should take responsibility for emissions.
However, the same pressures are a spur to innovation, creating lucrative
opportunities for those who can develop traditional products, such as glues,
paints and inks, that do not emit VOCs.
'Probably the whole drive behind all of the research in the market for car
paint is geared towards reducing VOCs,' says Bob McGuiness, European
marketing director for automotive paints at ICI.
The European market for equipment that controls VOCs is set to double to
Dollars 652m (Pounds 430m) a year by 1997, according to researchers Frost
and Sullivan - and this figure is purely for devices that can be bolted on
to existing processes; it does not include alternatives such as solvent-free
inks and paints.
It is these substitutes that are going to help hard-pressed smaller
businesses like the shoe maker and bottle top manufacturer, which do not
have the capital to invest in equipment that catches VOCs before they escape
to the air.
'There is a big opportunity for makers of water-based inks because they take
the trouble out of controlling VOCs,' says Jan Vernon of consultants KPMG.
'They solve many health and environmental problems and remove the need for
costly monitoring and control systems. For many companies, these inks will
be the only affordable option.'
The European oil industry is particularly hard hit by EC demands to reduce
vapours that evaporate during the making, storage and distribution of fuels.
'The first stage of controls will require industry to invest Dollars 2bn by
early next century,' says Klaus Kohlhase, BP's head of health, safety and
environment.
If the proposed second stage - now under discussion - is carried out, the
industry will have to spend a further Dollars 1bn installing vapour recovery
units at service stations.
These devices catch emitted vapours when motorists fill their tanks. But
because the petrol pump attachments are expensive and not necessarily the
most efficient solution, the oil industry wants car makers to fit carbon
canisters to petrol tanks.
Shell UK estimates that vapour recovery devices on the forecourt would
capture about three quarters of the VOCs emitted when motorists fill up,
while canisters would collect more than 95 per cent. The carbon is
regenerated when captured VOCs are drawn into the engine and burnt.
The car industry does not want to fit these canisters because of the cost.
And the EC does not favour the solution because it would take too long -
about 10 years before all cars were fitted.
The oil industry argues that its operations contribute only small amounts to
industry's overall VOC emissions. Furthermore, most problems with fuels
arise when vehicles are used, through unburnt fuel in exhaust fumes and
evaporation from petrol tanks and fuel lines.
But the oil industry is looking seriously at ways to prevent vapours from
escaping during distribution. BP researchers have produced one of the more
innovative solutions by adapting the idea of the wine box.
A collapsible plastic bag is placed inside storage tanks and road tankers.
The fuel is sealed in the bag and is never exposed to the air at any stage
during distribution. Trials have been promising, but the technology is
expensive and BP has not decided yet how it will be used.
Although technologies designed to prevent evaporation help save a
potentially valuable product, the benefits for oil companies are few and the
costs high. It is clear that all companies will have to find affordable
solutions to the problem of VOCs because the pressures from both regulators
and the market look set to increase. 'No one will be able to escape the
pressures to control VOC emissions,' says Vernon.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Jobs: How living costs vary across the globe - Additional
data on housing offered to compensate for effects of unusual journalistic
problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY the Jobs column must cast modesty aside and reveal that it has of late
achieved something probably unparallelled in the history of journalism.
Unfortunately, the exploit is not of the professionally acclaimed kind
typified by scooping one's competitors by publishing a story before them.
My feat is rather the reverse - having another newspaper scoop me with my
own material which had already been printed in this one. How it happened
perhaps requires some explanation.
Readers taking the UK editions of the Financial Times find this column in
the Wednesday morning's paper. In the overseas editions, however, it does
not appear until the Friday. So it is possible for the London-based staff of
foreign newspapers to pick up something I've printed here on a Wednesday,
and have their report on it appear in their home country on the Thursday
morning, a day ahead of my arrival there.
Such was actually done not long ago, it seems, by a Japanese reporter who
further complicated the issue by stating that the data in question had been
in 'yesterday's' FT. Hence several people unable to find the item telephoned
to inquire, only to be still more mystified by being told that for
'yesterday' they should read 'tomorrow'.
I tell you all that as an apologetic explanation about the table alongside,
containing the latest 'update' of this column's indicators of world-wide
living costs. As before, the figures have been kindly supplied by the P-E
International management consultancy which has like data on 142 cities. As I
have room for only 30, anyone interested in others should contact Simon
McBride at Park House, Wick Rd, Egham, Surrey TW20 0HW; tel (0)784 434411,
fax (0)784 471404.
For each city, my table gives three sets of figures. The first is its cost
level shown as an index based on London prices at 100. Next is the latest
official inflation rate available when P-E compiled the data. The third is
the exchange rate at which the foreign currency has been turned into
sterling - which is what I'm apologising about, because numerous of the
rates have a distinctly antique appearance.
They are in fact those which were in force last October when the information
on price levels was collected. That in itself matters little because the
prices move only slowly. But the opposite has lately applied to exchange
rates which, since they affect the cost-index figures, means that most of
the indices in the table are antiques too.
Although I've tried to bring them up to date, it hasn't been practicable. It
turns out that the only source from which I can get all the rates required
is the FT Guide to World Currencies which is published on a Tuesday. And for
reasons too tediously complicated to mention, I could not do the updating in
time to meet the deadline for this column's appearance in the UK editions on
Wednesday morning.
Now, while that might seem a fair excuse to readers taking those editions,
it would hardly do so to people overseas who don't see my efforts until
Friday. They might well think I was being unduly lazy. So I decided to
explain about the dual publication days in the hope of persuading them
differently.
Fortunately, despite the snags, the cost-index figures can still be useful.
The price data on which they are based should continue to be a tolerable
guide to reality until April or so, and the indices can be updated for
currency market changes by a simple calculation. Just take the exchange rate
in the table, divide it by the rate currently in force, and multiply the
result by the table's index figure.
Moreover, there is a bit of added compensation. As usual, because of
technical difficulties the living-cost indices exclude outlays on housing.
But today I can also shed some light on those outlays, thanks to
international consultancy Hamptons Relocation.
It keeps check on rentals paid by expatriates in 27 countries, and here are
its figures for average rentals in 15 (anyone wanting more data should
contact Anita Saunders at Cherry Orchard North, Kembrey Park, Swindon, Wilts
SN2 6BL; tel (0)793 619555, fax (0)793 534839.) The rent relates to a
three-bedroomed unfurnished apartment in a typical expatriate dwelling area,
close to international schools. London examples include Richmond as well as
central parts such as Kensington and Chelsea. Exchange rates are as at last
Friday.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Management: Another battle of the sexes - Do women or men
make better bosses? New research into management styles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Women will always look for consensus, while men try to divide and rule. A
woman will say: 'These are the ways we can solve the problem - how many
people can we get to agree with it?' A man says: 'This is the way we are
going to do it, and if you don't like it, you can resign'.
That, at least, is one senior personnel manager's view of how male and
female management styles contrast sharply in the workplace, from an
interview in a report to be published next week*.
The study, conducted by headhunters Spencer Stuart, asks why so few women
occupy top management positions, examining en route perceptions of
leadership qualities.
It concludes that the stereotype of male and female ways of managing -
typified by the personnel manager quoted - flatters because it ascribes to
women an exceptional degree of generosity and humility.
This is damaging because it conceals differences among women and forms what
is called The New Mythology. Old, politically incorrect assumptions are
replaced with others just as inaccurate and unreliable, argues Spencer
Stuart.
It is common now to hear companies being urged to take on what are typified
as superior 'female' management skills. The New Mythology sees the female
management style as the most appropriate and effective in the modern
corporation - less hierarchical than the male, more intuitive and open to
change, more participative and, above all, more likely to encourage
employees at every level to flourish.
Where exactly do these new stereotypes come from, given that almost anybody
who has experienced a range of female managers at work will easily be able
to picture at least one who will pull rank and bark orders along with the
worst of her male colleagues?
Beverly Alimo-Metcalfe, senior lecturer in organisational psychology at the
University of Leeds, is one strong advocate of what are seen as essentially
female management skills. She acknowledges the dangers of making new
stereotypes but believes that 'the most successful styles of leadership are
more closely associated with women than men'.
She points to research by Judy Rosener, carried out at the University of
California and published in the Harvard Business Review. This suggested
women were more likely to employ what is called in the jargon a
'transformational' style of leadership; the men were more likely to be
'transactional' leaders.
The difference between the two styles, as reported by Rosener, is supposedly
this: 'transactional' leaders see job performance as a series of
transactions with subordinates; they exchange rewards for services rendered
or punishment for inadequate performance. 'Transformational' leaders get
subordinates to transform their own self-interest into the interest of the
group. They are more likely to use charisma, interpersonal skills and
personal contacts to get what they want; transactionals are more likely to
use their status in the organisation.
Alimo-Metcalfe also points to US case studies of organisations that had been
in trouble but were then revitalised, where a common ingredient was the
presence of a transformational leader. Her worry is that companies are
failing to recruit and promote transformational leaders. Assessment centres
run tests with a built-in bias in favour of the transactional style and
therefore discriminate against women, she says.
One flaw in Rosener's research, according to Cynthia Fuchs Epstein, New York
City University professor, is that men and women were not observed at work,
but were asked, instead, to describe their own management styles.
Fuchs Epstein quotes the example from her own research on women attorneys of
the 'lawyer who described her style as 'caring' but who was characterised as
a barracuda by a male associate'.
George Bain, principal of the London Business School, has himself been a
participant in a controlled experiment aimed at identifying differences
between male and female management styles. Commissioned by the now-defunct
Business magazine, the battery of tests conducted on a (self-selected) group
of male and female managers led to the conclusion that 'men and women
executives have more talents in common than most people imagine,' but also
threw up significant differences: women paid more attention to detail and
men were more competitive; perhaps more surprisingly, given The New
Mythology, women were found to be less democratic.
But Bain is sceptical. 'I don't think there are systematic differences
between men and women managers. There are greater differences between the
way one man manages and another man manages than there are between men and
women as groups,' he says.
Even overwhelming empirical evidence would leave him suspicious. 'I would
want to know if any differences in the way women manage were as a result of
innate qualities or had developed because of the roles reserved for them,'
says Bain.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Management: Headhunters lead business down road to academe -
The newest recruits to British universities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new breed is stalking the top branches of British higher education: the
headhunted vice-chancellor.
Professor Gerald Bernbaum, registrar of Leicester University, appointed
today to succeed Baroness Pauline Perry as vice-chancellor of the new South
Bank University, is among the first.
It was Saxton Bampfylde, the executive recruitment agency, that attracted
him south, and made him only the second head of a 'new' university (former
polytechnic) to hail from one of the 'old' variety.
'I knew the job was up, but definitely wouldn't have applied without Saxton
Bampfylde,' said Bernbaum, 56, who has spent the last six years
masterminding Leicester's rapid expansion in student numbers.
It was not fear of stepping into Baroness Perry's capacious shoes; still
less ignorance of the polytechnic sector. 'I simply would not have thought
it was the job for me; and without Saxton, there would have been no
guarantee of speed and secrecy.'
Bernbaum sets particular store by the latter. 'I had to have confidentiality
until a very late stage to protect my position at Leicester; you simply
don't get that by replying to a newspaper ad.' All his discussions were with
Saxton until a late stage; it took only a few weeks from then to the
appointment.
As with most recruitment agencies, Saxton Bampfylde's bread and butter still
comes from the City. But it sees education and the public sector as a
growing business. The new head of the Office for Standards in Education,
Professor Stewart Sutherland, is its most prominent catch. It has also been
in on the selection of two heads of Oxford colleges, and it is pitching for
other posts at vice-chancellor level.
Saxton's services do not come cheap - around a third of the appointee's
first-year salary plus expenses. But, says Gavin Mackenzie, a fellow of
Jesus College, Cambridge, on secondment to Saxton as a consultant: 'This
market is bound to grow further, especially as universities realise that it
is not only career academics that make excellent vice-chancellors.'
By implication, next time South Bank could end up with, say, the marketing
manager of Unilever. In fact, it was prepared to this time: it wanted
candidates from outside the university world, and its shortlist included
private sector executives. One made it to the final shortlist of three.
Why, then, are there so few higher education institutions with heads from
outside academe? Senior civil servants and diplomats have long adorned
Oxbridge lodgings; but Derek Roberts, deputy managing director of GEC until
becoming provost of University College, London, in 1989, is almost alone in
moving from a senior industrial post.
Remuneration may have something to do with it. But of late the governing
councils of the new universities have shown remarkable generosity to their
vice-chancellors, despite the depressed state of academic pay generally.
Nearly-three-figure salaries are now not uncommon.
A more serious obstacle appears to be the cultural divide. Though
headhunters have sometimes made a difference to the individual appointed,
none of the universities or Oxbridge colleges employing them has yet gone
for a type of person they would not have chosen on their own. 'It would have
been too much of a leap in the dark to do otherwise  - and difficult to sell
to colleagues,' says an academic close to one such appointment.
All, however, is not bleak for the bored banker. Saxton Bampfylde has just
been retained to find a new director general for the Royal Horticultural
Society. Pounds 60,000 a year; car and benefits; interest in flowers
desirable.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Management: Inequality rules in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The late 1980s surge in Tokyo stock prices and corporate profits was also a
time of opportunity for Japanese women.
Mariko Mitsui was leader of the largest opposition party, and strong
career-minded women were fashionable advertising props. There was even
debate about the introduction of a new fast-track for women in big
companies.
Female fortunes, however, have taken a tumble with the economic downturn - a
change best illustrated by the fate of Mitsui, now an ex-member of the
Social Democratic Party. A couple of years ago she represented a new era,
but is now a symbol of the enduring discrimination against women.
Although as a member of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly, Mitsui set up the
city's sexual harassment complaints office and stopped the metropolitan
government from financially supporting beauty contests, she was criticised
by male party members for her feminist views, and has even been a target for
sexual harassment by a fellow council member.
'I thought the Social Democratic Party would have a liberal atmosphere, but
it was just another male hierarchy,' said Mitsui after resigning last month.
Most Japanese companies claim that women employees, on the same career track
as men, receive equal opportunities. But one reason to doubt their
commitment is recent evidence that they are becoming less willing to hire
female graduates. Another is the small impact of the 'sogoshoku' - a career
track launched by image-conscious companies in 1986 which was supposed to
give women the same promotion chances as men.
In practice, however, in addition to the rigid corporate hierarchy, female
employees find that they are bound by the unspoken cultural roles required
of Japanese women.
A study of office practices in 1,700 companies by Recruit Research indicated
that 87.6 per cent had female employees serving tea to colleagues, 70.5 per
cent made female employees wipe the office desks, while only 33.4 per cent
allowed women into policy-making meetings and discussions.
'Of course the basic ideal is for men and women to be equal, but social
roles are different, and this affects daily office work as well,' says a
manager at Seibu Department, a leading retailer famous for its women
managers. If a client comes and the secretary is unavailable, a women rather
than a man is required to make and serve tea.
Recruit also found that only 23.3 per cent of companies interviewed offered
management opportunities for women. Corporate managers blame female
employees' failure to justify the costs of training.
The low figure indicates the barrier may have more to do with unchanging
attitudes towards professional women. Mitsui says of Japanese men: 'They're
just not brought up to think that women can be partners or rivals.'

FT  03 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Resigned commuters wait to be
impressed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE proposals were greeted by commuters yesterday with a mixture of
resignation, frustration and confusion.
At London's Fenchurch Street station most passengers said they would accept
privatisation if it entailed a better service.
'They can't do a much worse job than they're already doing,' said Mr Lance
Bennet, a junior manager at Sainsbury's, and a regular commuter on the line
to Tilbury and Southend, Essex, dubbed the 'misery line' because of
overcrowding and delays, and one of the candidates for franchising.
Other passengers said the areas that needed improvement and investment were
the quality of rolling stock and punctuality.
'Nothing is ever on time, and they give feeble excuses when it does come,'
grumbled Ms Vicky Thorogood, a bank clerk. Like many others, though, she
admitted that she 'hadn't much clue' about what a franchise actually was.
However, Mr Bill Simpson, a manager who commutes from Barking, Essex, said:
'I'm opposed. I don't think that privatisation is good for the public when
it's heavily weighted against the public.'

FT  03 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Fares pledge fails to dispel Tory
unease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT assurance that rail fares will not rise faster under its new
proposals than under the present nationalised regime failed to dispel Tory
backbench unease in the Commons yesterday.
A succession of Conservative MPs expressed misgivings about the government's
plans, as the Railways Bill received its second Commons reading with a
majority of 33 (302 votes to 269).
At least three Tories abstained after two of them - Sir John Stanley, MP for
Tonbridge and Malling, and Mr Robert Adley, chairman of the cross-party
transport committee and MP for Christchurch, - said publicly they would not
support the government.
Sir John said the withholding of a 'key' government document on fare control
policy meant he was 'effectively asked to sign a blank cheque on my
constituents' chequebooks'.
The 'underlying pressure on fares for this privatisation are very firmly in
the upward category,' he added.
Mr Adley charged the government with 'breaking up a national railway system
and creating a vacuum'.
Expressions of Tory concern started during the opening speech by Mr John
MacGregor, the transport secretary. He repeatedly gave way to his backbench
colleagues, including three former ministers.
Mr Nigel Forman, MP for Carshalton &amp; Wallington, said his rail-travelling
constituents would apply three tests to the bill: would it make the trains
more reliable; would it improve the railway infrastructure; and would it
deal with the problem of non-availability of drivers and guards.
Mr David Howell, the former cabinet minister, and Mr Timothy Renton, former
arts minister, similarly highlighted concerns felt by commuters in their
constituencies of Guildford and Mid Sussex.
Mr George Walden, Tory MP for Buckingham, said there was 'a particular
scepticism' towards the government's plans for the railways among people
'not normally opposed to privatisation'. He added: 'They are saying: 'Anyone
can run a line; what we need is someone to run the railway'.'
Mr MacGregor said he did not see why privatisation should lead to reduced
rail services and suggested the new regime would have 'less bureaucratic
elements' than the present system.
He pledged controls on railway operators' freedom to increase fares in some
areas 'for example on London commuter services'.
But he declined a Labour invitation to guarantee that national network rail
cards for the elderly and for young people would continue. There was no
statutory obligation on British Rail to do so, he said.
Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said it was 'not proven' that
the changes proposed by the government were for the better. He added: 'A
publicly owned system can provide a better rail service than a privately
owned one.'
Mr Prescott called for immediate implementation of government proposals to
encourage a shift among freight users from road to rail.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government moves to boost freight
switch from road
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUCCESSIVE transport ministers have repeatedly said that they would like to
see more freight switching from road to rail, but the words have rung
particularly hollow in the last few weeks as hundreds of thousands of tonnes
have gone in precisely the other direction.
There have been fears that privatisation would not only continue, but
accelerate this process. Yesterday, however, the government acted to sweeten
the privatisation pill with a package of measures aimed at making the
railways more attractive for freight.
One of the main reasons for the recent switch away from rail has been the
imposition of big increases in railfreight charges as part of an attempt by
British Rail to get its freight operations into profit in readiness for
privatisation.
Under the new proposals, would-be private-sector freight train operators
will start by negotiating a fee for the use of the tracks with Railtrack,
the state-owned body that will own them. This will be a commercial
negotiation based on what the train operator can afford.
Railtrack's bottom price will be the marginal extra costs it incurs as a
result of allowing a particular freight train to run on its tracks. Clearly
it could not drop below that price without incurring a loss.
But if the freight-train operator cannot afford even that price, and would
otherwise send its freight by road, the government will be prepared to
intervene by paying grants to the freight-train operator of up to 100 per
cent of the track charges - in other words, giving it a completely free ride
on the tracks.
In addition, the government is planning to extend the existing freight
facilities grants scheme, which allows the private sector to claim modest
capital grants against the cost of building freight facilities such as
private sidings. In future it will also be allowable against the cost of
rolling stock.
The government is also to open consultations on increasing the maximum
allowable weight of lorries used in combined transport operations - that is,
those using lorry trailers that load on to rail wagons for the long-distance
part of their journeys. The limit would go up from 38 tonnes to 44 tonnes.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Transporters find some hope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POTENTIAL bidders for passenger franchises found few surprises in Mr
MacGregor's proposals but his plans for freight raised a cheer.
Mr Mike Harvey, spokesman for the Freight on Rail group, which represents
investors in the sector, welcomed Mr MacGregor's announcement as a 'major
positive move' to increase freight on rail.
'Over the last eight weeks or so many of the companies who are already
committed to moving freight by rail have been making sure that MPs and
ministers are aware of how important freight by rail can be to the national
economy. I have to assume that the messages have been getting through.'
The Freight Transport Association, representing large freight users, said it
was delighted with most of the proposals on freight, but 'very concerned'
that while Mr MacGregor announced his intention to raise the gross weight
limit for lorries in joint road/rail haulage operations to 44 tonnes, the
increase would not apply to haulage carried out by road alone. 'There is an
excellent case for 44 tonnes across the board. By restricting it the way he
has, he is almost penalising industry.'
Mr Philip Snowden, managing director of Badger Rail, a division of the bus
operators Badgerline, which is likely to be interested in the Great Western
InterCity line, said: 'We are a bit disappointed that he has restated the
very distinct separation of the authority over the track from the railway
operations.'
He said operation of the track was an important part of the overall service
provided to passengers. 'We would like to have a reasonable degree of at
least day to day control over these aspects.'
But the separation of track and operations was described as 'encouraging' by
Mr Kenneth Irvine, rail privatisation project manager for British Bus, which
is likely to bid for the South West division of Network SouthEast and the
Gatwick Express service.
Mr Keith Taylor, managing director of National Express, the coach operator,
said: 'I welcome the process he has adopted, because it will give
franchisees an opportunity to see what these businesses can produce.'

FT  03 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: British Maastricht vote on the line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH VOTERS are to have their say on Maastricht after all. At least,
those prepared to pay for the privilege.
Baroness Thatcher was at the Palace of Westminster yesterday to help launch
Dial For Democracy - a telephone referendum on the Maastricht treaty.
The idea is to give eligible voters the chance to express a view by dialling
one of two 0891 numbers. Backers of the exercise hope both to build up a
picture of how the British electorate would vote and to increase pressure on
the government for a referendum.
The former prime minister was one of seven cross-party Commons and Lords
representatives who hosted yesterday's launch.
The Euro-sceptic persuasion was ensured of a comfortable majority on the
platform by the presence of Mr Peter Shore and Mr Bryan Gould, both formerly
on the Labour front bench, and of Tory MP Sir Teddy Taylor, in addition to
Lady Thatcher herself.
Mr David Alton, the Liberal Democrat MP, waved the flag for the Maastricht
enthusiasts.
In serious if belligerent form, Lady Thatcher interspersed the usual
arguments deployed by referendum proponents with more characteristically
stentorian calls to arms.
'We alone of the people in Europe have not been invaded or occupied for
1,000 years,' the audience were reminded.
'It to me is unthinkable that the people should not be heard.'
Her speech ended with a plug for one of her favourite publications.
'We hope that all newspapers will print these numbers every day. One
newspaper has already agreed to do so and that is The Sun.'
The organisers' intention is that the poll will be non-profit-making, with
proceeds from the telephone calls used to minimise instances of improper,
under-age or multiple voting. The organisers say lines will remain open for
at least a month.
Yesterday's event culminated with Lady Thatcher appearing to cast the first
vote of the poll using a pristine white telephone provided expressly for the
purpose. On later inspection, the telephone appeared to be dead, so she will
presumably have to phone again to record her vote.
If she does she will of course have to pay; subsequent experimentation
revealed that calls last for two minutes and 35 seconds. They are billed at
48p per minute outside cheap rates.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tomlinson faces opposition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR and Liberal Democrats yesterday called for the channelling of extra
resources into healthcare in London, signalling opposition to any early move
by the government to implement the Tomlinson report on streamlining the
capital's hospitals.
As Downing Street confirmed the Cabinet will not discuss Sir Bernard
Tomlinson's conclusions this week, the two opposition parties rejected his
claim that there are too many beds in London.
Labour said that up to Pounds 1bn would be needed to implement the changes
proposed by Tomlinson - even before any extra spending on primary
healthcare. The Liberal Democrats said that unless adequate funding to
improve community and primary services was available before hospitals are
closed, Londoners would be worse off than before.
The response of Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, should
indicate how she will act. But ministers are anxious to ensure there is
sufficient consultation before decisions are implemented.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour's health spokesman, said the government may avoid
a 'direct approach' because of the cost and the political upheaval involved
and instead try, 'to achieve bed reductions and hospital closures by stealth
rather than by an honest and open frontal attack'.
He added: 'There is a desperate need for a fuller assessment of the needs of
London and how to face the challenges ahead'. He suggested suspending the
internal market and investing in a 'dramatic improvement' in primary and
community services.
Londoners should be involved 'in a consensus approach to developing a more
sensitive and appropriate service for the years ahead', Mr Blunkett said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's ability to abolish the Potato Marketing Scheme was limited
yesterday when a cross-party alliance of peers twice voted against the
government's advice.
The Lords voted by 144 to 136 for a move seeking to protect the scheme if
the government chooses to abolish it in advance of an impending EC
declaration on its conformance with community rules.
They then accepted, by 135 to 121, an amendment which would require a poll
of registered producers before the Potato Marketing Board could apply to
ministers for approval of a successor scheme.
The agriculture bill has now completed its passage through the Lords, and
will come before MPs shortly when ministers will have to decide whether to
reverse these defeats.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Patten condemns NUT boycott
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MOVES by the National Union of Teachers to boycott national curriculum tests
were condemned by Mr John Patten, education secretary, yesterday.
He warned: 'Any boycott would do great damage to the teaching profession.'
Mr Patten said that the NUT wish to oppose tests was shared by Labour MPs
who wanted to make it party policy.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, disputed Mr Patten's assertion
that pilot tests for stage three English had been carried out in more than
500 schools.
She said: 'The tests have actually been piloted in only 32 schools involving
the wrong age of pupils - 15 year olds and not 14 year olds.'
Mr Patten replied that careful preparations for the tests had taken place
over a longer period than for any other public examination. There are over
4m adult illiterates in Britain and this made critical the establishment of
a bench mark against which improved performance could be judged, he said.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Libel action may be dropped
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN apology by the New Statesman and Society for repeating unfounded
allegations about his private life could pave the way for Mr John Major to
drop his legal action against the magazine.
Ministerial colleagues suggested last night that the prime minister is ready
to withdraw his libel writ against the magazine if a retraction expected in
this week's edition is given equal prominence to the original article.
An unconditional apology - along with payment of legal costs - was also
likely to persuade Ms Clare Latimer, the owner of a North London catering
company, to drop her parallel action against the New Statesman.
Downing Street refused to comment on the case, but Mr Major's colleagues
said that he had no interest in seeking punitive damages from the magazine.
Action is, however, expected to continue against Scallywag, a satirical
periodical.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Clinton invites Major to visit US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Major will have an early chance to air any differences between the
UK and the new US administration when later this month he becomes the first
European leader to visit President Bill Clinton, Ralph Atkins writes.
The prime minister will be in Washington on February 24 and is expected to
talk about a range of international issues, although no agenda has yet been
drafted. Areas of contention could include: Bosnia, where the US has been
pushing harder for greater military involvement; world trade; and general
relations between the two countries.
Mr Major will be anxious for his relationship with President Clinton to be
seen as friendly and the White House's decision to invite him ahead of other
European Community leader is a boost.
Conservative party links with the Republican party have threatened to sour
relations. Tory central office sent advisers to help President Bush during
the US elections and the Home Office searched files to see if President
Clinton applied for UK citizenship.
More recently, the UK government has also been, at best, lukewarm about
suggestions raised in Washington for reform of the United Nations' security
council, of which Britain is a member.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Test rail franchises to be set up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE main effect of yesterday's announcements on the privatisation of British
Rail is that the private sector is likely to be operating most of the
passenger trains between London and south-west England and all those in
Scotland by the end of next year.
The government's plans involve putting BR's tracks into the ownership of a
new state-owned body called Railtrack and parcelling out the operation of
the passenger trains to private-sector franchisees by competitive tender.
To give would-be franchisees an idea of what they might be letting
themselves in for, the government will set up seven pilot franchises that
will be split from the rest of the railway this year and run autonomously by
BR managers.
These franchises will not necessarily be the first to be contracted out to
the private sector, but because they will be in a better state of readiness
than the rest it is assumed they will be prime candidates.
The seven - with annual ticket revenue - are:
Network SouthEast's south-western division operating out of London Waterloo.
Turnover: Pounds 230m.
InterCity's east coast main line from London King's Cross to Edinburgh and
Glasgow. Turnover: Pounds 209m.
InterCity's Great Western main line from Paddington to south Wales and
south-west England. Turnover: Pounds 159m.
ScotRail, comprising all non-InterCity lines in Scotland. Turnover: Pounds
81.6m.
The London, Tilbury &amp; Southend line running into London's Fenchurch Street
station. Turnover: Pounds 56m.
InterCity's Gatwick Express. Turnover: Pounds 25m.
The Isle of Wight railway which, unusually, will be franchised along with
its tracks. Turnover: not available.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said yesterday that a complete map
of proposed franchise areas covering the rest of the network would be
published later this year.
In an attempt to make the franchising process as simple as possible,
would-be franchisees will not be involved in complex negotiations over train
services and track charges. Instead, the franchising authority will work
these out with Railtrack and then put the resulting deal out to tender.
All that companies will be required to do is to look at the deal and say how
much they are prepared to bid to run the service under the terms agreed. If
they reckon it will run at a loss (as most will), they will bid according to
the amount of subsidy they require.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government moves to boost freight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUCCESSIVE transport ministers have repeatedly said that they would like to
see more freight switching from road to rail, but the words have rung
particularly hollow in the last few weeks as hundreds of thousands of tonnes
have gone in precisely the other direction.
There have been fears that privatisation would not only continue, but
accelerate this process. Yesterday, however, the government acted to sweeten
the privatisation pill with a package of measures aimed at making the
railways more attractive for freight.
One of the main reasons for the recent switch away from rail has been the
imposition of big increases in railfreight charges as part of an attempt by
British Rail to get its freight operations into profit in readiness for
privatisation.
Under the new proposals would-be private-sector freight train operators will
start by negotiating a fee for the use of the tracks with Railtrack, the
state-owned body that will own them. This will be a commercial negotiation
based on what the train operator can afford to pay.
Railtrack's bottom price will be the marginal extra costs it incurs as a
result of allowing a particular freight train to run on its tracks. Clearly
it could not drop below that price without incurring a loss.
But if the freight-train operator cannot afford even that price, and would
otherwise send its freight by road, the government will be prepared to
intervene by paying grants to the freight-train operator of up to 100 per
cent of the track charges - in other words, giving it a completely free ride
on the tracks.
In addition, the government is planning to extend the existing freight
facilities grants scheme, which allows the private sector to claim modest
capital grants against the cost of building freight facilities such as
private sidings. In future, it will also be allowable against the cost of
rolling stock.
The government is also to open consultations on increasing the maximum
allowable weight of lorries used in combined transport operations - that is,
those using lorry trailers that load on to rail wagons for the long-distance
part of their journeys. The limit would go up from 38 tonnes to 44 tonnes.
Although these measures may stem the loss of freight from rail to road, they
seem unlikely to do much more. Before paying any grants, the government will
need to be persuaded that they are justified by the environmental benefits
they bring. Furthermore, the success of the scheme will depend on the total
level of grant available in any given year.
The government was not saying yesterday how much the annual grant would be.
But some indication of what might be needed may be gained from the existing
freight facilities grants scheme. This provides capital grants to encourage
the private sector to build railfreight facilities. At just Pounds 6m a
year, it appears to have at best a limited effect on keeping freight on the
rails.

FT  03 FEB 93 / North-south council divide widens: The growing trauma over
criteria for sharing Treasury grants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEBRUARY heralds the annual local government budget trauma. As in past
years, there are daily reports - yesterday from Birmingham - of imminent and
massive cuts in services and staff, blamed on government spending caps and
inadequate Treasury largesse.
With capping far tighter this year than last, the reports could turn into
reality when budgets are finalised next month. But this year's budget round
is novel for the degree of ill-feeling between councils over the criteria
used for sharing out Treasury grants.
Government grants, and capping levels for total spending by each authority,
are based on 'standard spending assessments' (SSAs), calculated each year,
which is the Environment Department's view of the spending needed 'to
provide a standard level of service consistent with (its) view of the
appropriate amount of expenditure for all authorities.' It takes account of
'social, demographic and geographical characteristics'.
It is the way it does so that is causing the fuss. A particular source of
grievance this year is the so-called 'area cost adjustment' (ACA), which is
supposed to compensate councils in the south-east for higher than average
wage costs. But authorities further north say it is an unfair device for
siphoning funds to areas that are already cash rich.
In 1988, the ACA was only Pounds 418m; this year it is Pounds 1.3bn - about
3 per cent of total standard spending (the aggregate of all SSAs) for
England.
Mr Bruce Stevenson, chief executive of Labour-controlled Cleveland, says the
ACA 'has in effect become a redistributive mechanism moving sums of money
from the rest of the world into the south-east.' He described it as 'a
response to a political difficulty' - keeping council tax bills down in
politically-sensitive London.
He claimed that if ACA distributed resources fairly his council would be
Pounds 5m better off - equal to a reduction of Pounds 31 in average council
tax bills.
Shropshire County Council has been leading a national lobby against the ACA.
Though the county, in which no party has overall control, has a Labour
administration, the lobby includes Tory-controlled Hereford and Worcester.
Mr Tony Preece, the county's senior assistant county treasurer, said the
objections to ACA were not political. 'We acknowledge the formula must
reflect the higher costs in London and the south-east, but our reservation
is that the way the formula is applied at the moment more than compensates
authorities in that area.'
Derbyshire County Council, which is also lobbying, points to the rise in its
standard spending assessment compared with that of Hertfordshire, a
beneficiary of ACA. The county treasurer says Derbyshire's SSA rose by 28.9
per cent between 1989 and 1992, whereas Hertfordshire's increased by 43.8
per cent.
Derbyshire and other ACA critics want to see it eliminated for services like
education, police, and the fire service, where pay rates are determined by
national bargaining; and, for other services, to remove private-sector wage
rates as a basis of calculation.
None of that cuts much ice in Hertfordshire, a staunch defender of the
status quo. Mr Bill Ogley, county treasurer says his county 'has among the
highest housing costs in the country, the heaviest traffic and the highest
car ownership.' The Environment Department also insists that the ACA is
intended to reflect real cost differences.
Counties are also united in opposition to metropolitan areas, particularly
London, over rules for calculating standard spending assessments for social
services and 'additional educational needs' - which determine about a fifth
of the education element of government grants to councils.
The grant for additional education depends upon the proportion of an
authority's children living with lone parents, the proportion in families
dependent on income support, and the proportion born outside the UK, US or
Old Commonwealth, or with heads of household born there.
Derbyshire cites research showing there to be 'little if any' relationship
between those factors and the performance of pupils in national tests and
examinations, and thus the real demand for resources in schools. It claims
that the criteria simply channels resources to London and away from county
councils.
When introduced in 1990, SSAs were intended to be a simpler and fairer basis
for distributing government grants to councils than the previous system
comprising 63 components. Alas, in local government simplicity and fairness
are uneasy bedfellows.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Polluters may monitor themselves: Environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRY could be allowed to monitor its own pollution, under yesterday's
proposals for cutting through environmental red tape.
Environmentalists attacked the suggestion by Mr Michael Howard, environment
secretary, that the pollution inspectorate could supervise industrial
discharges by taking 'sample audits' of a few companies. Mr Andrew Lees of
Friends of the Earth, the campaign group, said: 'Lifting the burden of
regulation is good for chaos, not good for business. Regulation creates a
level playing field and rewards companies which strive towards higher
environmental standards.'
The 1990 Environmental Protection Act, under a framework known as Integrated
Pollution Control, requires some industries to demonstrate to the
inspectorate they are using the best environmental technology that is also
economic. Mr Lees said Mr Howard's statement was 'compromising' the
case-by-case approach because the pollution inspectorate was 'so
under-resourced'.
The environment department also plans to simplify the planning system 'to
reduce the burden on businesses' and Mr Howard believes it should give
designers and building control authorities 'greater flexibility' too. The
department intends to abolish the legal definition of architects, after a
report by the Architects Registration Council of the UK concluded that
statutory registration had 'brought no added benefit to the public, to
consumers, or to the profession'.
The Ministry of Agriculture is planning a deregulation, programme, including
reform of land tenure, with legislation, possibly in the next session of
Parliament.

A COMPLETE review of health and safety legislation, with the object of
reducing the regulatory burden on small businesses, was announced by the
Department of Employment yesterday.
The Health and Safety Commission is to report by the end of March to Mr
Michael Forsyth, the Department of Employment minister charged with
combating red tape, on how it plans to carry out the review.
The scope for wholesale deregulation is limited because of European
Community directives on health and safety. From January 1 businesses were
faced with six new pieces of legislation covering everything from visual
display units to the lifting of heavy weights.
Some defunct regulations were taken off the statute book at the same time -
the 1927 Gut Scraping and Tripe Dressing Regulations, for example.
However, the Confederation of British Industry feels the net effect has been
to increase the level of prescriptive legislation in recent years. Mr John
Cridland, CBI health and safety director, said it was no use talking of
deregulation on a domestic level when more red tape had already been agreed
to in Brussels.
The department also pointed out the abolition of Wages Councils would 'free
over a quarter of a million employers from statutory wage fixing'.

FT  03 FEB 93 / New shape to old proposals: Customs and tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S revenue-raising agencies yesterday re-packaged a number of
existing initiatives to offer as part of the Department of Trade and
Industry's deregulatory initiative.
HM Customs &amp; Excise was singled out under five areas:
Substantial reduction in forms, as a result of the single European market.
Abolition of duties on mechanical lighters and matches.
Increased thresholds for value added tax and cash accounting.
Review of the registration and licensing requirements for excise and inland
customs.
Proposals to decriminalise many excise offences, and the introduction of an
independent appeals system.
The Inland Revenue was highlighted under three areas:
Pay-and-file of corporation tax by which companies assess their own
liability, to be introduced this October.
Consultation for the reform of the taxation system for the self-employed,
with the introduction of the pay-and-file system, allowing taxpayers to
assess their own tax as soon as the 1996 tax year.
Extending the number of companies which can submit abbreviated, three-line
accounts for assessment, from turnover of Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 15,000 a
year.
In addition, officials yesterday stressed a number of other areas in which
it has been active in reducing red tape. These include extensive 'customer'
surveys to understand the needs of the self-employed, employees and
employers and a continual review and re-writing of tax forms and information
leaflets to make the system more understandable.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Small business welcomes untangling of red tape: Government
takes steps to cut bureaucracy - Insitute of Directors concerned over the
patchy nature of proposed measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS organisations and owners of small businesses last night welcomed
the government's drive to reduce red tape but said a lot of hard work would
be necessary for it to have any significant impact.
Some were disappointed at the trivial nature of some of the 56 measures
which government departments said they had already taken or were planning to
implement. The Department of Employment, responsible for health and safety
legislation, mentioned steps to remove the regulation specifying the
distance between clothes pegs in changing rooms.
'There are items on the list which are surprising,' said Mr Ian Peters,
deputy director of policy at the Confederation of British Industry. 'If that
is the extent of the lists departments can come up with it demonstrates the
significance of what remains to be done.'
The Forum of Private Business described the programme as 'a good start' but
called for the government to compensate small businesses for the cost of
administering regulations until significant reductions in the burden of red
tape had been made.
The plan to establish seven task forces of businesspeople to re-examine
existing legislation was welcome as long as small businesses were properly
represented. 'We hope small business owners will make up 96 per cent of the
committee members because that is their share of the business community,'
said Mr Stan Mendham, the forum's chief executive.
Ms Jane Lyon, managing director of Clam-Brummer, a manufacturer of
industrial adhesives, said she would welcome the opportunity to sit on the
relevant task force. 'The people who live with the regulations day in, day
out are the people who know the costs they impose on industry,' she said.
Some business owners said they feared that the task forces would be composed
only of 'the great and the good'. I fear it will be a case of the old pals
act,' said Mr Bud Ellis, managing director of Flexi-Pak, a food packaging
company with annual sales of Pounds 1.3m. 'It is absolutely vital that the
little fellow gets a look-in.'
One worry was that the creation of the task forces would put an additional
burden on the business community. 'What is really important is to change the
culture in government so we don't need all these panels,' said Mr Peters.
Of concern to the Institute of Directors was the patchy nature of the list
of actions or proposed actions from the different ministries.
'Some departments have done more than others,' commented Mr Ian Smedley,
responsible for deregulation policy at the institute.
He expressed surprise that no mention had been made of any plan to abolish
or modify the requirement that small companies have their accounts audited
since this was the responsibility of Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs
minister at the Department of Trade and Industry and the junior minister
responsible for the deregulation programme.
Much more needed to be done in the areas of pollution control and health and
safety, while no reference was made to plans to reduce the number of
licences needed to start up in certain business areas, he noted.
The institute said it was pleased to see that the government intended to
link its deregulation programme with the Citizen's Charter. This would
require government departments to promise to respond to requests from
business and the public within agreed time limits.
Mr Smedley said he was also encouraged by the news that the Department of
Social Security was reviewing eliminating the differences between the
definition of earnings for the purposes of PAYE and National Insurance.
Payroll administration is a heavy burden for small businesses and this would
simplify matters, he said.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Attack on notorious fire rules: Home Office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAIN item on the Home Office agenda is streamlining fire regulations,
which have been notoriously onerous for some businesses.
Action might be some way off, however, as the department is having to await
publication of the latest European Community regulations later in the year.
Moves are expected on Sunday trading regulations, but the timing is
uncertain. Options will be put to the Commons, but this is unlikely to
happen until the next session of parliament.
Immigration controls are to be eased for business travellers, but
implementation is also some way off.
Other proposals cover reform of the licensing laws with the introduction
licences that would allow children to go into pubs when accompanied by
adults.
In gambling, off-course betting for summer horse racing and the relaxation
of bingo advertising regulations have already been announced. Changes in the
way pools and lotteries operate are included in the Lotteries Bill before
parliament.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Plan for simplified tendering: Defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Ministry of Defence has a running programme of reforms aimed at cutting
bureaucracy and simplifying procedures for its suppliers.
It announced plans in November to market test each year for the next four
years Pounds 1.2bn worth of services and facilities provided in-house. The
idea is to open up new areas of activity to competition. At the same time, a
fortnightly billing scheme was introduced by the ministry to ensure prompt
payment to contractors. This year the MoD expects to pay more than Pounds
12bn to nearly 20,000 contractors.
Future plans to cut red tape include restricting the number of companies
invited to tender for contracts so that time is not wasted by unsuitable
bidders, reducing price investigations on non-competitive contracts, and
introducing simpler arrangements for the commercial exploitation levy on
products developed for the MoD.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Queen says Sun broke copyright
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE QUEEN'S solicitors have written to The Sun newspaper threatening legal
action for alleged breach of copyright when the paper published the text of
her 1992 Christmas message two days before it was broadcast.
Mr Kelvin MacKenzie, The Sun's editor, confirmed last night that he had
received a letter from solicitors Farrer &amp; Co giving him seven days to
respond to a demand for damages and costs or face a High Court action.
The letter said printing the text of the Queen's speech on its front page on
December 23 was a 'clear infringement of Her Majesty's copyright'.
The Sun said: 'We shall be vigorously defending the action'.
Buckingham Palace said last night it was not prepared to comment on the
matter at this stage.
Mr Richard Price, a partner of City lawyers Taylor Joynson Garrett who
specialises in intellectual property law, said the Queen had copyright in
anything that she had written subject to her licensing its publication.
'The question is did The Sun obtain the speech lawfully? If they did they
would effectively be licensed to use it and the Queen would have no case,'
Price said. 'If, however, they obtained it unlawfully or they breached the
terms of the licence by, for example, breaking the embargo then the Queen
would have a solid case for breach of copyright.'
The damages sought by the Queen are not specified in the letter from Farrer
&amp; Co, but the final amount is expected to be in six figures.
One lawyer said last night that the dispute will depend on whether The Sun
published the speech early in order to obtain a commercial advantage over
its rivals.
This is the latest episode in a long-running battle between the palace and
The Sun. The last time the Queen instructed her lawyers to take action
against the newspaper was also over a breach of copyright.
In 1988 the paper paid Pounds 100,000-plus costs in an out-of-court
settlement after it printed a private photograph of members of the royal
family.
The year before, The Sun paid an estimated Pounds 20,000 to charities after
the Queen extracted an apology for the publication of a private letter from
the Duke of Edinburgh to the head of the Royal Marines.
No action has been taken over stories about the marriage of the Prince and
Princess of Wales or over publication of transcripts of alleged phone
conversations between members of the royal family.

FT  03 FEB 93 / House price figures hit hopes for recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES that an upturn in house sales would lead to a swift recovery in prices
were damped yesterday after Halifax, the country's biggest mortgage lender,
reported that house prices on average had fallen by 0.4 per cent in January.
The Halifax's figures conflicted with a survey by Nationwide, the
second-largest building society, which reported that prices on average had
risen by 1.2 per cent last month, the biggest monthly rise since May 1991.
Both societies, however, agreed that there had been an increase in the
number of potential purchasers requesting mortgages and inquiring about
properties for sale.
Halifax said increased activity had yet to feed through to firm mortgage
offers. Nonetheless market activity was expected to show a stronger recovery
by spring, when prices should have started to stabilise.
'There might be some modest monthly increases in the second half of this
year provided that economic confidence generally begins to recover,' said
the society.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, Nationwide's chief executive, said his society's
figures should be taken as an encouraging sign that stability might be
returning to the mar-ket.
He said: 'One swallow does not make a summer, but we believe there are
grounds for cautious optimism. If the latest fall in interest rates helps to
stimulate the economy generally and to boost consumer confidence, a more
active and healthy housing market should emerge.'
The monthly house-price surveys published by Halifax and Nationwide have
occasionally disagreed. Nationwide says this is mainly due to differences
between the societies in what constitutes an 'average house'.
According to Halifax the average price of a home fell by 7.7 per cent to
Pounds 60,471 during the 12 months to the end of January, compared with
Nationwide which estimated the average price of a home last month to be
Pounds 52,507.
Halifax also estimated that the price of a new house had fallen by only 1.9
per cent on average to Pounds 67,060 since January last year.
Mortgage lenders, estate agents and builders have reported a sharp increase
in agreed sales since before Christmas. The Building Societies Association
last week reported the first December increase in mortgage approvals
compared with November for 16 years. Part of the improvement is thought to
be buyers returning to the market after the autumn sterling crisis.
The extent of the damage inflicted on buyers' confidence by wildly
fluctuating interest rates was underlined yesterday by the publication of
mort-gage lending figures for the final three months of last year.
The number of mortgage applications during the fourth quarter fell by 24 per
cent to 173,000 compared with the last three months of 1991, according to
the Council of Mortgage Lenders. Their total value fell by 28 per cent to
Pounds 9.34bn.
Mr Mark Boleat, the council's director-general, said: 'Evidence that
significant falls in mortgage rates were beginning to have a positive effect
on the housing market occurred too late in the quarter to be reflected in
the latest lending figures.'

FT  03 FEB 93 / BCCI liquidator hits back at critics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIQUIDATORS to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International
yesterday hit back at criticism from creditors calling for their removal,
Andrew Jack writes.
Mr Christopher Morris, head of corporate special services at Touche Ross,
who is joint liquidator to BCCI, said delays caused by 'a small' group of
dissenting creditors were costing 'many hundreds of thousands of pounds'.
His comments follow remarks from Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East,
who has represented a group of BCCI creditors criticising Touche's fees, the
size of the settlement being negotiated and the slow pace of its payment.
Mr Morris said substantial delays were being caused by the decision by
creditors to appeal against ratification by the Luxembourg courts of the
settlement negotiated by the liquidators.
Without the delays, he said, a first payment of Pounds 800m would have been
received from the government of Abu Dhabi in December.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Calcutt calls for tougher press curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR DAVID Calcutt QC warned MPs yesterday that the Press Complaints
Commission had not worked and that statutory measures were needed to
regulate newspapers.
Sir David, who recently published a review of self-regulation by the press,
told the Commons National Heritage committee that the commission was a body
'by the press, of the press and for the press'. Unless there is statutory
regulation, he said, 'there will be an endless succession of last chances
and an even weaker PCC'.
But many of the committee members were sceptical about Sir David's main
proposal that the commission be replaced by a statutory tribunal. Under his
proposals, the tribunal would be chaired by a judge and be able to impose
fines on newspapers for breaches of a statutory code of practice.
Sir David said his main anxiety was that if the press had one more chance it
would assume regulation was not being taken seriously. 'If you get that
situation you are going to have a real problem.'
Sir David defended his proposal to fine newspapers. This, he said, would
only happen in extreme cases where a newspaper repeated an offence or was in
contempt of the tribunal. Such a tribunal, he emphasised, would not stand in
the way of proper investigative journalism.
Sir David also said that proprietors should have 'a very big part to play'
in press regulation.
The commission was also criticised by Mr Gerald Kaufman, the Labour MP who
chairs the National Heritage committee. Mr Kaufman said it had made a fool
of itself over Mr Alastair Morton's book on the Princess of Wales. Although
it had been controversial, it was legitimately published and had turned out
to be a highly accurate piece of history, Mr Kaufman said.
By contrast, he said the commission had taken little effective action over
the so-called 'Camillagate' tapes of an alleged telephone conversation
between the Prince of Wales and his friend, Mrs Camilla Parker-Bowles, 'even
though very serious issues are raised by that tape'.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Contracting out policies face further trouble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S policies on contracting out public services faces
continuing disruption because of uncertainty over the rights of employees
whose work is contracted out.
Legal advice obtained by the Labour-dominated Association of Metropolitan
Authorities says that the overwhelming majority of contracts put out to
tender by councils are covered by European Community legislation protecting
the jobs and conditions of workers in mergers. This means that the
contractor must take over the employees on their existing terms and
condi-tions, removing scope for savings through lower pay or cutting staff.
The confusion has arisen over the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of
Employment) regulations 1981, which implement the EC's 1977 Acquired Rights
directive.
Recent decisions of the European Court of Justice have extended the scope of
the regulations to cover contracting out of some public services.
However, Mr Patrick Elias, a leading employment QC, has advised the local
authorities associations that the EC directive is likely to apply in most
cases where a service is contracted out.
An amendment to the regulations now passing through parliament will make
this absolutely clear, he says.
Government departments are continuing to suspend plans to put Civil Service
work out to tender until it is clear whether market-testing is covered by
the legislation.
The Home Office has shelved the contracting out of the Prison Service stores
from April 1, following advice that the regulations would apply. The 120
staff employed in the stores had been issued with redundancy notices after
the contract had been won by Beck &amp; Pollitzer, the contract-services group,
in the belief that the regulations did not apply.
The Crown Prosecution Service has shelved plans to put its file store out to
tender while seeking advice from the Treasury solicitor on whether the
regulations apply.
It emerged last week that Mr Michael Bichard, chief executive of the
Benefits Agency, had complained to Sir Michael Partridge, permanent
secretary at the Department of Social Security, over the failure of the
Cabinet Office to answer key questions over the issue. Mr Bichard said that
the lack of clarity threatened agency plans to market-test some 10,000 jobs.
One option for the government would be to seek an amendment of the EC
acquired rights directive to exclude contracting out of public services. The
UK, however, is reluctant to be seen to be pressing too hard for such an
amendment for fear of creating an anti-British coalition against change.
Both Mr Leon Brittan, the EC's external economic affairs commissioner, and
Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, have expressed an interest
in an amendment to exclude contracting out in the public sector.
Mr Padraig Flynn, EC social affairs commissioner, has not ruled out such an
amend-ment.
He said recently: 'If it could be shown to me that in special, isolated,
cases, the intention of the law was being defeated in usage then it may
require amendment.'

FT  03 FEB 93 / Scotland 'not gaining full benefit of multinationals'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH-based companies are failing to fully exploit the opportunities
presented by large multinational electronics companies based in Scotland,
says a new academic study.
As a result inward investment in electronics is not producing as much
benefit to the Scottish economy as it should.
A survey of 106 multinational electronics companies in Scotland by Dr Ivan
Turok of Strathclyde University shows they bought only 12 per cent of the
components and other material inputs from Scottish-based companies. This
percentage is roughly in line with past studies conducted by the Scottish
Development Agency.
Scottish companies tended to supply the multinational plants with simpler
products such as keyboards, plastics, cables, sheet metal, packaging and
printed materials, although Scottish companies were also significant
suppliers of printed circuit boards.
Output by electronics companies located in Scotland rose by an average of 14
per cent a year during the 1980s, reaching Pounds 3.9bn in 1989, while the
output of the rest of Scottish manufacturing industry stagnated, Dr Turok
says.
The value added in Scotland - the locally purchased inputs of material and
labour - declined from 39 per cent of output in 1983 to 24 per cent in 1989.
The relative decline in value added suggests that multinational plants are
increasingly importing components and sub-assemblies from overseas, and
confining their operations in Scotland to final assembly in what are
sometimes called 'screwdriver' operations, Dr Turok says.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Changes urged in medical research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW MEASURES are needed to translate advances in medical research into
improved patient care, the government's Advisory Council on Science and
Technology said yesterday.
Acost identified a 'development gap' in the transfer of Britain's 'world
class' medical research to improved treatments.
'Frustrated inventors contrast British industry's reluctance to pick up
technology at an early stage, because of the risks involved, with the
enthusiasm shown by US and Japanese manufacturers for new product ideas and
for their willingness to invest for the long-term,' the council said.
To bridge the gap, Acost wants the government to set up a Medilink programme
that would channel public and private funds towards exploiting ideas from
universities and the National Health Service.
It would be an extension of the existing Link programme of collaborative
research.
Other recommendations from the Acost medical research and health committee,
chaired by Dr Peter Doyle, ICI research director, include more training for
scientists in the use of patents and an opt-out system for organ donation to
increase the supply for transplantation.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Exporters warned of payment delays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK EXPORTERS to other parts of Europe 'are facing very seriously increased
risks', according to NCM Credit Insurance, Britain's leading private sector
export credit insurer.
Overdue accounts rose by more than a third in 1992 as recession and
bankruptcies led to defaults in countries once regarded as virtually
risk-free, the insurer said.
'The environment is very dangerous,' Mr Colin Foxall, NCM's chief executive,
said. 'It is important that people should realise that doing business in
Europe involves increasing risks.'
The warnings come just two weeks after Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, and Mr Richard Needham, his deputy, launched a
broad-ranging initiative to boost exports across the EC called Business in
Europe.
It is part of a wider UK government strategy to revive the economy through
export growth rather than domestic demand.
'Ministers are trying to encourage exports in Europe, but are not alerting
them to the dangers,' said Ms Conni Randall, NCM's director for business
strategy.
The value of overdue accounts in the EC in 1992 amounted to Pounds 72m, up
from Pounds 53m in 1991.
The company describes an even more stark deterioration over the five years
from 1987 to 1992, where real losses reported by UK companies exporting to
the EC have more than trebled.
Veiling actual numbers for reasons of business confidentiality, NCM says
losses reported on exports to Portugal have soared 27-fold between 1987 and
1992.
Losses reported for Spain have risen by 805 per cent, those for Belgium by
530 per cent. Even Germany was up 300 per cent.
'The opportunities that devaluation in the UK are going to present are not
going to be easily absorbed because of the state of these economies, which
are slowing down or presenting considerable difficulties in terms of
defaults,' Ms Randall said. 'Efforts to capitalise on export opportunities
will be blunted.'
Mr Foxall insisted yesterday that, while NCM's data was not comprehensive,
it was unquestionably representative.
The company provided export credit insurance for exports worth Pounds 14bn
in 1992, involving 6,000 companies trading with 222 countries, accounting
for 80 per cent of the policies written for UK exporters.
Trade Indemnity, which is the UK's second most important export credit
insurer, reported on Monday that a survey of 600 companies showed the
trading outlook for UK companies remained 'ominous', with under-capacity,
cancelled orders, and cash flow problems still rife.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Hoover pays lump sum over controversial deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKERS at Hoover's Cambuslang plant in Glasgow will receive one-off
payments averaging about 20 per cent of annual wages for accepting the
controversial deal on working practices that led to the closure of the US
household appliance manufacturer's factory at Dijon, France.
Every worker will receive Pounds 2,500 as compensation for the end of
restrictive practices and demarcation lines, with a further Pounds 150 as a
goodwill payment. Shift workers will receive Pounds 500 for accepting the
reduction in the three-shift premium rate - the rate paid and calculated per
shift - from 156 per cent to 133 per cent of the basic rate, the industry
average.
Hoover imposed a pay freeze last March and the present agreement will last
until the end of this year. Basic weekly pay rates range between Pounds
169.80 for a labourer to Pounds 212.55 for a craftsman fitter.
Leaders of the AEEU engineering and electricians' union yesterday robustly
defended the deal. 'We have nothing to be ashamed of,' said Mr Jimmy Airlie,
the union's executive officer for Scotland. 'We are not involved in social
dumping. We will be apologising to nobody for what we have done. In the
circumstances it was the best deal we could reach with the company.'
The AEEU points out that many of the jobs lost when Hoover shut its Perivale
plant in west London 10 years ago went to plants on the Continent.
Tomorrow Mr John Weakley, an AEEU executive member not directly involved in
the Cambuslang deal, will meet officials of the European Metalworkers
Federation in Brussels, including a delegation from the CFDT and FO unions
in France.
The federation's executive requested the meeting to discuss the Cambuslang
deal.
Mr Weakley said yesterday he would not be discussing the details of the
deal. 'I will sit down and listen to what they have to say.'
Mr Bill Jordan, AEEU president who also heads the European federation, said:
'Our union will not discuss the content of the agreement - that is our
business. It is not on the table.'

FT  03 FEB 93 / Barclays offers 1.5% pay rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS Bank yesterday offered its 65,000 clerical staff a salary increase
of 1.5 per cent in line with the government's public-sector pay guidelines,
but said it intended to cut their entitlement to paid sick leave.
At a time when both Lloyds and National Westminster banks have proposed pay
freezes, Barclays believes it has made a 'fair' offer. But Mr Rob MacGregor,
assistant general secretary of Bifu, the banking union, denounced the offer
as 'derisory' and accused Barclays of 'making the sick help pay for it'.
Clerical salaries range from Pounds 6,219 to Pounds 18,675 and Barclays is
offering flat-rate increases of Pounds 120 a year for the lowest clerical
grade up to Pounds 240 for the highest.
Staff with less than two years' service will have their sick-pay entitlement
cut from two months to two weeks from July 1. Other staff will have their
entitlement reduced too, but by less. Paid sick-leave entitlement for the
20,000 staff who have worked at Barclays for more than 12 years will be
reduced from six months to 24 weeks.
The bank also plans to drop its Pounds 300 to Pounds 900 London 'loading'
payments for new recruits. The payments were introduced a few years ago to
attract new secretarial staff when the labour market was tight. Staff will
still receive a London weighting allowance.
About 1 per cent of staff will not receive any rise because of poor
performance.
Barclays said staff were 'well aware of the difficult conditions under which
the bank is presently operating'.
It added that it did not intend to alter its offer, but further negotiations
are to be held on February 11. Bifu is seeking a 5.5 per cent pay rise for
its members at Barclays and the bank's staff association wants 3 per cent.
Print workers yesterday lodged a claim for a 'substantial' wage increase and
a rise of one week, to six, in annual holiday entitlement.
Last year employers, who had wanted a pay freeze, agreed a two-stage deal.
The GPMU, the printworkers union, claimed that a high proportion of the
industry was still busy and productivity had increased substantially.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Granada likely to cut 60 to 70 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRANADA Television is expected to announce between 60 and 70 compulsory
redundancies today among its programme-making staff.
The company has already said it wants to shed between 250 and 300 jobs and
last week accepted 120 redundancy applications.
'These are PA's, floor managers, stage managers - the people who make
programmes,' said Ms Anne Rawcliffe-King, a national officer for Bectu, the
broadcasting union.
There are currently 894 permanent staff at Granada and Bectu says this will
now fall to 650 even though the company has one of the largest programme
contributions in the ITV network.
The union believes that remaining Granada staff will be asked to accept a
cut in basic wages even though the Granada Group recently announced a 129
per cent increase in pre-tax profits, up to Pounds 130m for the year to the
end of September 1992.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Data watchdog to meet bank chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR manager of Barclays Bank is to meet a representative of the data
protection registrar this week to defend the bank against the claim it may
be breaking the law by insisting that new customers' details can be used for
the marketing of other bank products.
Barclays said yesterday it believed it was neither breaching the 1984 Data
Protection Act nor evading the banks' code of practice for personal
customers by refusing to allow applicants who reject this to open new
accounts.
The bank acted as Labour demanded that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
establish whether any bank is turning away customers who refuse to allow
their details to be made available to all the bank's subsidiaries.
Labour's move followed the disclosure that Mr John Lamidey, assistant data
protection registrar with responsibility for financial services, was worried
about possible breaches of the act and evasions of the personal banking
code.
Mr Lamidey cited clauses in application forms for Barclays products, such as
its Barclaycard credit card, which say that the bank will enter the
information on its central database for use by any company within the
Barclays group.
Barclays said yesterday it had written to all customers in 1990 to ask their
permission to enter details on its customer information system database.
Only a small fraction had refused such permission.
The code of practice says that banks should not disclose information about
customers' accounts or their names and addresses for marketing purposes
except in circumstances such as when the customer requests it or gives
consent.
The British Bankers' Association said its committee on data security was
still discussing concerns raised by Mr Lamidey. It expected to meet him
again to discuss data security after individual banks had considered them.
Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's city spokesman, tabled a series of
parliamentary questions to the Treasury after Mr Lamidey expressed concern
on Monday about how banks were obtaining and using personal and account
details.
Mr Darling has asked Mr Lamont to request a report from the governor of the
Bank of England on whether personal financial information on customers has
been disclosed to third parties without the knowledge and consent of the
customer.
Mr Darling also wants to know if any bank is turning away customers who do
not agree to their personal financial deta being disclosed to third parties
such as their own subsidiary financial services companies. He said there was
'legitimate public concern' about whether the existing regulatory system was
being adequately enforced. The Treasury is likely to respond to Mr Darling's
questions within a week.
Banks have become keen to gain customers' permission to disclose details to
all their subsidiaries because they want to raise more income from selling
products such as insurance and credit cards.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Fears on confidentiality prompt industry review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH Bankers Association is conducting an industry-wide review of how
to prevent leaks of customers' account details. The move follows the leak
last autumn to The Sun newspaper of details of Mr Norman Lamont's Access
credit card statement.
Banks are concerned that the leak over the chancellor's details was not
unique, although they dispute claims by some law firms and private detective
agencies that almost anyone's bank account or credit card details can be
obtained relatively easily. Senior bankers said it would be damaging to
business if customers lost confidence in banks' ability to keep their
account details secret.
Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland Bank, said: 'What I find
concerning is the suggestion that someone will disclose information on bank
customers for as little as Pounds 200.'
Mr Bert Morris, the National Westminster Bank director who called for the
review, said: 'I do not think it is easy to obtain such information. But
there are sophisticated investigators who can get in to our systems.'
The banks' main fear is that some of their employees may be selling
information to private detectives. Because banks have introduced nationwide
computer networks for the storage of customer information, a bank employee
may be able to obtain access to information about any customers of the bank.
Prior to computerisation, the employee could only get access to details
about customers of the branch.
The association's review will cover three issues:
Are there effective legal sanctions against the disclosure of information
about customers' affairs? In particular, is the Data Protection Act tough
enough?
Could banks build more safeguards into their computer systems to make it
harder for employees to use them in unauthorised ways? The process of
'logging on' to a computer system is under particular scrutiny.
Could banks do more to ensure the honesty of their staff?
The law in this area is complex, but lawyers and bankers agree that it is
not a criminal offence to pass on information about a customer's accounts
without authorisation from the customer. It would, however, be a breach of
contract and banks say they would have no hesitation in dismissing an
employee making unauthorised disclosures.
There are laws to protect confidentiality of information stored on computer.
The 1990 Computer Misuse Act makes it illegal for anyone to gain
unauthorised access to computerised information, and the 1984 Data
Protection Act obliges companies to take steps to prevent leaking of
information stored on computers.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Philips boosts Blackburn plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the large Dutch electronics group, yesterday said that it had
decided to concentrate all production of television-tube cathodes at its
Blackburn plant in Lancashire.
The company produces about 60 per cent of its cathodes in Blackburn. The
rest are made in the Netherlands.
Philips said the decision had been taken as part of a drive to cut
production costs. He said the production facilities in Blackburn could be
developed to produce cathodes more efficiently.
The move is evidence of the 'clear and tough' measures the company promised
in November to improve performance in consumer electronics and components.
About 200 people are employed in Blackburn in cathode production. The
company would not say whether the decision would lead to either further
investment or more jobs at the plant. He also said he did not know the
salary differential between workers in the Netherlands and Blackburn but
salary costs had not been part of the decision.
About 168 workers are involved in cathode production at the Netherlands
plant at Sittard and the company said that forced redundancies could not be
ruled out.
Philips has been hard hit by a sharp downturn in consumer electronics which
pushed the group into a loss of more than Fl 150m (Pounds 57m) in its third
quarter. The knock-on effects have been felt strongly by the components
division.

FT  03 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Indignant EC springs to defence of its
directive - Community officials see utilities ruling as an important
market-opening initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTRARY to US claims that the European Community is bent on using the
obscure new 'utilities directive' to block US companies' access to
government contracts, EC officials see it as an important market-opening
initiative and one of the most important parts of the single market
programme.
This perhaps explains the outburst on Monday of Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's
most senior trade official, attacking as 'unilateral bullying' Washington's
threat to freeze out EC companies when awarding US federal contracts.
Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, Denmark's foreign minister and president of the EC
Council of ministers described the action as sending the 'wrong signal for
the world economy.'
The Clinton administration said on Monday that from March 22 it would block
EC companies from bidding for millions of dollars' worth of American
government contracts and, potentially more damaging, threatened to withdraw
from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's multinational government
procurement code.
The initial action is to be taken as retaliation for what the US says is EC
discrimination against US sales of telecommunications and power-generating
equipment to government utilities following the introduction of the
utilities directive on January 1 1993.
The idea of 'government procurement contracts' may be hazy to many, but they
are nevertheless immensely important.
Overall, Commission officials estimate that they represent some 15 per cent
of EC gross domestic product, of which 7 to 10 per cent - contracts worth
Ecu240bn-Ecu340bn (Pounds 194.88bn-Pounds 276.08bn) - could be opened to
competition by the new directive.
The present row centres on the specific area of contracts for equipment
supplied to telecommunications and electrical utilities in the EC.
The directive allows EC governments to reject tenders for supply contracts
where the non-EC content of the products supplied exceeds 50 per cent of
total value.
It says that in borderline cases preference should be given to tenders where
over half the products are made in the EC, even if the price is up to 3 per
cent higher than that of competing tenders.
The US believes this so-called 'reciprocity' clause is discriminatory. The
EC in turn has complaints about allegedly protectionist US procurement
legislation, including the Buy American Act, which the EC says imposes far
stricter price preference clauses on products of US origin.
In the utilities sector, US and EC central government spending is roughly
equal. US central authorities spend annually Ecu48bn on supplies, Ecu25bn on
services and Ecu7bn on works; the EC spends respectively Ecu40bn, Ecu30bn
and Ecu25bn. About half this could be contract expenditure.
In the trickier area of state expenditure the US figure is Ecu194bn and the
EC's Ecu145bn. Contracts in the telecommunications and electrical equipment
sectors are said to be worth about Ecu50bn annually in the US and roughly
the same amount in the EC.
What galls Sir Leon Brittan and his officials is that they believe the EC
directive will allow US suppliers to compete directly on the EC market and
gain a chunk of that Ecu50bn total.
That is a view shared by the French government, which tried unsuccessfully
to postpone the implementation of the utilities directive before Christmas.
The attempt was made on the grounds that it would put EC suppliers at a
disadvantage compared with their US counterparts.
Brussels officials claim that the public procurement directives are already
having an effect on the sheltered market.
In spite of the fact that not all EC countries have put the utilities
legislation into their national law, about 250 equipment contracts were
advertised for tender in the EC's Official Journal in January.
'We are getting advertisements from every member state in the Community,
major and minor utilities,' one official said yesterday.
About 40 of those notices stated a contract value making a total of some
Ecu500m. That is probably far short of the overall value of advertised
contracts, but still equals the annual value of trade in the whole EC public
procurement sector before legislation was introduced.
In EC-US negotiations at the beginning of January the community offered to
drop temporarily the offending 3 per cent clause on telecoms and electricals
equipment, in exchange for suspension of the Buy American Act at five
federal-controlled power utilities, representing some 25 per cent of the
market.
EC negotiators also pressed for a wider deal covering procurement supplies,
works and services. 'The idea was to meet the American problem on
electricals and telecoms, at least partially, and to give a kick-start to
(multilateral Gatt) negotiations on public procurement,' one EC official
said.
That deal was rejected, and even though the US presidency has changed since
the January negotiations, Commission negotiators say it is unlikely to be
given a new lease of life by the Clinton administration.
Sir Leon has nevertheless urged the US to show restraint, and hopes to
discuss the issue with Mr Mickey Kantor in Washington during his first
formal meeting with his US counterpart, on February 11.

EC FOREIGN and trade ministers failed yesterday to agree a compromise on
lifting or harmonising national import restrictions, adding to confusion
about the treatment of non-EC goods in the single European market.
Britain, Germany and the Netherlands may be breaking EC law by unilaterally
trying to find ways round the problem, according to Community officials. A
spokesman for Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, warned yesterday that
unilateral action to extend or abolish quotas risked 'undermining a unified
(EC) trade policy'.
The question of what to do about outstanding national quotas is linked to
controversial European Commission proposals to streamline the procedure for
imposing anti-dumping duties on non-EC imports. Liberal northern member
states like Britain, Germany and the Netherlands object to the Brussels
plan; they believe it would give the Commission greater power to impose
duties.
Yesterday, they attacked Sir Leon's compromise, which would have allowed a
simple majority of member states to reject proposed duties. Sir Leon
rejected claims that the Commission was trying to grab more power for
itself, and said Brussels was trying to speed and improve the procedure for
imposing duties and trade safeguard weapons.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, UK trade minister, said after the meeting: 'If the
Commission lays before the council a strong and well-argued case for an
anti-dumping or safeguard measure, they will get support.'
Failure to agree how to use such weapons means a legal void still exists on
the question of national quotas, still in place in many EC countries despite
the lifting of internal EC border controls on January 1. Goods covered
include textiles and footwear from 'state trading countries' like China and
North Korea.
In the worst case, that could mean an import ban or reimposition of internal
controls to try to stop cheap imports coming across internal borders.
In principle, member states wanting to take temporary measures to fill the
legal void have to apply to the Commission for permission to extend or
abolish quotas. Germany, which has gone for full liberalisation, and Britain
and the Netherlands, which want to extend their licensing regimes, have not
yet asked for permission, according to EC officials.
Foreign and trade ministers may get another chance to discuss the issue next
month. Meanwhile, it will be debated again by national officials.

FT  03 FEB 93 / World Trade News: US tough on public contracts - Washington
determined to create 'level playing field'
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
YEARS AFTER 'level playing field' became a cliche in Washington trade
circles, the US now has an administration which says it is determined to
create one.
In the second potentially explosive trade issue tackled by the Clinton
administration in as many weeks, hard on the heels of dumping duties
provisionally levied on steel exports, the fledgling Clinton team took only
11 days in office to announce sanctions against 'certain discriminatory
procurement practices' maintained by the EC.
'We do not want to close our procurement market, but must insist our major
trading partners show an equivalent commitment to open and
non-discriminatory procurement policies,' Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, said.
During the election campaign, President Clinton, who has been forced to
backtrack on various promises, said he would open markets and enforce US
trade laws. He seems intent on keeping to these commitments. Mr Kantor, who
was the president's campaign chairman, shares them. Fresh in his mind is the
anger of US voters facing uncertain economic conditions and joblessness.
'The days when we could afford to subordinate our economic interests to
foreign policy or defence concerns are long past,' Mr Kantor told the Senate
finance committee. 'As President Clinton has noted time and again, our
national security is directly related to our economic viability here at
home. We will not be guided by the assumption that other nations share our
commitment to free trade and open markets when the real-world evidence is
otherwise.'
The government procurement dispute with the EC dates back to 1990 when the
Community first announced its utilities directive, planned to come into
force in January.
Under US trade law the administration must thoroughly review global
procurement practices every year. In February 1992 the administration
determined that the EC discriminated against the US in its utilities
directive. President Bush said he would institute sanctions against the EC
to take effect by January 1993, subject to EC implementation of the
utilities directive.
The Clinton administration was not forced to act immediately. US law gives
the president the authority to modify or suspend sanctions if in the
national interest. Mrs Carla Hills, former US trade representative, usually
took full advantage of the law's flexibility in the hope of reaching
settlement. But Mr Kantor apparently decided more talking would not produce
agreement.
US officials recognise that the directive has many 'aspects' which improve
US market access, but consider it unacceptable that restrictions remain.
Clinton officials, who overwhelmingly approved the action, believe the US
was already late in moving and was even ill-prepared to do so.
The US trade representative had no sanctions list prepared nor even an
accurate estimate of the costs of the retaliation. The retaliation will only
hit products not covered by Gatt's procurement code: telecommunications,
airports, waterways and services. Mr Kantor has ordered a study of 'the
desirability and feasibility of withdrawing from the Gatt government
procurement code,' letting the US broaden sanctions against the EC with the
cost as high as Dollars 500m.
US foreign procurement curbs fall on some sectors, mostly defence but also
mass transit, affecting the EC. US states also have Buy American provisions.
The US has been willing to negotiate on these and governors of over half the
states agreed to scrap their curbs and join the Gatt code.
'(The EC) wanted to have some procedural guarantees applied to private
telecommunications companies,' a US official said. 'We might feel more
sympathetic if they had come up with examples of discrimination.' Mr Steve
Cooney of the National Association of Manufacturers said the sanctions were
no 'protectionist break from the past'. The White House was committed to
increasing exports; it knew better than to count on the home market alone
for job growth.

The government procurement dispute with the EC dates back to 1990 when the

EC procuring utilities could exclude bids with less than 50 per cent EC
content; acceptable bids with a majority of EC content must receive a 3 per
cent price preference over non-EC bids.

the Gatt government procurement code, and to deal with any 'legitimate
market access problems' EC companies might have with private utility
bidding.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has rescinded two Bush administration directives
which the trade union movement considered unfair.
The first prohibited companies which entered into project agreements with
unions from competing for federal contracts. It was issued by President
George Bush just before last November's election in return for the backing
of the trade association representing non-union building companies.
The second, issued earlier last year, required the posting of notices on all
federal projects advising workers of their rights not to pay union dues
according to the terms of a 1988 Supreme Court ruling.
Mr Clinton's actions are reminiscent of those taken on the first Friday of
his presidency when he lifted several Bush and Reagan orders limiting access
to abortion.
Mr Clinton said he had acted 'to restore a needed balance in America's
workplace' and to reduce 'unnecessary federal government intrusion'. He said
that project agreements with unions allowed more reliable cost estimates and
promoted safety in the workplace.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Less a honeymoon, more a new affair: The altered
relationship between media and president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS still not quite clear who first claimed in print or on the air that
President Bill Clinton's national honeymoon was over and his presidency
damaged beyond repair. It probably happened before he even took office. It
certainly has been the substance of many column inches and words since.
Yet, suddenly, in the past 72 hours, the great American media have begun to
have second thoughts.
Not to the point of redeifying Mr Clinton, let alone his wife, but of
wondering, even in a week when Dallas crushed Buffalo in the football Super
Bowl, whether every political issue has to have an irrevocable winner and
loser.
In a remarkable exercise in media self-criticism, Jonathan Alter, the
Newsweek magazine columnist, offered an exquisite and entirely accurate
summary of the overall thrust of the reporting of what, in his view, is now
a 'manic depressive' journalistic culture.
'He was a hero on election day, a goat during his early disorganised
transition, a hero at the Little Rock economic conference, a goat during the
week before taking office, a hero at the inauguration, a goat during the
fights over Zoe Baird and gays in the military. In each case there may have
been sound reasons to reach those judgments but little acknowledgment of
their evanescence.'
RW Apple, the veteran Washington bureau chief of the New York Times, a man
not disposed to instant judgments unless on food and wine, suspects that it
is more an awakened public than the media which is ringing the changes.
'A host of factors, including weakened political parties, wider coverage of
governmental activities on cable television, the proliferation of pressure
groups, the advent of radio and television call-in shows and a popular mood
of scepticism and discontent reflected in the candidacy of Ross Perot, have
repeat-edly combined to prove the capital's conventional wisdom unwise.'
Some are totally disdainful both of their own profession and the tendency
towards participatory democracy. George Will, the conservative pundit who
would have been at home in Plato's Republic, allows his lips to curl on
television when he talks of the US as 'a plebiscatory' in which there will
soon be no point in sending members to Congress.
It is undeniable that Mr Clinton and the media are experiencing a rocky
early relationship. Generalised factors include a media perception that he
was given too easy a ride in the election (the president would disagree),
that he is de facto green because he is actually younger than many of the
media doyens, and the suspicion - not without foundation - that he does not
like the press (few politicians do these days).
Relations with the White House press corps are particularly fractious. This
is normal, because the job of White House correspondent, with long hours,
minimal freedom of movement and dependence on photo opportunities and
whatever information is doled out, is nothing like as glamorous as it
sounds.
The main consolation is guaranteed air time and the front page, with
inevitable emphasis on well turned soundbites and snappy judgments.
George Stephanopoulos, the principal spokesman, has not always been
sensitive to this bear garden in the first two weeks. Operating erratically
on Clinton Standard Time, restricting access to some offices and
occasionally being a little too smart for his own good, he has invited
criticism not just of himself but of his president.
But Mr Apple's broader point about new pressure points may be more important
in the longer run. Last year's election campaign demonstrated that the
established media had lost its monopoly of the dissemination of political
information and analysis, as candidates by the dozen took to the talk and
call-in shows (many featuring, it might be said, establishment journalists
like Mr Will).
The first sign that Ms Baird's employment of illegal immigrants might
jeopardise her nomination to be attorney general surfaced on the talk shows
around the country.
In Washington, where the Clinton transition was partly operating, it
appeared a minor matter and the Senate judiciary committee gave her an
initial warm welcome. When mounting public criticism reached even the
capital's radio stations, she was gone.
But the new genre has a short attention span and Ms Baird now seems but an
historical footnote.
The latest focus has been on homosexuals in the military, and this time the
evidence was of orchestration by well-organised pressure groups, mostly on
the religious right. Some popular talk show hosts, like Rush Limbaugh, a
ferocious conservative, needed no stoking.
There is nothing new in this - ever since the Pony Express, congressmen and
presidents have been intermittently deluged with mail from distant quarters.
But there may be a new unwillingness on the part of elected representatives,
Mr Clinton included, to disregard the voices of the people in the Perotian
age.
Not that all are uninformed. The audiences that CNN and C-Span, the cable
channels, command may look small in the ratings but they seem to pull
weight. C-Span is turning out to be something of a national phenomenon.
Still mostly set up to air, without adornment, debates in Congress, it has
expanded into viewer call-ins and the sort of serious discussion programmes
and seminars on government affairs that was thought would only appeal to
political groupies.
There are more of these aficionados than might be expected. Your
correspondent's one appearance on C-Span, not exactly a knockabout
pre-recorded discussion on foreign affairs, resulted in more calls from
around the country than anything written for the FT in the past 26 years.
It would probably, therefore, be as misleading to rush into premature
judgment on the new media as the media is to rush into premature judgment on
the new president.
As Republican Senator Robert Dole said this week: 'It's a long road and he's
only had a bumpy beginning.' Or, as Jonathan Alter observed: 'What goes down
must come up. And down and up and down and up until we're all dizzy.'

FT  03 FEB 93 / US pit strike may hit other coal producers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 7,000 miners working for Peabody Coal, the largest coal producer
in the US and a subsidiary of UK-based conglomerate Hanson, went on strike
yesterday in a dispute over job security and union representation that could
soon spread to other big US coal producers.
The United Mine Workers union said it was ordering its members at Peabody,
who make up the bulk of the company's workforce, not to report for work
after negotiations over a new national wage agreement broke down. The old
agreement, negotiated in 1988, expired just before midnight on Monday.
The dispute is over a refusal by the employers' body, the Bituminous Coal
Operators Association, to issue a guarantee in the new wage agreement that
its members will employ union workers at their new mines. Without such a
guarantee, the union will not negotiate a new national contract, which
covers 42,000 of the country's 103,000 mine workers.
Mr Thomas Hoffman, a BCOA spokesman, said yesterday: 'Employees should have
the right to decide themselves whether they want to be represented by a
union or not.'
The UMW is seeking a guarantee for its members because in recent years
employers have been increasingly using non-union labour at their new mines,
a practice which has steadily reduced the UMW's representation among mine
workers. In the 1970s, the UMW represented more than 50 per cent of all mine
workers. Today, the union represents only 35 per cent.
There was no indication from the union yesterday whether it would extend the
action to other producers. However, Mr Richard Trumka, president of the UMW,
said on Monday: 'If, when and how this strike expands depends entirely on
whether the BCOA companies are prepared to bargain.'
If the UMW does extend the strike, it could seriously affect production at
other big producers. Companies with operations in the Mid-West, where the
UMW is heavily represented among miners, would be particularly vulnerable.
An extended nationwide strike, however, would not immediately affect
coal-users or consumers. Mr Ron McMahan of Resource Data International, a
Colorado-based consultancy, estimates that the country's leading electric
utilities have stockpiles of coal that would last about 60 days.
Peabody, however, is likely to be hit immediately by the strike. The company
employs UMW workers at all but one of its 71 mining operations, and the
strike will affect about 58 per cent of the company's annual coal output of
almost 90m tons. The rest of Peabody's production, all of it concentrated in
the western US, would not be affected because these operations have a
separate contract with unions.
Peabody's parent, Hanson, would also suffer from a prolonged strike. In 1991
it made a profit of Dollars 263.5m on sales of about Dollars 1.7bn, making
it the second largest contributor, after tobacco, to Hanson's total
earnings.
Industry analysts were not surprised that UMW chose Peabody, saying that the
company was probably singled out because it is foreign-owned. The union is
likely to have judged that industrial action would have had much greater
impact if it struck first at a non-US-owned company.
This latest miners' strike - the first since the violence-plagued stoppage
against the Pittston Coal in 1989 - comes at a time when the coal industry
is producing more coal each year with fewer miners.
Just after the second world war, the US coal industry employed 320,000
miners who produced about 480m tons of coal a year. By 1979 employment had
fallen to 220,000 but production had jumped 781m tons, and by last year,
103,000 miners were producing more than 1bn tons of coal.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Clinton promises welfare task-force
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday promised to name a task-force within the
next 10 days to reform the US social safety net of welfare programmes.
He told the National Governors' Association that he was committed to 'ending
welfare as we know it' with measures to finance expanded job training for
the unemployed, matched by a requirement that people must do some kind of
work for their welfare cheque.
The president said he would focus on better implementation of the Family
Support Act, a 1988 welfare reform based on the work of an NGA task-force
which he, as governor of Arkansas, co-chaired.
'The bill that is on the books will work, given the right economy and the
right support systems,' Mr Clinton said.
Advocates of welfare reform had been discouraged about the new
administration's intentions, fearing that the centrist Democratic emphasis
on requiring welfare recipients to work or enroll for training might fall
prey to left-wing advocacy groups concentrating on greater funding of
existing programmes.
These suspicions were enhanced when Ms Donna Shalala, new secretary of
health and human services, last month devoted only one sentence to welfare
reform in a five-page statement of goals.
With the onset of the recession, state revenues have been constrained while
the number of welfare recipients has grown by 30 per cent. As a result, few
states have been able to implement in full the act's requirement that
welfare recipients take part in some form of education or training.
Mr Clinton promised yesterday his reforms would be based on the principle
that 'welfare should be a second chance, not a way of life'. There must be
'a certain time beyond which people don't draw a cheque for doing nothing,'
he said. But at the same time people must be helped out of the welfare trap
by providing them with continued health coverage, child care, and expanded
earned income tax credits when they took jobs.
Many states have already embarked on far-reaching welfare reform programmes,
such as Michigan's 21-point plan to strengthen families or New Jersey's
family development programme. Mr Clinton said he would let states experiment
with such programmes, even when he disagreed with them.

FT  03 FEB 93 / US leading indicators rise sharply: Administration officials
hint at Dollars 31bn economic stimulus
</HEADLINE>

THE BIGGEST increase in the US index of leading indicators in nearly a
decade and a sharp rise in new home sales yesterday provided further
evidence of an accelerating economic recovery.
The figures were released as officials hinted that the Clinton
administration may be planning a short-term economic stimulus of about
Dollars 31bn (Pounds 20.5bn), rather than the Dollars 15bn-Dollars 20bn
mentioned by aides last week.
The Commerce Department said the leading index rose 1.9 per cent in
December, the largest increase since December 1983.
Separate figures showed a 6.3 per cent increase in new home sales in
December and a large upward revision for figures for November. New home
sales rose 19.4 per cent in 1992 as a whole - the largest annual increase
for nearly a decade.
A White House spokeswoman said President Bill Clinton was encouraged by the
improved tone of recent economic statistics but remained very concerned
about the lack of job growth. 'We've got to find a way to put people back to
work,' Mr Clinton said on Monday night.
The Dollars 31bn stimulus package under consideration would include an
immediate increase of about Dollars 15bn in federal spending, to take effect
this fiscal year, with the remainder devoted to an investment tax credit. No
final decisions, however, have yet been made.
The administration is continuing to search for ways to cut the budget
deficit by Dollars 145bn by fiscal 1997. Some senior advisers fear that
mooted tax increases - such as a broad-based energy tax - would represent a
politically damaging repudiation of Mr Clinton's pledge to lower the tax
burden on middle-income families.
Mr Clinton will spell out his economic strategy in his State of the Union
address on February 17 and deliver a full budget on March 23.
Federal Reserve governors and regional presidents met in Washington
yesterday to chart a monetary strategy for 1993. The Fed has signalled it
will co-operate with the administration by holding short-term interest rates
at current levels for the forseeable future.
Target ranges for M2, the broad measure of money, may be lowered this year,
but this will be a technical adjustment, reflecting distortions in the
monetary data, rather than a deliberate tightening of policy.
The rise in the leading index was led by a surge in consumer confidence, a
drop in weekly claims for unemployment insurance and an increase in
corporate order books; only two of the 11 components of the index failed to
contribute to the overall increase - real monetary growth and commodity
prices.

LAW and Order Minister Hernus Kriel declared Johannesburg an emergency area
yesterday, giving police special search and arrest powers after the death of
two people in violent demonstrations by black taxi drivers, Reuter reports
from Johannesburg.
Mr Nelson Mandela's African National Congress condemned the declaration as
an attempt to obscure the real grievances of the taxi drivers.
Police shot dead one man and wounded at least three others when they opened
fire on a mob attacking a white motorist in central Johannesburg, police
said.
Witnesses said a second man died when police opened fire to clear a blockade
erected by the protesting taxi drivers.
The killings came as two days of violence accompanied the strike by taxi
drivers alleging harassment.

POLICE and protesting black taxi drivers clashed for a second straight day
yesterday, leaving three people injured and tempers high in parts of central
Johannesburg, AP reports from Johannesburg.
The drivers were angry that some people held in Monday's confrontation
remained in custody, despite an agreement with city officials that called
for their release.
Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel said he would declare Johannesburg an
unrest area, giving police wide powers to arrest people and disperse crowds.
Protesting taxi drivers were complaining that traffic police harass them and
that they want subsidies similar to those given the Public Utility Transport
Corp. bus company. Taxi drivers are notorious for dangerous driving and are
often involved in accidents.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Patten faces surgery as HK reforms loom

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG Governor Chris Patten has been taken into hospital for minor heart
surgery just weeks before his controversial political proposals are due to
pass before the colony's legislature.
Hong Kong stock prices climbed on the news in London yesterday, as brokers
speculated on the exceptionally remote possibility that the illness could
prepare the way for Mr Patten stepping down from a reform programme that has
attracted the ire of China and damaged investors' confidence.
Mr Patten is to undergo angioplasty (the full term is 'percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty') treatment, after doctors identified a
narrowing of two coronary arteries.
A government spokesman suggested he would remain in hospital for four days
and was expected to be back at work within a fortnight.
Mr Patten chaired a meeting of the Executive Council (LegCo) - the
governor's cabinet - during the morning, and the full reform package is
still on track, to be presented to the legislature before the end of
February. It is unlikely that his hospitalisation will delay this process.
But the timing is awkward, as it coincides with a stepping-up of China's
opposition to Mr Patten's plans to broaden democratic representation in the
Legislative Council, following a brief lull in the verbal conflict.
On Monday evening, China's most senior representative in Hong Kong, Mr Zhou
Nan, reiterated China's stance that it would not 'barter on principles'.
He also claimed that the British proposals were a serious stumbling block to
Hong Kong's stable transition back to China in 1997.
This was seen as a warning directed at executive councillors, and observers
expect the criticism to intensify in the lead-up to the LegCo debate on the
proposals.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Pretoria unveils bill of rights: Death penalty would be
reimposed for some crimes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SOUTH African government yesterday published proposals for a bill of
rights which would outlaw race and sex discrimination and protect private
property, but which would impose the death penalty for certain serious
crimes and permit detention without trial.
The proposal forms an essential part of Pretoria's blueprint for a
constitution which prevents blacks from dominating whites. However, it will
not become law without the agreement of the African National Congress and
other parties to constitutional negotiations.
The draft bill of rights seems specifically designed to outlaw the gross
human rights abuses committed by the ruling National party during its 44
years in power, including torture, murder, discrimination by race and
infringements of basic freedoms of speech, movement and association.
Asked whether the proposals did not represent a 'deathbed conversion' to
human rights protection, Justice Minister Kobie Coetzee admitted the current
constitution permitted abuses against fundamental rights, and that abuse had
taken place.
Pretoria's proposal is likely to provoke wide controversy, as it would
reimpose the death penalty (suspended since 1990) for certain crimes, would
permit 10-day detention without trial, and includes only limited provisions
to protect individuals from race discrimination while providing far more
protections against sex discrimination.
It makes no move to redress any of the economic wrongs of apartheid,
including forced expropriation of land from blacks, but outlaws
expropriation by any future government. Measures included in the bill to
protect private property rights will attract widespread criticism, as they
are designed to protect whites.
The ANC is likely to oppose the proposal on the grounds that economic
rights, such as the right to employment, housing, health care and education,
are not guaranteed. The ANC's own draft bill of rights includes such
guarantees, but the National party argues that they cannot be enforced
against a government which lacks the resources to finance huge social
investment.
Government officials say the publication of their draft bill of rights
demonstrates Pretoria's desire to move rapidly away from apartheid
discrimination. Other recent moves have also been announced, including a
decision to remove the racial bias in per capita education spending.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Downturn pushes Japan's unemployment to 2.4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S unemployment rate rose to 2.4 per cent in December as the downturn
in the economy began to take its toll upon the jobs market.
Most Tokyo economists expect the official unemployment rate will rise in the
course of the year to nearly 3 per cent, the peak it reached during the
downturn of the mid-1980s.
The main cause of the rise from 2.3 per cent in November is the virtual
evaporation of private sector job offers, in both manufacturing and
services, as companies freeze recruitment to cut costs.
The ratio of job offers to job applicants stayed at 0.93 in December, the
same rate as November, which means there are 93 job offers for every 100
applicants.
This ratio's stability was mainly due to a surge of job offers from the
construction sector fuelled by expanded public works programmes.
Government ministers and business leaders used the weak unemployment data to
renew their calls for an early cut in interest rates.
The official unemployment rate is an underestimate of the extent of
unemployment in Japan. Job losses among self-employed and mainly women
part-time workers who do not register for unemployment benefit have already
risen sharply.
Japan's lifetime employment system means that thousands of workers are being
kept on company payrolls even though they have no work to do. Some financial
analysts estimate this so called in-company unemployment amounts to about 6
per cent of the industrial workforce.
The rise in unemployment is one of the main factors depressing consumer
confidence, which fell by 3.2 per cent to 38.2 per cent in the final quarter
of last year according to the official index published yesterday by the
Economic Planning Agency.
Consumer sentiment about the employment outlook fell 8.6 per cent to 27 per
cent in the last quarter of the year, fuelling growing pessimism among
consumers about the outlook for their standard of living.
As private investment is deeply depressed a revival in personal consumption
is seen as essential to reigniting economic growth. Business confidence
remains depressed, but not as depressed as the end of last year, according
to a separate report by the EPA. Its index of business sentiment for the
first three months of this year stood at minus 24, compared with minus 32 in
the final quarter of last year.

The bulk of the investments were in the chemical, electronic components and

FT  03 FEB 93 / Scramble to preserve US link: Expulsions shake special
relationship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPEED and relief with which Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of
state, welcomed Israel's offer to take back 100 of the 415 Palestinians it
deported in December revealed far more about American-Israeli relations than
it did about the future of the Middle East peace process.
It had taken Mr Christopher several days and phone calls to persuade Mr
Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, to drop his insistence that the
decision on the deportees was final and irrevocable.
The Palestinians had said that they would not resume peace negotiations
unless the fate of the men was satisfactorily resolved, but it was not this
issue which appears to have been uppermost in Mr Christopher's mind.
His primary concern was that the new administration, which condemned the
expulsions, should not be forced into using its veto to block any move to
impose UN sanctions against Israel for refusing to implement Security
Council resolution 799.
Very quickly after Israel's statement on Monday night, Mr Christopher
asserted that not only was talk of sanctions now unnecessary, but that it
could undermine the whole peace process.
To this extent, a relieved Mr Christopher and a bruised Mr Rabin might
reflect on their success in sustaining the single most critical relationship
in the Middle East.
However, it cannot augur well for the peace process and will not have
quashed moves for sanctions against Israel.
The episode has already cost Mr Rabin domestic political capital needed for
the day when Middle East peace talks move on to issues which demand Israeli
concessions. After the partial U-turn, the Israeli leader may seek to
reinforce his hardline stance on security issues, while being even less
ready to compromise at the negotiating table.
There will also be less enthusiasm for compromise on the other side of the
table. Mr Rabin's decision to expel the Palestinians was aimed at crippling
Hamas, the radical Islamic organisation gaining ground in the occupied
territories at the expense of the Palestine Liberation Organisation.
Instead, Hamas has been given a substantial political boost. Deportees on
their hillside in southern Lebanon provide potent images of defiance. While
they remain, it is almost impossible for the more flexible PLO to ask its
negotiators to return to the negotiating table in Washington.
Mr Rabin's offer to let 100 men return does nothing to satisfy PLO demands
and may perversely be damaging Israel's own peace talks strategy.
In the past few months Israel's negotiators have increasingly come to sense
that it might just be possible to strike a deal with Syria over the Golan
Heights. Furthermore, any hint of real progress with Syria would provide a
big impetus for the Palestinians to become more pliant to avoid being left
behind.
Syria has been providing some encouragement for this belief with Mr Farouk
al-Sharaa, the foreign minister, stressing last month that Arab delegations
should not break off bilateral talks where they had most to gain. If they
wished to boycott anything, he argued, it should be the multilateral talks
which involved issues of greater benefit to Israel.
But Israel's negotiators concede that while the Palestinians stay away it
will be difficult for the Syrians, Jordanians and Lebanese to return.
At the very least, the framework for a solution to the plight of the
deportees had to be in place, and Mr Rabin's concessions on Monday do not
meet that requirement.
If anything, argue some Arab diplomats, the apparent US endorsement of Mr
Rabin's action has made the situation worse by damaging American credibility
as an honest broker.
This sense of frustration is heightened by the understanding that the three
Arab governments and the PLO have no alternative to the peace process.
The reasons that brought them to the Madrid conference are every bit as
valid today as they were 15 months ago. But with every new confrontation
hopes for negotiation are less easy to justify before a sceptical domestic
audience increasingly receptive to hardline and militantly Islamic voices.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, came under sharp attack from
the opposition Likud party yesterday for giving in to US pressure to
compromise over the controversial expulsion of 400 Palestinians to Lebanon,
while the deportees themselves and the Palestine Liberation Organisation
flatly rejected the offer for 100 to return home.
The deportees and the PLO dismissed Mr Rabin's compromise as a manoeuvre to
prevent unprecedented UN sanctions against Israel.
Mr Rabin's Labour-led government had enjoyed broad support from the
right-wing Likud for ordering the expulsions in December after a series of
killings of Israeli soldiers by Islamic fundamentalist militants. But this
evaporated following Monday night's reversal.
Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the former prime minister, said the government's
credibility had been undercut by its inability to withstand international
pressure. Israel's position in Middle East peace negotiations had been
weakened, he said.
Mr Binyamin Netanyahu, a leading candidate to succeed Mr Shamir as Likud
leader next month, said: 'I believe in retrospect it would have been better
not to deport at all.'
The 396 deportees, most of them alleged members of the Hamas Islamic
movement, voted unanimously in their snowbound Lebanese encampment to reject
Mr Rabin's proposal, which included reducing the terms of exile of those not
allowed to return immediately to no more than one year and the offer of food
and medical supplies.
Likewise, the PLO said at its headquarters in Tunis that it would continue
to press for sanctions against Israel to enforce UN resolution 799 calling
for the immediate return home of all those expelled.
Mr Rabin dismissed the Palestinian rejection of his offer as 'their
problem'. He would be happy for the deportees to stay put, saving him the
humiliation of having to organise their return. His chief concern in making
the compromise was to cement ties with the Clinton administration in
Washington.
Government officials expressed satisfaction that Mr Warren Christopher, the
secretary of state, quickly applauded the Israeli move. They were confident
the US would keep any debate of sanctions out of the UN Security Council.
However, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, was reported last
night as telling American Jewish leaders he did not believe Israel's offer
on the deportees complied with Security Council requirements.

THE CAMBODIAN government yesterday denied its latest military offensive was
aimed at capturing the Khmer Rouge headquarters near the Thai border, and
suggested UN troops be repositioned to act as a 'buffer' between government
forces and the guerrillas.
The government said a series of recent attacks on Khmer Rouge positions in
northern and western Cambodia were aimed at driving the guerrillas back to
the territory they held before all the country's main factions signed a
ceasefire and peace agreement in Paris in October 1991.
They were responding to accusations by UN peacekeepers on Monday they were
engaged in a big offensive which could not be justified on grounds of
self-defence.
'It's a purely defensive activity,' Mr Khieu Kanharith, senior adviser to
prime minister Hun Sen, said. 'Now the mission is complete. It's a great
success.'
Gen Pann Thay, military spokesman, said the offensive was aimed at
protecting villagers working on the rice harvest and at forcing back Khmer
Rouge artillery shelling government positions.
He said there was no plan to take the gem-mining town of Pailin, regarded as
the Khmer Rouge headquarters, but added: 'We finish right now, but if the
Khmer Rouge launch an offensive against us we have to attack them again.'
The UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) seems unlikely to accept
the idea of placing its 16,000 troops as a buffer between the country's
warring factions.

FT  03 FEB 93 / State keeps control of Bezeq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ISRAELI government decided yesterday to maintain control for an
unspecified period over Bezeq, the state-owned telecommunications monopoly,
preferring a gradual programme of liberalisation in the sector and limited
public share offerings to proposals for the early sale of a controlling
stake to a strategic investor.
Bezeq is one of the biggest of Israel's many state-owned companies and was
earmarked as a prime candidate for privatisation when the Labour-led
government took power last July promising to speed up the privatisation
process.
Critics said the decision showed the government's reluctance to embrace
radical privatisation, despite its promises.
The government has ruled out selling its control of Israel Chemicals and
made little progress on other companies such as the airline El Al.
But the cabinet sub-committee that controls privatisation, which includes
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Mr Avraham Shohat, the finance minister,
said competition in the economy would be enhanced by dismantling some of
Bezeq's monopoly before letting it move out of the government's hands. The
committee said it would move to allow private competition in cellular
telephones and international links.
The state would reduce its 75 per cent holding in Bezeq to 51 per cent
through share offerings on the Tel Aviv stock exchange. Exactly when it
would give up control was not specified.
Israel's two biggest conglomerates, Clal Industries and Koor Industries, had
expressed interest in buying control of Bezeq.

THE United Nations yesterday suspended road travel for its staff between

four of its staff members were killed on Monday in an ambush by unknown
gunmen.
The road provides the most important land link for transportation of relief
goods from Pakistan to the Afghan capital, Kabul.
Rival groups of mujahideen tribesmen have recently exchanged fire to gain
control of the road, western diplomats and officials say.
The bodies of two of the UN's international staff members were brought to
Islamabad yesterday to be flown to their home countries.

ISRAEL and the European Community have agreed to lift obstacles to direct EC
investment in the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza, Mr Shimon
Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, said yesterday.
Mr Peres said the EC was becoming a world leader in foreign and humanitarian
aid and the accord would allow the EC to invest in housing, hospitals and
businesses in the West Bank without dealing with the Israeli authorities.
Israeli-EC relations improved this week after the Rabin government unveiled
an initiative aimed at bringing back about 100 of the Palestinian deportees
stranded in no-man's land in Lebanon and shortening the terms of the 300
others.
Mr Peres said the compromise cleared the way for talks to update a 1975
bilateral trade accord with the EC, but EC officials were more cautious,
describing it as a 'very good step' only.
Israel wants to free the movement of capital and services with the EC and
upgrade technological co-operation.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN, BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY will ask the US to support a total isolation of Serbia as one of the
few remaining options aimed at stopping the war in the former Yugoslavia.
But it will not support a selective lifting of the arms embargo, even though
Washington appears to be shifting its policy towards arming the Bosnian
Moslem forces.
The request, which will be made when Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign
minister visits Mr Warren Christopher, his US counterpart, in Washington
tomorrow, reflects the growing frustration and fears within Germany that
Croatia and Serbia could be moving towards an all-out war.
Foreign ministry officials in Bonn yesterday said they have asked President
Tudjman of Croatia to stop his offensive into the demilitarised 'pink zones'
of the republic. These straddle United Nations protectorates set up last
year on Croatian territory seized by Serb forces.
'We want Tudjman to stop this offensive, even though we understand why he is
doing it, and to accept an extension of the UN mandate in the republic. If
not, then this could provoke the Yugoslav army into attacking Croatia. The
pressure must be kept up on Serbia, but pressure should be imposed on
Croatia as well,' a foreign ministry official said.
Despite pressure from public opinion, both in the US and Germany, Mr Kinkel
does not support arming the Bosnian Moslems. 'We would not go it alone in
lifting the arms embargo,' an official said, adding that it would be
difficult to see how more arms in the region would stop the war from
spreading.
Germany also recognises that the US will not commit ground troops as a means
of lifting the siege off the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, impose a no-fly
zone, which is 'fairly irrelevant by this stage', or back selected air
strikes either in Bosnia, or Serbia.
In Belgrade General Satish Nambiar, the commander of UN forces in the former
Yugoslavia, yesterday said the renewed Serbo-Croat clashes had derailed the
peace plan in Croatia but dismissed fears of a pull-out by the 14,000-strong
peacekeeping force.
'We have gone back to square one. What we are engaged in now is damage
limitation. We are trying to assure that the conflict does not spread,' he
told reporters.
Gen Nambiar suggested that the peacekeeping forces should have their mandate
extended in order to deal with the situation on the ground.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARMENIA'S president yesterday replaced his prime minister with a young
economist who pioneered land privatisation in the former Soviet republic,
writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow.
President Levon Ter-Petrosian said he had sacked outgoing premier Mr Khosrov
Arutunian for a 'gross breach of etiquette' in criticising parts of his own
economic reform programme. His successor, Mr Grant Bagratian, previously
deputy prime minister, had quarrelled bitterly with Mr Arutunian, who wanted
the state to have greater control over economic reforms.
The change of government comes as Armenia is reduced to begging for
electricity from its neighbours, including Turkey, its historical enemy. The
landlocked republic, starved of natural resources and at war with
Azerbaijan, fears energy shortages could lead to a breakdown of law and
order.
Its last source of fuel - a pipeline from war-torn Georgia - was blown up
last week. Its nuclear power station has been closed since a 1988
earthquake.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Serbs feel the pinch from UN sanctions: Milosevic may turn
the embargo to his advantage, but the economy is crumbling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SERBIAN barges may be running illicit cargoes of oil up the Danube under the
eyes of United Nations monitors, but nevertheless eight months of sanctions
and the oil embargo, in particular, have hit hard.
The latest casualties of sanctions were two McDonald's hamburger restaurants
in Belgrade, which this week closed down after their supplies of foreign
toppings were depleted.
Yugoslav media meanwhile, has mourned the loss of the Disney cartoon figures
Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, after Disney Publications severed a contract
it has had for nearly 60 years with Yugoslavia.
Rising inflation and a sharp decline in the availability of goods also
reflect the debilitating impact of sanctions on the Serbian economy, already
reeling from 18 months of war and the collapse of trade with the former
Yugoslav republics.
Prices rose 100 per cent in December, while industrial production was down
22 per cent on a year ago. More than 800,000 workers have been sent on
compulsory holidays as state enterprises have cut production. Some 70 per
cent of Serbia's 9.8m inhabitants are earning less than Dollars 370 a year,
estimates economist Mr Tomislav Popovic.
The value of the Yugoslav dinar continues to plummet as the government
printing presses work overtime. On the bustling black market, hard currency
is sold at eight times the official rate. In a move which could indicate the
virtual abandonment of the dinar, JUMCO, a major textile manufacturer in
southern Serbia, this week announced that all prices would be denominated in
dollars, payable in dinars at the black market rate.
Last November the UN tightened the sanctions originally imposed last May on
Serbia and Montenegro for supporting Serb forces in the Bosnian war.
But diplomats believe Serbia, under President Slobodan Milosevic, has not
been compelled to cut off oil supplies to industry or the Yugoslav army.
Instead, it has extended winter holidays for schools and universities due to
the shortage of heating oil.
Although oil is undoubtedly in short supply, analysts point out that Serbia
produces 25 per cent of the oil it needs.
'There is absolutely no reason to believe the army doesn't have topped-up
fuel tanks. They do have problems, some of which are logistical, of getting
fuel to places,' says one western diplomat. 'But Serbia has not yet made the
tough choices which would hit industry or transport.'
Sanctions have, however, provided Serbian President Milosevic with an alibi
for Serbia's economic decline. Backed by his control of state television, Mr
Milosevic has vowed that the west will never succeed in bringing Serbia to
its knees.
'In terms of the economy, the sanctions are doing a better job than before.
But on the political front, they are having a counter-effect,' said a
western diplomat in Belgrade.
Belgrade economists and diplomats fear that Mr Milosevic so far has
capitalised on the decline in the standard of living, and has used the
sanctions to his advantage. 'They have provided the government with an
excuse to impose wage and price controls and destroy the market economy,'
believes Mr Popovic.
'The embargo has radicalised the population, by feeding the propaganda about
international conspiracies against the Serbian people,' he adds.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Russians at loss on bankruptcy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN legislators and officials said yesterday there would be problems in
implementing a long-awaited bankruptcy law, due to go into effect on March
1, because of gaps in related regulations and a shortage of qualified staff,
writes Leyla Boulton.
Mr Alexei Manannikov, a member of the parliament's economic reform
committee, said for instance the government's postponement of a decision on
indexing enterprises' fixed capital to keep up with inflation would leave
the door open to fraudulent bankruptcies. Although arbitration court judges
were being trained to handle bankruptcy procedures, an economics ministry
official said a lack of qualified staff remained another serious problem.
Mr Manannikov said he believed that galloping inflation would discourage
creditors, who may have to wait up to two and half years for the completion
of bankruptcy proceedings, from retrieving money owed to them, except if the
debts were denominated in hard currency.

NEGOTIATIONS to admit the EC's first new members since 1986 began in earnest
yesterday at separate meetings between the EC president Denmark and
ambassadors from Austria, Finland and Sweden, Reuters reports from Brussels.
Diplomats said the talks had gone well and the applicants had agreed to an
EC plan to start talks in the first instance in eight areas.
Those areas are the free movement of services, workers, and capital,
external relations, social policy, agriculture and forestry, customs union
and regional policy. They also agreed to seek additional areas where the
applicants' opening speeches on Monday had demonstrated talks could proceed
swiftly. The diplomats said a date was not set for the next set of meetings.
The EC and the applicants hope talks can be wrapped up in a year, allowing
the three, who could be joined soon by Norway, to enter the EC fold on
January 1, 1995.
Talks are expected to focus on the applicants requests' for special
arrangements for their farming sectors and on the implications of the three
countries' policy of neutrality for the EC's plans to forge a foreign and
security policy.
All three countries offered assurances on Monday that they would abide by
the EC's plans laid down in the Maastricht treaty.
Support among Finns for their country's application to join the EC has
fallen in recent months, according to an opinion poll yesterday, Reuter
reports from Helsinki.
The latest results showed 43 per cent in favour, down from 54 per cent.

<TEXT>
TURKEY is to speed up its privatisation programme with an ambitious target
to raise revenues to TL25,000bn (Pounds 1.86bn) in 1993, more than five
times the sum realised in 1992, writes John Murray Brown in Istanbul.
Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel's ambitious sales target was unveiled
together with a radical shake-up of the agency handling the sale of state
assets to the public. The government is relying on the privatisation
programme to close the public sector deficit, which in 1992 was 12 per cent
of GNP.
In 1992 Turkey's Public Participation Administration earned TL4,300bn
through the sale of six cement companies and minority stakes in a number of
smaller, privately managed enterprises.
However, it has not addressed the problem of the main loss-making state
corporations, which are unlikely to receive such a positive response from
buyers.

Italy's balance of payments deficit quadrupled in 1992 despite an
improvement in the final quarter following the September float of the lira,
writes Robert Graham.
The 1992 payments deficit was L32,549bn (Pounds 14.5bn) compared with
L8,571bn in 1991. The deterioration, reflecting an overvalued lira, is even
more marked when measured against the 1990 surplus of L15,156bn.
The worst month was September when the monthly deficit reached L29,000bn
after the massive lira support operation. But from October Italy began to
record a surplus again.

FT  03 FEB 93 / French plea for German rates cut
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, yesterday called on Germany
to reduce interest rates as soon as possible.
He also sought to damp down speculation about further increases in French
base rates.
He urged Germany to 'shoulder its responsibilities' by bringing its rates
down, thereby enabling other European economies to follow suit.
France's real interest rates, which are among the highest in Europe, are one
of the main factors affecting the French economy, and they threaten to be a
sensitive issue in the run-up to next month's legislative elections.
There is also considerable speculation about another rise in French base
rates.
Money market rates have risen since the Bank of France last month introduced
a new one-day lending facility of 14 per cent to protect the franc, but the
commercial banks have held base rates at 10 per cent.
This discrepancy has triggered a steep increase in the banks' borrowing
costs.
Societe Generale, one of the largest banks, estimates that it is losing
FFr1m (Pounds 125,000) a day and the whole banking system FFr10m a day.
The banks are lobbying the Bank of France to alleviate the impact of high
market rates by widening the range of collateral available to them, as it
did during the September currency crisis.
The French government seems to be gambling that it can prevent an
electorally embarrassing increase in base rates if it staves off pressure on
the franc for long enough to enable the Bank of France to signal a fall in
market rates.
Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, yesterday said there were already
signs of market rates starting to fall.

MR Giuliano Amato, the Italian prime minister, yesterday admitted his
six-month-old four-party coalition was defying political gravity.
Just like a cartoon character, the government would keep going as long as no
one realised it was riding on air.
He is managing to stay in office even though the government has ceased to
represent the specific interests of the Christian Democrats and Socialists,
the two main coalition partners. The two parties' credibility is daily
diminished by the mounting revelations of corruption and illegal party
financing over the past decade.
Mr Amato, a Socialist, has been obliged to cut free from Mr Bettino Craxi,
his party leader. It has been a post-war political tradition in Italy for
party leaders to control prime ministers. The break with Mr Craxi,
formalised on Monday, was essential to prevent the government from being
directly involved in the Socialist leader's fight for political survival in
the face of allegations of corrupt behaviour and illicit funding of the
party.
The prime minister's divorce from Mr Craxi has been followed by three other
Socialist ministers, including Mr Claudio Martelli, the ambitious justice
minister.
Mr Amato is thus no longer the prime minister for the Socialist party but a
socialist chief executive of the administration. If Mr Craxi and his
dwindling band of followers so choose they can withdraw their parliamentary
support, thereby removing the coalition's narrow 16-seat majority in the
chamber of deputies.
In recent days Mr Craxi has posed this threat, especially in the light of a
motion of confidence tabled by the former communist Party of the Democratic
Left (PDS). However, on Monday night Mr Craxi was persuaded this would be
counter-productive, and could even hasten the break-up of the party he has
dominated for a decade.
As in every instance over the past six months when the Amato government has
appeared unstable, it has survived for two reasons: none of 16 parties in
parliament has suggested viable alternatives; and second the major parties
have neither the funds nor the public support to call fresh elections so
soon after last April's poll.
Added to this, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who has conducted his
presidency with skill and quiet authority, has thrown his weight behind the
Amato government.
The same considerations apply today as the government faces its first
no-confidence motion. Indeed, Mr Achille Occhetto, the PDS leader, who
tabled the motion, has admitted his main intention is not to bring down the
government; but to force Mr Amato to distance himself from Mr Craxi, make
firmer commitments to combat corruption and focus more on the increasingly
serious problem of unemployment.
The no-confidence debate, due to wind up tomorrow, will give Mr Amato a
platform to state his aims and indicate how long he expects to stay in
office. The timetable over the next two to three months is overshadowed by
parliament's need to agree electoral reforms or be overtaken by referendums
imposing such reforms. This key debate requires government stability - as
does the management of an economy in recession.
He would be reluctant to leave office before electoral reform was in place
and the parties had regained their composure. But for this to happen he will
have to expand the coalition. The no-confidence motion will provide an
opportunity for those parties who regard themselves as the 'opposition',
like the PDS, to spell out terms for joining an enlarged government.

SUPPORT among Finns for their country's application to join the European
Community has fallen in recent months, according to an opinion survey which
was published yesterday, Reuter reports from Helsinki.
The results, published a day after Finland opened negotiations to become an
EC member, showed 43 per cent of Finns in favour of membership in November,
down from 54 per cent in June.
Those opposed to membership increased to 37 per cent from 25 per cent in
June.
The Community launched official accession talks with Austria, Finland and
Sweden on Monday in Brussels.
The Finnish centre-right government hopes the country can become a member in
1995 after a referendum, probably in 1994.
Europeans debated yesterday whether the first live TV broadcast from a
European Community ministers' meeting marked the beginning of a new EC
openness, but most agreed it was a rather dull affair, Reuter reports from
Copenhagen.
Television in many countries carried parts of the meeting of EC foreign
ministers in Brussels on Monday.
Danish television said 2 per cent of Danes, about 100,000 viewers, watched a
two-hour live transmission before noon as well as a one-hour session in the
afternoon.
In Sweden, where anti-EC sentiment is rising, national television had live
coverage of Mr Ulf Dinkenspiel, the European affairs minister, listing his
country's expectations in Brussels at the start of EC entry talks.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Kohl sets deadline for solidarity pact: The chancellor is
playing the foreign travel card as he seeks to concentrate minds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl has finally set himself a deadline, of a sort, to tie
up the details of his much-vaunted solidarity pact to finance German
unification.
The day is February 17, and the reason is that on February 18 he leaves on a
two-week trip - already once postponed - to India, Japan and south-east
Asia.
The only question is whether the chancellor's travel plans will prove enough
of an incentive to concentrate the minds of coalition and opposition
leaders, trade unions, employers and the 16 federal states to agree on a
coherent package in time. As D-day approaches, the differences not only
between the negotiating partners, but within each camp, are multiplying.
That may allow the wily German chancellor more room for manoeuvre to do a
deal, which would set savings in west Germany against spending in the east,
and exchange increased investment for wage restraint. Equally, it threatens
to cause total confusion.
The solidarity pact is important for two reasons. First, it will begin to
find an answer to the ever-more intractable task of financing the flow of
western subsidies to east Germany, which are forecast at around DM150bn
(Pounds 62.5bn) or more a year for the next decade.
It may not quite fill the gap - estimated at around DM110bn in 1995 - but it
will make a start.
More immediately, if a solidarity pact can show that the public sector -
central government, the 16 Lander and local government - can seriously cut
its budget deficits, and that the trade unions can restrain their wage
demands, the mighty German Bundesbank will be much more likely to find the
necessary 'room for manoeuvre' to cut its interest rates.
Both government and trade unions urgently want those interest rates cut to
prevent the recession from deepening. And it just so happens that the
central bank has a council meeting on February 18.
The pact is supposed to operate on two parallel planes. On one level it
would exchange guarantees of increased investment in the east for wage
restraint: a deal between government, employers and unions.
The second level amounts to a deal between the central government and the 16
federal states, east and west, on how to step up spending in the east, and
share the burden in the west. Little is yet agreed.
For a start, Mr Kohl's own Christian Democrats (CDU) are divided about how
much money they can switch from west to east.
His eastern lieutenants - the premiers of four of the five Lander in east
Germany - are calling for a further DM8bn to be made available this year
alone, more than double what is on offer. From the western side, Mr Erwin
Teufel, the CDU prime minister of wealthy Baden-Wurttemberg, insists that
the bill is already too large to be borne without unacceptable cuts in
services. It would mean an annual transfer of DM6bn from his state, or twice
the state budget for hospitals, roads and houses. 'This is simply
inconceivable,' he said in a television interview yesterday.
The left wing of the party, led by Mr Norbert Blum, the labour minister, and
Ms Rita Sussmuth, president of the Bundestag, are worried that planned cuts
in social spending will hit the lower-paid too hard. They want new tax rises
soon to cushion the blow.
Mr Blum has floated the idea of rethinking the entire financing of
employment and retraining schemes in east Germany, to spread the burden more
fairly: to switch from financing through national insurance payments (borne
by only 70 per cent of the population) to a form of tax surcharge, borne by
all income tax payers, including the self-employed. Mr Kohl and Mr Waigel
say no tax rises before 1995. They would be 'poison for the economy'.
Mr Blum's ideas are, perhaps, conveniently close to thinking coming from the
opposition Social Democrats (SPD). Therein may lie the seeds of compromise.
The SPD is officially set against anything like the sort of spending cuts,
including a reduction in unemployment benefits, proposed.
Yet Mr Bjorn Engholm, the party leader, and Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, the
parliamentary leader, both seem keen to do a deal in the end.
As for the trade unions, one pillar of SPD party support, Mr Franz
Steinkuhler of the powerful IG Metall engineering union, has been a key
participant from the start.
Mr Steinkuhler believes that he has won important concessions from the
Chancellor to preserve the 'core areas' of east German industry. He doesn't
want to throw that away for nothing.
Few doubt that some sort of package will emerge. The only question now is
whether it will end up as a unilateral plan presented by the chancellor, or
a cross-party deal for which he can claim broad-based support. And in either
case, will it be enough to persuade the Bundesbank to move?

FT  03 FEB 93 / Frankfurt dissident targets Emu again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Reimut Jochimsen, a leading Bundesbank official, yesterday took further
aim at the Maastricht treaty by saying that Germany was being 'forced' into
economic and monetary union.
Confirming a reputation for outspokenness which has attracted criticism from
the Bonn government, Mr Jochimsen said Emu 'was more forced on the Germans
than that we wanted it'.
Speaking at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London, Mr
Jochimsen singled out the French government as the main force behind the
drive for a single currency. The quest for monetary union had been a
'recurrent' feature of French politics since 1973, he said. Mr Jochimsen,
president of the North Rhine-Westphalia central bank, said the present
franc-D-Mark exchange rate was in line with the fundamentals in the French
economy. But he called on Bonn's partners to 'depoliticise' exchange rate
changes in the European monetary system.
In a pointed reference to recent attacks on 'speculators' by Mr Michel
Sapin, the French finance minister, Mr Jochimsen called operators on
currency markets 'portfolio managers and investors'. He said he did not want
to use methods of the French revolution against them.
Mr Jochimsen, a heavyweight member of the Social Democratic party, has
earned the ire of both the Bonn government and Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank president, since he joined the Bundesbank council in 1990.
In August 1992 he caused controversy by stating, in remarks prepared for a
speech in Dusseldorf, that EMS members were shunning realignments for
'prestige' reasons.
Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary in the Bonn Finance Ministry, took Mr
Jochimsen to task this week for having criticised the government's recent
efforts to cut spending.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Daf collapse risks 12,650 jobs: Truckmaker sinks under Fl
3bn debt - Government accused of failing to intervene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday became embroiled in fresh controversy over failing
to save jobs in Britain, as Daf, the Dutch commercial vehicle maker and the
leading truckmaker in the UK, was forced to file in the Netherlands for
protection against its creditors.
Mr John Talbot of accountants Arthur Andersen was last night expected to be
announced as the administrative receiver for Leyland Daf, Daf's UK
subsidiary, the UK new truck market leader with a share of 25 per cent last
year. The financial collapse of one of the leading west European truck
makers was precipitated by the failure of Daf's banking consortium and the
Dutch government and Flemish regional authorities in Belgium to reach
agreement on emergency short-term funding.
Some of the banks - National Westminster, Barclays and Lloyds, together with
Generale de Banque of Belgium - had insisted on independent auditors
studying a long-term rescue package as a precondition for taking part in the
short-term financing. The Dutch and Flemish authorities had insisted on
immediate participation.
The company has run up losses of more than Fl 800m in the past three years.
Its total indebtedness is estimated at more than Fl 3bn (Pounds 1.1bn)
including more than Fl 2bn in the finance subsidiaries.
Production at the group's plants in the UK, the Netherlands and Belgium was
hit yesterday as many suppliers stopped delivering parts, as news spread of
the Daf parent company seeking protection in the Netherlands.
The collapse of Daf, which in 1987 took over the former British Leyland
truck and van operations, puts at risk about 12,650 jobs, mainly in the UK,
the Netherlands and Belgium. Leyland Daf said its 5,500-strong UK workforce
was expected to report in today, but it was uncertain whether either hourly
or salaried workers would be paid tomorrow as originally scheduled.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, was jeered by Labour MPs
in the Commons when he refused to intervene with public money to preserve
Leyland Daf jobs.
He was repeatedly taunted about his speech to last year's Conservative party
conference in which he envisaged intervening before breakfast, lunch and
dinner to help British industry.
Mr Heseltine maintained that the best means of preserving commercially
viable jobs was through the receiver and administrators and the management
of the company working together.
Pressed about assistance for long-term investment, he said a sum of Pounds
450m had been mentioned and the government had made it clear it could not
contemplate such a project. The maximum available under regional assistance
was some Pounds 18m.
The Department of Trade and Industry had not been asked to provide
short-term working finance and, in any case, would not have done so.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's shadow trade and industry secretary, condemned the
refusal to provide assistance and warned that the collapse of Leyland Daf
would inflict another bitter blow on Britain's shrinking industrial base. Mr
Cook said Daf had advised him that it had been the three British banks which
had wrecked the consortium's planned rescue deal.
Mr Heseltine said: 'My department has been absolutely satisfied with the
British banks, and the Bank of England has been fully engaged in the
dialogue that was necessary.'
The DTI had done all that was asked of it by the company, which had made no
specific request for financial aid of the kind referred to by MPs, he said.
A spokesman for ABN Amro, the biggest Dutch bank and leader of the
consortium, said the rescue deal had broken down over disagreements between
the banks and Dutch and Belgian authorities over short-term and long-term
financing.
Mr Koos Andriessen, Dutch economic affairs minister, said: 'We were faced
with the situation where the bridging finance was simply insufficient to
meet Daf's needs.'
Daf's court-appointed administrators in the Netherlands have carte blanche
to act as they see fit, which means that they can close down or negotiate
the sale of subsidiaries. The company in the meantime enjoys protection from
its creditors.

FT  03 FEB 93 / UK banks defend decision to withdraw support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE major UK banks, which between them were being asked to provide Pounds
4m in new short-term finance for Daf, yesterday defended their decision to
withdraw financial support for the truckmaker.
National Westminster, Lloyds and Barclays said that they were presented with
an unacceptable ultimatum on Monday afternoon by the Dutch government and
the Flemish regional authorities, which were also involved in attempts to
rescue Daf.
Their decision not to support the refinancing plan was justified, they said,
because they were being asked in effect to provide an open-ended commitment
to support Daf.
Their actions were defended by the Bank of England, which over the past week
kept in close contact with the banks.
The three banks are members of Daf's main banking syndicate, which consists
of 10 international banks, led by ABN Amro, the Dutch banking group. Daf has
drawn Pounds 300m from this syndicate, of which around Pounds 140m came from
ABN, Pounds 25m each from NatWest and Lloyds, plus Pounds 10m from Barclays.
Last week, the syndicate, including the UK banks, agreed to provide a short
term bridging loan to Daf of Fl 50m (Pounds 18.5m) so long as the Dutch
government and Flemish regional authorities also contributed Fl 50m each.
The UK banks said they could not, at that stage, give a commitment to
supporting Daf's medium-term rescue plan until this plan had been
scrutinised by a firm of outside reporting accountants.
This had first been made plain to ABN Amro last November, they said.
Two days ago, the Dutch government and Flemish regional authorities told the
banks that they were not prepared to wait for the result of another
accountant's investigation. They wanted the banks to give a firm commitment
immediately to both the bridging loan and the medium-term rescue plan.
Last month, Daf received reports on the medium-term plan's viability by two
firms it had been employing, AD Little, the management consultant, and
Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the accountants. Mr Cor Baan, chairman of the
Daf management board, said yesterday that a new accountant's study would
take at least 10 weeks.
As soon as the banks learned of the new condition, they informed Mr Pen Kent
and Mr Mike Smith, two Bank of England executives. The Bank of England then
told officials at the DTI.
'We were being asked to give a commitment to provide a very significant sum
(around Pounds 100m, most of it by swapping existing debt for equity) on top
of the bridging loan,' said a banker. 'And we had been given almost no
information on which to make a rational decision about whether to
participate.'
Two members of Daf's supervisory board, Sir Adrian Cadbury and Mr George
Simpson, said yesterday they felt that the Coopers and Little reports were
of a high quality. Neither could understand why the banks wanted a separate
report.

FT  03 FEB 93 / PM backs Lamont as Pounds hits new lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR staged an ostentatious display of support for Mr Norman Lamont
yesterday in an attempt to shore up the chancellor's authority in the run up
to the March 16 Budget.
But his defence of the chancellor failed to rally the pound, which slipped
to new lows on the foreign exchange markets.
Downing Street refused to be drawn on the speculation at Westminster that Mr
Lamont will be moved from the Treasury in a summer cabinet reshuffle. Senior
officials cited a long-standing policy of refusing to comment on how long
any individual would remain in a particular post.
That left most Tory MPs believing that Mr Lamont probably would be given
another department in June or July. The prime minister, however, may seek to
buttress further the chancellor's position in a keynote policy speech to
senior Tories tonight.
In a carefully planned performance which saw Mr Major and Mr Lamont
side-by-side in the House of Commons, the prime minister flatly rejected
Labour charges that speculation about Mr Lamont's future had fatally
undermined his credibility.
During angry exchanges with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, he said that
neither he nor Mr Lamont would be 'pushed around' by unfounded reports that
they were at odds. 'It may be that many people would like to find divisions
between him and I - but there are none.'
Listing Mr Lamont's achievements at the Treasury, Mr Major said he had cut
inflation to 2.5 per cent, introduced tax reforms, offered help to industry
and reduced interest rates. 'That's a record that he can be proud of and
that I fully support.'
Mr Smith said the confusion of recent days had demonstrated that 'we have a
chancellor with no credibility and a government with no economic policy'.
Mr Major's support for the chancellor had little effect on foreign exchange
markets. In late London trading, the pound slipped to Dollars 1.44 against
the dollar, a new low for this year, before closing nearly a cent down on
the day at Dollars 1.446. It eased further in late New York trading to
Dollars 1.4443.
Against the D-Mark, the pound slipped  1/2 a pfennig in London, closing at
DM2.375, and it eased to DM2.3714 in New York.
The sterling index, which is monitored by the chancellor as an overall guide
to the currency's strength, closed at an historic low of 77.1, down 0.3
percentage points on the day.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Fifth of passenger rail routes selected for sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PASSENGER services on nearly a fifth of Britain's railway network are likely
to be in private sector hands by the end of next year, the government
announced yesterday.
It also came up with a surprise package of grants and other incentives aimed
at encouraging freight traffic to switch from road to rail.
Grants will in some cases give private sector freight carriers a free ride
on the railway tracks if that is what it takes to persuade them to use rail
instead of roads.
The government also plans to raise maximum lorry weights from 38 tonnes to
44 tonnes for special vehicles which transfer their loads from road to rail
for the larger part of their journey.
The announcements came as Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, defended
the government's controversial rail privatisation plans in the second
reading of the railways bill, which last night received a government
majority of 33.
Mr MacGregor named seven parts of British Rail which will be split from the
network this year and managed autonomously by BR staff on an experimental
basis pending privatisation.
Ranging in size from the Isle of Wight railway to ScotRail, they also
comprise three InterCity routes, East Coast, Great Western and Gatwick
Express, and two Network SouthEast commuter services - the London, Tilbury &amp;
Southend line and the whole of the South West division between London
Waterloo and south-west England.
The government hopes that by preparing these routes for privatisation now,
they can be moved swiftly into private hands after the planned launch of the
privatisation process in April 1994.
Other parts of the passenger railway will take much longer, but Mr MacGregor
said the government's proposals for franchising out the operation of all
BR's passenger services would be mapped out shortly.
The proposals mean that the InterCity network looks likely to be split into
separate franchises. InterCity's management had hoped to bid for the
franchise to operate the network intact. The Department of Transport said it
had not reached any conclusions on the future of InterCity, and that it had
not ruled out the possibility that a single bidder could win more than one
franchise.
The proposals won praise from Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, who welcomed
measures to boost freight.

FT  03 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: US threat to drug stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCKS IN the international drug industry companies, particularly Glaxo and
Wellcome, suffered selling pressure in London ahead of a press conference to
be held today in Washington. The conference will highlight a report which
claims that pledges by drug companies to contain drug costs have gone
unfulfilled.
It will be hosted by Senator David Pryor, an established critic of the drugs
industry and a Democrat who is believed to have the ear of the president. It
is expected to add further weight to President Clinton's promise to review
the industry. Also, Salomon Brothers removed several US drug companies from
its buy list.
Glaxo dropped 23 to 655p on very heavy turnover of 9.8m shares. Wellcome
weakened by the same amount to 853p and SmithKline Beecham lost 15 at 482p
in the 'A's and 18 at 420p in the Units.
Gas placing
The placing by a leading UK securities house of a block of 5.9m British Gas
shares at 286p brought significant pressure on the shares, which closed a
net 7 1/2 off at 284p. The Seaq ticker revealed that the share block had
been purchased at 285p before being sold on.
Turnover in Gas reached 14m shares, the highest single day's business in the
stock since mid-December when Ofgas chairman Mr James McKinnon called for
the group to be broken up.
It was thought that the block of Gas shares had been sold into the market
and the proceeds switched into other utilities, notably the regional
electricity stocks (recs).
The 'recs' were badly mauled after last week's report from the Trade and
Industry Committee on energy policy which called for the electricity
distribution review to be brought forward and for a reduction in the 'recs'
returns on capital.
Among the best performers in the 'recs' were Seeboard, 6 higher at 452p, and
Eastern, 2 firmer at 413p.
Granada hint
An institutional visit by Granada moved the shares smartly forward, adding
to speculation that the television and leisure group is again considering an
acquisition. Granada has made little secret of its desire to buy a
cash-generative company and rumours have hinted at Compass, the catering
group, as a potential target.
Compass shares have been strong performers in recent weeks, yesterday
climbing 6 before falling back to 594p, up a penny on the day. Granada rose
11 to 359p.
Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada's chief executive, formerly ran Compass, and he
confirmed his continuing interest in the catering industry by admitting
Granada was look-ing at Gardner Merchant, the catering subsidiary of Forte
which was eventually sold to management in a Pounds 400m deal.
The market also focused on the share price following an announcement that
Reed International is to offer its 3.66 per cent stake in BSkyB to big
shareholders Granada, Chargeurs and Financial Times owner Pearson. The news
means that the Reed stake and, consequently, the whole of BSkyB would
receive the stock market valuation which it at present lacks. Reed shed 3 to
666p and Pearson 14 to 370p.
Stakis deal
Institutional support for the Stakis recovery story was again in evidence
yesterday, with a large placing of family shares being quickly taken up by
large investors.
The 21m shares on offer were the ones due to the Stakis family as a result
of last week's three-for-one rights issue. They were placed by Smith New
Court in the nil-paid form at 9 3/4 p. The fully-paid closed steady at 44p
and the nil-paid a halfpenny off at 10 1/2 p. As a result of the sale, the
family holding will fall from around 24 per cent to 19 per cent.
News of a strike at its US coal subsidiary Peabody led to early nervousness
over Hanson shares yesterday. The stock was weak in the US and 3p lower in
the UK at one stage.
However, Goldman Sachs argued that the strike affected less than 7 per cent
of Hanson's earnings and the US investment bank advised clients to switch
into the stock from international conglomerate BTR.
Mr Gavin Launder at Goldman Sachs said: 'Hanson offers better exposure to
the US recovery market than BTR, and a better yield at a substantially lower
rating.' Hanson shares closed only a halfpenny easier at 257p on heavy
turnover of 11m, while BTR, also hit by vague talk of a rights issue,
retreated 5 to 553p in trade of 4.8m.
The upsurge in market activity since the turn of the year triggered further
keen support for the merchant banks with significant market share. Against
the overall trend, SG Warburg added 15 at 615p and Kleinwort Benson 3 at
356p.
Confirmation that the recent burst of US buying of BP had boosted the US
holding in the oil company to 23.1 per cent led to periodic bouts of short
covering in London. This, plus more defensive buying of the shares by UK
institutions anxious not to be underweight in the stock, drove BP shares up
3 to 257p with turnover reaching 12m. Shell suffered from switching into BP,
and closed off 4 at 569p on 4.1m traded.
The recent big increase in turnover of Premier Consolidated continued, with
more than 15m shares changing hands and the stock edging ahead 1/4 to 29 1/4
p.
Weakness in Vodafone shares, triggered by worries about competition from
Mercury PCN, scheduled to start up in the middle of the year, and a scare
story hinting at links between cellular phones and brain cancer, was brought
to an end as Vodafone stock advanced 11 to 390p.
ICI rose 4 to 1150p on currency considerations and news of a joint venture
for its titanium dioxide unit.
Some big dollar earners, however, saw profit-taking following sharp rises.
Reuters receded 19 to 1404p and BAT Industries 5 to 973p.
Pharmaceuticals and scientific equipment group Fisons rose sharply in early
trading as Credit Lyonnais Laing recommended the stock as a short to
medium-term buy. There was also a return of bid speculation. However, the
gain was trimmed later. From being 10 points up, the shares closed a net 5
ahead at 224p.
Shares in Alexon continued to be buoyed by rumours of a predator. Most
prominent among potential suitors has been Next, but company sources denied
this, as did Country Casuals. Alexon said no approaches had been received.
Its shares jumped 18 per cent to 88p. Next dipped 3 to 140 1/2 p and Country
Casuals held steady at 177p.
Marks and Spencer shares were bought as the stores sector dipped below a
significant technical resistance level. The stock added 7 1/2 at 325 1/2 p.
Dixons rose 3 to 226p on the replacement of the head of its US subsidiary,
Silo. Two blocks of 10m Laura Ashley shares went through the market at 78
1/2 p and 79p. The stock closed off 2 at 80p.
Another poor performance by Invergordon shares increased speculation that
White &amp; Mackay may consider a renewed bid for the whisky distiller. US-owned
White still holds a 41.3 per cent stake in Invergordon and has never
discounted returning to the fray. Invergordon shares have now underperformed
the market by 20 per cent this year and at yesterday's close - 12 weaker at
252p - were 25 below White &amp; Mackay's final offer price.
Profit-takers were out in force in Rolls-Royce and turnover jumped to 11m as
the shares eased 3 to 130p. Talk of further profit downgrades in TI Group
left the shares 6 lighter at 297p.
BBA moved up 3 to 173p, with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said to have shown a keen
interest. IMI hardened 2 to 264p after ending talks to acquire a subsidiary
of Gebrueder Sulzer, of Switzerland.

FT  03 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DERIVATIVES market ran out of steam yesterday, recording a dull session
following the strong buying seen on Monday, writes Joel Kibazo.
In stock index futures, the FT-SE contract for March delivery opened at
2,868 and was squeezed forward in the first half-hour of trading to 2,873.
However, the early enthusiasm dried up, leaving the contract to drift lower.
The downward slide briefly gathered momentum when an erroneous news agency
report suggested that base rates were to be lifted to 7 per cent today. The
poor performance of short sterling and initial weakness in gilts dampened
the mood further.
The afternoon was dull, with a poor performance on Wall Street serving only
to encourage the usual buyers to remain on the sidelines. March ended at
2,837, a fall of 33 from Monday's close and at a two-point premium to the
underlying cash market, which it had earlier helped to pull lower. Traders
said the closing turnover of 13,297 lots mainly reflected basket trading.
The traded options sector was equally lacklustre, with turnover reaching a
meagre 24,923 contracts, against Monday's 51,866. The FT-SE 100 option
traded 6,746 lots, while the Euro FT-SE 100 option saw business of only 425
contracts.
Among the stock options, British Steel was the busiest at 2,955, with the
October 60 puts the most active. It was followed by Dixons at 2,343 lots.

FT  03 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Optimism on base rates turns cooler
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS IN the London stock market yesterday paid closer attention to the
rejections from Mr John Major, the British prime minister, of rumours that
another early cut in domestic interest rates is on the cards. Caution over
the near-term outlook for UK base rates was enhanced by trends in sterling
futures and, at first, by firmness in cash sterling; a late dip in the
sterling exchange rate had little immediate effect on equities.
However, share prices opened firmly and only the continued weakness in
pharmaceutical issues restrained the FT-SE 100 Index from reaching for a new
peak in early trading. The day's high on the index of 2,859.7 was soon lost
as the cooling of base rate hopes left the share gains of the previous
session vulnerable to profit-taking. By the close, the FT-SE 100 was at
2,834.4 for a net fall of 17.2.
Trading volume remained high, with the non-Footsie stocks continuing to
attract interest; deals in the non-Footsie issues made up about 63 per cent
of the day's Seaq total of 854.5m shares. Monday's customer, or retail,
business was worth Pounds 1.27bn on a Seaq total of 793.4m shares.
Heavy US selling of drug industry stocks was a significant feature. In
addition to underlying uncertainties over possible changes to medical
funding by the new US president, suggestions that Glaxo could surface in the
list of rights issue prospects known to be hovering in the wings of the
London stock market overshadowed the sector.
Profit-taking in market sectors which have stood out strongly this week,
notably the banks, aerospace and building materials groups, was modest.
Stores issues, although also marked for profit-taking, rebounded when early
falls took the sector relative below market tolerance.
Construction and contracting shares, which have consistently outperformed as
the stock market has been gripped by hopes for economic recovery and base
rate cuts, extended their gains yesterday.
The fall in the market yesterday of less than half of Monday's gain appeared
to underline scepticism in the City of London over the apparent uncertainty
in official policies over base rate policies. Having been taken completely
unawares by last week's one percentage-point reduction in domestic interest
rates, most analysts have now reverted to the belief that a further cut in
rates will have to wait six weeks, until the March Budget.
The cooler tone of the stock market allowed rights issue fears to reappear.
Most of the names suggested were the old favourites, but many securities
houses were braced for a heavy call on funds.
However, the institutions are believed to be keener to put cash into the
market by way of rights issues than by straightforward investment through
the equity market.
For the medium-term outlook, investment strategists continue to balance
pros-pects between prospective returns on government bonds and equities.
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, warned that while UK share prices
will be buoyed this year by economic recovery, equity weightings of UK
pension funds will fall gradually over the next few years. Any substantial
fall in pension fund equity holdings would significantly hurt share prices,
comments the US bank.

FT  03 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US blue chips ease as
investors consolidate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
IN SPITE of more good economic news, US share prices were mixed across the
board yesterday as investors consolidated recent gains and searched for
fresh incentives to buy, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.51 at 3,328.67. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.03 up at 442.55, another
record close, while the Nasdaq composite gained 3.35 at 705.12. Trading
volume on the New York SE was 271m shares.
After Monday's big advance, the market opened in a cautious mood, with blue
chip prices easing slightly as some investors took the opportunity to book
profits from recent gains. Although the outlook for the economy continues to
brighten, providing underlying support for stock market sentiment,
yesterday's economic figures, although bullish, failed to give shares a
lift.
The day's data consisted of a 1.9 per cent rise in the December leading
index of economic indicators and a 6.3 per cent gain in December new home
sales. Both increases were bigger than analysts had expected, and were
consistent with other recent data which have painted a picture of a
recovering economy.
Equity prices may have been weighed down by the bond market, which suffered
losses across the maturity range yesterday. Recent rises in bond prices have
pushed interest rates to six-year lows, so any reversal in the trend was
likely to lead to a negative reaction from the stock markets.
Individual stocks continued to be affected by fourth-quarter earnings
announcements. Tenneco climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 41 7/8 after the
natural gas, and farming and construction equipment manufacturer unveiled
fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 35m, up from Dollars 26m a year
earlier.
Pepsico slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 41 3/4 in busy trading after it
announced fourth-quarter profits of Dollars 265.6m, compared with Dollars
221m at the same stage of 1991. Both sets of figures, however, were affected
by restructuring or accounting charges.
The ADRs in Hanson, the UK-based conglomerate, lost Dollars  1/4 to Dollars
18 7/8 after union workers began a strike at the group's Peabody Coal
subsidiary, the largest coal producer in the US.
Leading drug issues took a beating. Pfizer declined Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars
63 1/8 and Merck Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 37 5/8: both stocks were removed
from the recommended list at Salomon Brothers, the big Wall Street
securities house.
The news depressed the rest of the drugs sector, with Bristol-Myers Squibb
weakening Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 58 1/4, Schering-Plough Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 58 3/4 and Johnson &amp; Johnson Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 43 5/8 .
Colgate-Palmolive rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 58 1/4 after it was added to
the Salomon recommended list, on the grounds that the stock has growth
potential.
On the Nasdaq market, Lone Star Steakhouse jumped Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars
41 3/4 in busy trading after the company unveiled plans to accelerate its
rate of new store openings this year. Lone Star also said it was comfortable
with analysts' forecasts that earnings would reach 85 cents a share in 1993.
Canada
TORONTO showed no clear trend after heavy trading. The TSE 300 index was up
10.9 at 3,321.8, but declines held a slight edge over rises by 316 to 305.
Volume amounted to 46.5m shares valued at CDollars 420.9m.
Nine of the 14 stock groups were higher, with the golds sector adding 1.09
per cent.
LAC Minerals, CDollars  3/8 firmer at CDollars 6 1/2 , reported higher
fourth-quarter earnings.

FT  03 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: European shipping boom still elusive -
But the strong dollar should encourage a revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Falling freight rates and lower ship values made 1992 a grim year for most
European shipping companies. Nearly all the major bulk and liner shipping
groups saw their shares head downwards, including such leading concerns as
Denmark's AP Moller, the Netherland's Nedlloyd, Germany's Hapag-Lloyd and
Norway's Bergesen.
The current year may provide a revival, helped by a strong dollar, but the
boom time that many had predicted for the 1990s remains as elusive as ever.
For the bulk groups, much will depend on whether the tanker market recovers
from last year's dire levels, and that in turn hinges a great deal on Opec
output.
Mr Ole Slorer, shipping analyst with NatWest Securities in London, comments:
'If Opec cuts its output by 1m barrels a day in the spring, the equivalent
of 30 supertankers lose employment on an annual basis, so rates weaken.'
Norway is one of Europe's two leading maritime nations, and the 35 per cent
drop in its shipping index to 308 last year gave as clear a picture as
anything of shipping company fortunes in 1992. At this level, the index is
now less than a third of its peak 1,000 in early 1990.
Shares in Bergesen, the big Norwegian bulk shipping group, fell to NKr91.50
from NKr130 in 1992. The collapse in tanker market rates and the crisis in
the Norwegian financial sector took the group to a NKr32m loss at the eight
months stage, although it may scrape back into profit for the year as a
whole.
Any move to raise vessel standards in the wake of the Braer shipping
disaster in the Shetlands could well have a positive effect on a company
such as Bergesen, which operates a high quality fleet of vessels. But it
will not be a beneficiary if the action results in a blanket ban on ships
over a certain age, because some of its ships, though well maintained, are
also old.
Shares in AP Moller's DS 1912 fell 18 per cent from DKr95,900 to DKr79,000,
a smaller decline than the overall drop in the Danish stock market. The
group, Denmark's biggest listed company, was insulated from the full effect
of the poor tanker market by the broad spread of its shipping activities, in
addition to its substantial North Sea oil and gas production operations. As
for all liner shipping groups, its prospects in 1993 will be influenced by
the prospects for world economy and trade.
Nedlloyd, the Dutch shipping and transport group, was a special case, with
its poor underlying performance again aggravated by its uneasy relation-ship
with Mr Torstein Hagen, a major shareholder and a long-time critic of group
strategy. Although Mr Hagen won a hard-fought battle for a place on
Nedlloyd's supervisory board, the perception that financial problems might
force him to sell much of his stake undermined the group's share price from
mid-year onwards. This contributed to a 43 per cent fall in Nedlloyd's stock
price over the year, from Fl 55.60 to Fl 31.70.
Mr Hagen has recently resigned his board position, but 1993 may be another
difficult one for the Dutch company because of its exposure to the slowing
German economy. The same concern surrounds Hapag-Lloyd, the German liner
shipping company whose shares fell 15 per cent to DM435 from DM515 in 1992.
This year the expectation is that both bulk and liner markets will pick up,
if only marginally. But whether shipping groups feel the full benefit of the
trend is another matter. 'Financing costs and higher vessel operating costs
mean that many companies will have worse figures in 1993 than 1992', says Mr
Harald Moraeus Hanssen, shipping analyst with Fearnleys in Oslo.
Shipping's perennial problem is that tonnage supply and demand are out of
balance. It needs weak markets to induce significant scrapping to cut supply
and push up rates. It also needs shipowners to show restraint when ordering
new vessels. If this happens in 1993, then the bull market scenario will be
that much nearer.

FT  03 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt's hopes of
breakthrough recede
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRENGTH of the dollar had less of an impact on senior bourses yesterday
than it did on Monday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT's hopes of breaking up through 1,600 on the DAX index receded as
carmakers fell, an attempt to boost Siemens ran out of impetus, and some
profit-taking set in. Turnover remained subdued as the DAX closed 2.07 lower
at 1,583.09. Siemens stood out with heavy volume, closing DM2.40 higher at
DM606.50 after DM609.
Carmakers eased as traders accepted that the fundamentals were against their
recent rally. Daimler dropped DM2 to DM582.50, BMW DM5.80 to DM499 and
Volkswagen DM1.80 to DM282.70, but dealers said that their losses were
higher compared to Monday's strong post-bourse close on the IBIS screen
trading system.
PARIS ended marginally higher with a strong feature in Matra-Hachette after
an upbeat presentation from its chairman, M Jean-Luc Lagardere.
The market failed to hold an early rise above 1,800, which traders see as a
firm ceiling. The CAC-40 index closed up 1.41 higher at 1,787.31 although
turnover was more active than on Monday, at FFr2.37bn.
M Lagardere's media and defence group rose FFr1.50 to FFr98.50 after he
forecast 1993 profits substantially higher than those of 1992, and average
profits growth of 30 per cent in the period 1993-96, with turnover gaining 5
per cent a year over that time.
Auto industry stocks suffered after a 36.8 per cent drop in French car sales
for January. Peugeot lost FFr3 at FFr567 but the tyremaker, Michelin, fell
FFr3.40 to FFr187.10 and St Gobain, the glassmaker, by FFr13.50 to FFr484.
AMSTERDAM focused on Daf, whose shares were suspended as the loss-making
truckmaker filed for protection from creditors. The shares will resume
trading today but sector analysts believe that they will slide sharply from
the Fl 4.55 quoted at Monday's close.
Overall, the market was mixed in slow trading which saw the CBS Tendency
index 0.4 lower at 98.0.
The Daf suspension spilled over into the financial sector. ABN Amro eased 40
cents to Fl 51.70 as as investors assessed its exposure to Daf. The bank,
which is DAF's main creditor, also holds an 8.24 per cent stake. However,
ING, which holds 10.36 per cent of the Daf shares, edged 10 cents ahead to
Fl 58.40.
Ahold, the retailer, added Fl 1.70 to Fl 92.00 as the market digested its
expansion plans in Portugal and a statement from Mr Cees van der Hoeven, who
becomes chairman on March 1, that the company will continue to seek large
stakes in other US and European supermarket operators.
MILAN was in a more positive mood with the news that the Socialist Party had
pledged full support for the administration of Prime Minister Giuliano
Amato. The Comit index rose 4.10 to 491.56.
Heavy speculative activity in insurance issues was attributed both to the
imminent creation of pension funds and a view that the weekend death of the
Fondiaria president, Mr Camillo De Benedetti, could spark a big reshuffle in
the sector.
Fondiaria rose L256 to L28,033 ahead of a statement by the chairman of AGF,
the French state-controlled insurer, that it would not be buying the Italian
group's 20 per cent stake in AMB, the German insurer, because it was too
costly.
However, analysts noted that Mr Michel Albert left the door open for further
talks, telling shareholders: 'There is a price below which we could buy.'
ZURICH closed narrowly mixed in moderate turnover, the SMI index ending 2.0
lower at 2,118.7
Banks saw SBC bearers SFr3 firmer at SFr330 ahead of the announcement of
higher parent company profits in 1992 and an unchanged dividend.
MADRID was boosted by foreign interest in the Spanish bond market, and
expectations of a cut in three-month and six-month Treasury bill yields at
today's auction may also have boosted equities as the general index closed
4.26 higher at 233.98.
Volume was strong at around Pta25.5bn, almost Pta10bn of which was accounted
for by put-throughs and block trades.
ISTANBUL hit a new 12 month high, the market index putting on 196.74, or 4.3
per cent to 4,748.11, up 10.9 per cent over the past three days.
Turkish equities saw heavy buying by banks and brokerages, buoyed by the
banks' plans to set up mutual funds with an equity content, and by strong
expectations for lower January inflation and bond auction rates this week.

Nikkei edges higher

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE share prices traded within a narrow range due to a lack of fresh news,
the Nikkei average firmed on small-lot buying from foreigners and arbitrage
linked purchases, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei finished 52.67 up at 17,186.31 in spite of selling by tokkin, or
specified money trusts. The index moved between 17,241.60, seen in the
morning session, and 17,145.78 before the close.
Volume rose to 240m shares from 175m. Advances led falls by 599 to 341, with
183 issues unchanged and the Topix index of all first section stocks gained
1.80 at 1,310.81. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.92 to 1,058.63.
Traders said activity was led by the futures market, as most investors
waited for the expected cut in the official discount rate. 'We are expecting
the cut to be as large as 0.75 percentage point now,' said a trader at Nikko
Securities.
Public funds buying, which pushed the Nikkei index up 4.5 per cent last
week, was absent yesterday as most fund managers had placed buy orders at
lower levels. In spite of the sharp rise in share prices, the Tokyo Stock
Exchange said outstanding margin buying fell by Y21.1bn to Y1,401.5bn last
week, its 16th consecutive decline, reflecting the absence of genuine
investors.
Joyo Bank, a regional bank, was the most active issue of the day, rising Y10
to Y860. The issue was heavily cross- traded by financial institutions,
realising profits on holdings without changing the composition of their
portfolios.
Isuzu Motors put on Y3 at Y372 on buying by dealers. The issue has been
popular on the restructuring theme. Gajoen Kanko, the financially troubled
hotel and restaurant operator, which rose on Monday on dealers' buying, lost
Y13 to Y213 on profit-taking.
NEC fell Y13 to Y641 on profit-taking by tokkin funds, foreigners and fund
trusts. Some investors are also concerned over the company's fall in
profitability due to the personal computer price wars in the Japanese
market.
Kyocera, the ceramic packaging maker for integrated circuits, weakened Y80
to Y4,360 on reports that International Business Machines, of the US, had
filed a patent lawsuit over Kyocera's software.
Sankyo Seiki, a music box manufacturer, surged Y64 to Y579 on rumours that
it would merge with NMB Semiconductor, which is to be acquired by Nippon
Steel, the leading steel maker, which owns 16 per cent of Sankyo.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved forward 113.94 to 18,569.05 in 64.7m shares,
rising for the sixth consecutive trading day on individual buying.
Roundup
THIN trading ranges seemed to be the order of the day in the region.
SINGAPORE continued its record-breaking run, the Straits Times Industrial
index closing 1.24 higher at 1,645.68, the third consecutive all-time peak.
Turnover of 119.62m shares compared with Monday's 104.92m.
Keppel Integrated Engineering was the most active stock, adding 10 cents at
SDollars 1.59 after a brokerage house recommended the stock. KIE announced
after the market closed that it had clinched two contracts in Thailand worth
about SDollars 9m.
HONG KONG closed lower after quiet trading, with demand dampened by the
lingering Sino-British dispute over Hong Kong's political reform. The Hang
Seng index receded 35.25 to 5,662.53 in the wake of selling by foreign
investors, while turnover rose from HKDollars 1.7bn to HKDollars 1.8bn.
News that Governor Chris Patten will enter hospital because of a heart
ailment was released after the market closed.
HSBC Holdings was the most traded issue, rising 50 cents to HKDollars 59.50.
It was followed by its Hang Seng Bank unit, which was steady at HKDollars
56.50 after touching a high of HKDollars 57.50.
AUSTRALIA took little heart from an improved balance of payments and the All
Ordinaries index finished just 1.1 firmer at 1,530.2 in thin volume of
ADollars 190.5m.
Trade was dominated by Westpac, which ended 3 cents ahead at ADollars 3.00.
Higher net profits announcements left Simsmetal 18 cents higher at ADollars
2.36 and Evans Deakin 20 cents stronger at ADollars 2.20.
MANILA drifted lower, the composite index ending down 2.79 at 1,334.73.
KUALA LUMPUR was broadly higher on a technical rebound after the recent
losses.
The composite index closed a net 3.89 to the good at 628.38 after some late
profit-taking had dragged prices down from the day's highs.
BANGKOK recovered from early losses as heavy buying of leading banks in the
final minutes pushed the SET index ahead to end 4.05 up at 969.80.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Money Markets: Revised expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STERLING cash and futures markets yesterday reined in expectations of
another cut in UK base rates before the March Budget after the UK government
mounted a concerted campaign to restore confidence in the pound, writes
James Blitz.
On Monday, Downing Street denied weekend reports that the prime minister was
about to drive interest rates lower to stimulate economic recovery.
The comments from Mr Major's office had little effect on sterling markets on
Monday, but there was a sharp change of tone to dealing yesterday.
The March short sterling contract dropped 24 basis points in the early part
of the day, falling as low as 94.28, a level which prices three-month money
at Budget time at 5.72 per cent. It only recovered a small amount of lost
ground in the afternoon, finishing at 94.33.
The revised view on rates was also felt in the cash market.
Three-month money closed more or less unchanged at 6 1/4 per cent, helped by
a comparatively small shortage of Pounds 750m forecast by the Bank of
England in the morning.
However, six-month money rose on the bid side by about  1/16 percentage
point to end at 5 7/8 per cent. With the bid rate for one-year money closing
at 5 3/4 per cent, the money market yield curve appeared to be levelling off
yesterday.
A rising yield curve would indicate that dealers believe 5 per cent could be
the eventual floor for base rates in this cycle.
Trading in French franc markets was extremely calm when set against the
volatility of Monday.
The franc barely moved on the foreign exchanges and three-month money fell
back to around 12 1/2 per cent from Monday's 13 per cent. The March French
franc contract climbed 32 basis points, finishing at 85.55, following
Monday's 23-point decline.
The market will scrutinise today's Bundesbank interven-tion in the money
markets for any sign of policy easing, although expectations of this are
low.
There is a heavy call on funds because of the German tax season, and call
money finished a little higher at 8.66 per cent. One money market analyst
was yesterday expecting the lowest accepted repo bid for today to be on the
high side, possibly in the area of 8.61 or 8.62 per cent.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar close to a crucial test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR yesterday con-tinued to rally towards this year's peak of DM1.65
against the D-Mark following the release of the best set of US leading
indicators in 10 years, writes James Blitz.
The US currency had climbed nearly a pfennig at one stage, after news that
the leading indicators rose 1.9 per cent in December against economists'
predictions of a 1.7 per cent gain.
The dollar's rally was also triggered by German economic indicators showing
a flagging economy, and a need to stimulate economic production through
lower interest rates. December industrial orders in Germany fell 1.8 per
cent and manufacturing output was down 2.4 per cent. The US unit ended in
London at DM1.6420, up  1/2 pfennig on the day. In New York it closed at the
London level of DM1.6420.
This week is seen as a critical test as to whether the dollar can break
through DM1.65. Analysts were yesterday upward revising their expectations
for the January US payroll figure, with at least one European bank nearly
doubling its estimate from 85,000 to 160,000.
Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Banking Corporation, said: 'A
payroll week is always big for the dollar. A lot of long-term players are in
the market waiting to test the currency's strength.' Mr Brian Hilliard, a
Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull economist, was confident that the dollar
was about to surge ahead.
The dollar could gain additional strength if the Bundesbank makes a
conciliatory move on short-term interest rates either today, at its weekly
money market intervention, or tomorrow, at its fortnightly council meeting.
Few people expect any policy easing, because Germany's public sector wage
talks will probably finish on Thursday at the earliest. These are seen by
the Bundesbank as a crucial guide to the inflation outlook.
The relaxation in tensions inside the European exchange rate mechanism has
taken pressure off Germany to ease for now. The French franc yesterday
traded at around FFr3.3820 against the D-Mark.
One small source of tension was that both Danish and Irish authorities were
forced to intervene in the markets, selling the Irish punt, because the
Danish currency was at its ERM floor against the Irish one. This was not yet
seen as an important test of the system.
The dollar's strength put heavy pressure on the pound at the end of European
trading, pushing it as low as Dollars 1.4400. This, in turn, sent the
Sterling Exchange Rate Index down to a record low of 77.1 at the end of the
day. The pound closed in London at Dollars 1.4460, off 3/4 cent on the day,
and finished lower in New York at Dollars 1.4435.
Sterling was calmer against the D-Mark for most of the day, as dealers took
the view that another UK base rate cut may not come before the March Budget.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mauritanian fishing flounders
for lack of investment - The problems holding back a potentially rich source
of export earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MAURITANIA HAS some of the world's richest fishing grounds. A profusion of
plankton, where the Canary current from the north meets the Guinea current
from the south off the northern city of Nouadhibou supports species ranging
from pink spiney lobsters, octopus and squid to sardines, horse mackerel and
tuna. But under-investment in vessels and insufficient data about fish
stocks remaining threaten to undermine the industry.
The novelty of fishing for most Mauritanians could help to explain the lack
of investment. Less than 30 years ago, more than 80 per cent of the people,
mostly Moors, led a nomadic, or semi-nomadic way of life, based on raising
livestock. 'We've traditionally looked more towards the sand than the sea,'
says the managing director of one of the country's largest fishing
companies.
The country did not have its own fishing fleet until the beginning of the
1980s. It started with 150 boats, but only 50 are now operational, and many
of those only just. Many vessels lie rusting at anchor in Nouadhibou
harbour.
The banks, meanwhile, are owed an estimated 13bn ouguiya (Pounds 84m) by the
fishing industry, borrowed for the purchase of new boats, an amount which
represents 40 per cent of the credit in the Mauritanian economy. The Union
Bank for Development, one of the main lenders to the fishing industry, is
likely to have its activities radically curtailed under the World Bank and
IMF reforms.
Mauritanians, it seems, generally prefer to invest hard currency from fish
sales in banks and businesses abroad, particularly in the Canary Islands and
mainland Spain. Some figures suggest that the Mauritanian fishing industry
channels USDollars 100m a year through Las Palmas alone.
Most of the large industrial boats are owned jointly by Mauritania and other
countries, such as Libya, Romania, Russia or Algeria. 'Those countries don't
have the money to invest in boats and neither, it appears, does Mauritania,'
comments one foreign diplomat who has taken a close interest in the
fisheries sector. The cost of bringing the Mauritanian fleet back up to
strength has been estimated at UM75bn (UM is the abbreviation for the
ouguiya) - or nearly Pounds 490m.
Just as worrying for the future of the industry is the lack of accurate
information on fish stocks. According to figures published by the
government's Oceanographic and Fisheries Research Institute (CNROP) in
Nouadhibou, the level of fish stocks has been static in recent years.
Foreign scientists, on the other hand, believe the numbers of some species
to be critically low. 'The Mauritanians don't know how many trawlers should
be allowed in their waters, whether to permit 500 or 5,000,' says one marine
biologist.
The Japanese recently reported to the Mauritanian government that the
octopus would become threatened if pipes - used mostly by smaller,
traditional boats - continued to suck up immature as well as adult fish. The
total octopus catch of 21,000 tonnes last year was worth Dollars 75m in
export markets, principally Japan, out of total fish exports Dollars 220m.
Mauritanian boats are themselves reporting falling catches, 'A vessel of
average size used to land over 10,000 boxes of octopus, cuttlefish or squid
after two months of fishing,' says Mr Moulaye el Hassen, founder and
managing director of Somacopp, a Mauritanian company with three industrial
vessels. 'Now, if you're lucky you can expect about 5,000 boxes after 70
days at sea.'
Lobsters were once so plentiful that they were fished with nets. The decline
in lobster numbers has been so disastrous that Portuguese boats now consider
lobster fishing to be virtually uneconomic.
Log books listing catches are often not returned to the DCP, the Mauritanian
fishery control authority. The main culprits seem to be Spanish and
Portuguese captains. The absence of effective surveillance and punishment of
vessels infringing quotas and net sizes is another concern. Of penalties
totalling UM450m imposed over the last four years UM156m remains unpaid.
Foreign governments and multilateral agencies have been insisting on
wide-ranging reforms of the Mauritanian fishing industry in exchange for
major investment. For example, Mauritania should be eligible for a grant of
Ecu9.6m (Pounds 7.85m) from the European Community, as compensation for a
fall in 1990 cephalopod exports, under the Stabex provisions of Lome
Convention, a trade and aid agreement with former colonies of EC members.
This is likely to be used partly to improve management within the CNROP.
Foreign exchange will be made available for the purchase of inputs, mostly
fishing gear and spare parts, but only to those boat owners who can show
they are not indebted to the Mauritanian banks and can deposit the ouguiya
equivalent.
Germany has invested nearly DM16m (Pounds 6.7m) since 1989 in the purchase
and modernisation of the Priscilla, a 54-metre, former Scottish surveillance
vessel. Rechristened N'madi, or hunter, it is crewed by Mauritanian sailors
and carries German, Danish and British fishery experts. The Germans have
also funded an on-board computerised information system for the N'madi.
The French government has agreed to provide a second patrol vessel and to
finance two marine biologists to work in the CNROP for three years. It is
also interested in contributing to the financing a shipyard and an
enlargement of port facilities at Nouadhibou.
From July last year, at German and French insistence, the DCP assumed
responsibility for co-ordinating maritime surveillance, managing navy, air
force, customs and fishery patrols. Germany recently agreed to fund a marine
biologist as an interface between the DCP and the CNROP, to improve the
CNROP's grasp of fish stocks. Meanwhile, the French are requesting that the
Mauritanian law requiring a minimum mesh size of 70 mm be more strictly
enforced, that all boats display special numbers at least as prominent as
their name and that there should be tighter monitoring of infringements and
the collection and use of fines.
Mauritania still lacks the capacity significantly to add to the value of
fish caught. This final piece in the jigsaw - investment in major on-shore
processing plant - would become more likely should there be a relaxation of
the investment climate climate in Mauritania and, in particular, Central
Bank regulations for the release of hard currency. At the end of last year
the Brussels-based Centre for Development and Industry held the first of a
planned series of seminars to promote industrial partnerships in the fishing
sector.
Investment of some Dollars 7.5m is needed to improve existing but basic
on-shore fish processing plant, to bring it up to standards of hygiene now
required by the EC, and to make new products such as fish blocks and fish
fillets.
Mauritania's fish exports are expected to rise sharply in the coming year
with West Africa seen as the most promising market for the pelagic catch. If
Mauritanians themselves develop a taste for fingers, fillets and steaks,
perhaps then the Moors may turn more of their attention to the sea.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber talks break up without
price deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER SIGNS of dissension have appeared within the International Natural
Rubber Organisation, with the world's main producers and consumers failing
to agree whether to cut the Inro reference price.
The reference price, now at 207.2 Malaysian cents a kilogram, is the base on
which calculations are made to determine whether the Inro buffer stock
manager buys or sells rubber.
A meeting here has broken up in deadlock with neither producers or consumers
prepared to compromise on a new reference price. One participant at
yesterday's talks - which were originally due to have concluded last Friday
 -said that any decision had been indefinitely postponed.
Under Inro rules the reference price has to be cut by 5 per cent if the
average Inro daily market indicator price over the last six months period is
below the organisation's 'may buy' level - at present 176 cents.
Though natural rubber prices have flagged for much of the last few months, a
recent sharp rally in prices has caused the six month average to jump to
only 5 cents under the 'may buy' level. Producers, led by Malaysia, want the
figure to be rounded off to 176 cents to avoid triggering a price cut.
Consumers, led by the European Community, insist that the Inro rules should
be followed.
This is the latest in a series of increasingly bitter rows between the two
sides within Inro. The most vexatious issue at present is whether or not to
have a new international rubber agreement.
The present agreement expires at the end of this year and producing
countries have warned that unless progress towards negotiation of a new pact
can be achieved by March, Inra could collapse. Producers would then bring in
their own pricing mechanisms.
Meanwhile, the rubber market been given new life in recent weeks by fears of
supply shortages and a strengthening of demand from consumers. An early
wintering season - the period of low latex production - has been reported
from several producing areas in south-east Asia, a region that accounts for
nearly 80 per cent of global natural rubber production.
Market prices for RSS 1 and SMR 20, two of the most commonly bought rubber
grades, are now at 25 and 16 month highs respectively.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cobalt price slide halted by
Zaire crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLOODY RIOTS and killings in Zaire, like those seen in the past few days,
once would have sent the price of cobalt soaring because that country is the
world's biggest producer. But traders said yesterday that, while the latest
orgy of violence in Zaire had made buyers nervous, cobalt metal prices had
moved up only by between 50 US cents and Dollars 1 a lb.
Similar events in Zaire in September 1991 sent the free market price of
cobalt from Dollars 20 to Dollars 35 a lb in a few days. It had started that
year at only Dollars 7.
Since then the market has been revolutionised by the collapse of the Soviet
Union and a dramatic rise in Russian exports. Meanwhile, demand for cobalt -
a hard, silver-white metal used in superalloys in such things as cutting
tools, high-strength magnets and jet engines, as a powder in catalysts for
the oil and man-made fibre industries and in radial tyres - has eased back
because of recessionary conditions in much of the industrialised world.
According to the Cobalt Development Institute, about 23,000 tonnes of cobalt
metal was produced last year, while demand was roughly 21,300 tonnes.
Political turmoil in Zaire played havoc with production there and it slumped
by 2,000 tonnes or nearly one quarter to 6,600 tonnes. At its peak, in 1986,
Zaire's state-owned Gecamines produced 14,500 tonnes.
Last year Russian exports more than made up the deficit and reached an
estimated 5,000 tonnes. Russian production was probably 4,500 tonnes while
the rest came from various stockpiles.
'The power in the cobalt market has shifted from Africa to Russia. There has
been an avalanche of Russian material so that all last year's bad news about
Zaire could not stop the cobalt price falling,' pointed out Mr Nick French,
a director of the Wogen Resources minor metals trading organisation.
The African producers' price set by Zaire and Zambia, where annual
production is steady at about 4,500 tonnes, was cut last month from Dollars
25 to Dollars 18 a lb. The free market price of Russian cobalt is Dollars 11
to Dollars 12 a lb.
Mr French said: 'Present events in Zaire have not changed the outlook (for
cobalt production there) - it remains atrocious. However, the killings have
moved the story on to front pages so sentiment has been affected.' Consumers
were still not willing to sign long-term contracts but were no longer
waiting until the very last moment to make short-term purchases, he said.
Speculators had withdrawn from the market and traders and merchants were
reluctant to take positions.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee rally continues as pact
negotiations labour on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S ROBUSTA coffee market continued to gain ground yesterday, taking
heart from an overnight close above 60 cents a lb in New York's March
contract.
At the same time delegates to the International Coffee Organisation talks on
a possible new agreement laboured on, with little sign that concrete
progress will be announced when they close on Friday.
ICO delegates were dismayed by the March New York contract's 6.75 cent
tumble to 56.05 cents a lb last week. But the plunge appears not to have
fuelled any burning desire to reach agreement during the present round of
negotiations. 'I can't think of one thing that we have actually agreed in
the last few days,' one consumer delegate said yesterday.
In late trading New York was almost 3 cents ahead, while London's May
contract closed Dollars 38 up at Dollars 945 a tonne, well above last week's
low of Dollars 801.
The recent volatility of the coffee market has been caused not by news from
the ICO talks, which has followed much the same pattern as the last few
meetings, but by the weight of investment fund money being moved around in
New York. But the fundamental supply and demand factors suggest that prices
should be beginning to move ahead.
In a briefing paper headed 'Who needs a coffee pact?' GNI, the London
futures broker, suggests that even without the help of an agreement, coffee
should bounce from its current oversold condition back to around 75 cents a
lb on tight supply alone.
GNI points out that the Brazilian crop for the 1992-93 year (ending in
April) of below 20m bags (60 kg each) represents a 25 per cent reduction on
the three previous years. . . 'and a 25 per cent fall in production from the
world's largest producer is enough to scare any commodity market'.
Yesterday a separate report from ED &amp; F. Man estimated Brazil's crop for
1993-94 at 21.52m bags - slightly below most trade estimates, which have
ranged between 22m and 23m bags. The news helped to support yesterday's
price advance.
According to GNI, the fall in Brazilian output will leave consumer stocks at
the end of this season 25 per cent below the 1990-91 peak of 19.7m bags. 'By
the end of the 1993-94 season, consumer inventories should be close to more
normal levels of around 12m bags.'
GNI believes that if good progress is made at the ICO, 'then it is possible
that a major rally back to Dollars 1 a lb is on the cards.' However, the ICO
has already fixed a further meeting for the last week of March. The
agreement runs out on March 31.
Yesterday producers and consumers were still locked in negotiation over
'selectivity' - which would determine whether three or four different sorts
of coffee would be exported under a future ICO quota scheme.
Producers favour four, while consumers prefer three.

Sterling's weakness continued to carry the COPPER market higher at the
London Metal Exchange. Prices ended higher in pound terms for the sixth
successive trading day with cash metal closing at Pounds 1,537 a tonne, up
Pounds 15.50 on the day and Pounds 114.50 from the level ruling just over a
week ago. But virtually all of that rise reflected the currency factor.
Dealers said an early rise on short-covering and options-related buying had
taken the three months delivery price up to a resistance level between
Dollars 2,400 and Dollars 2,500 a tonne. The subsequent fall had been
cushioned by concern over the situation in Zaire, strike action in Mexico
and a threatened strike in Chile, they said. Last business had three months
metal at Dollars 2,235 a tonne, up Dollars 5 from Monday. ZINC prices
surrendered some of the recent gains that had been prompted by production
cut announcements. The three months price closed Dollars 13.25 down at
Dollars 1,116.50 a tonne. Rising LME stocks and dollar strength kept
ALUMINIUM under pressure.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Selling wave hits Chicago wheat
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHICAGO WHEAT futures tumbled in active trading as export prospects dimmed
and professional traders, seeing little good news on the horizon, liquidated
their wheat futures holdings.
Soft red winter wheat for March delivery was down more than 8 cents, at
Dollars 3.71 per bushel at midsession. Analysts said managed futures funds
sold wheat after March futures fell below a chart support point of Dollars
3.75.
News that Russia had recently received French credits to purchase 2.4m
tonnes of European Community wheat and that the Republic of Kazakhstan has
sold Russia 3.2m tonnes of wheat would limit Russia's appetite for US wheat,
even if its credit problems were resolved, analysts said.
The Australian Wheat Board boosted its crop estimate to 15.3m tonnes, from
14.6m, but US traders said the upward revision had been expected and was not
a major feature in the sell off.

FT  03 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Northern Foods launches
Pounds 91.28m debut issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Foods, the UK dairy and convenience food company, yesterday
launched the first sterling convertible bond issue for two months, taking
advantage of rising UK share prices and falling interest rates.
Strong demand enabled the food company to increase the size of the issue,
which marked its debut in the international capital markets, to Pounds
91.28m from Pounds 85m. The coupon was set at 6.75 per cent, the low end of
the indicated range of 6.75-7.00 per cent, and the conversion price was set
at 326p a share, representing a premium of 18.11 per cent over the ordinary
share price at the time of pricing. This came in at the top of the indicated
range.
Mr Martin Clark, finance director of Northern Foods, said the issue was
aimed at repaying short-term debt of Pounds 120m linked to last year's
Pounds 359m acquisition of Express Dairy and Eden Vale from GrandMet. 'The
issue also improves the company's debt (maturity) profile,' he said.
The 15-year issue, redeemable after five years, represents 5 per cent of
Northern Foods' share capital. The bonds were priced at par but rose to 101
1/2 in grey market trading.
Convertibles dealers were hopeful that Northern Foods' issue heralded a
pick-up in a market which has been virtually moribund for the last 12 to 14
months, during which high interest rates and low share valuations
discouraged finance directors from using this sort of financing.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries slip as strong economic data
spark selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>

MORE strong economic figures sparked retail selling on US bond markets
yesterday, leaving Treasuries lower across the board.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/2 at 104
19/32 , yielding 7.240 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was  1/8 lower at 99 31/32 , to yield 4.250 per cent.
The day's economic news was singularly bearish for bonds. The Commerce
Department reported that the December US leading economic indicators rose
1.9 per cent, a much bigger increase than analysts had expected. The data
followed the news that new home sales surged 6.3 per cent in December, again
a bigger rise than the market had forecast. Later in the day, the Johnson
Redbook report was released showing a 4.6 per cent jump in store sales for
the last week of December.
The figures prompted selling across the board, especially by retail players.
Prices were also pressured lower by a reluctance among market participants
to trade ahead of today's important refunding announcement, which will
reveal how much the Treasury will issue of three-year, 10-year and 30-year
securities.
THE Bank of England saw strong demand for its three-year Ecu notes yesterday
when it resumed its quarterly Ecu note programme with its first tender for
several months.
The Bank's Ecu note programme was halted last October when turbulent
conditions in the Ecu and European government bond markets forced it to
cancel a planned auction. However, as conditions in the bond and foreign
exchange markets have stabilised recently, the Bank announced it would
resume its quarterly programme.
Yesterday's tender of Ecu 500m of notes was heavily oversubscribed, with a
bid-to-cover ratio of five times and a very narrow range of accepted bids.
The highest accepted yield was 8 per cent and the lowest 7.99 per cent. The
coupon was set at 8 per cent.
Dealers said the strong demand for the paper reflected growing confidence in
the Ecu market after the turmoil and uncertainty of recent months following
Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty.
The tender results had little impact on the Ecu bond market, which weakened
slightly yesterday. The Ecu futures contract on the Matif traded at around
110.04 by late afternoon, against Monday's close of 110.08.
UK government bonds closed up half a point at the long end, helped by
outright buying and some switching out of shorter-maturities. Dealers said
hopes of another cut in the base rate are fading, leading to a slight fall
in prices at the short end.
EUROPEAN government bond prices edged higher in lacklustre trading with
attention focusing on developments in Germany. The German public sector pay
talks are due to resume today and the Bundesbank Council holds its regular
meeting on Thursday. Some dealers are hoping to see an easing at today's
repo, but doubt a cut in official interest rates will materialise this week.
JAPANESE government bond prices closed firmer, with the futures contract
reaching a new high as speculation about an interest rate cut continued.
The release of relatively high unemployment figures helped to fuel hopes
that the Bank of Japan would ease soon. Unemployment in December rose to 2.4
per cent from 2.3 per cent the previous month. Jiji, the Japanese news
agency, reported later that the Bank of Japan was expected to lower its
official discount rate by 75 basis points to 2.5 per cent on Thursday.
However, news that Mr Yutaka Yamaguchi, director of the Bank of Japan's
policy planning department, had emphasised the timing was not right for a
rate cut dampened the futures price during London trading.
The March futures contract opened at 109.68 and closed at 109.77, the high
of the day. The yield on the benchmark No 145 bond, ended the day unchanged
at 4.30 per cent, having traded in a range of 4.28 to 4.375 per cent.

FT  03 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Liffe prepares Spanish
10-year bond contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) is
preparing to launch a new 10-year Spanish government bond futures contract
which will compete directly with a contract on Meff RF, the Spanish futures
exchange based in Barcelona.
Liffe's decision to launch a rival contract was sharply criticised by Mr
Jose Luis Oller, Meff RF's chief executive. 'We think it is the wrong policy
for a market which is not very large,' he said. '(Liffe is) going to segment
the market and split the liquidity.'
Meff's 10-year contract currently trades around 6,500 contracts a day, while
its three-year contract is hardly traded.
Liffe argued that the new contract would be positive for the market. 'The
listing. . .will increase international participation in the 10-year Spanish
government debt market, widening distribution and hence potentially
contributing to a reduction in the funding cost of this debt,' said Mr Nick
Durlacher, Liffe's chairman.
Liffe already trades contracts listed on other domestic exchanges, such as
German bund and Italian bond futures.
The new Liffe contract, which starts trading on March 10, is designed to tap
international interest in the Spanish government bond market, which is
recovering after a severe dip last year. Foreign holdings currently account
for around 20 per cent of the market, according to Bank of Spain figures,
down from around 33 per cent a year ago.
International participation is expected to recover further. 'Of all the
high-yielding markets, Spain has most of the right credentials,' according
to Mr Steve Major, an economist at Credit Lyonnais Securities.
The introduction of the Liffe contract is expected to encourage
spread-trading between markets, using other government bond futures listed
on Liffe. The move is also likely to promote the development of a more
active repo market in Spanish government bonds, traders said.

FT  03 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Credit Suisse wins mandate for Dollars
500m offering from IADB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN, ANTONIA SHARPE and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Inter-American Development Bank yesterday launched its expected Dollars
500m issue of 10-year Eurobonds, after a fierce round of competitive bidding
among banks for the mandate to arrange the issue.
Credit Suisse First Boston was awarded the mandate to arrange the deal,
which was priced to yield just 18 basis points more than the 6 3/8 per cent
Treasury due 2002. Dealers were not surprised by the aggressive pricing of
the offering, given the level of competition among potential underwriters.
The bonds looked expensive compared with 10-year paper for the Asian
Development Bank, trading at a yield spread of 21 basis points. However,
there is a lack of paper trading below par, following the recent rally in
the US Treasury market. Dealers reported some demand from Asia, but said the
deal would take some time to place.
Meanwhile, Italy is reported to be considering launching a large dollar
transaction, totalling Dollars 2bn to Dollars 3bn, following its recent
DM5bn Eurobond. However, dealers said such an issue would have to be
carefully priced, as investors remain nervous about the credit.
The Portuguese escudo bond market was tapped for the first time since last
April by the European Investment Bank, which launched an Esc10bn five-year
bond.
An official at Espirito Santo-Sociedade de Investimentos, the lead manager,
said the convergence of interest rates between the Euro-escudo and the
domestic escudo since the liberalisation of capital movement in Portugal
last December made the issue attractive to domestic investors.
The EIB bond was priced at 100.75 to yield 12.53 per cent, which compared
with a yield of 12.47 per cent in the recent auction of Portuguese
government bonds of a comparable maturity. The bonds were trading at 99.90,
well inside total fees of 1 5/8 per cent.
Two further Canadian dollar issues, totalling CDollars 470m, for a Japanese
government-backed agency, and the Austrian government-guaranteed Asfinag
added to the supply in an already over-crowded market. Syndicate managers
said distribution was slow since there was little to choose between the
issuers. More than CDollars 1bn has been issued since Friday.
Dealers said the 10-year paper from Japan Finance Corporation for Municipal
Enterprises went well, as its yield spread of 43 basis points over
comparable Canadian government bonds was more generous than other recent
issues. By contrast, the syndicate on Asfinag's 10-year offer, which yielded
40 basis points over, had still not broken by last night.
Columbia plans to launch a sovereign Eurobond this year to open the way for
public and private entities to tap international capital markets, according
to finance minister Mr Rudolf Hommes, Reuter reports.
'We are preparing it for this year, I don't know whether in the first or the
second half,' he said.
Mr Hommes added that the final amount was still under discussion but added
the funds raised would be used to repay expensive public borrowing.

FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: Chrysler raises Dollars 1.78bn
in share issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRYSLER, the US vehicle manufacturer, last night raised Dollars 1.78bn
gross when its international issue of 46m new shares was priced at Dollars
38 3/4 a share, - the closing price of the company's stock on the New York
Stock Exchange.
The issue is a considerable success for Chrysler, which has seen its share
price nearly quadruple since the start of last year as its financial
prospects have improved.
The company originally planned to issue 40m shares, but it has now sold an
additional 6m which it made available to the underwriters, led by First
Boston, to make up over-allocation of the stock to investors.
Chrysler's share price has performed robustly since the issue was announced
on January 11. It stood at Dollars 36 3/8 immediately before the
announcement, dipped a little afterwards, but then rose, helped by strong
fourth-quarter earnings.
The company has indicated it will use almost half the funds raised to reduce
the underfunding of its pension obligations. The shortfall stands at about
Dollars 4bn and Chrysler has left open the possibility that all the cash
could go to the pension fund.

FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: Eastman Kodak advances to post
earnings of Dollars 299m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and Our Financial Staff
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EASTMAN Kodak, the photo-graphic equipment company, yesterday reported
fourth-quarter net earnings of Dollars 299m, compared with a Dollars 400m
loss a year ago, and forecast that its latest restructuring plan would
produce a solid increase in 1993 operating earnings.
The company, with a lacklustre profits record in recent years, has shown
signs of a more aggressive approach to its problems in recent months,
including the announcement of 2,000 redundancies.
Mr Kay Whitmore, the chairman, reiterated the company's penitential tone
yesterday when he declared that from now on Kodak would 'better align our
structural costs with realistic volume projections. We will view the world
as it is, and not as we might wish it to be. And our view will be fixed on
increasing shareholder value.'
The fourth-quarter earnings worked through at 92 cents a share and compared
with a loss of Dollars 1.23 a share in the same period of 1991, when the
company took after-tax restructuring charges of Dollars 597m, or Dollars
1.84.
Revenues rose 6 per cent to Dollars 5.40bn from Dollars 5.08bn.
For the full-year the company reported net earnings of Dollars 1.15bn, or
Dollars 3.53 a share, compared with Dollars 17m, or 5 cents, a year ago. The
1991 figures were reduced by Dollars 1.03bn of after-tax charges, while in
1992 a Dollars 152m beneficial accounting change was almost offset by
Dollars 141m of restructuring charges.
However, Mr Whitmore acknowledged that 'with sluggish volume and cost
inflation putting pressure on operating margins, the sale of certain
investments was a large factor in the net earnings gain' for 1992. In the
fourth quarter the imaging business produced earnings of Dollars 316m,
compared with a 1991 loss of Dollars 189m, while the information business
made a loss of Dollars 12m, down from a loss of Dollars 65m, excluding
restructuring charges.
The chemicals business made Dollars 110m, down 1 per cent on a year ago,
while health operations made Dollars 123m, down from Dollars 151m, excluding
restructuring charges.
Polaroid, the US camera and films group, blamed a sharp fall in European
film sales for a decline in fourth-quarter net profits, writes Our Financial
Staff.
Earnings for the three months to end-December totalled Dollars 29.6m, or 63
cents a share, compared with Dollars 58.5m, or Dollars 1.16, a year earlier,
on sales 2 per cent higher at Dollars 649.2m against Dollars 633.4m.
For the full year, net income was Dollars 99m, or Dollars 2.06, against
Dollars 683.7m, or Dollars 12.54, in 1991, a figure boosted by a pre-tax
gain of Dollars 925m as a result of a litigation settlement with Eastman
Kodak. Sales for the year were Dollars 2.15bn against Dollars 2.07bn.
Polaroid said that in the first quarter of 1993 it intends to take an
undisclosed charge for its previously announced early retirement and
severance programme.

LOCKHEED, the US defence group, yesterday reported a 15.5 per cent increase
in fourth-quarter net earnings to Dollars 119m, or Dollars 1.95 a share,
from Dollars 103m, or Dollars 1.63, in the corresponding period a year ago.
Sales increased 6 per cent to Dollars 2.9bn.
For the full year, it reported earnings of Dollars 348m, or Dollars 5.65 a
share, on sales of Dollars 10.1bn, before taking a Dollars 631m after-tax
non-cash charge for a change in methods of accounting for employees
post-retirement health benefits.
In 1991 it earned Dollars 308m, or Dollars 4.86 a share, on sales of Dollars
9.8bn.
Lockheed's funded backlog increased to Dollars 8.9bn at the end of 1992,
compared with Dollars 8.8bn at the end of 1991.

FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: Telmex in line with expectations
</HEADLINE>

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TELEFONOS de Mexico (Telmex), Mexico's monopoly telephone utility and the
country's largest private company, reported net profits of 7.972bn new pesos
(Dollars 2.56bn) for 1992, an increase of 1.9 per cent in real terms on
1991.
The results were in line with expectations, but Telmex shares fell in early
trading yesterday.
Excluding extraordinary items such as 1991's profitable debt swap, Telmex
profits increased in real terms by 12.4 per cent last year, and 14.1 per
cent in the fourth quarter, similar to growth of recent years.
Telmex intends to invest 7.518bn new pesos in modernising Mexico's
antiquated telephone system this year.
It hopes to increase lines in service by 12.3 per cent, or 850,000 lines,
and to extend fibre-optic cables carrying long-distance calls to 6,000km.
The investment in updating the telephone system, mandated by the government
concession, is one of largest in the world.
The company, as required by government regulation, increased lines in
service by 12.1 per cent last year, with sales up by an inflation-adjusted
13.7 per cent.
'There were no real surprises in the 1992 numbers, except the company took a
Dollars 20m-Dollars 25m write-off for obsolete equipment,' said Mr Mickey
Schleien, Latin American analyst at Morgan Stanley.
Profit margins fell slightly, as costs grew faster than revenues, due to the
company's 'additional commitment to quality,' Mr Schleien said. Line growth
also slowed in the last quarter of 1992.
Telmex is controlled by Grupo Carso, the Mexican conglomerate that
successfully placed Dollars 350m of stock on international markets last week
.
The offering was the first important one by a Mexican company since Banamex,
Mexico's largest bank, abandoned its share offer in June last year due to
lack of demand.

<TEXT>
TWO leading US tele-communications companies, GTE and Sprint, yesterday
reported double-digit underlying growth in fourth-quarter earnings.
Sprint, the third-largest long-distance operator, reported a 19 per cent
increase in fourth-quarter net income, from Dollars 98m, or 45 cents a
share, to Dollars 117m, or 53 cents, on revenues which rose 10 per cent to
Dollars 2.41bn.
GTE, the largest local telephone group in the US, reported net income of
Dollars 417m, or 44 cents, down from Dollars 515m, or 57 cents, a year ago.
However, the 1992 figures included one-time after-tax charges of Dollars
100m, or 11 cents a share, including Dollars 48m for the sale of its
electrical products business.
Earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding accounting changes
and a one-time gain on the sale of cellular properties, rose 10 per cent.
GTE reported 1992 income from continuing operations of Dollars 1.79bn, or
Dollars 1.95, including a Dollars 137m after-tax charge for a change in
accounting for health benefits.
In 1991 the company reported income from continuing operations of Dollars
1.53bn, or Dollars 1.69. Revenues totalled Dollars 19.98bn, up from Dollars
19.62bn.
Sprint's local telephone operations reported operating income of Dollars
160m, down from Dollars 164m, on revenues up 7 per cent to Dollars 766m.
For the full year, Sprint reported net income of Dollars 457m, or Dollars
2.07 a share, compared with Dollars 368m, or Dollars 1.68, in 1991.
Revenues were up 5 per cent at Dollars 9.23bn.

<TEXT>
SOCIETE Generale has bought out the remaining 19.7 per cent of Societe
Generale Strauss Turnbull, the London-based securities house which it has
been trying to build into a broad-based trading, research and derivatives
firm.
The purchase, understood to have cost less than Pounds 4m, (Dollars 6.04m)
was described by SGST executives as part of a long-term move by the bank
progressively to take on full ownership of the firm. It did not signal any
change in direction, said Mr Paul Tisch, chief executive.
The bank's stake has grown since it first took 55 per cent of Strauss's
Eurobond arm in 1980. In the mid-1980s, it took the maximum permissible 29.9
per cent in the the firm's equity operation.
Mr Derek Strauss, son of Mr Ronald Strauss, one of the founders of the
original Strauss Turnbull partnership and himself holder of 5 per cent of
SGST, said he would remain with the firm .

POHANG Iron and Steel (Posco), the world's third-largest steel company,
yesterday reported that net earnings for 1992 rose by 27 per cent to
Won185.1bn (Dollars 230m).
The South Korean group's result was better than expected. Analysts had
predicted profits of Won150bn, while its own forecast was Won169bn.
Sales totalled Won6,180bn, an increase of 6 per cent.
Profits were boosted by a rationalisation programme to cut production costs
by Won160bn, increased sales of higher-valued steel products, and a fall in
raw material prices.
Analysts predict that Posco earnings could climb to Won220bn this year as
its capital costs shrink following the completion last year of its fourth
and final steel plant.
Posco, however, could have its exports to the US curtailed if Washington
decides to impose dumping duties in June. Its main export to the US is
hot-rolled steel sheets, which face a 30 per cent dumping penalty. The steel
is mainly delivered to UPI, a California-based 50-50 joint venture of Posco
and USX.

KOLBENSCHMIDT, the car components subsidiary of the Metallgesellschaft
group, may make losses until the end of 1994, the new chief executive
warned.
Mr Heinrich Binder said that the market for car suppliers had become more
difficult since the start of the new business year in October. In the year
to the end of September, group losses were DM90m (Dollars 56.9m) after
barely breaking even in the previous year.
He said the loss for the current year would not exceed last year's figure
and sales would be no less than the DM1.51bn achieved in 1991-92. Sales in
the first quarter rose 11 per cent to DM396m.
The company's air-bag and steering-wheel businesses were expected to do well
during the year, but all other operations would be put on short-time working
for six months.

FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: Tenneco moves back to the black

<TEXT>
TENNECO, the US conglomerate in the throes of restructuring, yesterday
reported fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 35m, compared with a net loss
of Dollars 26m in the same period of 1991. Operating performance was better
at all the group's six divisions, although its J. I. Case farm and
construction equipment business remained in the red.
The net income figure, which worked through at 21 cents a share, against a
loss of 24 cents a year ago, included an extraordinary loss of Dollars 12m,
while the 1991 period involved a Dollars 5m loss from discontinued
operations. Net income from continuing operations was Dollars 47m, compared
with a loss of Dollars 204m.
The company's improvement dates from the arrival of Mr Michael Walsh, who
took over as chief executive at the start of last year. Mr Walsh, who
revealed last month that he was suffering from a brain tumour, said the 1992
turnround was 'but the first phase of a long-term transformation of this
company'.
For the year as a whole the group produced net income of Dollars 292m, or
Dollars 1.92 a share, including a gain from discontinued operations of
Dollars 71m and a Dollars 12m extraordinary loss. In 1991, it lost Dollars
732m, or Dollars 6.09, including restructuring charges, gains on asset sales
and a Dollars 40m loss from discontinued operations.
The natural gas pipeline operations reported fourth-quarter operating income
of Dollars 111m, up from Dollars 99m, excluding a gain on asset sales. The
improvement was due to increased volumes, higher rates on the pipeline
system and cost controls.
Case narrowed its fourth-quarter loss to Dollars 94m, compared with a loss
of Dollars 227m in the same period of 1991, despite a 32 per cent cut in
production levels. The company attributed this to the fact it had stopped
being the industry's leading discounter, while also making continued cuts in
operating costs and headcount.

LTV, the steel group which has been operating under US bankruptcy court
protection since 1986, yesterday reported a fourth-quarter net loss of
Dollars 129m, compared with a net loss of Dollars 8.5m in the same period of
1991.
The increased loss was partly due to a Dollars 140m extraordinary charge for
LTV's estimated liability under a new law relating to retiree health
benefits in the coal industry. This was partly offset by a Dollars 60m
special credit. Sales totalled Dollars 947m, against Dollars 924m.
Fourth-quarter operating income was Dollars 13.4m, compared with a loss of
Dollars 70.3m in the same period of last year, with its steel business
losing Dollars 49.1m, against Dollars 54m a year ago.
For 1992 as a whole, LTV reported net income of Dollars 598.7m, compared
with Dollars 74.1m in 1991, thanks to a Dollars 737m gain on the sale of its
aerospace and defence business.

REEBOK International, the US sports shoe maker, yesterday announced
fourth-quarter profits from continuing operations of Dollars 49.8m,
unchanged from a year earlier.
However, the company took a previously-announced restructuring charge of
Dollars 135m in the final quarter which, along with a one-off gain of
Dollars 18m from the sale of stock in CML Group, left Reebok with a net loss
of Dollars 67.6m for the last three months of 1992.
For 1992, earnings before charges and special gains totalled Dollars 232.3m,
down slightly from the Dollars 234.7m earned in 1991.
Mr Paul Fireman, chairman and chief executive of Reebok, said he was pleased
with the company's overall performance in the fourth quarter, citing
increased sales of its Reebok brand both in the US and abroad, of its sports
apparel, and of its Rockport products.
However, sales of the Avia brand, fell 21 per cent in the quarter.

<TEXT>
SULZER, the Swiss engineering group, has cancelled the agreed sale of its
Thermtec valves and control systems division to IMI, the British industrial
group.
Sulzer said a 'material difference' arose between the two parties during the
negotiation, which began last September.
Thermtec, which makes precision components for fossil fuelled and nuclear
power plants, recorded annual sales of SFr80m (Dollars 52.71m) and is
profitable.
Sulzer said price was not the only factor. The Swiss company was seeking
'the most optimal environment' for the business, which meant preserving it
as a centre of excellence in Winterthur.
IMI said it was prevented by a non-disclosure agreement from commenting on
the abortive deal.

FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: Japan's Daihatsu in Malaysian
car joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MALAYSIA'S ambitious programme of industrialisation took a step forward
yesterday with the signing of a joint venture deal between Malaysian and
Japanese companies to build the country's second car plant.
Daihatsu Motor Company of Japan will build a 660cc mini-car in partnership
with three Malaysian partners and Mitsui, the Japanese industrial and
trading conglomerate. The initial cost of the project is put at MDollars
400m (USDollars 153m).
Malaysia already produces more than 100,000 Proton cars a year in a joint
venture with Mitsubishi of Japan.
Under the terms of the joint-venture agreement, Daihatsu will take a 20 per
cent stake in the project, the local Daihatsu distributor 5 per cent and
Mitsui, 7 per cent.
The Malaysian partners are the state-owned Permodalan Nasional - which
together with its listed subsidiary, UMW Holdings, will control 48 per cent
 -and Med-Bumikar Mara, a newly-formed Malay-controlled company, which will
have a 20 per cent stake.
The new car, to be based on the existing Daihatsu Mira model, will be built
at a plant now being constructed outside Kuala Lumpur.
The first car is scheduled to roll off the assembly line in mid-1994.
Initial production at the plant is put at 20,000 vehicles a year,
subsequently rising to 45,000 units.
As with the Proton, launched in the mid-1980s, the driving force behind the
new car project is Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister.
However, many question the need for a second national car, particularly at a
time when the Malaysian economy shows signs of slowing and sales of Protons
in the highly-protected domestic market are falling.
Dr Mahathir says the new car will provide a cheaper alternative to the
Proton. A standard Proton now costs about MDollars 33,000 on the domestic
market.
Malaysian officials say that the new car will be given various tax
incentives and protection - including exemption from duty of components
imported from Japan - and will not cost more than MDollars 24,000.
The future of the new car venture was in doubt for much of last year,
apparently due to Daihatsu's insistence that its executives fill important
management positions in the project.
At a signing ceremony yesterday, Mr Takashi Toyozumi, Daihatsu's president,
said his company was committed to transferring technology to its Malaysian
joint-venture partners.
Dr Mahathir is reported to have been dissatisfied at the slow rate of
technology transfer from Japan in the Proton car venture.

FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: Sharp increase in earnings at
Siam Commercial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIAM Commercial Bank has followed other Thai banks in announcing sharply
increased earnings for last year.
Net profits rose 56 per cent to Bt4.18bn (Dollars 163.7m) in 1992 from
Bt2.68bn a year before, while earnings per share rose to Bt109.51, from
Bt82.87.
Like all Thai banks, SCB has profited from the wide gap between deposit
rates and lending rates in Thailand, a phenomenon that the commercial banks
have collectively been able to sustain, in spite of quiet pressure from the
central bank to narrow the gap.
SCB's interest income rose 2 per cent last year, while its interest expense
fell by 13 per cent, resulting in net interest income growth of 49 per cent.
However, some brokers expressed disappointment that SCB's net interest
income as a proportion of average assets was 3.7 per cent, lower than that
of some of its competitors.

THAI Airways International, the partially-privatised national airline,
yesterday blamed higher costs and increasing competition for a sharp fall in
profits in the first quarter to December 31.
Thai announced that net profits fell to Bt120m (Dollars 4.7m) in the quarter
from Bt792.2m a year earlier.
In a statement to the Thai stock exchange, the airline said operating
expenses rose 8.32 per cent over the year, while yields were lower than
expected because the airline decided to maintain market share by lowering
fares on some routes. Thai said there was strong competition in Asia from
new airlines such as Eva and Aseana.
Thai said it would cut costs by suspending some investments which would not
affect earnings, and would introduce marketing strategies such as
frequent-flier programmes.

BANGKOK Land, the property developer which became the largest company on the
Thai stock exchange at its listing a year ago, has announced a 43 per cent
rise in consolidated net profits for the first nine months to Bt3.52bn
(Dollars 138m).
Profits in the third quarter to December 31 rose by 31 per cent to Bt1.25bn.
Oversupply has brought prices some Bangkok residential property prices down
but Bangkok Land has concentrated on the relatively buoyant low-cost housing
market.
The company is looking to projects in mainland China for some of its future
profits.

<TEXT>
THE Frankfurt airport authorities yesterday announced a recruitment freeze
until April 1 in an effort to cut labour costs and stem losses.
Mr Wilhelm Bender, who took over as president of Flughafen Frankfurt Main
last month, warned that the company's net loss for 1992 would be 'as high as
the previous year'. The airport recorded a DM29.4m (Dollars 18m) loss for
the fiscal year ending December 31 1991.
Mr Bender blamed mainly increasing labour costs, which accounted for 43 per
cent of the company's overall expenses in 1992.
'We are faced with a drastic erosion of our basic capital if we don't change
direction,' he said. He did not expect the airport to return to profits in
the near future.

<TEXT>
TENNECO, the US conglomerate in the throes of restructuring, yesterday
reported fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 35m, compared with a net loss
of Dollars 26m in the same period of 1991. Operating performance was better
at all the group's six divisions, although its J. I. Case farm and
construction equipment business remained in the red.
The net income figure, which worked through at 21 cents a share, against a
loss of 24 cents a year ago, included an extraordinary loss of Dollars 12m,
while the 1991 period involved a Dollars 5m loss from discontinued
operations. Net income from continuing operations was Dollars 47m, compared
with a loss of Dollars 204m, and revenues were 8 per cent lower at Dollars
3.3bn.
The company's improvement dates from the arrival of Mr Michael Walsh, who
took over as chief executive at the start of last year. Mr Walsh, who
revealed last month that he was suffering from a brain tumour, said the 1992
turnround was 'but the first phase of a long-term transformation of this
company'.
For the year as a whole the group produced net income of Dollars 292m, or
Dollars 1.92 a share, including a gain from discontinued operations of
Dollars 71m and a Dollars 12m extraordinary loss. In 1991, it lost Dollars
732m, or Dollars 6.09, including restructuring charges, gains on asset sales
and a Dollars 40m loss from discontinued operations.
The natural gas pipeline operations reported fourth-quarter operating income
of Dollars 111m, up from Dollars 99m, excluding a gain on asset sales. The
improvement was due to increased volumes, higher rates on the pipeline
system and cost controls. It expected another much improved year in 1993.
Case narrowed its fourth-quarter loss to Dollars 94m, compared with a loss
of Dollars 227m in the same period of 1991, despite a 32 per cent cut in
production levels. The company attributed this to the fact it had stopped
being the industry's leading discounter, while also making continued cuts in
operating costs and headcount.
It said it would cut production 18 per cent in the first quarter, compared
with the same period of 1992, to keep inventories in line with market
conditions, and expected a loss for the period. However, it aimed for Case
to at least break even for 1993 as a whole.
The automotive parts business tripled its operating income from Dollars 18m
to Dollars 54m in the quarter, while shipbuilding was up from Dollars 49m to
Dollars 61m, packaging from Dollars 21m to Dollars 64m, and chemicals made
Dollars 23m, against a Dollars 4m loss.

<TEXT>
COLES Myer and Woolworths, Australia's two leading retailers, both reported
increased interim sales and forecast profit improvements when they report in
March for their latest half-years.
Coles reported a 4.1 rise in per cent sales to ADollars 7.85bn (USDollars
5.3bn) for the six months to January 24.
Mr Peter Bartels, Coles Myer chief executive, said sales in the latest
quarter had risen 4.3 per cent, against an increase of just 1.4 per cent a
year earlier.
Coles' performance was again surpassed by its smaller rival, Woolworths,
which announced an 11.3 per cent rise in sales to ADollars 5.45bn in the 28
weeks to January 3.
Woolworths directors noted that the company's sales increase easily
surpassed that in national retail sales, which grew by about 5.3 per cent in
the period.
They said the company expected to surpass forecast earnings before interest
and tax of ADollars 272m for the 53 weeks to June 27.
BHP has further consolidated the refinancing of its complex investment in
Beswick, the vehicle which controls around 20 per cent of BHP's own capital.
BHP directors yesterday announced that Westpac Banking Corporation had
agreed to hold its 'B' redeemable preference shares in Beswick until October
1996, subject to a put-and-call arrangement.

FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: Matra-Hachette claims sound
profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MATRA-HACHETTE, the newly-created French media-to-missiles group, yesterday
reported that its divisions made a profit 'in the region of' FFr350m
(Dollars 63.3m) in 1992.
Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, the flamboyant president and controlling shareholder
of the group, forecast a rosy future for the merger, formalised last
December, which linked the Matra defence and transport business with the
Hachette publishing company.
He promised 'a very substantial increase' in profit this year. He forecast
that Matra-Hachette's turnover, which totalled FFr55bn last year, would rise
by an average annual 5 per cent to 1996, while profits would increase by 30
per cent a year over the same period.
'By 1996, at the latest, we will be making FFr1bn profit a year', he told a
press conference.
In its last year as a separate entity, Matra reported a FFr191m profit for
the first six months of 1992.
For its part, Hachette, weighed down by the collapse of La Cinq television
station, which was wound up last November, recorded a FFr39m loss over the
same period.
Conceding his mistaken venture into TV, Mr Lagadere yesterday prided himself
and his team on the speedy merger, which takes the unusual form of a
'societe commandite par actions'. It entails other shareholders delegating
considerable responsibility to Mr Lagardere who, in return, carries
unlimited personal liability.
Mr Lagardere claimed that, despite past problems with La Cinq,
Matra-Hachette was not starting married life with a millstone of debt around
its corporate neck.
Without counting its convertible bonds, it had FFr7bn in funds and a net
debt of FFr3bn, he said. The new group was able to generate a cash-flow -
after paying for investments and dividends - of FFr3.8bn a year and would be
able to repay an average FFr900m a year in debt, he said.
Mr Lagardere bridled at the description of his group as a conglomerate,
saying this implied it would be constantly buying, selling and shifting
activity in search of maximum capital gains. He stressed that, instead, the
group's nine divisions were all in 'solid areas' - defence, space, telecoms,
rail transport, cars, newspapers, books, distribution, and audiovisual.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEPSICO, the US soft drinks, snacks, and fast-food restaurant group,
yesterday reported an underlying 21 per cent increase in after-tax profits
to Dollars 1.4bn in 1992, before including charges related to accounting
changes and other one-off items.
The company said that earnings per share - on a similar basis - were up by
one-fifth at Dollars 1.80, and that the improvements were achieved on a 14
per cent increase in sales, to Dollars 22bn.
The bottom-line figures, after taking in the one-off items, paint a very
different picture, however.
After taking account of a Dollars 195.5m restructuring charge and almost
Dollars 400m for the adoption of the new accounting standard on non-pension
retirement benefits, after-tax profits fell from Dollars 1.08bn to Dollars
374.3m in 1992.
PepsiCo said that it was encouraged by the underlying figures, with all
three divisions recording double-digit growth in 'ongoing' profits.
'Our domestic beverage division is being completely restructured,' noted Mr
Wayne Calloway, PepsiCo chairman, 'and our aggressive acquisition activity,
over 50 (acquisitions) in all, is doing a lot to expand and strengthen our
core businesses.'
On the New York Stock Exchange, PepsiCo shares were down Dollars  1/2 at
Dollars 41 3/4 before the close.

FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: Suppliers keep calm over Daf's
problems - The belief that the truckmaker might not disappear completely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE decision by Daf, the Anglo-Dutch truck and van manufacturer, to seek
protection from its creditors caused some confusion and mixed reactions
among European suppliers of a wide variety of components.
As union officials in the UK warned that jobs in the component supply
industry could be at risk, some suppliers immediately halted deliveries to
Leyland Daf in the UK, bringing production at its factories in Preston and
Birmingham almost to a halt.
But companies generally reacted calmly over the long-term implications of
the decision - even if they did halt supplies yesterday. While big
automotive customers worldwide have been reducing the number of suppliers
with which they deal, the suppliers have also been careful, where possible,
to avoid being too dependent on any one client.
Ultimately, the importance of Daf and its market position - it is truck
market leader in the UK with a 25 per cent share - has convinced some
suppliers that the company and its truck manufacturing will not disappear.
'I can't believe a package won't be put together to retain the most
successful parts of the business,' said one international supplier.
Companieswhich continued deliveries to Daf explained their action by saying
either that the immediate future of manufacturing at the truck maker was
unclear or that they were not in a position to halt supplies because of
their own problems in the recession.
One of Daf's most important suppliers, Thyssen Stahl, said it was continuing
to make deliveries to Daf in the Netherlands. 'We have no plan to stop being
a supplier,' said a spokesman for Germany's biggest steel producer. 'I can't
imagine that any steel company could do that at the moment.'
Daf, in comparison with other truckmakers, is a relatively integrated
producer, with a big share of components made in-house. 'Its policy tends to
be 'make' rather than 'buy',' said Mr Edward Hadas of Morgan Stanley.
Daf makes most of its engines itself, although engines for its 45 Series of
small trucks are supplied by US-owned Cummins Engine, and Peugeot-Talbot
make diesel engines for Daf vans. Peterborough-based Perkins also makes
engines for the 200 Series van, and Eagle engines for the Daf 'Drops'
military vehicle.
Transmissions come largely from ZF, the big German producer, while axles are
mainly made in-house at Glasgow and at Westerlo, Belgium.
Cabs for its UK-built light truck are supplied by Motor Panels, a
long-established UK supplier of automotive bodies, which is part of the
Mayflower Corporation, a UK holding company. Cabs for its medium and heavy
trucks are made in-house in Belgium. Other leading suppliers to Leyland Daf
include GKN, the big UK vehicle parts group, which supplies drive-line
components for trucks, as well as some axles.
There are also smaller component suppliers serving Daf's manufacturing
plants, such as Washwood Heath in east Birmingham.
Suppliers were yesterday deciding on the best immediate steps to take. At
Motor Panels, deliveries have been suspended until the situation is
clarified, said Mr Merrick Taylor, chairman of Mayflower's Automotive
Products Group.
He could not envisage a situation where Daf would just disappear. 'People
will be keen to pick up parts of the business. To have such a large share in
a very important market is very attractive.'
Cummins, which makes Daf-badged engines for the 45 Series at Darlington,
said Leyland Daf was a 'fairly major' customer in the automotive area. But
Cummins pointed out that the impact of Daf's decision was not quite the same
for a broadly-based supplier, such as Cummins, as for companies that served
only the automotive industry.

<TEXT>
BANCO Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), Spain's biggest private bank, yesterday reported
a 19.9 per cent drop in net profits for 1992 but will increase its dividend
because of an improvement in its core banking business.
BBV blamed the lowered profits of Pta81.1bn (Dollars 71m), against
Pta101.2bn in 1991, on a 42 per cent drop in extraordinary income. The bank
earned Pta70.4bn through non-banking business in 1991, chiefly through the
disposal of two subsidiaries. However, this fell to Pta40.2bn last year.
Mr Emilio Ybarra, BBV chairman, justified a Pta6 increase in the dividend to
Pt169 per share on account of an improvement in the bank's operating profit,
which rose 11.1 per cent to Pta136bn, and its ordinary profit, up 8.6 per
cent to Pta74.2bn.

<TEXT>
MR BERNARD Tapie, the controversial French industrialist and politician, is
on the verge of concluding a deal to sell his controlling stake in Adidas,
the German sporting goods group, to a consortium of investors led by Mr
Robert Louis-Dreyfus, chief executive of the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi advertising
group.
The consortium, which also includes Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, and
Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the insurance company, is expected
within the next few days to finalise negotiations to buy Mr Tapie's 78 per
cent stake in BTF, the German holding company that owns 95 per cent of
Adidas, according to a report in that appears in today's edition of Les
Echos, the French financial newspaper.
Mr Tapie, who recently returned to the French cabinet following the collapse
of a fraud case, has for months been trying to sell his Adidas stake to
reduce the debts of Bernard Tapie Finance, his holding company.
An earlier attempt to sell the stake to Pentland, the UK consumer products
company, collapsed last year.
Last autumn, Mr Tapie instructed Credit Lyonnais to sell the BTF shares for
FFr2.08bn.
Les Echos suggests that Credit Lyonnais, AGF and Banque Worms, another
French bank, will raise their current combined 20 per cent stake in BTF with
Mr Louis-Dreyfus taking between 3 per cent and 7 per cent of the shares.
Mr Louis-Dreyfus, the heir to a French banking fortune, made his name in the
business world as chief executive of Saatchi where he orchestrated a
financial restructuring that saved the group from collapse. He announced
last year that he was leaving Saatchi in mid-1993 to pursue new interests.

RJR NABISCO, the tobacco and food conglomerate which was the target of a
Dollars 25bn leveraged buy-out in 1989, yesterday reported a small decline
in operating profits during 1992. However, the after-tax figure, ahead of
extraordinary items, increased sharply, thanks to lower financing charges.
At the operating level, the group made a profit of Dollars 2.9bn, compared
with Dollars 2.93bn in 1991. The fourth-quarter figure was Dollars 703m,
against Dollars 752m in the same period of the previous year. Total sales
for the year were Dollars 15.7bn, up from Dollars 14.9bn.
RJR added that domestic tobacco volume rose 3 per cent during the year,
increasing market share, although there was a 2 per cent decline in the
final quarter.
The tobacco division made slightly lower profits, of Dollars 2.69bn for the
year against Dollars 2.73bn last time, while the food division's
contribution increased to Dollars 947m from Dollars 920m.
Tobacco sales were Dollars 6.16bn, up from Dollars 5.86bn on the domestic
side, and Dollars 2.86bn compared with Dollars 2.68bn on the international
front. Food sales rose to Dollars 6.71bn from Dollars 6.45bn.
The refinancing of RJR's debt burden - encompassing over Dollars 3bn of
borrowings in 1992 - helped reduce cash interest expense to Dollars 995m
from Dollars 1.326bn, and non-cash interest expense to Dollars 434m from
Dollars 787m.
This left net income before extraordinary items at Dollars 776m compared
with Dollars 368m.
After a Dollars 477m charge the group's net profits for the year fell to
Dollars 299m from Dollars 368m.

CKD, one of the Czech Republic's biggest companies, needed an injection of
Kcs1.3m (Dollars 45m) in capital if it was to avoid closing several
subsidiaries with the loss of 5,000 jobs, Mr Jan Havelka, the general
director, said yesterday.
The company, which makes railway engines, trams, diesel generators for power
plants,; produces steel, electrical engineering equipment and motor parts,
has seen the collapse of its main markets in the former Comecon trade bloc.
The company is being privatised, but plans for a joint venture to make
transport equipment with ADG of Germany and Secheron of France with
investments of DM200m (Dollars 126.5m) will have to be abandoned if CKD is
not provided with the necessary finance.

FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: BBL French unit loses FFr540m

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANQUE Bruxelles Lambert, one of Belgium's biggest banks, revealed yesterday
that its French subsidiary lost FFr540m (Dollars 100.74m) in 1992.
BBL said the loss was principally related to provisions made against French
property loans. The French banking sector is under pressure because of the
economic slowdown and the squeeze on the French property market.
As part of a restructuring, the Belgian group is planning to cut 139 jobs
out of 462 at BBL France, and relocate to rented premises in the Defense
commercial area of Paris.
BBL has ploughed some FFr700m into its French subsidiary over the last year
to help meet solvency ratios through a capital increase in April.
The Belgian bank said it had anticipated the losses at its French
subsidiary. In November, BBL announced non-consolidated group profits for
the 12 months to end-September of BFr2.8bn (Dollars 84m), sharply lower than
the equivalent period. Consolidated figures for the 15 months to the end of
1992 will be announced early next month.
French property prices have been falling for the past three years. Average
rentals in Paris, the worst affected area, have declined by 20 per cent over
that period.
The problems are most acute in the commercial sector. There is now estimated
to be two years of commercial property stock on the Paris market.

<TEXT>
BANCO Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), Spain's biggest private bank, yesterday reported
a 19.9 per cent drop in net profits for 1992 but will increase its dividend
because of an improvement in its core banking business.
BBV blamed the lowered profits of Pta81.1bn (Dollars 71m), against
Pta101.2bn in 1991, on a 42 per cent drop in extraordinary income.
The bank earned Pta70.4bn through non-banking business in 1991, chiefly
through the disposal of two subsidiaries. However, this fell to Pta40.2bn
last year.
Mr Emilio Ybarra, BBV chairman, justified a Pta6 increase in the dividend to
Pt169 per share on account of 'a tremendous improvement' in the bank's
operating profit, which rose 11.1 per cent to Pta136bn, and its ordinary
profit, up 8.6 per cent to Pta74.2bn.
BBV raised its provisions for writedowns and bad debts by 47.6 per cent to
Pta55.8bn.
He said the bank had put behind it the problems of its foundation merger in
1988 between Banco Bilbao and Banco Vizcaya and said it was on line for
sustained growth.
Last year, the BBV group increased its share of the banking sector's
deposits and other borrowed funds by 1.25 per cent to 14.29 per cent. Bad
debts grew 15.7 per cent against an average of 50 per cent in doubtful loans
for the Spanish financial sector as a whole.
Operating expenses declined by 2.3 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RJR NABISCO, the tobacco and food conglomerate which was the target of a
Dollars 25bn leveraged buy-out in 1989, yesterday reported a small decline
in operating profits during 1992. However, the after-tax figure, ahead of
extraordinary items, increased sharply, thanks to lower financing charges.
At the operating level, the group made a profit of Dollars 2.9bn, compared
with Dollars 2.93bn in 1991. The fourth-quarter figure was Dollars 703m,
against Dollars 752m in the same period of the previous year. Total sales
for the year were Dollars 15.7bn, up from Dollars 14.9bn.
RJR added that domestic tobacco volume rose 3 per cent during the year,
increasing market share, although there was a 2 per cent decline in the
final quarter.
The tobacco division made slightly lower profits, of Dollars 2.69bn for the
year against Dollars 2.73bn last time, while the food division's
contribution increased to Dollars 947m from Dollars 920m.
Tobacco sales were Dollars 6.16bn, up from Dollars 5.86bn on the domestic
side, and Dollars 2.86bn compared with Dollars 2.68bn on the international
front. Food sales rose to Dollars 6.71bn from Dollars 6.45bn.
The refinancing of RJR's debt burden - encompassing over Dollars 3bn of
borrowings in 1992 - helped reduce cash interest expense to Dollars 995m
from Dollars 1.326bn, and non-cash interest expense to Dollars 434m from
Dollars 787m.
This left net income before extraordinary items at Dollars 776m compared
with Dollars 368m.
After a Dollars 477m charge related to the repurchase and retirement of
higher-cost debt instruments, the group's net profits for the year fell to
Dollars 299m from Dollars 368m.

FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Shareholders approve Pepe rescue measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIONS to try to safeguard the future of Pepe Group, the jeans designer and
distributor, have been approved by shareholders. As a result the USM
quotation has been cancelled.
Under the open offer of 199.9m shares to raise Pounds 9.1m, applications
were received in respect just over 1m shares or 0.5 per cent. The offer was
underwritten by SML, a company set up by its new management and Novel, the
Hong Kong textile group, which now has a controlling interest.
SML has an inventive option to buy up to 75 per cent of Pepe's equity if and
when the company's market capitalisation reaches Pounds 118m. A Dollars 25m
(Pounds 16.5m) global advertising campaign will be launched.
The provision of Pounds 35m of new banking facilities, which were
conditional on the approval, have been agreed.
The new management consists of Mr Silas Chou, who became chairman when Novel
acquired 29.6 per cent of Pepe in March last year and Mr Lawrence Stroll, a
director of Tommy Hilfiger, the US clothes group, as chief executive
officer. Mr Maurice Marciano, former president of Guess Jeans, is vice
chairman and chief executive officer (Americas). Mr Arun Shah, who founded
Pepe, stays on the board as an executive director.

A sharp drop in sales in November and December, plus further substantial
provisions against the cost of withdrawing from property development, pushed
Eleco Holdings into a loss of Pounds 2.21m for the six months to end-1992.
Directors said current trading was showing some improvement over last year.
Sales fell to Pounds 23.6m (Pounds 26.4m). After provision of Pounds 1.4m
(Pounds 649,000) the loss compared with a restated profit of Pounds 513,000.
Losses came to 7.5p (earnings 2.6p). The interim dividend is omitted (2.3p).

An offer for Graig Shipping from Idwal Williams has been rejected by
independent directors as not reflecting sufficiently the true value of the
company.
They are not able to recommend it to shareholders, but discussions are
continuing. They were advised by Close Brothers.
Idwal Williams owns 50.45 per cent of the ordinary and 5.96 per cent of the
A non-voting shares in Graig, and also manages its shipping and investment
activities.
It has offered 125p cash for the ordinary and 120p for the A, which
represented premiums of 67 per cent and 62 per cent respectively over the
share prices prevailing immediately prior to the announcement of an approach
in early December.
Yesterday the ordinary shares lost 9p to 129p while the A dropped 14p to
124p.

FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Armitage shakes off sales decline
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Continuing tight control on costs and cash flow enabled Armitage Bros, the
pet foods group, to hold pre-tax profits in the 28 weeks to December 13.
On sales reduced from Pounds 13.1m to Pounds 12.9m, profit came to Pounds
715,000, compared with Pounds 712,000. Net interest charges were cut to
Pounds 69,000 (Pounds 122,000).
Mr Russell Taylor, chief executive, explained that consumers spent less and
traded down on pet accessories and Christmas goods. Exports generally, and
home sales of Wafcol dog food in particular, performed well.
The UK market remained sluggish but there was the opportunity to build on
export performance through the devaluation of sterling.
Last year's tax charge benefited from a substantial credit, so this time
earnings per share were down from 13.4p to 11.9p. The interim dividend is
again 2.6p.

FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Heiton warns on second half
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HEITON Holdings, the Dublin-based steel and builders' merchants, and
Atlantic Homecare DIY retailer, reported a 15 per cent improvement in
interim profits but warned on prospects for the second half.
Effects of the currency crisis and extraordinarily high interest rates would
have their impact, said Mr Diarmuid Quirke, chairman.
Investment projects were being deferred and consumer spending would be
affected until interest rates returned to levels at which investment could
be justified and mortgage repayments were at more manageable levels.
For the six months ended October 31 the core businesses improved their
trading performances to produce total sales of IPounds 30.1m (IPounds 29.7m)
and a pre-tax profit of IPounds 945,000 (IPounds 820,000). In sterling terms
turnover was Pounds 30.8m and profit Pounds 967,000.
Earnings per share worked through at 1.9p (1.75p) and the interim dividend
is again 0.65p.

FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Property still a problem for restructured
Miskin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP cut in interest payable and lower exceptional charges helped Miskin
Group, the USM-quoted construction company, report much-reduced annual
losses for the 12 months to July 31.
Losses before tax were Pounds 2.19m, against Pounds 7.36m in the previous 18
month period, struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 532,000 (Pounds
4.62m) relating to property write-downs. Interest payable was Pounds 709,000
(Pounds 1.81m).
Turnover, reflecting the sale of Laing Demolition and Nirimba Roofing &amp;
Insulation, dropped from Pounds 19.6m to Pounds 10.6m.
The two businesses incurred losses of Pounds 961,562 and Pounds 59,083
respectively over the year.
Mr Jeffrey Goodman, chairman, said the main core business had returned a
modest profit of Pounds 4,812 pre-tax against losses of Pounds 1.04m last
time, while the tool hire side, now reorganised, turned a deficit of Pounds
44,623 into pre-tax profits of Pounds 9,299.
The group's property assets, however, were proving difficult to sell, he
said.
'The reduction of the stock of properties is currently a priority, as
without this involvement and costs thereof, the trading subsidiaries would
appear able to bring the group back into profit.'
There is again no dividend; the last payment was in 1990.

FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Hoping to put profits on the line -
Binatone's plans will bring it into competition with Amstrad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BINATONE Electronics, the privately-owned electronics group run by Mr Gulu
Lalvani, is poised to broaden its product range and compete directly for the
first time with companies like Philips and Amstrad in Europe's consumer
electronics market.
Binatone, founded by Mr Lalvani and his brother in 1958, became the UK's
leading importer of transistor radios in the 1960s. It has grown into an
international group with headquarters in Hong Kong and annual sales of
between Pounds 60m and Pounds 80m focused on audio equipment and more
recently on the UK market for consumer telephone equipment.
Now Mr Lalvani has positioned his group to gain a larger share of the fast
growing market in continental Europe for consumer telephone equipment, while
expanding its product range to include satellite television, facsimile and
video equipment.
One immediate consequence of this growth strategy is that the friendly
rivalry between Mr Lalvani and Mr Alan Sugar, Amstrad's chairman, who was
given his first business break by Asian-born Mr Lalvani, has become more
strained.
This was highlighted last month by the surprise announcement that Mr Robert
Watkins, Amstrad's technical and manufacturing director and a key Sugar
aide, was joining Binatone as group managing director.
Mr Watkins helped develop many of the products which fuelled Amstrad's
success in the 1980s. At Binatone he will be responsible for UK and Hong
Kong operations.
His first task has been to complete a business review and work out a
strategy for taking Binatone from corded telephones and expanding into
cordless telephones and then into satellite systems.
In the first year he expects to increase sales by 50 per cent and launch
Binatone into 'three or four new product areas', beginning with a
high-specification low-price cordless telephone due in September.
Binatone's design and marketing expertise coupled with its low cost
manufacturing base in the Far East should give it a advantage over many of
its competitors.
In the UK it has been targeting the consumer telephone business for more
than two years and has an annual turnover of about Pounds 20m.
Binatone has captured an unrivalled 30 per cent market share under its
Binatone and Dialatron brands. It also supplies equipment which is re-badged
and sold by other companies such as BT. Most of its products are made in
Hong Kong and southern China.
The timing of its drive into broader markets in Europe is critical. The
advent of the single market presented new business opportunities, as has the
steady deregulation of markets like telecommunications.
Meanwhile, many local competitors, including Philips and Amstrad, have seen
their consumer electronics business hit hard by competition from
manufacturers in Japan and the Far East.
Amstrad in particular appears to be drifting following last month's abortive
attempt by Mr Sugar to buy-out his fellow shareholders for 30p a share.
However, during the attempt it became clear that Mr Sugar, who said he had
run out of 'blockbuster' product ideas for Amstrad, also saw the market for
consumer telecommunications equipment as a potential growth area.
Amstrad already manufactures facsimile machines for domestic and small
business use and is developing a videophone product with GEC Marconi.
A determined push into the telecommunications equipment market would come
through Betacom, the separately-quoted UK-based consumer telephone equipment
company which became a Amstrad subsidiary last year.
Mr Sugar has described Betacom, which has a modest Pounds 13.7m market
capitalisation, as Amstrad's telephone arm. He has moved quickly to
consolidate his grip over the loss-making company which has been run by Mr
Ken Ashcroft, Amstrad's former corporate finance director, since last July.
Mr Ashcroft has instigated a rationalisation of Betacom's product range and
refocused its business on the UK market. One consequence of Amstrad's
ownership is that its 49 per cent stake in Loewe Betacom, a profitable
German joint-venture, was put on the auction block. In November it was
acquired by Binatone for about Pounds 1.8m.
The joint venture, in which BMW and Mitsubishi are its partners, was founded
in 1990 with the aim of supplying equipment to the newly-liberalised German
telephone market.
In its first full year of business sales reached a profitable DM20m (Pounds
8.4m) and during the first 10 months of last year it increased its share of
the German market to 10 per cent with a 50 per cent increase in sales.
The joint venture is an important plank in Binatone's new European strategy.
Mr Lalvani believes there is substantial growth potential in the German
market itself, and that Binatone will be able to apply the lessons it has
learned from the deregulation of the UK market.
He also sees the renamed Loewe Binatone as a springboard for telephone
equipment sales across continental Europe where telecommunications
liberalisation is expected to fuel a fast growing consumer equipment market.
In the UK the telephone equipment market is one of the few areas of the
economy to have shown growth in both volume and value throughout the
recession. Sales of telephone answering machines, for example, increased by
30 per cent last year and Binatone more than doubled its sales.
This year Binatone will concentrate on boosting cordless phone sales in the
UK. However, there is little doubt that the UK market for consumer telephone
equipment, worth Pounds 158m at end of 1991, is maturing and margins are
growing thinner. Over the next three to five years the best growth prospects
for may well lie in continental Europe.
If so Amstrad, the share price of which is languishing around 25p, and
Betacom, the price of which has climbed back to 17 1/2 p recently having
fallen to a low of 13 1/2 p in October, may have to reconsider their
strategy yet again.
By that stage investors could have another choice. Mr Lalvani said he would
consider bringing Binatone to the market once the recession is over.

FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Johnson Matthey share sale details soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DETAILS OF the sale of Pounds 250m-worth of shares in Johnson Matthey, the
platinum marketing company, by the Charter Consolidated conglomerate are
likely to be made known next week.
A clue to the timing came when Johannesburg Consolidated Investment, the
South African mining finance house which is widely expected to play a
crucial role, possibly by buying 29.9 per cent of JM postponed the
announcement of its annual results.
JCI said the board meeting at which the figures were to be approved would be
held 'towards the end of next week' because that would be more convenient.
All the companies are perceived by the investment community to be part of an
extended 'family' controlled by the Anglo American Corporation of South
Africa. Analysts suggested that, while Anglo might be willing to see Charter
cut adrift, it would want to maintain an influence over JM.
Anglo and its sister organisation, De Beers, between them own more than 60
per cent of Minorco, the group's Luxembourg-quoted offshore investment arm,
and Minorco owns 36 per cent of Charter.
Mr Jeff Herbert, Charter's managing director, has dismissed analysts'
suggestions that his relationship with the former Minorco management was
strained and had contributed to his desire for Charter to sell its 38.4 per
cent of JM . He said that the working relationship between Charter and
Minorco had always been 'excellent' and that the two former joint managing
directors of Minorco, Mr Tony Lea and Mr Roger Phillimore, had become his
personal friends.

FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Write-downs could top Pounds 1bn - Size of
contractors' provisions may undermine recovery financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S 10 biggest construction companies are expected to announce
provisions of between Pounds 650m and Pounds 700m when they publish annual
results later this year, according to latest City forecasts.
Warburg Securities and Barclays de Zoete Bevan say the scale of the
provisions, following substantial write-downs last year and in 1990, could
seriously undermine the ability of some companies to raise capital to
finance a recovery.
Total provisions from the sector may top Pounds 1bn when write-downs from
small and medium housebuilders and construction companies are included.
The biggest provision, totalling Pounds 250m, is expected to be made by
Tarmac's construction, property and housing operations.
Wimpey, following warnings issued by the company last month, is expected to
make provisions of Pounds 120m. Taylor Woodrow is expected by both brokers
to make write-downs of about Pounds 65m.
Costain, Amec and Trafalgar House are also forecast to make sizeable
provisions.
The findings provide further bad news for banks which lent large sums in the
late 1980s to finance commercial property and housing developments which in
some cases have fallen below the value of the original loan.
Mr Mark Stockdale, construction analyst for Warburg, said: 'The bulk of the
provisions this time are likely to be against commercial property
developments. This compares with previous years when companies mainly were
writing down housing developments.'
He estimated that the top 20 builders in the four years between 1989 and
1992 between them wrote-off Pounds 800m from the book value of housing land
and developments.
Mr Amarjit Chhina, construction analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said:
'The provisions will make already damaged balance sheets even weaker. It
will make plans for any refinancing even more difficult.'
Construction companies, he says, will need cash to replenish housing stocks
and land banks as the housing market starts to pick up.
Banks, however, may be reluctant to lend more to operations which have
already seen their book value reduced by many millions of pounds as property
and housing prices have fallen sharply.
Shareholders, for the same reason, may be reluctant to support a rights
issue particularly for those construction companies which had issues in
1991, ostensibly to finance a recovery. In many cases this money has been
used to offset cash losses and reduce borrowings.
Construction companies will also find it difficult to use their contracting
operations to generate cash with UK construction output forecast to fall by
a further 2 per cent this year following falls of 6 per cent and 9 per cent
in the two previous years.

FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Medeva enters Europe with French
acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEDEVA, the pharmaceutical company, yesterday announced the acquisition of
Institut de Recherche Corbiere, a French company that distributes a range of
ethical products.
The acquisition is Medeva's first in Europe and will provide a platform and
a sales force for the launch of other products.
Medeva is paying FFr93.8m (Pounds 11.6m) - FFr40m immediately in cash with
the balance payable after a year. IRC shareholders have the option to
receive 81 per cent of this balance in Medeva shares.
In addition Medeva is paying FFr16.3m over five years in bonuses and
possible performance fees to directors and the sales force.
Mr David Lees, finance director, said IRC directors would be able to help
Medeva with registration of its flu vaccine in France. The vaccine, once
registered, would be sold through the existing sales force to general
practitioners.
This could open up a market, worth about Pounds 40m a year, which is
overwhelmingly dominated by Institut Mereire.
Based in Paris, IRC has 67 employees, and had sales of FFr50m in the year to
end-December 1991. That year it lost FFr4.74m after bearing the cost of
building the sales force.
Medeva said it expected IRC to be profitable and to enhance earnings in
1993.
Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith, chief executive, said the deal was consistent with the
strategy of expanding the product range through acquisition and
internationalising the group's activities.

FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Northern Rock climbs 37% to Pounds 74.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Rock Building Society, the 11th largest building society, yesterday
announced a 37 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 54.6m to Pounds
74.7m, in the year to December 31.
The society's strong pre-tax performance in the year was partly offset by an
extraordinary loss of Pounds 5.7m from the sale of its Northern Rock
Property Services estate agency chain, as goodwill previously written off
was credited to reserves.
Profits after the extraordinary item and tax rose 22 per cent to Pounds
44.7m (Pounds 36.6m). This followed the takeover of the Lancastrian Building
Society, which contributed 6 per cent to a 36 per cent rise in assets to
Pounds 6bn (Pounds 4.4bn).
Mr Christopher Sharp, managing director, said he believed Northern Rock's
perfor-mance would prove exceptionally strong among the larger societies.
However, he thought societies would in general report good results for the
year.
Mr Sharp said that 60 per cent of the society's provision of Pounds 12.5m
(Pounds 6m) for possible bad debts during the year related to the
Lancastrian's Pounds 25m commercial property lending book, which was now
heavily provisioned.
He said that the Lancastrian's 'sound' Pounds 230m portfolio of residential
mortgage lending, and its 10 branches would bring in a regular annual income
of between Pounds 4m and Pounds 5m.
Northern Rock's overall mortgage balances rose 34 per cent to Pounds 5bn
(Pounds 3.7bn) and its net intake of retail funds rose 45 per cent to Pounds
914m (Pounds 636m). Mr Sharp said the inflow was helped by a postal saving
account launched during the year.
The ratio of costs to total income fell by a fifth to 38 per cent, largely
because of the rapid growth in assets while costs were contained. The ratio
of management expenses to mean assets fell by a quarter to 1.04 per cent.

FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Increased research leaves Celltech losses
higher at Pounds 7.46m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX losses at Celltech, the biotechnology group which plans to float in
the 1993-94 year, grew from Pounds 6.58m to Pounds 7.46m in the 12 months to
September 30, as investment in research and development rose 13 per cent
from Pounds 10.6m to Pounds 12m.
Operating losses declined to Pounds 9.32m (Pounds 9.45m) but interest
receivable fell to Pounds 1.85m (Pounds 2.87m), as cash reserves shrank to
Pounds 16m (Pounds 23.8m). In the current year net cash outflow is expected
to amount to about Pounds 7.8m.
Mr Peter Fellner, chief executive, said Celltech had had 'a successful
year'. He added that it had achieved important advances in the R&amp;D
programmes and in the alliances with pharmaceutical partners.
The company received milestone payments of Pounds 2m as the first tranches
in the Pounds 26m agreement with Bayer, the German pharmaceutical group.
Celltech's collaboration with American Cyanamid for the development of
antibodies to treat cancer was extended, and an agreement was recently
announced with Schering-Plough to develop and commercialise recombinant
antibodies to cytokines.
Turnover declined to Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 17m) and the operating profits
from Celltech Biologics rose to Pounds 518,000 (Pounds 468,000). CB's
manufacturing capability is to be expanded with a new facility in New
Hampshire, which will finance the construction through the issue of Pounds
16.2m of state guaranteed bonds.

FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Halved interest charge helps Adscene rise
by 31% to Pounds 946,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HALVING of interest payable from Pounds 303,000 to Pounds 127,000 helped
Adscene Group, the Canterbury-based newspaper publisher, lift pre-tax
profits by 31 per cent in the 26 weeks to November 28 1992.
The rise to Pounds 946,000 (Pounds 720,000) was struck on turnover down by
almost Pounds 1m at Pounds 7.11m. Operating profits edged ahead to Pounds
1.07m (Pounds 1.02m).
Mr Harry Lambert, chairman, said that, over the half, group borrowings were
reduced from Pounds 3m to Pounds 2m, accounting for the decline in the
interest charge. Borrowings would fall further in the second half.
The 12 per cent decline in group turnover was due to the 41 per cent
downturn on the printing side, Mr Lambert said, because certain low margin
contracts were deli-berately lost. The division's contribution rose 8 per
cent.
On the publishing side, total advertising revenue slipped 2 per cent - it
was up 3 per cent in Kent, but fell 7 per cent in both London and
Lincolnshire, the group's other regions. Operating profits in the division
rose 4 per cent, largely because cover prices for the paid-for newspapers
rose 10 per cent.
In Kent, where all Adscene's newspapers are free, adver-tising rates were
reduced, though market share was increased.
The interim dividend is lifted to 1.8p (1.5p), payable from earnings of
4.54p (3.01p) per share.

FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: YRM incurs deficit of Pounds 498,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YRM, the architectural group, yesterday announced a pre-tax loss and a cut
in the interim dividend in line with its warning in November.
For the six months to October 31 the pre-tax deficit was Pounds 498,000 on
turnover of Pounds 7.89m, compared with a profit of Pounds 534,000 on sales
of Pounds 10.2m.
The interim dividend is 0.5p (1.65p) - the directors, who control 47 per
cent of the shares, have waived their entitlement reducing the cost to
Pounds 35,000 (Pounds 218,000).
Losses per share worked through at 2.78p (earnings 2.54p).
Mr Tim Poulson, chief executive, blamed fierce competition in a much reduced
construction market for the setback. This had led to a sharp reduction in
the level of architects fees, damaging margins.
Losses included redundancy costs of Pounds 282,000 (Pounds 337,000); the
labour force during the past three years has been halved to 300.
Mr Poulson said the savings in overheads, together with rents from surplus
office space which had been sub-let, should put the group back in profit in
the second half.
Even so, analysts expect losses for the year to be about Pounds 400,000. Mr
Poulson said the group still hoped to pay a final dividend but would not
make a decision until nearer the time.
Last year the final was cut from 3.35p to 2.35p, reducing the total from 5p
to 4p.
The group saw little prospect of an improvement in the UK during the next 12
months. It said British clients had been slow to commission work in the
first half. A number of projects which were expected to start had been
delayed although some were now proceeding.
Reduction in UK commissions had been offset partially by a rise in overseas
work. International commissions during the first half were almost equivalent
to those won during the whole of the previous 12 months.
The Paris office, opened only two years ago, had won commissions from Air
France and the French government.
The Berlin office, started last year, had secured its first substantial
commission for the refurbishment of 13 hotels in eastern Germany.
Net debt at the end of October was Pounds 1.4m, equivalent to 15 per cent of
shareholders funds. Gearing was expected to remain at that level at the
year-end, said Mr Poulson.

FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: SE criticised over plan to close USM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICE Waterhouse yesterday criticised the Stock Exchange's proposal to close
the Unlisted Securities Market and warned that as the economy recovers 'the
case for a second market will re-emerge'.
In a survey on the future of USM companies the firm said recovery would
revive demand for smaller companies.
'The USM itself was the product of an expanding economy,' the report states.
'The Stock Exchange's proposal . . . comes at a low point in the USM's 12
year history.'
It was regrettable, the report continues, that the Exchange had rejected
proposals to relaunch the USM 'with sufficient distinction and identity to
provide an alternative market'.
Some 53 per cent of the 95 companies which responded to the survey - out of
a total of 278 - were concerned about the potential closure of the USM.
About 40 per cent said they welcomed the changes.
Price Waterhouse noted, however, that those which welcomed the changes were
largely longer-established USM companies. This suggested they had possibly
outlived the USM and were more prepared for a main market listing.
Most companies were in favour of a second market - 55 per cent as opposed to
45 per cent against.
Price Waterhouse said that experience had shown a main market listing would
not necessarily answer problems of marketability.
The report also noted the concern of smaller companies about the possible
loss of Inheritance Tax benefits in any transition to the Official List.
More than 70 per cent considered the loss of such tax relief to be a
significant obstacle.
'This situation is clearly unsatisfactory,' the report stated.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STRAINS IN the property and financial-service arms of the business empire
controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family have heightened fears of a wider
restructuring of the vast Canadian industrial and financial group.
Shares of several Bronfman-controlled companies continued to slide yesterday
amid concern that the group will either be forced to sell assets or raise
funds from other sources to support the haemorrhaging property and
financial-service businesses.
Brascan, one of the group's main holding companies, tumbled CDollars 1.13 to
close at CDollars 8.25. Hees International, the merchant banking arm, lost
62 cents to CDollars 5.13. Brascan and Hees shares stood at CDollars 13.75
and CDollars 8 respectively at the beginning of the year.
Share prices of almost all companies in the Bronfman orbit are at their
lowest point in recent years.
The Bronfman group makes up about 6 per cent of the total market value of
the Toronto stock exchange. Companies controlled by the family and their
senior managers include Noranda, the diversified resources producer; John
Labatt, the brewing group; and Trizec, North America's biggest
publicly-traded property developer. Noranda shares lost CDollars 1 to close
at CDollars 15.
The most immediate problems are at Royal Trust, Canada's second-biggest
trust and loan company, and at Bramalea, a debt-laden property developer. RT
is seeking an equity injection from an outside financial institution.
Bramalea filed for court protection from its creditors last year.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Reed International to sell its 3.66% stake in BSkyB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REED International is in negotiations to sell its stake in British Sky
Broadcasting, the satellite television venture.
Reed, now part of the merged Reed Elsevier international media group, will,
it is believed, receive around Pounds 40m for its indirect stake of 3.66 per
cent in BSkyB. The company will also get rid of guarantees and other
possible liabilities of more than Pounds 150m.
The sale comes as Pearson, owners of the Financial Times, Granada and
Chargeurs are completing arrangements for the renewal of financing deals
which run out this month.
In May 1991 Reed decided not to invest any more money in BSkyB and was
diluted to its present 3.66 per cent. It said existing publishing and
information businesses would have first call on investment funds.
Mr Peter Davis, chairman of Reed International, said yesterday: 'The merger
with Elsevier confirmed this view of our strategic priorities and the
refinancing this month of the 1990 facilities provides the opportunity for
us to complete our withdrawal.'
By pulling out now Reed may not get as much for its stake as it might if it
held on until a possible flotation in a few years' time.
It is clear that Mr Davis wishes to draw a line under the BSkyB investment.
Reed no longer has any part in the management of the satellite venture.
Mr Frank Barlow, group managing director of Pearson and chairman of BSkyB,
said yesterday: 'What we have done is agree a price between us, but that
does not give an ultimate valuation (of BSkyB).'
Negotiations on the sale of the stake are not yet complete.
Pearson, Chargeurs and Granada, the main BSkyB shareholders apart from Mr
Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, will split the Reed stake equally between
them. The three will each also take on guarantees and other liabilities
'which are not likely to exceed Pounds 50m plus accruing interest, fees and
costs'.
A report due out this week from stockbrokers James Capel is expected to
value the BSkyB equity at Pounds 2bn.
Pearson said yesterday it was calling an extraordinary general meeting to
approve its proportion of BSkyB's borrowing requirements.
The new arrangements are similar to those which expire on February 23.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Rank earnings fall under new accounting rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RANK Organisation, the diversified leisure group, said yesterday that
under new accounting standards which take effect in June, its 1992 earnings
per share would have been 6.8p rather than the 37.8p it reported.
The disparity results from the new standard's different treatment of
extraordinary items, profits and losses on disposals of businesses, and
property revaluations.
The City said the sharply reduced earnings per share figure demonstrated the
difficulties the new accounting standard will cause rather than being a
reflection of the leisure group's performance. Earnings per share figures
are likely to fluctuate more widely under the new system than under the old.
One analyst said: 'The important questions remain: what are the core
earnings of the company; what is its debt position; what is its cashflow?'
Rank said that although the new accounting standard, FRS 3, only applies to
companies with financial years ending after June 22, it had decided to
publish an additional group profit and loss account in its annual report,
presented as if the new rules had already taken effect. The Accounting
Standards Board has encouraged companies to adopt the new standard early.
Under the new rules, Rank's after-tax profits would have been Pounds 44.3m,
rather than the Pounds 140.1m it reported. The new system provides that
extraordinary items previously taken below the line now have to be included
in profits. This had little effect as Rank had only Pounds 100,000 in
extraordinary items.
The disposal of the group's motorway service business had a more significant
impact. Under the new system, the sale price achieved has to be set off
against the revalued worth of the business rather than the historic cost.
This reduced Rank's after-tax profits by Pounds 38.8m.
Profits were reduced by a further Pounds 56.9m as the result of a downwards
revaluation of hotel assets which have been put up for sale. Under the new
standard, these are reflected in the profit and loss statement rather than
only in the balance sheet.
Rank said: 'In this profit and loss account nothing is hidden. People have
got to think a bit more about the figures and that's not a bad thing.'

FT  03 FEB 93 / Heron acts to cut advisers' fees in restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERON, the property and trading company negotiating a Pounds 1.4bn debt
restructuring deal with its banks and bond holders, has acted to limit the
'cost spiral' involved in the process.
Heron's decision has implications for other companies in similar talks also
facing huge fees for professional advice.
Since talks started in March last year fees have totalled nearly Pounds 40m.
Heron, Mr Gerald Ronson's private company, said it would no longer pay fees
it did not regard as essential to the refinancing.
Heron also said it planned to present final proposals to creditors by the
end of this month. The group said it could not comment on rumours that a
revaluation of its properties, being prepared as part of the documentation
for the deal, showed a further fall of Pounds 100m since March last year.
But its first public mention of an end-February deadline appeared designed
to quash speculation that the talks were being held up by creditors' concern
about property values.
In order to preserve cash resources, Heron said, it would 'no longer be
responsible for fees of advisers other than those which in (Heron's) view
are essential to the restructuring process'.
It had had to devote 'disproportionate resources' to verifying data already
prepared under due diligence procedures.
Heron stressed that its Heron Corporation subsidiary in the UK, which
includes the housebuilding and automotive divisions as well as property
companies in the UK, France and Switzerland, had substantial cash resources
and positive net assets.
As well as paying its own advisers, such as lawyers, merchant bankers and
accountants, Heron was obliged to 'fund and deal with the queries of more
than 17 other firms of advisers representing creditor groups'.
It said that the time and money being devoted to this was 'not in the
interest of the company's creditors and could potentially threaten the
successful completion of the restructuring'. Without the refinancing the
group would be forced into receivership.
Heron said this decision, taken at the weekend, would 'protect the interests
of creditors by bringing the cost spiral of the debt restructuring process
to an end'.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Make-or-break mission for TCE: William Dawkins meets the
chairman of French electronics group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alain Prestat, the young French civil service supremo who was launched
into the top job at Europe's second-largest consumer electronics company
almost exactly a year ago is on a make-or-break mission.
As chairman of Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE), the 41-year-old Mr
Prestat faces odds that would frighten many. A year ago, the group was
losing so much money, market share and morale that its immediate owner,
Thomson, the state-owned flagship of the French electronics industry, wanted
to relinquish TCE. Today, TCE has been given a new chance and Mr Prestat
believes the group is in the early stages of a turnround.
'Our situation is a bit like that of Renault in the mid 1980s. Some people
thought Renault was in a hopeless situation then - and their problems at the
time are of the same order as ours are today. They managed a turnround and
we can too. We have already hit bottom and now we must rebound,' said Mr
Prestat.
Operating losses are set to rise from FFr228m (Pounds 28m) in 1991 to an
estimated FFr300m last year, but Mr Prestat predicts that TCE will make an
operating profit in 1993. Net losses are set to fall from FFr2.47bn to
FFr1.7bn in 1992, on turnover stable at around FFr31bn last year, having
declined to this level steadily from FFr36bn in 1989.
'In relative terms, that is not nearly as bad as the rest of the electronics
industry. I see it as regaining stability,' he argues. As a symbol of its
new ambitions, TCE last week hired the designer Mr Philippe Starck in the
latest streamlining of the group's design management.
Mr Prestat, who has spent his life moving between the higher echelons of
state industrial policymaking and the electronics industry, was dispatched
from the prime minister's private office into the hot seat at TCE during its
worst crisis in recent memory.
Only three weeks earlier, many senior executives were horrified to hear that
the then prime minister, Mrs Edith Cresson, was planning to place TCE under
the control of CEA-Industrie, the industrial arm of the atomic energy
authority. Others thought, in the end wrongly, that the state had decided to
bail out the heavily indebted group.
The government presented the plan, since reduced and reshaped nearly beyond
recognition, as a bid to create a world-beating energy-to-electronics
conglomerate on the lines of Siemens, the German conglomerate. Privately,
executives knew the government also had a hidden reason.
Mr Alain Gomez, who as chairman of the Thomson group is Mr Prestat's boss,
was said to want to hand TCE to another part of the state sector so he could
focus better on the group's profitable defence electronics arm, Thomson-CSF.
With net losses of FFr5.5bn over the four years to the end of 1991 and debts
of FFr10bn at the end of 1991 - now FFr14bn - TCE looked like a dangerous
liability in Mr Gomez's strategy of trying to turn Thomson-CSF into a
leading-edge defence electronics supplier.
To his credit, Mr Gomez immediately executed a U-turn when it became clear
that Mrs Cresson's blueprint was politically unfeasible, and returned to his
old support for TCE. Mr Prestat was instructed to beat out a recovery
strategy on the assumption that TCE had a long-term future in Thomson, but
that a bail-out was not, as it had been in the past, guaranteed.
Initially, he was greeted with suspicion by TCE executives who saw him as a
mere political appointee, to impose the erratic government industrial policy
of the time. They were wrong. 'Now they realise I am serious and that I am
here to do nothing but run the business for the medium to long term,' he
says.
His first action, less than two months after arriving, was to change the
heads of the US and European marketing divisions and the head of the
European television section. 'They were run like baronies, or civil service
departments, not like real sales teams,' says Mr Prestat. On both sides of
the Atlantic, TCE had been losing market share in televisions, which
accounts for 54 per cent of it sales.
The 20 per cent US television market share it seized by buying RCA in 1987
had fallen several points and the penetration achieved by TCE's clutch of
fine European brands was acceptably low. Now TCE's US market share has
climbed back to the old level and it has added a percentage point to its
European penetration by keeping volumes stable in a falling market.
Mr Prestat, is however, disappointed with sales of TCE's new enhanced
definition television set, intended as its foothold in the future market for
full high definition television (HDTV) and TCE's main hope for thwarting
Japanese competition in Europe. The risks of the HDTV market were
highlighted over the weekend when Philips, the Dutch electronics group,
suspended plans to make HDTV sets because there were no European programmes
for them.
TCE is undismayed by this because it does not affect demand for its existing
enhanced television sets based on D2-Mac, a halfway standard between normal
television and full HDTV. TCE is continuing its HDTV development in
collaboration with Philips. It dismisses its partner's move as a production
decision. The French group says it still has full faith in HD-Mac, Europe's
HDTV standard.
The other part of his strategy has been to work on TCE's fragile financial
health, cutting stock levels by half to FFr1.3bn over the past year and
trimming FFr2bn from annual running costs. He can do little more, however,
than chip away at the group's huge debts and admits that the prospects of
making a net profit depend on whether the Thomson group decides to pump more
equity into TCE. 'I am not going to my shareholders with a begging bowl. I
expect them to put in more money only if operating profits show the right
trend,' he says.
He is similarly non-committal on whether TCE should seek to strengthen
itself through a foreign alliance, as did Renault with Volvo. 'That is not
on my agenda at the moment. I never negotiate in a difficult situation, so
it all depends on how we perform.'

FT  03 FEB 93 / Business task forces to aid assault on red tape: More than
7,000 regulations to be reviewed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVEN task forces of businessmen and women are to be called in to review
more than 7,000 government regulations affecting the private sector, as
ministers begin a new offensive against red tape.
Its scope covers health and safety rules which brand Tipp-Ex corrector
fluid, Brillo pads and Jif cleaner as dangerous substances; regulations
which set such tough standards for outside play areas that many playgroups
simply keep children indoors; and food safety laws which forced retailers to
install freezers which failed to meet subsequent legislation, introduced by
a different department, to reduce the environmental impact of refrigerants
through CFCs.
Rules already scrapped or listed for scrapping in the drive to cut red tape,
which is being backed by Mr John Major, the prime minister, include
regulations about the distances between clothes pegs in changing rooms and
requirements for factory walls to be washed every 14 months.
A Downing Street seminar of cabinet ministers agreed yesterday that small
groups of private sector appointees should be set up to look at regulation
in areas such as construction, engineering, chemicals and financial
services.
They will work closely with Lord Sainsbury, the government's deregulation
adviser, and are intended to be able to call on trade associations and the
largest companies in the relevant sectors to ensure that ministers obtain a
proper picture of what business would like to see achieved in the review.
The aim is to look again at the need for all the existing regulations,
including European Community legislation, and the UK's rigorous approach to
its implementation.
Business organisations and small business owners last night welcomed the
announcement of the government's initiative, but said a lot of hard work
would be necessary for it to have any significant impact.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour spokesperson on the Citizen's Charter, attacked
as 'misguided' the setting up of a further seven committees all headed by
business people. 'Regulations on, for example, train safety and food hygiene
are not matters for business to decide,' she said.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, and Mr Major will
receive progress reports every two months, as part of the effort to ensure
that the deregulation drive retains more momentum than its predecessors.
In the Commons, Mr Major said ministers had agreed that 'in future, any
proposal for new regulations will have specifically to spell out the cost
for Britain's companies'.
The current estimate of the cost to business of enforcing government
regulations is Pounds 800m-Pounds 1bn a year.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Insurers hope good publicity is their best policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE life insurance industry, stung by adverse publicity about high
commissions and early surrender of policies, is embarking on its first-ever
image advertising campaign.
The life company members of the Association of British Insurers are also
rethinking their two-year opposition to new rules requiring greater
disclosure of charges.
According to a confidential memo obtained by the trade magazine Money Week,
the ABI wants to 'adopt the high ground' to counter press allegations of
high-pressure sales tactics.
It says insurers are concerned that 'a number of key media representatives
have attacked the industry by drawing attention to high surrenders, poor
surrender values, apparent high commission and expense costs, and other
areas'.
Mr Tony Baker, the ABI's manager of public affairs, said yesterday: 'The
industry has had a bad time for publicity over the past year, some of which
has been well deserved. But the positive virtues of insurance haven't been
stressed enough.'
As a result, the ABI's Life Industry Council plans to spend more than Pounds
300,000 on advertisements in quality and trade publications which will warn
that insurance is a long-term commitment and should only be purchased by
those likely to keep up payments.
'You will think it is an ad that could have been placed by the Consumers'
Association,' Mr Baker said.
The advertisements might discourage some individuals from buying policies
but it would help to ensure that those who do buy them intend to keep them,
he said.
The ABI memo urges life company members to stress in contacts with
journalists and MPs that life policies 'provide support for family units and
make women better able to exist independently in society'. Policies can also
'relieve stress caused by financial worries', particularly during a
recession.
In another effort to get across the 'positive attributes of the industry',
the ABI tells members that it can suggest journalists and provide
biographical information about them.

FT  03 FEB 93 / EC warns of action to counter US trade threats
</HEADLINE>

THE European Community warned yesterday that it would take 'whatever action
is necessary' to counter US threats to bar EC companies from government
contracts.
As Community trade ministers warned the Clinton administration against
sliding towards protectionism, they confirmed they had discussed retaliation
in Brussels, but had decided against immediate action.
Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, Danish foreign minister and current president of
the EC Council of Ministers, said: 'We decided that this was not the time.
It is time now to tell the Americans they are on the wrong track.' Every EC
member state was concerned about 'the uncertainty of the trade direction of
the new Clinton administration', he added.
At the same time the US signalled it intended putting its concern about free
trade and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade behind its
determination to ensure what it sees as fair play for its companies.
'We do not want to close our procurement market, but we must insist that our
major trading partners show an equivalent commitment to open and
nondiscriminatory procurement policies,' said Mr Mickey Kantor, the new US
trade representative.
The EC trade ministers also denounced as 'unacceptable' Washington's
imposition last week of heavy anti-dumping duties on EC steel.
Mr Petersen dismissed suggestions that Monday's US threat to freeze EC
companies out of American federal contracts was simply the bureaucratic
outcome of a move set in train by the Bush administration.
'This is not just some minor trade dispute,' he added. 'What we are talking
about is absolutely the wrong signal for the world economy.'
But President Bill Clinton, who has been forced to backtrack on a number of
his election campaign pledges, appears intent on fulfilling promises to open
foreign markets to US exports and enforce US trade laws.
Mr Kantor recently told the Senate finance committee: 'The days when we
could afford to subordinate our economic interests to foreign policy or
defence concerns are long past.'
Sir Leon Brittan, EC external economic relations commissioner, said he would
be meeting Mr Kantor in Washington on February 11 'reassured and reinforced'
by the uniform view of the EC.
'The only possible solution to such questions is a negotiated one, which is
fair and balanced,' Sir Leon said. The Community 'will not allow itself to
be bullied'.
Ministers and senior officials said the EC would act multilaterally through
the disputes procedures of Gatt, as well as through bilateral negotiations
with the US.

FT  03 FEB 93 / West German labour faces real wage cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WEST GERMAN workers will this year suffer their first real cuts in wages for
a decade, according to documents due to be presented to the Bonn cabinet
next week.
Wage rises are expected to range between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent, while
inflation will average 3.5 per cent, the economics ministry says in its
official new year forecasts.
The leak of the figures, two days before the Bundesbank council is due to
consider the country's economic plight, and review - but not change  - its
interest rates policy, coincided with the publication of key indicators
which showed recession tightening its grip on industry.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, meanwhile, told the European assembly in Strasbourg
that he and the government would do everything possible to enable German
rates to be reduced. A decision on federal spending cuts would be reached in
four weeks at the most, he said.
Since the last recession of 1982, pay rises have consistently outstripped
increases in living costs. The trend appeared to peak in 1991 when average
wages rose 6 per cent and inflation was 3.5 per cent. Last year the consumer
prices index rose 4.5 per cent and average wages 5.4 per cent.
An interruption of the trend would send a further signal to the Bundesbank
that wage-driven inflation could be coming under control. Much depends,
however, on public sector pay talks, due to resume today, in which federal,
state and local government employees are demanding packages worth up to 5.5
per cent.
The employers have so far refused to raise their opening offer of 2.25 per
cent. Taken together, Mr Kohl's soothing promise in Strasbourg and the
economics ministry forecasts, suggest anything above 3 per cent is out of
the question.
The economics ministry, meanwhile, reported a 2 per cent drop in industrial
production from November to December, and the VDMA engineering industry
association said new orders booked during December were 9 per cent lower
than a year earlier.
Foreign orders were unchanged, while domestic demand slumped 17 per cent,
the association said. A breakdown of the economics ministry's production
figures showed further strong declines in most sectors except construction.
Comparing November and December with the same months of 1991, the ministry
said overall industrial production was down by 5.1 per cent. Output in the
capital goods and mining sectors fell 10 per cent, while construction rose
5.3 per cent.

If the new accounting standards were already in force the Rank Organisation
would have reported net earnings for last year of 6.8p instead of 37.8p. If
respectable companies face such earnings volatility, it will be easy to
overlook real transgressions in the transition. Rank has been refreshingly
candid, but it has also used the opportunity to take a discreet Pounds 57m
provision for diminution of assets which would not otherwise have shown up
in the profit and loss account.

FT  03 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: BAT Industries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Like some diva forever postponing the final curtain call, Sir Patrick Sheehy
appears reluctant to leave the stage at BAT. Although the company has split
the two top jobs for the first time in 90 years, Sir Patrick is to remain in
the chair. The figure who has dominated BAT for the past decade will soldier
on for up to three more years. By then he will be 65. BAT's normal
retirement age is 60.
It is easy to imagine how Sir Patrick's continuing presence might make life
tricky for the new chief executive, Mr Martin Broughton. However BAT's
shareholders are unlikely to feel too aggrieved if the share price continues
its recent strong run. For the moment at least, Mr Broughton will doubtless
stress the theme of continuity. BAT's tobacco business has found new
customers in the developing world while the financial services arm appears
to have endured the worst. The stiffer long-term challenge will be to
address BAT's structural ACT problem. That may require a significant
strategic move in the UK and a new song from Mr Broughton.

FT  03 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: UK food sector
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the PSBR pressing down on him, Mr Norman Lamont may eventually have no
choice but to raise some extra cash. Tax hawks suggest extending VAT to
books, newspapers and domestic fuel, but the really big target would be
food. The Treasury estimates it could garner a further Pounds 7bn by making
full-rate VAT applicable to food. Taxing bread and butter would certainly
provoke a furious public reaction. It would also raise questions about food
industry earnings. The worrying memory is of April 1991, when a large chunk
of the 2 1/2 percentage point increase in VAT came out of the margins of
retailers and their suppliers. Recessionary conditions prevented the
increase from being passed on to consumers.
In the case of food, the direct consequences might not be as bad as at first
imagined. Many discretionary items, such as soft drinks and snacks, already
attract VAT. Higher taxes would not depress consumption of essential foods,
though there might be trading down to cheaper items. Prized brands would
become less valuable for a while. With food more expensive consumers might
spend less on other items, like restaurant meals, with a knock-on effect in
other sectors.
Large food retailers might suffer the least damage because of the power they
wield over their suppliers, but margins should recover quickly. Food has
declined as a proportion of disposable income over many years. The
additional burden of VAT, were it introduced, would only represent a blip in
this long-run trend.

FT  03 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Convertible bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Three convertible bond issues in four months hardly constitute a flood, but
after a couple of barren years, City advisers might be forgiven for licking
their lips. Yesterdays Pounds 91m issue is cheap funding for Northern Foods.
A straight bond issue would cost the company more in interest payments, yet
on even modest assumptions of dividend growth, equity investors would do
better buying the shares.
The success of the issue - the 3 per cent fall in the share price yesterday
is par for the course - underlines that the market is willing to pay a
premium for a secure yield. The dwindling return from cash has squeezed
investors looking for income. Recession has made high yield in equities
synonymous with corporate distress. Income fund managers could hardly
justify holding Northern Foods' shares on a yield less than the market
average. The convertible offers a way in.
But convertibles are condemned to a limited role in corporate fund-raising.
To protect pre-emption rights, UK institutions effectively limit convertible
issues to 5 per cent of share capital. Northern Foods has refinanced a handy
slice of bank debt - and strengthened its hand in negotiations over the
rest. Plenty of companies want to reduce short term debt, but, if big money
is needed, it will still have to come from rights issues.

FT  03 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Daf breaks down
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Doubtless the Dutch government and the Flemish regional authorities are
hopping mad at the British banks which have effectively pulled the plug on
Daf. Smaller lenders have an irritating habit of getting in the way of
rescue proposals that appear socially and politically sensible, but then
those without an axe to grind can see the financial traps more easily. The
Dutch banks are so deeply involved they would prefer not to leave room for
second thoughts about the medium term rescue plan. On any objective measure,
Daf's position was precarious enough to warrant doubts.
An operating loss last year of Fl 200m with provisions for restructuring on
top would have cut deeply into capital and reserves which stood at Fl 810m
at the end of 1991. Lenders clearly faced a transformation of debt into
equity. The activities of the group's financing subsidiary made it all the
more legitimate to worry that the same might have happened to any new loans
extended. Daf Finance was responsible for a large part of the Fl 3.5bn of
short term debt on the group's last balance sheet. But the quality of its
loan book must have deteriorated with the recession in the UK and the
downturn in continental Europe. That problem only made rescuing the
industrial activities more difficult.
Nor was Daf a natural survivor in the commercial vehicle market. It is too
small and too dependent on the UK. The logical answer might have been an
alliance, but a partner's first job would have been to pay to take out
capacity. The rest of the European industry must be sighing with relief now
that this cost looks like falling squarely on the shoulders of Daf's own
lenders and shareholders.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Parcelling up the Post Office
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IDEA of privatising the UK Post Office seems to be taking on a dangerous
life of its own. It began innocently enough, with the government's proposal
last year to sell off the parcels division. Since this business operates in
a highly competitive market without monopoly protection, that seemed
sensible. The snag is that parcels lose money, as do the post offices
themselves. The only profitable and attractive bit of the operation is the
Royal Mail, which enjoys a monopoly on letters below a certain price. The
notion has thus gradually taken hold of selling the whole enterprise in a
lump, raising some Pounds 2bn in the process.
This risks repeating a classic error of the 1980s. The issue of monopoly
power should be resolved before privatisation is begun, not tacked on as an
afterthought. To privatise the Royal Mail as it stands and then send in a
regulator is to beg a whole range of questions about its structure, powers
and social obligations. Nor is there an urgent need for change; the Royal
Mail provides a world-class service, broadly satisfies the public and is, by
public sector standards, well managed.
One argument for privatisation has a certain force. The Royal Mail operates
in a broader communications market, competing against telecoms, faxes and
information technology generally. This is a highly capital-intensive,
competitive world, in which the old-fashioned letter post risks becoming
obsolete. If the Royal Mail cannot invest to compete, it will lose the
volume which enables it to hold down its prices and thus enter a spiral of
decline. And in the public sector it is not free to borrow, since that would
count towards the government's budget deficit.
But in fact, the Post Office scarcely needs to borrow, since it generates
vast sums of cash through its operations. The snag is that the money is
confiscated by the Treasury: Pounds 750m in the past decade, with another
Pounds 181m to come in the next fiscal year alone. If the government is
being too greedy, perhaps the Post Office needs protection. If so, to
install a regulator to mediate between it and the Treasury would be a more
sensible first step than privatising it out of hand and sending a regulator
in afterwards.
Similar logic applies in the case of the post office counters. These are
highly sensitive politically, since half of them are loss-making and all of
them perform a social function. But the losses are at least partly the
result of arbitrary restriction by government. Legally, the post offices can
only handle transactions for government departments and the formerly public
utilities. They can do business for British Telecom or Thames Water, but not
for Marks and Spencer or Barclays Bank. An economically important resource
is thus denied the opportunity to run on commercial lines. Change might well
occur most effectively under privatisation but should not be impossible
without it.
This is not to deny the proposition that a commercial undertaking should
justify its place within the public sector, rather than the other way round.
The question is rather what role the Post Office should be expected to play
as a private entity and how it could then be exposed to competition. Private
sector monopolies are to be avoided.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Driven to a grinding halt: Daf is the biggest victim of the
sharp contraction in the European truck industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The war of attrition in the European truck industry claimed its biggest
casualty yesterday when Daf, the Anglo-Dutch commercial vehicle maker, was
forced to file for protection against its creditors in the Netherlands.
The vice is tightening inexorably. The number of truck makers in Europe had
already dropped from 25 in 1975 to 10 by the end of 1991, and the group is
still shrinking.
Financially Daf has been the weakest of the leading European truck makers,
but it has tried hard to compete in the industry's premier league. Its
financial collapse will send shock-waves through a sector that is already
being battered by deepening recession.
Daf is the biggest truck maker in the UK - since its takeover of Leyland
vehicles in 1987 - and it is the UK truck market leader with a share of 25
per cent. It is number six among the big seven European truck makers with a
share of close to 8 per cent of the west European truck market.
Its single biggest shareholder is still British Aerospace with a stake of
10.9 per cent resulting from BAe's takeover of Rover, formerly British
Leyland, in 1988. The BAe holding has fallen sharply from an original 40 per
cent, however, and BAe failed to subscribe to the last share issue in late
1991, further diluting its then stake of 16 per cent.
But as Daf's problems have mounted it has been the Dutch institutions that
have increasingly answered the distress calls. More than 40 per cent of the
equity is now in the hands of the biggest Dutch bank, ABN/Amro (8.2 per
cent); VADO, controlled by the founding Van Doorne family (10.3 per cent);
the Dutch insurance groups ING (10.6 per cent) and Aegon (6.4 per cent); and
DSM, the former Dutch state-owned chemicals group (5.9 per cent).
How the administrators and receivers in the Netherlands and the UK will seek
to pick up the pieces remains unclear. Daf insisted yesterday that its
attempt to engineer a financial rescue had only foundered on the opposition
of a minority of its banks, mainly in the UK, to its proposals for securing
emergency short-term funding.
With Dutch financial institutions facing the biggest financial exposure, and
the Dutch and Belgian governments having shown themselves willing earlier in
the company's decline to support restructuring packages, the Dutch
administrator might still be able to work out a new rescue.
For the moment, however, Daf has given up control of its own destiny. Having
run up cumulative losses of about Fl 800m (Pounds 300m) in the past three
years, it was forced to file for protection from its creditors at the
district court of s'Hertogenbosch.
Its operations were immediately plunged into uncertainty and upheaval.
Employees turned up at the company's plants in the UK, the Netherlands and
Belgium for work as usual, but within hours production was being affected.
As news of the financial collapse spread, some suppliers began to stop
deliveries of components. With just-in-time delivery of parts to plants
spread from Leyland in Lancashire to Eindhoven in the Netherlands, the
impact of such actions on the assembly process can be almost immediate.
'Where possible we are producing, but in some areas supplies of components
have stopped. What happens tomorrow, I don't know', said one Daf executive
in the UK.
As Daf's fortunes have waned, it has proved unable to find a rescuer within
the industry, despite desperate overtures in recent months to Mercedes-Benz,
the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz of Germany and the world's biggest
truck maker. It has also searched in vain in recent months for a Japanese
partner.
The absence of a partner is not surprising. Daf's competitors have enough
troubles of their own. Volvo, Renault and Iveco (the commercial vehicles
subsidiary of Fiat) are all losing money on their truck and bus operations.
In the US the heavy truck industry has been deep in loss for five of the
past 11 years. In Japan the truck market has been falling for more than two
years. Nissan Diesel fell into loss in the six months to the end of
September, while Hino, the leading Japanese heavy truck maker, suffered a 59
per cent fall in pre-tax profits in the same period.
The fortunes of the truck makers fluctuate wildly as the industry suffers
from exaggerated trading cycles. In west Europe the last year of strong
growth was 1989, the year that Daf went public.
European truck sales have been falling for the past three years, and there
is little prospect of relief during 1993 with demand forecast to fall
particularly sharply in Germany and Italy.
Each lurch downwards in the trading cycle claims new victims, and Daf has
long looked most exposed.
Its financial demise has abruptly ended its brave dream of becoming one of
the leading players in the European truck industry, able to challenge the
likes of Mercedes-Benz, Iveco and the Franco-Swedish alliance of Renault and
Volvo.
Its strategy for climbing into the top flight started with the takeover in
1987 of the then British Leyland truck and van operations. The move
transformed it from being essentially a heavy truck and bus maker into a
commercial vehicle producer with a full product range from vans to light,
medium and heavy trucks and buses.
Buoyed by record sales and profits in 1989 it then tried to add to Leyland
by taking over the Steyr truck business in Austria, and then Enasa, the
Spanish state-owned truck maker of Pegaso vehicles. Each time it was
thwarted by bigger rivals - first by the German truck maker MAN, in the case
of Steyr, and then by Iveco at Enasa.
Even as these dreams of grandeur were fading, Daf began to be overtaken by
the impact of the UK recession - one of the principal reasons for its
downfall.
The UK became its biggest single market after the merger with Leyland and by
1991 the UK still accounted for 29.4 per cent of group sales. In 1991 it
ousted Iveco from the leadership of the UK truck market and it consolidated
its pole position last year.
But market leadership has been small consolation, when overall UK truck
sales have fallen to their lowest level since the early 1950s. In the past
three years, the number of trucks sold in the UK market has declined by more
than 50 per cent, from 69,234 in 1989 to only 31,398 in 1992.
Daf has tried hard to reduce its dependence on the UK by expanding its
dealer network and sales overseas - in particular in Germany and in France.
But other markets have weakened too.
Excluding the German market, which was stimulated for two years by the
impact of reunification, the effects of recession have been savage.
According to Mr Peter Schmidt, an analyst at the UK-based Automotive
Industry Data, the west European truck market (above 3.5 tonnes gross
vehicle weight), excluding Germany, has plunged from 255,000 in 1989 to
160,000 in 1992, the lowest level for at least two decades. Including
Germany, truck sales in west Europe have fallen from 321,000 in 1989 to an
estimated 281,000 last year.
Now the prop of Germany is also falling away. Mercedes-Benz, the industry
leader, has been forced to cancel a big investment in a new truck plant in
east Germany, and has disclosed that since July it has suffered a 'dramatic'
fall of 30-50 per cent in new commercial vehicle orders booked in Germany.
Daf has had its own particular problems, however. It has been badly exposed
by having the breadth of product range of the biggest manufacturers without
their production and sales volumes. As a result, it has been unable to
achieve economies of scale.
But if Daf's problems have been exaggerated by its relatively small size,
its rivals are unlikely to feel reassured. The problems of the European
truck industry are likely to get worse before they get better. Some of Daf's
larger competitors may also find themselves forced on to the hard shoulder
before the end of the decade.

The Treasury has been accused of a few errors of judgment in recent days.
Yesterday brought another.
At 11.39am, the Treasury used its special page on the Stock Exchange's Topic
information service to issue the January official reserves figures. Because
of a technical hitch, a sentence from a very old Treasury announcement
accidentally crept on to the screen - Minimum Lending Rate will be revised
to 7 per cent tomorrow.
The announcement was spotted by the Extel news service, and displayed for
five minutes before the Bank of England requested the Treasury to remove the
offending page.

There are some privileges in running a television channel. Alan Yentob, boss
of BBC2, was one of the first-night audience at Covent Garden last week
which cheered to the echo of the first British professional production of
Verdi's 'lost' opera, Stiffelio.
Yentob was so enraptured by the performance of Jose Carreras in the title
role that he is clearing his planned schedule this Saturday and transmitting
nearly three hours of Stiffelio live instead. Wisely, Covent Garden Pioneer,
the company set up last summer to video productions at the Opera House, and
Yentob's hosts at the premiere, had been planning to film the opera this
week, with a planned BBC transmission around Christmas time. This
unprecedented speed is wonderful pr for the Opera House which has been
criticised in the past for elitism. Not many more than 10,000 people will
see Carreras live in his five performances as Stiffelio; now millions can
join in Covent Garden's hottest production for years.

Once upon a time, western governments used to lecture post-communist peers
in eastern Europe on the need to adopt economic shock cures and open up
their markets.
Now it seems the boot is on the other foot, judging by this year's economic
forum in Davos.
Take Karel Dyba, the Czech republic's economy minister, who offered
Washington deadpan advice on balancing its budget provided the US would
agree to open its cheese market. Or his boss, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus
who, when asked what should be done to open the EC market to Czech products,
sighed: 'We spent years studying western economic textbooks. Now it seems we
have to sell free market ideas back to the western world.'
Anatoly Sobchak, the mayor of St Petersburg, sounded even sniffier. He
boasted that his city was about the only place in the former Soviet Union
that was not crawling with Harvard-trained advisers - and that did not have
a budget deficit.
President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine, meanwhile, has developed an intriguing
line in sales patter. When asked what his country had to offer investors, he
recited the usual laundry list of cheap labour and ample natural resources,
then added cheerily: 'We have the best missiles in the world . . . they can
be used for launching satellites.'

Japanese carmaker Mitsubishi seems to have scored an own goal by luring
German soccer star Franz Beckenbauer away from Mercedes- Benz to be its
chief pr 'personality' in Europe.
There were loud grumblings among Dutch fans attending this week's opening of
Mitsubishi's glitzy new European headquarters in Amsterdam. As Mitsubishi is
also making its European manufacturing debut through a joint venture with
Nedcar, the Dutch government-backed carmaker, wouldn't it have been better
to have given the job to the Netherlands' legendary Johan Cruyff, instead of
hiring an expensive German transfer?

Tut, tut. Sir John Quinton, the recently departed boss of Barclays, can't
have been serious when he hinted at a possible solution to Britain's

Noting that the City had always bounced back from previous crises ranging
from the Great Plague to the Great Fire, he mused whether a repeat of the
latter calamity might not help reduce the City's vast store of unlet
properties now disfiguring many bank loan portfolios.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Observer: BAT takes another puff
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be hard to describe Martin Broughton, the new chief executive of
BAT Industries, Britain's fourth biggest company, as a breath of fresh air.
True, he is jolly young - 45 - and, like the bosses of most of his
competitors, he is no longer a chain-smoker. But he is still at heart a
tobacco man, having joined the British-American Tobacco Company over 20
years ago.
BAT's performance over the past decade has certainly improved. If it hadn't,
it would almost certainly have been taken over by now. However, its
preference for recruiting its head honcho from within underlines its
conservatism.
Lou Gerstner, the 50-year-old boss of RJR Nabisco since 1989, is an
ex-management consultant who made his name at American Express; Michael
Miles, 53, head of Philip Morris, is a marketing man who joined PM after it
took over his employer Kraft in 1989. Both these conglomerates have
benefited from a breath of fresh air at the top. Perhaps BAT should try it
some time?

FT  03 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Bankers' secrets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMERS OF Britain's high street banks have the right to restrict how
widely details of their accounts are circulated within their bank. Barclays
Bank has devised a way around this for new customers by requiring those who
buy products such as its credit cards to allow any of the bank's
subsidiaries to use information about them on its database.
This tactic, and other efforts by banks to get customers to give permission
for the use of financial data, is intended to help banks sell more financial
products to their existing customers. Barclays has a strong motive to raise
its income from products such as personal loans and credit cards because it
may next month declare a pre-tax loss for last year.
The banks are thus trying to minimise the effect of a provision in their
code of practice for personal customers which says that customers must give
their consent for banks to publish details of their accounts to third
parties - even when those third parties are subsidiaries of the bank. In
effect, Barclays is forcing new customers to give such consent.
The office of the data protection registrar, who is responsible for ensuring
that companies adhere to the Data Protection Act, is naturally concerned
about this. It thinks that Barclays and other banks which might follow are
evading their own code of practice. It also believes they may be breaching
the act by not obtaining and handling data fairly.
British banks are currently facing a wave of criticism over everything from
their small business lending policies to charges for overdrafts. In reply,
they rightly point out that they are businesses not public utilities, and
they must make a profit. This means raising charges, since much of their
lending in the late 1980s turned out to be loss-making.
This argument does not apply to the methods being used to obtain permission
from customers to use data. The banks only agreed their code of practice
last March. But its provision on confidentiality would be weakened if all
banks emulated Barclays. This is hardly the signal to send to those who call
for statutory regulation.
The banks are themselves concerned about data security, and have started an
industry-wide review after the shock of seeing details of Mr Norman Lamont's
credit card bill in The Sun newspaper last December. Their worry is that
employees may take information from their databases, and disclose it to
outsiders.
The banks say they recognise the need to improve data security, but their
customers' faith in these efforts is hardly enhanced by their response so
far to the data protection office's anxieties. It is in the banks' own
interest to ensure that the right of confidentiality afforded under the
banking code of practice is honoured in the spirit and the letter.

FT  03 FEB 93 / The mother of all parliaments: Andrew Adonis analyses
proposals to reform the way laws are made in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The best cure for admiring the House of Lords, said Walter Bagehot, is to go
and look at it. If you have never looked, and harbour admiration for either
Lords or Commons, save yourself a trip to Westminster and read the Hansard
Society's report on the legislative process*.
The report, published yesterday, is a withering critique of the way law is
made in Britain, produced by a commission of senior legislators, lawyers and
lobbyists chaired by Lord Rippon, the former Tory cabinet minister. It is a
tale of obfuscation, lack of consultation, grossly inefficient use of
parliamentary time, yet inadequate scrutiny of either the principles or
details of legislation.
As the case studies in the report testify, the heart of the problem is the
government's largely unfettered control over the legislative process.
At one extreme, it cites the 1990 Dangerous Dogs Act. A panic measure, now
widely regarded as unworkable, to ban pit bull terriers and Japanese tosas
passed through all its stages in the Commons in a single sitting, less than
a week after publication.
In contrast, the 1990 Broadcasting Bill, which reformed the regulatory
regime for the independent broadcasting sector, was subject to lengthy
consultation before reaching Parliament, and debated for 17 days once there.
Yet so faulty was the bill as introduced, and so little had ministers done
to take on board prior criticism, it practically had to be rewritten on the
floor of both Houses. The government was obliged to table 800 amendments in
the Lords alone, many of them at a few days' notice.
'Public anxiety about the current system is great and demand for change is
strong,' says the report. Its main recommendations for change fall into
three categories: more intelligible drafting; more meaningful consultation;
and more rigorous parliamentary scrutiny.
However desirable, major statutes will never make good bedtime reading. On
the second theme, the commission wavers between wanting improved
consultation, and proposing to take the framing of legislation out of the
government's hands.
It would, for instance, 'welcome more frequent appointment of independent
inquiries, including royal commissions'. But what is an 'independent'
inquiry? One staffed by 'experts' (who are generally far from independent)?
Or one including political opponents of the government, in which case its
report - like that of so many royal commissions in the past - will
inevitably be the lowest common denominator of its diverse composition? No
royal commission in the early 1980s would have got the privatisation ball
rolling; nor is one likely to reform the welfare state.
It is in the third area, parliamentary scrutiny, that the commission makes
particularly valuable recommendations. Two radical proposals are set out:
Before being debated, controversial bills should be referred to select
committees with the power to take evidence from academics, professional
bodies and interest groups. Ministers and whips should not be members.
Select committees should conduct inquiries into important bills before they
are subject to line-by-line scrutiny by the Commons.
If implemented, these proposals would provide far greater opportunities for
those affected by bills to make their voice heard, without compromising the
government's necessary right of initiative. And by reducing the direct
control of ministers over at least part of the parliamentary process, they
would make it more difficult for ill-considered bills to reach the statute
book.
Would the Hansard proposals have made any difference to the poll tax,
perhaps the worst product of the legislative process this century? Possibly
not, given the size of Lady Thatcher's majority in 1987, and her
determination not to change a dot or comma. But under Hansard's plans, MPs
would, at least, have had to address the chronic practical difficulties
thrown up by the tax. They would also have come face to face with the near
universal condemnation of it.
It will take a battle royal between the government and Parliament - that is,
its own backbenchers and the opposition - to get the Hansard reforms
through. But it has happened before. In 1979, immediately after the demise
of a Labour government with no overall majority, MPs voted to set up the
departmental select committees, which have proved influential of late. They
should seize the chance offered by Mr Major's slender majority to establish
select committees for legislation too.

FT  03 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Britain cleans up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DISPUTE about the transfer of work from Hoover's vacuum cleaner plant in
France to its plant in Scotland has been long on political rhetoric and
short on facts. Contrary to political rhetoric in Brussels and Paris, the
transfer has little to do with 'social dumping' or Britain's opt-out from
the Maastricht social chapter.
Social dumping is the theory that in barrier-free economic zones capital
will flow to areas where labour is cheapest and least protected, triggering
downward pressure on standards in other regions. There is no evidence for
the second part of the theory and little for the first, regrettably for the
low wage economies of southern Europe where investors have learned to
balance cheap labour against low productivity.
By recruiting the EC's social dimension to the cause of economic nationalism
French politicians also risk discrediting a feature of European integration
that they have done so much to promote. A balance has to be struck. It is
legitimate to enforce minimum standards of civilised behaviour on employers
by banning child labour or insisting on basic safety standards. It is also
essential to ensure state aid does not give companies an unfair advantage.
But it is absurd to regard every aspect of competitive advantage across the
EC as dumping.
The Hoover episode has struck an understandable anti-British nerve but the
row says something about the increasing fragmentation of the EC as well as
the state of French politics. It is easy to see why the 'sweatshop' of
Europe is in the dock following its social chapter opt-out and sterling's
devaluation since September.
In reality, Hoover's restructuring decision was made in Scotland's favour
because the company had spare capacity there and because, it says, non-wage
labour costs are only about 10 per cent of wage costs in Scotland compared
with 45 per cent in France. Despite the crowing of some British politicians
neither the social chapter opt-out nor devaluation has much to do with that.
The social chapter does not cover wage or non-wage labour costs and Hoover
says it did not make a long-term investment decision based on a short-term
devaluation.
The labour market culture of the Thatcher era may have enhanced the UK's
attractiveness, but it has for decades claimed the largest share of external
investment in the EC. Easier hire and fire can also work against British
jobs when it is much cheaper to close plants in the UK than in Spain, France
or Germany. By EC standards Britain is a low labour cost economy, partly
because citizens pay for healthcare through general taxation. In those parts
of industry where productivity is not correspondingly low the UK is an
attractive investment site. British workers should thank Mr Delors for
advertising that.

FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: J. P. Morgan raises Dollars 1bn
for private equity fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
J. P. MORGAN, the US banking group, announced yesterday it had raised more
than Dollars 1bn for its Corsair Partnership, a new private equity fund that
will make strategic investments in banking companies in the US and
worldwide.
The blue-chip New York bank has invested Dollars 100m of its own money into
the fund, giving it the largest single stake.
The rest of the Dollars 1bn has come from 46 different partners, including
financial institutions, pension funds, public and private companies, wealthy
individuals and small investment partnerships.
Mr Nick Paumgarten, a J. P. Morgan managing director and chairman of
Corsair, said the fund planned to invest minority stakes in undervalued
banks that have an existing management team and business plan, but which
need of fresh capital.
Each investment will be made with the full support of bank managements, and
Corsair will not seek to control or acquire the banks in which it invests,
although it will offer access J. P. Morgan's banking expertise.
J. P. Morgan may be taking a gamble with Corsair, because it is entering a
relatively crowded market. Other similar investment partnerships, run by
such big guns of investment banking as Goldman Sachs, Lazard Freres and
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, have been taking private equity stakes in banks for
several years.
Many of these partnerships have enjoyed large returns from their
investments, primarily because US banks reached a trough in terms of
performance and capital strength more than two years ago, and the industry
has been steadily recovering ever since.
Mr Paumgarten admits that Corsair is arriving late on the scene, but
believes there are 'incredible' investment opportunities outside the US,
particularly in parts of Europe and the Far East.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Biggest airline reservation systems merge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE merger of two of the world's biggest airline computer reservation
systems was finalised yesterday, creating a new company called Galileo
International.
Galileo International will combine the European Galileo network with the US
Covia-Apollo reservation system. The move will result in job losses at the
Galileo data centre in Swindon, Wiltshire, whose data processing operations
will be absorbed over the next 12 months by a combined facility in Denver,
Colorado.
Computer reservation systems have increasingly become a key weapon in the
competitive arsenal of international airlines. But the huge cost of setting
up and operating these systems has forced airlines to try to pool resources.
Shareholders in the new company will include British Airways, United
Airlines, USAir, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair, Alitalia, Aer Lingus,
Air Canada, Olympic Airways, TAP Air Portugal and Austrian Airlines.
The new company, which claims to be the first global computer reservation
system group, will be 50 per cent owned by European carriers and 50 per cent
owned by US airlines. Its headquarters will be in Chicago.
It will maintain a marketing and product development facility at Swindon,
where some staff will be redeployed. Its main competitor is the Sabre
network owned by American Airlines, which attempted but failed two years ago
to merge with another European computer reservation system, called Amadeus.
However, the Galileo-Apollo merger still has to be approved by US and
European Commission regulators.
On both sides of the Atlantic, regulators are considering introducing new
rules for computer reservation systems to prevent distortions in airline
competition by the use of these powerful networks.
Mr Giovanni Bisignani, the chief executive of Alitalia, has been chosen as
chairman of the new merged company, which claims a 30 per cent share of the
world airline reservation market.
He said yesterday that the new company was 'a combination of two recognised
computer reservation market leaders with a long success story of
co-operation'.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Technology: Unix's survival at stake - Technically Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEW days before Christmas last year, Novell, a US computer networking
company whose annual sales are now close to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) signed
a letter of intent to acquire Unix Systems Laboratories, a company in which
AT&amp;T has a majority stake and which is responsible for the licensing and
development of the Unix computer operating system.
The deal, worth Dollars 350m, has to be ratified by 11 other computer
companies which own shares in USL. These include Amdahl, Fujitsu, ICL,
Motorola and Sun Microsystems. It is nevertheless remarkable, given the
history of Unix, that there has been a dearth of comment on a development
which may fundamentally reshape the open systems movement. It may simply
have been the imminence of the New Year; others see more sinister forces at
work.
To recap briefly: open systems imply a common set of rules for interworking
so that no supplier has a technical advantage over any other in developing
standard products.
Unix is one of a number of operating systems vying to be adopted as the open
systems standard. The development of such an operating system would have to
be free from the control of any one manufacturer or group of manufacturers.
Unix was created by AT&amp;T at Bell Labs but has since been widely licensed,
leading to a damaging multiplicity of 'standard' versions. These include
Sunsoft's Solaris and IBM's AIX.
The competition includes IBM's personal computer operating systems OS/2, the
Open Systems Foundation's OSF1 and Microsoft's Windows NT, a new operating
system which has yet to be launched commercially.
AT&amp;T established USL, and encouraged other companies to Take stakes in it,
to promote the idea of Unix development independent of itself or any other
company. In doing so, it showed it had learned the lessons of the 1980s when
plans to establish a standard Unix between AT&amp;T and the aggressive
workstation company, Sun Microsystems, provoked an industry war.
Novell, however, is one of the industry's newly emerging dominant forces
with some 60 per cent of the global market for networking software. The
1990s are set to be the decade of computer networking so Novell, along with
Intel and Microsoft, can claim to be an architect of the new world order in
computing.
So by selling off USL to Novell, has AT&amp;T thrown away the idea of an
independent Unix? And if it has, does it matter?
The answer to the latter question would seem to be 'No', judging by the lack
of controversy over the proposed sale. Why should that be?
One possible answer is that AT&amp;T and the rest of the industry are already
anticipating that Windows NT will be the operating system of the future and
have thrown in the towel.
Windows NT - standing for 'New Technology' - is Microsoft's first multiuser,
multitasking operating system suitable for powerful network servers. It is
Microsoft's attempt to lay siege to the market for enterprise-wide
computing, taking advantage of the shift away from mainframes and mainframe
operating systems.
Microsoft has a deserved reputation for tenacity in bringing reliable
products to market even if there are several false starts on the way. But
coming as it does from a background in stand-alone personal computers, it
has little experience of enterprise data processing. It knows this very well
and is taking steps to remedy its deficiencies.
But multiuser computing is complex and critics argue that Windows NT will
have to go through several versions before it approaches the reliability and
robustness of Unix.
Many believe that Unix represents the best opportunity of developing a
genuinely open operating system for the 1990s and beyond. With the loss of
an independent USL, however, there may be again a proliferation of Unix
variants - to nobody's advantage.

FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: South West Water launches Pounds 35m bond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH WEST Water yesterday announced a Pounds 35m bond issue, becoming the
second water services company in a week to launch a fund raising.
Most of the money raised through the private placement will be used to pay
for Haul-Waste, the waste management business acquired last month from
English China Clays. Of the Pounds 27.5m purchase price, Pounds 25m is due
on completion, expected within a week.
The bond issue, which is redeemable in 1998 and bears interest at 8.375 per
cent, follows last week's Pounds 144.5m rights issue and other fund raising
from Wessex Water. Wessex will use Pounds 113m of the money to buy Waste
Management Ltd from NFC, the transport and logistics group.
South West holds net cash of about Pounds 80m but decided against using the
money, most of which is in short term investments, because it is earning
reasonably high rates of interest. South West, which has one of the highest
capital expenditure plans among water companies, is likely to become a net
borrower by the end of its financial year on March 31.
Mr Ken Hill, finance director, said Haul-Waste would become South West's
main waste subsidiary.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MARINE MIDLAND Banks, Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's US subsidiary, reported a
substantial recovery from losses for both its 1992 fourth quarter and its
results for the full-year.
The New York-based bank, which has Dollars 17.1bn (Pounds 11.3bn) in assets,
said net profits in the fourth quarter were Dollars 35.7m, compared to
losses of Dollars 23.8m in the last quarter of 1991.
For the whole of 1992, net profits were Dollars 109.2m, a significant
turnround from losses of Dollars 189.9m for 1991.
Mr James Cleave, president and chief executive, said this was the first time
Marine Midland had returned to profit for three years. He said 1992 was a
benchmark year in the bank's recovery and pledged to continue to focus on
controlling expenses, especially in light of the soft New York state
regional economy.
Fourth quarter operating expenses were Dollars 241.4m, up slightly from
Dollars 238.3m in the same period of 1991. The bank's revenues in the
quarter were Dollars 283.3m, against Dollars 258.6m a year earlier.
Bad debt provisions amounted to Dollars 3.4m in the fourth quarter, down
sharply from Dollars 41m. Provisions for the whole year were Dollars 73.2m,
down from Dollars 230m in 1991.
The bank ended 1992 with a Tier One risk-weighted capital ratio of 9.12 per
cent. The return on assets rose to 0.66 per cent in 1992, against a loss on
assets of 1.06 per cent in 1991.

142m

<TEXT>
BLOCKBUSTER Entertainment, the US video rental chain which acquired the
Cityvision group in the UK, yesterday reported after-tax profits of Dollars
45.1m in the final three months of 1992, taking the total for the year to
Dollars 142m.
In the fourth quarter of 1991, Blockbuster made an after-tax profit of
Dollars 29m, and for all of 1991 Dollars 93.7m. At the earnings per share
level, the Florida-based company - whose recent expansion moves have
attempted to create a 'full-service' home entertainment group, rather than
one narrowly focused on video rental - saw a figure of 77 cents in 1992, up
from 56 cent in the previous 12 months.
Blockbuster said revenues increased by 31 per cent to Dollars 1.98bn in 1992
overall, although this partly reflected the impact of acquisitions and
expansion. In the fourth quarter, revenues for video stores which had been
in operation for more than one year increased by 5.8 per cent.
Yesterday, Blockbuster's finance director, Mr Gregory Fairbanks, was said to
be comfortable with earnings estimates for the first quarter of 1993 that
fall in the 18 to 20 cents a share range.
He also estimated that Blockbuster commanded about 15 per cent of the US
video rental market at end-1992, up from about 12 to 13 per cent in 1991.
By the end of last year, the company had 3,127 video stores, of 2,002 were
company-owned (including 775 stores in the UK, under the Ritz name). The
remainder were franchised.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Compromise may emerge on HDTV
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community member states will press on with attempts to find a
compromise over the development of cinema-quality television despite the
announcement by Philips at the weekend that it was suspending plans for mass
production of high-definition television sets.
Philips of the Netherlands and Thomson, the French electronics manufacturer,
have invested heavily in HDTV technology and the Dutch company's decision
underlines the uncertain future of the European HDTV programme.
In December, Britain blocked approval of European Commission plans to inject
Ecu500m (Pounds 406m) into the development of HDTV over five years, saying
other technologies might overtake the standards promoted by the Commission.
Philips said at the weekend there was no point producing sets to the most
advanced standards if the EC did not fund production of HDTV programmes. But
a spokesman for the industry commissioner Mr Martin Bangemann, said
yesterday there was no question of abandoning the programme at this stage.
Denmark, which holds the EC presidency, will try to break British opposition
with a new compromise proposal before the May meeting of EC
telecommunications ministers.
The Philips decision was 'obviously not a positive decision,' a Commission
official said yesterday, but he added Philips was completing research into
HDTV and would be ready to produce sets if funding was made available.
Some senior Commission officials are sceptical about the prospects for the
HDTV strategy, once seen as the flagship of an active EC industrial policy,
and believe Philips' decision could hasten its demise.

FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Furlaud named to head American
Express board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE board of directors of American Express, the troubled US travel and
financial services group, yesterday named Mr Richard Furlaud as its new
non-executive chairman, replacing Mr James Robinson, who resigned at the
weekend.
The election of the 68-year-old Mr Furlaud, a former president of Bristol
Myers Squibb and a member of the American Express board since 1972, caps a
week of internecine boardroom politics at the company.
Mr Robinson said he would sever all ties to the company last Saturday, only
five days after he had staged a counter-coup by having himself re-confirmed
as group chairman and taking over the same role at Shearson Lehman, the
lossmaking investment banking and brokerage arm.
Mr Robinson's departure and the swift election of Mr Furlaud followed
protests from institutional shareholders to Mr Harvey Golub, the man who
last Monday took over as group chief executive from Mr Robinson.
American Express stock rose by Dollars 1 5/8 yesterday in unusually heavy
trading before closing in New York at Dollars 24 3/4 .
Mr John Keefe, an independent financial services industry analyst in New
York, said the stock market was expressing its approval for the latest turn
of events.
American Express, which is still suffering from shattered morale and the
damage to its reputation caused by last week's management upheavals, sought
yesterday to reassure the market by defining Mr Furlaud's responsibilities
as clearly as possible.
It said that, as chairman, Mr Furlaud would be responsible 'for ensuring
that appropriate issues are identified for the directors to consider,
determining the agenda for board meetings and seeing that significant
matters of interest to shareholders are reviewed by the board'.
Mr Furlaud said he would work with Mr Golub 'to implement the strategies in
place to build the American Express brand franchise, restore Shearson Lehman
Brothers to profitability and strengthen the company's balance sheet'.
Uncertainty remains about the leadership of Shearson. Investors were
outraged last week when Mr Robinson pushed aside Mr Howard Clark Jr, the
Shearson chairman, and assumed the twin roles of both chairman and chief
executive.
It is not known whether Mr Clark might be re-instated at Shearson. American
Express said Mr Golub would work with the board at Shearson on a succession
plan 'to deal with the longer-term executive management structure of the
firm'.
Mr Furlaud was president of Bristol-Myers from 1989 to 1992 and was chairman
and chief executive of Squibb before its merger with Bristol-Myers.
At American Express he serves as chairman of the board's compensation,
benefits and nominating committee and as a director of Shearson.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Losses for Gooda Walker syndicates put at Pounds 924m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOODA WALKER syndicates at Lloyd's of London suffered losses of nearly
Pounds 924m in the four years to 1990 - possibly the largest experienced on
the insurance market - according to estimates released yesterday.
An interim report from GW Run-Off, the agency managing the defunct
syndicates, showed losses for 1989 of Pounds 621m - or nearly 30 per cent of
losses across the entire Lloyd's insurance market for the year.
Some 4,000 Names - the individuals whose assets underwrite the market - on
the seven Gooda syndicates also received initial estimated losses for the
1990 underwriting year of Pounds 188m.
Mr Michael Deeny, chairman-elect of the Gooda Walker Action Group, said last
night: 'This is absolutely horrific. It's larger than we expected and very
depressing for Lloyd's Names.'
But Mr Ralph Sharp, GW Run-Off chairman, said the estimates could increase
substantially because they took no account of asbestosis and pollution
losses or allowances for the collapse of reinsurance companies.
In a measure of the difficulty facing Names, the report showed that only two
thirds of the Pounds 598m in calls made from syndicates during 1991 and 1992
had been received by the end of last year.
Syndicate 387 alone posted losses of 750 per cent of its underwriting
capacity for 1989, the last year in which it wrote insurance business and
the highest proportion on a Lloyd's syndicate.
The other syndicates - 164, 290, 295, 296, 298 and 299 - showed losses of
between 5 per cent and 150 per cent in 1986-90.
Additional costs for 1986-89 rose by Pounds 142m, of which Pounds 46m was
attributed to exchange rate losses and Pounds 24m was in further reserves
against claims connected with Hurricane Hugo.
GW Run-Off said that it was investigating several aspects of the management
of the Gooda syndicates, including 'under-reserving' - making insufficient
provision against possible losses - on syndicates 164 and 290, and bonuses
and salaries paid to former staff and a fleet of cars charged to syndicate
funds.
The report criticised Lloyd's for charging Pounds 12m in interest payments
at 5 per cent over UK base rates on overdrawn money held with the market. Mr
Sharp called the charges 'excessive'.
But Lloyd's defended its decision, which it said had been reviewed as
recently as December. It also said the losses were in line with estimates it
calculated late last year. It was confident these could be supported within
the Central Fund, which meets claims Lloyd's Names cannot.
Mr Deeny said Names were to issue writs alleging negligence against Gooda
Walker and other agencies within the next month.

FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: BOC in Pounds 48m drug deal with Du Pont
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOC, the healthcare and industrial gases group, yesterday announced it had
purchased the Brevibloc European and North American operations of Du Pont
Merck Pharmaceutical for Dollars 72.5m (Pounds 48m).
Brevibloc is a drug used in operating theatres to control heart rate and
blood pressure.
The product will be marketed by Anaquest, BOC's pharmaceuticals division
which specialises in products aimed at anaesthetists.
The business, which last year generated sales of Dollars 15m, has been
growing at more than 20 per cent a year, according to BOC.
The group said it hoped to be able to use its specialist marketing force to
boost Brevibloc's sales. Mr Roger Stoll, president of BOC Health Care, said
the drug complemented its current portfolio of anaesthetic and acute care
drugs.
Du Pont Merck is retaining the product rights in markets outside North
America and Europe.
Mr Joseph Mollica, president of Du Pont Merck Pharmaceutical, said:
'Brevibloc no longer fits in our core business strategy that focuses on the
office-based physician market-place.'
The move is part of BOC's efforts to boost its healthcare operations which
increased sales by 4.2 per cent to Pounds 512m last year.
BOC needs to lift its US revenues following the expiry at the end of last
month of the American patents for Forane, its anaesthetic.
Anaesthetics represent about 60 per cent of the group's health-related
profits, according to Kleinwort Benson.

INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the US computer company reeling from
declining sales in its key mainframe market, is today expected to unveil its
first machine using parallel processing, a relatively new technology which
could help shore up its mainframe revenues.
The company is due to hold a news conference to discuss a new scalable
parallel processing system and enhancements to its existing family of
RISC-based (reduced instruction set computing) workstations.
Parallel processing involves using a multitude of off-the-shelf
microprocessors to solve problems.
Traditional mainframes use a few, very fast and very expensive processors.
Parallel processing, which offers buyers much cheaper computing power, has
already been introduced commercially by companies such as Hewlett-Packard
and NRC.
IBM will follow up this announcement on February 9 by unveiling enhancements
to its ES/9000 mainframe line.

FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Accounting change leads to
Dollars 20.8bn charge for GM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors, the struggling US carmaker, announced last night that it
would take a Dollars 20.8bn after-tax charge to comply with a new standard
of accounting for the post-retirement health benefits of employees.
The company also announced it would be taking a much larger-than-expected
fourth-quarter charge relating to its plan to sell a significant proportion
of its stake in National Car Rental Systems.
This is now expected to work through at Dollars 744m after tax. The company
previously suggested a Dollars 300m charge might be necessary. It said the
increase related primarily to the write-off of goodwill on NCRS' books.
All US companies have to adopt the new accounting standard, but GM's charge
is expected to be by far the biggest of any corporation, because of both the
company's size and the age profile of its workforce.
GM stressed that the charge - which works through at Dollars 33.38 a share,
and will be applied retroactively to January last year - is a non-cash item
which will not affect the company's cash flow or ability to pay dividends.
However, it will cause a major dent in the equity on the company's balance
sheet.
The accounting standard, FASB 106, involves changing from a system of
recognising the cost of retiree health benefits when the money is paid out,
to a system of recognising the expense when the obligation is incurred.
Companies could choose either take a charge for catching up on past
obligations in one go, as GM has done, or amortise the cost over 20 years.
Mr Richard Wagoner, chief financial officer, said GM had decided on a
one-time charge.
Companies also have an additional ongoing annual charge, which GM said would
amount to Dollars 1.4bn, or Dollars 2.05 a share, in 1992.
The size of the charge was no surprise to Wall Street, since GM had
signalled that it faced an obligation of roughly this size. The only
question was whether it would take it in one go, or over 20 years.
Mr Wagoner said GM continued to be encouraged by recent trends in its
loss-making North American operations and continued to aim for break-even
there in 1993 before interest, tax and FASB 106 expenses.
GM yesterday also elected two new non-executive board members: Dr Louis
Sullivan, president of the Morehouse college school of medicine who was
health secretary under President Bush; and Mr John Bryan, chairman of foods
group Sara Lee.

FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: BA files new USAir investment
agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways, which earlier this year invested Dollars 300m in USAir in
return for a potential 19.9 per cent stake, last night filed with the US
Securities and Exchange Commission details of its revised investment
agreement, writes Nikki Tait in New York.
The new SEC filing runs to around 300 pages, and will be subject to minute
scrutiny by lawyers for the big US airlines - American, United, and Delta -
who are opposed to the BA-USAir deal. It was the small print contained in an
earlier Dollars 750m investment proposal between BA and USAir - in
particular, certain 'negative control' provisions - which allowed the 'big
three' US carriers to lobby successfully against that transaction.
Last night, lawyers for the leading US carriers had yet to receive copies of
the new filing and were unable to comment on it. However, the wording in the
current document is considerably more complex than in last year's investment
agreement and, from a legal standpoint, BA's advisors appear to have crafted
the revised transaction so as to minimise the possible resistance.
Even so, there will be hurdles. Earlier in the day, for example, the US
carriers petitioned the US Department of Transportation, noting that the new
transaction appeared to envisage BA's having three board seats at USAir - a
figure confirmed by last night's filing - and warning that the deal could
restrict USAir's future ability to issue new securities in cash-raising
moves. This, said the US carriers, could prevent USAir from taking truly
independent decisions, and 'enhance BA's grip' over USAir.
The new investment agreement does, indeed, give BA certain pre-emptive
rights if USAir issues new securities.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Biggest airline reservation systems merge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE merger of two of the world's biggest airline computer reservation
systems was finalised yesterday, creating a new company called Galileo
International.
Galileo International will combine the European Galileo network with the US
Covia-Apollo reservation system. The move will result in job losses at the
Galileo data centre in Swindon, Wiltshire, whose data processing operations
will be absorbed over the next 12 months by a combined facility in Denver,
Colorado.
Computer reservation systems have increasingly become a key weapon in the
competitive arsenal of international airlines. But the huge cost of setting
up and operating these systems has forced airlines to try to pool resources.
Shareholders in the new company will include British Airways, United
Airlines, USAir, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair, Alitalia, Aer Lingus,
Air Canada, Olympic Airways, TAP Air Portugal and Austrian Airlines.
The new company, which claims to be the first global computer reservation
system group, will be 50 per cent owned by European carriers and 50 per cent
owned by US airlines. Its headquarters will be in Chicago.
It will maintain a marketing and product development facility at Swindon,
where some staff will be redeployed. Its main competitor is the Sabre
network owned by American Airlines, which attempted but failed two years ago
to merge with another European computer reservation system, called Amadeus.
However, the Galileo-Apollo merger still has to be approved by US and
European Commission regulators.
On both sides of the Atlantic, regulators are considering introducing new
rules for computer reservation systems to prevent distortions in airline
competition by the use of these powerful networks.
Mr Giovanni Bisignani, the chief executive of Alitalia, has been chosen as
chairman of the new merged company, which claims a 30 per cent share of the
world airline reservation market.
He said yesterday that the new company was 'a combination of two recognised
computer reservation market leaders with a long success story of
co-operation'.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Far right in Austria fails with petition
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRIA'S right-wing Freedom Party (FPO) and its charismatic leader, Mr Jorg
Haider, suffered a stinging setback yesterday, when a mass petition directed
against foreigners only drew the signatures of 415,00 people, half the
number he had sought.
Only 7 per cent of voters put their signatures to the petition, which calls
for stricter immigration laws and a constitutional amendment stating:
'Austria is not an immigration country'.
Mr Haider had hoped for backing from more than 1m people.
Even though the petition is non-binding, a higher turnout would have put the
coalition government on the defensive. Because more than 100,000 signed the
petition during the eight-day registration period, the Austrian parliament
is now required to debate its contents, although it can then safely ignore
it.
But as he is riding on a wave of economic and social discontent, Mr Haider
is expected to score further successes in regional elections later this
year.
The Freedom Party leader blamed what he called unfair local authority
restrictions for the disappointing results. But mobilisation of a broad
coalition against the petition had deterred voters from signing. Last
weekend 200,000 people demonstrated in Vienna against racism.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Cambodia fighting erupts again: Government attacks against
Khmer Rouge inflict further damage on UN credibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PHNOM PENH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CAMBODIAN government forces have launched an offensive against Khmer Rouge
guerrillas on several fronts in the worst fighting since the United Nations
peacekeeping mission was established a year ago.
The UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) yesterday announced a
catalogue of ceasefire violations since Friday in five of the 11 military
sectors into which the UN has divided the country, including exchanges of
artillery and mortar fire.
Although the ceasefire has been in tatters for months, and there were no
immediate reports of heavy casualties, the offensive will inflict further
damage on Untac's credibility as it attempts to prepare for elections in
May.
Untac officials said villagers in some areas had fled their homes and
government troops had conscripted civilians and former refugees recently
repatriated from Thailand. Some were reportedly being used as forced labour
to carry ammunition, a practice previously associated with the Khmer Rouge
and the military junta in Burma.
The Khmer Rouge had almost from the start refused to co-operate with Untac,
participate in elections or abide by the peace agreements it signed in 1991,
forcing the UN to acknowledge that the existing administration of Mr Hun
Sen, the prime minister, had the right to defend itself.
Yesterday, however, Untac said the latest government offensive could not be
justified by concerns about security.
Officials of the Vietnamese-installed Cambodian government, many of them
corrupt and unpopular, are worried about their likely performance in the
elections and are probably mounting the offensive in an attempt to
strengthen their grip on the countryside. This would give them a stronger
hand in any negotiations to form a coalition after the elections.
Khmer Rouge leaders are boycotting the polls but are banking on being
included in a future administration by Cambodian politicians who will want
to avoid the permanent partitioning of the country into Khmer Rouge and
government zones.
Among other attacks, government forces in the west have advanced to within
20km of Pailin, the Khmer Rouge headquarters near the border with Thailand.
Further incidents were reported from a swathe of territory in the north and
north-east of Cambodia. Troops of Funcinpec, the royalist party, were
involved in at least one clash, but most of the fighting was between the
government and the Khmer Rouge.
The Khmer Rouge was blamed for the deaths of 1m Cambodians during its reign
of terror between 1975 and 1978, when Vietnam invaded and installed a new,
pro-Vietnamese communist government.
UN military observers and electoral workers have often been impressed with
the commitment and discipline of the Khmer Rouge troops they have
encountered, and Untac officials have therefore been surprised by the
success of recent government offensives.
However, there have been signs of differences within Khmer Rouge ranks. Some
Khmer Rouge guerrillas have registered to vote. According to a senior Untac
officer, at least one Khmer Rouge commander refused to join in a previous
battle for the defence of Pailin a few weeks ago.

FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Japanese oil refiner surprises
with large increase in dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE conflicting corporate philosophies of the US and Japan were brought
sharply into focus yesterday when Tonen, a Japanese oil refiner in which
Exxon and Mobil, the US oil companies, each have a 25 per cent stake,
unveiled a hefty dividend increase.
Japan's meagre dividend levels have been cited by Washington as a
'structural impediment' to trade and condemned by Japanese life companies.
But Tonen is the talk of Tokyo not because the payout is too small, but
because it is too large and getting larger.
The ratio of Tonen's dividend to net profits has risen from 37.6 per cent in
1987, to 93.7 per cent in 1990 and, for the year just ended, a mighty 174
per cent, much to the discomfort of its Japanese managers, who would prefer
to bolster the company's reserves.
Mr Takuya Fujimura, managing director, said Tonen had been 'requested' by
Exxon and Mobil to increase the dividend, and the rise from Y26 in 1991 to
Y50 was made after considering relevant circumstances. One such circumstance
is that the two US oil companies, if they joined forces, would hold sway at
a shareholders' meeting.
Tonen's pre-tax profit for the year to December is expected to fall 5 per
cent to Y32.7bn (Dollars 262m), while sales slipped 14 per cent to Y558bn.
In attempting to save face in announcing the year-end dividend of Y37.5,
following a Y12.5 interim payout, the company found two handy anniversaries
on which to hang the increase.
One, coming a year early, was the establishment, in 1893, of a Mobil unit in
Yokohama; the other was that an Exxon Japanese subsidiary began business in
Japan in 1962. Japanese brokers were wondering aloud last night what
anniversary would be found to justify the next payout.
The average Japanese payout last fiscal year was about 38 per cent, though
the Life Insurance Association of Japan found that 46 per cent of companies
held the payout ratio below 30 per cent. It said the average yield on
Japanese equity was around 1.97 per cent - about one-third that of the US -
while the yield on the 225 stocks in Tokyo's Nikkei index was a slim 0.89
per cent in calendar 1992.
About 20 per cent of Japanese companies plan to cut or suspend dividends in
the year to end-March, and most will leave the amount unchanged.

FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Chubb lifted by investment gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and AP-DJ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHUBB, the US insurer, yesterday lifted after-tax profits to Dollars 617.1m,
or Dollars 6.96 a share, in the 12 months to the end of December, compared
with Dollars 552m, or Dollars 6.32, in 1991.
In the fourth quarter, the New Jersey-based company made a net profit of
Dollars 197.5m, or Dollars 2.21 a share, up from Dollars 139.3m, or Dollars
1.58, a year earlier.
The annual results came after realised investment gains of Dollars 123.6m,
compared with Dollars 43.4m in the previous year. They also reflected a
deterioration on the underwriting front, with Chubb returning a Dollars
15.3m underwriting loss, against an Dollars 18.6m surplus in 1991.
This was partly due to heavy catastrophe losses, which have affected the
industry generally. Chubb's catastrophe losses last year were Dollars
175.3m, compared with Dollars 71.6m in 1991.
American General unveiled after-tax profits of Dollars 532.7m, or Dollars
4.89 a share, in 1992, compared with Dollars 480.2m, or Dollars 4.25, in the
previous year.
The Houston-based financial services and insurance company said that
operating earnings, ahead of realised investment gains, were Dollars 523.7m,
compared with Dollars 479.4m in 1991.
Standard &amp; Poor's has lowered its rating on the claims-paying ability of
Hannover Reinsurance to Double-A-Plus from Triple-A, AP-DJ reports from New
York. The downgrade reflects lower operating results and S&amp;P's expectation
that future earnings will remain under pressure.
'Operating results in the last five years have been very volatile despite
the company's cyclical underwriting strategy,' S&amp;P said. Hannover Re's
combined ratio over the period has fluctuated between 109.5 per cent and
124.2 per cent.

FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: A distinctive formula for success - Andrew
Bolger on expanding Motor World and plans for its market debut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTOR WORLD, the UK's biggest independent chain of stores selling car parts
and accessories, is to be launched on the stock market with a value of about
Pounds 28m.
The Bradford-based group will raise Pounds 12.5m by selling shares, at a
price to be announced on Thursday, through a placing fully underwritten by
Beeson Gregory, its stockbroker.
Motor World has 178 outlets, mainly in the north of England, Wales and the
Midlands, and plans to build a national network for its distinctive formula.
Unlike Halfords, the market leader, Motor World eschews prime high street
sites and large out-of-town 'sheds'. Its stores offer seven-day trading in
cheaper locations away from the high street, usually on busy main roads with
parking facilities.
Each outlet carries about 4,000 items and also offers a 24-hour order
service for parts and accessories not in stock. Staff are trained to advise
customers on what to buy and the shops stock Haynes Manuals for 150 types of
car, to encourage DIY maintenance.
Mr Darrell Kershaw, managing director, believes the chain could expand to
300 outlets within two years, with depressed property prices and acquisition
opportunities giving it an ideal chance to move into the south-east of
England and Scotland.
Motor World has lifted profits at an annual rate of 30 per cent over the
past three years and made operating profits of Pounds 3.51m on turnover of
Pounds 34.5m in the 12 months to November.
The group has four divisions - retail, distribution, packaging and
manufacturing - all aimed at the motor market.
In 1988 Mr Kershaw led an Pounds 8m management buy-out, backed by Candover
Investments, of Motor World from Mr Michael Stanford, who started the
business in 1968 and steadily expanded it, augmented by acquisitions of
small chains of shops from receivers.
The MBO team acquired 101 Motor World outlets and Panther, a business
established in 1982 which buys car parts and accessories in bulk to package
and distribute, either under the Panther name or the brand label of
retailing and wholesale customers.
In 1989 Motor World decided to get into the fast-fit exhaust market. It paid
Pounds 5m for Autogem Holdings, which had six exhaust-fitting service
centres, and its two related manufacturing subsidiaries, Genex and KRC,
which make metal pressing and rubber mouldings.
Although the Autogem exhaust-fitting centres were profitable and remain so,
Mr Kershaw said he quickly recognised that opening this type of outlet was
much more expensive than the modest outlay required for a typical Motor
World shop.
Instead, Autogem has been developed as the UK's largest supplier of exhaust
system supports to fast-fit retailers such as Kwik-Fit and Superdrive. A
warehouse/distribution centre just off the M1/M62 carries 6,000 product
lines, offers next-day delivery service throughout Britain, and serves many
export markets. Autogem's products are sold to smaller garages and workshops
through Motopax, a separate trading division.
Motor World's main business is, however, the retail outlets, which in the
year to November accounted for 72 per cent of sales and 64 per cent of group
operating profit. Building a national chain is the group's key priority.
Mr Kershaw, a hard-headed Yorkshireman who trained as a motor mechanic, said
his warehouse at Bradford could service 300 shops, and had land adjoining if
more space was needed. But all Motor World stores must make a profit.
He said: 'I'm just as proud to close a shop, as to open one. We give every
shop 12 to 18 months and then if, in spite of our best efforts, it is not
making a profit, we close it.'
Although Motor World has closed 30 outlets over the years, the group only
has one unlet unit on its books. Mr Kershaw said that because of the modest
size and convenience of the sites, the group had found it easy to sub-let
premises to other shopkeepers when necessary.
The group, which employs 877 people, believes that benefits of scale in
buying and distribution will give it an advantage over small independent
stores, which are its main competition.
As well as expanding organically and by acquisition, Mr Kershaw aims to
increase the amount spent by individual customer by stocking more expensive
items, such as audio and security products. Last year the group paid Pounds
360,000 for Eurocar, a company with two outlets in West Yorkshire which
supplies in-car entertainment and security systems.
Once again, the canniness which has seen Motor World raise profits through
recession is to the fore. Although 60 group stores now sell audio products,
Mr Kershaw is still testing the economics of Eurocar's service of fitting

FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Debenture holders approve L&amp;P plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
LONDON &amp; PROVINCIAL, the troubled property group, yesterday won approval for
its plan to repay Pounds 135m of debentures at less than their face value,
the first time in recent memory that holders of secured bonds have accepted
such a loss.
At a meeting called for the purpose, holders of 92 per cent of the bonds by
value agreed to accept the company's offer of Pounds 95 for every Pounds 100
of stock held.
They will also receive accrued interest amounting to 430p for every Pounds
100 of stock.
The overwhelming support for the offer, with none of the 67 bond holders
voting against, reflected a general belief that the offer was generous in
the circumstances.
Property securing the bonds has halved in value since the summer of 1990,
and the company warned investors at the end of last year that it would not
be able to meet interest payments.
Citibank, banker to the Randsworth group, the parent of London &amp; Provincial
which is in receivership, has provided the cash to repay bond holders, the
company said.
The deal will increase the bank's exposure to the group as a whole by Pounds
109m to some Pounds 333m.
At the beginning of January, Citibank announced its intention to make an
offer for the property group's shares through an investment subsidiary,
though no bid has yet been made.

FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Banque Indosuez in move to new
HQ

<TEXT>
BANQUE INDOSUEZ, one of France's leading investment banks, is moving out of
central Paris into the suburbs to a new corporate headquarters in the old BP
Tower, the office block at the centre of a recent property scandal.
The move comes as Indosuez, part of the Suez industrial group, is trying to
raise capital and cut costs to offset the steep provisions it has been
forced to make on the losses on its property and business loans portfolios.
Late last year, Indosuez, which saw its net profits fall to FFr82m in the
first half of 1992 from FFr517m in the same period a year earlier, raised
FFr400m from the sale and leaseback of its prestige headquarters in the
heart of the Paris banking district.
It plans in 1996 to move all its operations, currently spread between five
different buildings, into the BP Tower, now renamed the Paul Doumer Tower.
The BP Tower has been clouded by controversy since the discovery of
irregularities in its sale to Lucia, a French property company then headed
by Mr Christian Pellerin.
Indosuez last month participated in a recapitalisation of Lucia, in which
Suez, its parent company, is a minority shareholder with other French
financial institutions.
The move for Indoseuz forms part of the trend for large companies to move
out of central Paris. Societe Generale, another leading French bank, is
leaving its Boulevard Haussman headquarters in 1995 to move to the La
Defense business district.
Ironically, the drift to the suburbs is intensifying the financial pressure
on companies which have large property holdings in the French capital. The
Paris property market is in a precarious state with average rentals down by
20 per cent in the past three years. The move out of the city centre is
aggravating this problem by increasing the number of properties available
for sale or rental.

<TEXT>
THE North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) is a threat to the global
trading system and could shrink the amount of capital and technology flowing
into China, a leading Chinese newspaper warned yesterday, Reuter reports
from Beijing.
The economic grouping of the US, Canada and Mexico is a blow to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), according to the Guangming Daily.
China should counter the threat by gaining a foothold in the North American
market before Nafta formally takes effect next year.
The paper said trade with North America accounted for 12.26 per cent of
China's total, excluding a huge volume of trade that passed through Hong
Kong. The US is a key source of capital and technology.
China and Mexico produce many similar goods for export. The newspaper argued
that Mexican manufacturers would enjoy a competitive advantage within Nafta.
China is pressing hard to be allowed back into Gatt, which it quit after the
Communists took power. It has adopted a series of market-opening measures
over the past year and is strengthening copyright protection laws.

THE WORLD Bank is to lend Lebanon Dollars 175m for rebuilding the country's
infrastructure, devastated by 15 years of civil war, Reuter reports from
Beirut.
Officials said yesterday an initial agreement was signed in Washington last
week and the loan would be granted after parliamentary approval.
The loan agreement, the first between Lebanon and the World Bank in 14
years, was reached after months of negotiations. Lebanon would pay back the
loan over 17 years, with a five-year exemption and at an interest rate of
7.5 per cent.
Lebanon managed to limit foreign debts to about Dollars 800m despite the
1975-90 civil war. Its internal debt is estimated at more than Dollars
2.4bn.
Officials said the loan reflected growing international confidence in the
government of Mr Rafik al-Hariri, the billionaire prime minister.
Economists and bankers said that although the loan was significant it was
only a small step in the right direction.
According to the agreement, Lebanon would use Dollars 35m to rebuild its
power grid, Dollars 60m on water and sewage systems, Dollars 25m on housing,
Dollars 30m on garbage incineration, Dollars 15m on vocational schools, and
Dollars 10m on technical aid.

<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE Telekom, the German state telephone monopoly, urgently needs to
expand its capital base through privatisation, in order to help finance a
DM60bn (Dollars 38bn) investment programme in east Germany.
Mr Helmut Ricke, the chief executive, said yesterday that the investment
programme, under which DM11bn was spent in 1992 and the same amount again is
planned this year, would run up huge debt servicing costs unless the
privatisation plan was approved by the German Bundestag in the near future.
He said that the telecommunications giant managed to install more than 25
per cent more telephone connections in the former Communist part of Germany
last year than it originally planned: 758,000, compared with a target of
600,000. Yet the company still faces a backlog of 2m requests for new phone
lines.
Details of the extraordinary telecommunications investment programme were
presented by Mr Ricke yesterday, in a defence of the decision not to open
the east German market to wider international competition. At the same time
he warned that the planned privatisation of Deutsche Telekom was urgently
needed 'so that we won't have to hold back our investments because of our
capital base'.
The German government plans to sell off 49 per cent of the state monopoly to
private shareholders, but has to reach agreement with the opposition Social
Democrats first, in order to change the constitution to allow privatisation
to go ahead. Mr Ricke said last week he expected the first shares to be sold
in 1994 or 1995.
He said that Deutsche Telekom created 1,500 jobs directly in east Germany
last year through its investments, and ensured the preservation of 100,000
more jobs through its contracts to east German enterprises. Of the DM11bn
spent on the overhaul of the entire network, DM5bn was spent directly in
east Germany.
Dr Wilhelm Pallmann, the director responsible for the eastern investment
programme, said there were now 20 telephones per 100 inhabitants, compared
with 11.6 in 1989, and around 50 per 100 inhabitants in west Germany. The
two halves of the country should be equally well equipped by 1997, when the
Telekom DM60bn investment programme comes to an end.

<TEXT>
Controversy always surrounds America's number one spy. So when Jim Woolsey
appears before the US Senate today for confirmation hearings on his
suitability as the next head of the CIA, he can expect a third-degree
interrogation.
Liberals will want to know whether he is a cold war warrior in disguise
while the conservatives will want to be reassured that he is hawkish enough
for their tastes. Like his new commander-in-chief, the 51-year-old Woolsey
started in the sticks - Oklahoma - before climbing that well known path to
power: Stanford, opposition to the war in Vietnam, a Rhodes scholarship to
Oxford and Yale Law School.
But Jim Woolsey is not as buttoned-down as he seems. Just as his president
seeks relief with the saxophone, Woolsey is a fiendish ballroom dancer, a
one-time instructor at the Arthur Murray school. He is also a deep devotee
of baseball, and not above drawing lessons from the game that are applicable
to intelligence-gathering.
One thing he will have to come to grips with, however, is a change in
life-style. After a particularly good party a few weeks ago, Woolsey
received a late night call from the CIA. Would the director-designate please
close his front door and, while he was at it, kindly stop leaving the key
under the mat.

The hot money is still on an internal candidate to replace Rupert

intellectually sparky, tends to be hostile to would-be editors from outside.
But one possible outside candidate has insider qualifications.
Sarah Hogg, head of the Number 10 policy unit, is a former economics editor
of The Economist. She also proposed Pennant-Rea for his new post at a late
stage in the Whitehall job search.
What could be neater, now that it's all hard grind in Downing Street, to

A small rebellion put Rio de Janeiro out of step for a time with the rest of
Brazil. The fun-loving capital refused to turn its clocks back in line with
the rest of the country.
Rio's decision to stay on summertime caused chaos in the city yesterday,
particularly as the digital clocks placed along the beach are owned by the
central government and were showing the new time. Radio commentators did not
know what time to give, resorting to 'it's 10 minutes past the hour'.
Airlines flying in and out of Rio had no idea whether aircraft were running
on Rio time or Brazil time.
Paulino Cicero, Brazil's minister of mines and energy, called it an act of
'insurrection', and a bitter blow for a country which always prided itself
on its unity. Cesar Maia, Rio's new mayor, said it was all part of his new
campaign to give his sun-worshipping citizens more time on the beach before
lights out. But after a meeting with President Itamar Franco he agreed
reluctantly to set the city's clocks back one hour putting his own and the
president's watches once more in perfect harmony.

To whit he has ordered 30 copies of the Yes, Minister, and Yes, Prime

assumed that Sir Humphrey and Machiavelli will continue to rule during what
Rasmussen claims will be his 'decade of decency'.

<TEXT>
One of the more fascinating sub-plots in the hunt for the next boss of IBM
is that it has thrown together the world's two top headhunters - Tom Neff
and Gerry Roche. If it were any other company than IBM, it would be hard to
imagine two of the world's most competitive headhunters being asked to bury
their differences and share their contact books.
It is highly unusual for a firm to advertise its use of headhunters and even
more unusual to hire two. However, IBM has announced that it has retained
Heidrick &amp; Struggles and Spencer Stuart, two of the top four US-based
headhunters. The advantage of having two firms is that it proves to
investors that everything is being done to find the right man.
It also overcomes the problem of headhunters who are barred from poaching
executives of firms they have recently worked for because of self-imposed
off-limits rules. Even headhunters have ethics, it seems. If IBM is going to
find a wunderkind, then these two should be able to do it.
The downside is that they are fiercely competitive. Heidrick &amp; Struggles'
Roche is the acknowledged king of the headhunters. He was the man who found
Apple's John Sculley, for example. However, Spencer Stuart's Neff is said to
be coming up fast and has his eye on Roche's crown.
Jim Kennedy, editor of Executive Recruiter News, describes him as 'the young
bull challenger to the old smoothie Roche'.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Leading Article: ICI pays up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STROKING Britain's recession- weary business community is likely to be a
central theme in the government's forthcoming budget. But while Prime
Minister John Major is keen to employ interest rate cuts and tax breaks as
evidence that economic growth and an export-led recovery really are at the
top of his agenda, British companies continue to resist the message.
Mr Major's heart will have sunk yesterday morning on seeing details of the
latest pay package agreed by Imperial Chemical Industries. Manual workers at
three ICI plants can expect to receive double-digit pay rises this financial
year followed by an extra 4 per cent a year for two more years on top of the
annual pay round. The agreement should in time cover all ICI's 20,000 manual
workers. Meanwhile, the government, struggling to control the growing fiscal
deficit and prevent sterling's recent devaluation from feeding into wage
settlements, has imposed a 1 1/2 per cent ceiling on public sector pay
increases.
Hold on a moment, ICI's management will say. Our pay package does look a
little embarrassing for the government, but this comparison with the public
sector really is not valid.
This year's pay increase, agreed last June, was only 5.1 per cent, perhaps a
little high compared with inflationary expectations but not out of line with
average pay settlements at the time. The extra 6 per cent increase this year
is in exchange for changes in shift patterns and other radical changes in
working practices which will produce an equivalent saving. ICI knows its
business and is updating its working practices in order to compete in the
global market-place in the 1990s.
ICI, they will argue, acknowledges that the end of a recession is not the
best time to agree a real increase of 10 per cent; but the negotiations were
started two years ago when an imminent recovery was confidently expected. Of
course ICI would have preferred to achieve the changes without needing to
offer this financial incentive to the workforce to co-operate; but the
threat of industrial action in a capital-intensive industry is too harrowing
to consider, however high the official unemployment rate.
True, this pay package means the productivity gains will be used to increase
workers' pay rather than to cut prices and increase exports to close
Britain's gaping trade deficit; but the macroeconomy is the government's
business. And yes, workers at Rover agreed last year to a radical change in
working practices, in order to match Japanese productivity levels, while
receiving no specific payments in return; but Rover is a special case.
Offering large financial carrots in exchange for productivity increases is
standard British practice.
It must cease to be so.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Personal View: Productivity leads America's recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN ROACH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a quiet transformation now shaping the basic fabric of the US
economy. The evidence: an impressive turnround in productivity, the magic
elixir that hold the key to any nation's standard of living. Over the past
year and a half, business productivity has risen at a 2.5 per cent rate -
about double the rate that would have been expected in this anaemic recovery
and all the more encouraging when compared with average increases of only
0.2 per cent from 1987 to 1991.
Productivity improvements in the US stem from the most powerful economic
force of all - global competition. Record trade deficits forced
manufacturing companies to slash costs with a vengeance. Now the pendulum of
global competition has swung into the service sector, with deregulation and
globalisation prompting a new wave of restructuring - hitting banks,
airlines, telecommunications, retailers, insurance, advertising, accounting,
and the legal profession.
The dark side to this outcome has not been lost on America's once sacrosanct
white-collar workers. White-collar hiring in services has screeched to a
standstill - rising only 0.2 per cent in 1991, easily the weakest
performance in more than 20 years. And with private service industries
accounting for literally three out of every four workers currently employed
in the US, the outcome has been a dramatic compression in overall job
creation.
What is critical to appreciate, however, is that today's pain could well be
laying the foundation for lasting gain. Many positive benefits are already
apparent. Reflecting intense cost cutting, business unit labour costs are
now up only 0.5 per cent over the past year, a very hopeful sign for the
inflation prognosis.
Indeed, disinflation is the silver lining of a productivity-led recovery,
broadening the purchasing power of beleaguered consumers, and auguring well
for further reductions in longer-term interest rates. Needless to say, the
beneficial impacts of such a productivity-led recovery may be difficult to
appreciate in today's tough economic climate. That is because the US economy
is still in the first stage of a productivity revival. The victims of
restructuring are fearful of permanent job loss. And survivors are hurting
as well - less secure about their job prospects and working longer and
harder than ever before.
Of course, productivity gains cannot be sustained just by adhering to the
slash-and-burn strategies of intensified cost cutting. Such an outcome would
lead to a 'hollowing' of corporate America at precisely the time when
rebuilding is essential to maintain global market share in an ever-expanding
global economy. Thus, the second phase of a productivity-led recovery
requires companies to look beyond restructuring - embarking on a bold course
of enhanced capital formation and providing workers with the latest in
technologically sophisticated tools needed for improved efficiency
solutions.
There is also a third phase, entailing long-overdue upgrading of the quality
of human capital - giving workers a new set of intellectual tools, so they
can work smarter, continually pushing out the envelope of discovery and
innovation.
A key goal in the 1990s should be to craft economic policies that provide
further impetus to this nascent productivity-led recovery. Incentives for
capital formation are critical, and in this regard President Clinton is to
be commended for his support of an investment tax credit, defence conversion
and a permanent R&amp;D tax credit. Moreover, Clintonomics has much to say about
an upgrading of human capital, stressing the combination of educational
reform, apprentice programmes and worker re-training.
While these prescriptions seem to match the imperatives of productivity
enhancement, the benefits could be lost if the new president tilts away from
trade liberalisation to shelter US industry from global competition. Equally
disconcerting would be a lack of fiscal discipline  - a possibility if the
Clinton administration does not adopt a credible programme of deficit
reduction.
Policy must also be sensitive to the dark side of a productivity-led
recovery. America is now suffering from a profound loss of traditional
sources of job creation. In response, new sources of hiring must be
stimulated - not by relying on make-work pork barrel projects but through
the birth of new companies. Entrepreneurs and other risk-takers will need
incentives to fill the looming employment gap of the 1990s. Elimination of
capital gains taxes for patient investors in business start-ups - together
with an employment tax credit - would go a long way in satisfying this aim.
Such targeted incentives are the most affordable of all: no tax break
without a job-creating start-up.
Most of all, America's new leaders must now come to appreciate that the door
is open. If the US is to earn its fair share in an increasingly competitive
global market place, it must stay the course of a productivity-led recovery.
Ultimately, that's what gives workers the fairest shake of all, getting paid
a just reward for their innovative endeavours.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Cutting red tape
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH like to think of themselves as a pragmatic nation with no time
for the formalities which often burden their Continental rivals. Yet there
is growing evidence that business in the UK is hobbling through ever more
tangled lengths of red tape - not all of it imported from Brussels.
Mr John Major is not the first prime minister to declare war on the problem
and he will today meet ministers and senior civil servants to hear their
ideas for reducing the burden.
The extent of red tape has been well-documented. A small business owner
would need to read 26 booklets running to nearly 270,000 words to understand
all the regulations affecting him, one business lobby group has calculated.
The 1980 edition of one of the basic textbooks on company law ran to 486
pages in 1980. By 1991 it had expanded to 3,544 pages.
Small businesses in particular have long complained about the cost of
administering VAT and the burden of compulsory audit. In recent years
regulations have been added in food safety, child care, the environment and
transport safety. Every piece of legislation may individually make sense but
taken together they add up to a heavy burden.
The government has had a deregulation initiative in place since 1985 but has
failed to stem the tide of new regulation. What practical steps can it now
take?
First, it should resolve that new legislation will be drafted with a view to
supervising the outcome of actions rather than attempting to control the
details of the process. Business should be aware that there are effective
penalties for actions which lead to financial fraud, food poisoning or
accidents.
Within this general principle there are clearly many activities which still
need light-touch regulation. Notably, the translation of EC directives into
UK law must be monitored to prevent UK civil servants gilding the Brussels
lily.
The government has already said it plans to introduce more formal techniques
for measuring risks and assessing the cost to business of complying with new
laws. These techniques and individual assessments need to be made public.
Also, the existing deregulation drive requires a higher profile and greater
political momentum.
In the end, any system will only be as good as the officials responsible for
applying it. Training should focus on the need to enforce rules efficiently
but sensibly. The FT's own research has revealed startling examples of
official zeal.
The unseen costs of excessive regulation are considerable in terms of higher
prices, the stifling of innovation and ultimately jobs. Removing red tape is
an endless task requiring some delicate judgments but it is a challenge
which yet again requires a sustained effort from the top.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Leading Article: India needs faster reform
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Manmohan Singh was appointed India's finance minister during a
payments crisis in 1991, he said: 'We in this country have to wake up to the
harsh realities of this new world.' His economic reforms have begun to
dismantle isolationist barriers, as well as improving India's
creditworthiness and easing the bureaucratic stranglehold on business. But
as he prepares his third budget to be delivered on February 27, Mr Singh
still faces enormous tasks.
Though the economy is turning upwards and inflation is falling, exports and
foreign investment are disappointing. Moreover, the budget will launch a
session of parliament likely to be turbulent for the government of Mr P V
Narasimha Rao. The prime minister's uncertain handling of the Ayodhya temple
dispute has left his government lacking direction. A January cabinet
reshuffle carried no message, wasting an opportunity to restore leadership.
Just as financial crisis provided initial justification for economic reform,
so the political malaise provides a platform for Mr Singh's budget. He can
recreate an identity for the government by decisive action to open the
economy further.
Among the steps he should take are sharp cuts in tariffs, including those on
capital goods needed to develop infrastructure and export industries; a
shift of tax revenues away from customs duties to new sources such as a
value added tax; and reform of the financial system, including cuts in
subsidised lending, more efficient management of state-owned banks,
reorganisation of their balance sheets and injections of new capital.
Mr Singh also needs to prove that he can make the public sector shrink,
while giving those who run the administration and state corporations greater
flexibility to manage their staff. Recent disturbances may mean the time is
not right for full convertibility of the rupee, but this should be achieved
as soon as possible.
All these measures are politically charged. But all are necessary if Mr
Singh is to proceed with reform.
The international climate remains fair for India. The British business
leaders who travelled with Mr John Major last week were given a convincing
picture of the opportunities. The settlement of India's dispute with Russia
on debt payments improves the prospects for the balance of payments and for
export markets. India continues to receive substantial aid commitments.
However, foreigners must question how much reform means when aid commitments
for badly-needed infrastructure projects are not utilised because of a lack
of Indian counterpart funds. Investment projects cleared by one ministry can
be blocked by another. Foreign business people must pay more than Indians
for hotel rooms and domestic airline tickets. Even a request for
installation of a telephone line in reasonable time must go to the minister
for communications.
Mr Singh has the opportunity to erode significantly the mentality which
creates such frustrations. As a technocrat rather than a career politician,
he can be bolder than his colleagues might be. He could even, as the fruits
of reform pass into the economy, prove to be his party's saviour.

FT  02 FEB 93 / The equation that didn't add up: UK banks are rethinking
small-business policies, which could lead to more expensive loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government's inquiry into whether high-street banks are spoiling the
chances of an economic recovery by making loans to small businesses
prohibitively expensive did not end as expected. Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, started the inquiry amid a wave of public antipathy to banks.
But it ended with the conclusion that they have not behaved as badly as many
of their customers think.
The inquiry was completed last week with the announcement that banks will
allow businesses with turnovers of less than Pounds 1m to make complaints to
the banking ombudsman, as personal customers already can. In spite of a
public belief that banks had not passed on interest rate cuts to small
businesses, it found that they had only slightly widened the gap between
base rates and loan interest rates.
Yet behind this facade of stability, the banks are engaged in a fundamental
rethink of small-business lending, which could lead to far more expensive
and restrictive loans. The 1980s lending that led to talk of an 'enterprise
culture' has gone so wrong that banks are now questioning the nature of the
market. Barclays has been writing off bad loans to small businesses at the
rate of Pounds 1m a day for 18 months.
The problem of small-business lending has big implications for British bank
profitability. When banks faced growing competition in the personal and
large corporate sectors of their business in the 1980s, small corporate
lending appeared the last bastion of easy profits. Building societies were
offering rival cheque accounts to personal customers, while big companies
with better credit ratings than banks obtained money directly from wholesale
markets.
In contrast, there was slim competition in small-business lending. Fewer
than 1 per cent of the 2.9m businesses with an annual turnover of less than
Pounds 1m are estimated to sell debt to obtain working capital, a process
known as factoring. And in spite of speculation about competition from
foreign banks, Barclays, National Westminster, Lloyds and Midland still
provide the bulk of financial services to 84 per cent of the market.
Not only were there few rivals, but there also appeared to be little risk.
Banks thought they could charge higher margins than they would get on large
corporate lending without much threat of losing their capital. Much lending
was secured on properties of business owners, which were rising in price.
Businesses that failed presented little risk, while most thrived in the late
1980s boom.
This happy equation has since fallen apart. As businesses have failed and
property prices fallen, lending secured on property has become unsecured.
Banks have also found that some of the money they theoretically lent as
working capital was used to substitute for equity in undercapitalised
businesses. They had not followed loans closely enough to discover this.
The result was that money ploughed into the fabric of small businesses -
disguised as 'hard core' overdrafts - was impossible to get back. Banks now
grumble that the return on their loans, which seemed generous at the time,
was not enough to cover this sort of risk. 'We have been lending much too
cheaply, because we have actually provided risk capital,' says Mr David
Lavarack, Barclays' head of small business.
As banks have reassessed small- business lending, they have been faced with
the most worrying fact - they have no reliable way of calculating
profitability. In theory, banks should allocate capital by assessing the
risk of different forms of business, their profitability over a business
cycle, and overheads. By doing so, they will not be over-influenced by
profits during economic upswings, or recession losses.
In practice, banks are finding this extremely difficult. Overheads are hard
to calculate when different businesses are carried out through branches. And
financial data are not good enough to monitor rewards over past cycles.
'Banks are about five years behind other large corporations in their
financial management,' says one clearing bank director.
The finance directors of several banks are now working on producing better
profit measures. Meanwhile, banks are trying to increase profitability in
two ways.
First, they are trying to reduce risk. They are changing how they assess the
risk of loans, and trying to monitor companies once loans are made. Although
banks insist that managers have always been taught to look at cash flow
rather than loan security, the message is now being reinforced.
'I am a strong advocate of staying in touch. We and our customers benefit
from them pulling out financial data,' says Mr Lavarack.
National Westminster has devised training courses for its managers so they
can assess the competence of small-business owners more strictly. 'Often
everything is resting on a single man's shoulders,' says Ms Jane Bradford,
NatWest's head of small business.
Second, they have raised charges on services, such as cheque-clearing, and
re-examined loan margins. It is this process, carried out over the past 18
months, which led to the Treasury inquiry. Mr Terry Smith, a banking analyst
at Collins Stewart, says banks are testing the market without a sense of
what price it will bear. 'They do not actually know the level of demand,' he
says.
Banks have traditionally tried to raise charges and loan margins as
surreptitiously as possible. But this has become harder because of increased
public scrutiny, which has forced the banks to publish charters for
small-business customers, and to start notifying them of charges before they
are levied.
They have nonetheless been fairly effective in managing to hide from public
view the size of their increases in charges. Barclays and National
Westminster have disclosed that their average margin on small-business loans
has risen from 2.9 percentage points above base rate to about 3.5 points
over 18 months. But the level of fees and charges associated with these
loans has been rising much faster.
Mr Smith estimates that NatWest's commission income rose by 27.9 per cent
and Barclays' rose by 18.2 per cent in 1991, while the overall value of
transactions in the banks' clearing system fell by 0.9 per cent. He argues
that small businesses probably bore a disproportionate amount of this rise,
because there was stiffer competition among banks for personal customers.
There are still few alternatives to banks for smaller businesses. Even if
they can seek loan finance elsewhere, most small businesses rely on banks'
clearing services. While most personal customers get free banking if in
credit, business fees are rising.
'There is not a lot of choice out there, and most people are with one bank
or another,' says Mr Stan Mendham, founder of the Forum of Private Business.
Banks have made moves to offer equity finance to small companies through
venture capital. But they have little appetite for taking equity stakes in a
lot of small businesses.
Some bankers now talk of the government having to provide tax breaks if they
are to lend again to poorly capitalised businesses. But Mr Mendham argues
that neither small businesses nor banks can abandon each other in a time of
adversity. 'I think most businesses would prefer the devil they know, as
long as the relationship improves,' he says.
The fuss over charges may indeed fail to break up the old relationship
between banks and small businesses. If the banks get higher returns, and
small businesses can complain to the banking ombudsman, both sides may gain
enough from the latest inquiry to satisfy them. But the severity of losses
sustained by the banks could lead to a break with the past.
This depends on banks' new methods of assessing loan risks. For the first
time, the assumption that small-business lending is an easy source of
profits is being questioned. For now, banks will struggle along. But it is
not certain that their old bonds with small companies will ever wholly
recover from the wounds of recession.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Catching up on the Field
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Norman Fowler should spend his evenings in Durham this week. It is the
duty of the chairman of the Conservative party to watch out for constructive
thinking in the Labour party. If Sir Norman tiptoes into the Exhibition Hall
on Palace Green and stands silently at the rear he will strike paydirt. He
will hear the Labour MP for Birkenhead, Mr Frank Field, deliver four
lectures on why his party always loses, and how it can win.
Let me explain why Sir Norman will find it worthwhile to make a few
clandestine trips. He is not asked to travel north in the expectation that
he will discover how to prevent the opposition from winning. There is no
danger of that. Labour will not listen to what Mr Field says. It never does.
It would not do so if Nostradamus descended from Heaven and predicted that
heeding the words of the member for Birkenhead would guarantee a majority of
50 seats at the next election and 100 at the one following. No, the prize to
be had in Durham is in the form of a fresh stimulus to Tory thinking.
Such a trophy has been picked up before, and from the same source. In 1976
Mr Field advocated that Labour should transfer the ownership of council
houses to their tenants. The people's party rejected his proposal. The then
Mrs Thatcher's hard-faced Tories made a vote-winner out of it. 'No policy
 .comes anywhere near to having the impact this ..has had in summing up what
political parties stand for,' says its self-proclaimed author now. 'While
the Conservatives scooped the advantages, Labour's fractious opposition to
the sale of council houses marked its card equally clearly.' The text of Mr
Field's first Durham lecture is a touch braggadocio, but the general
conclusion it draws is inescapable.
Conservatives have consistently presented themselves as on the side of those
who want 'freedom to get on and build their own lives', he said last night.
Labour has as strenuously contrived to be seen as the party that wants 'to
hold people down'. All the currently fashionable theories about why it lost
the past four elections are brushed away in favour of this simple
observation.
Long before Mrs Thatcher came along people were 'opting for their own form
of privatisation' by building their own world, one which 'ruthlessly
excluded officialdom.' Money taken in taxes competed with the cost of new
kitchens, bathrooms, or family holidays. The Tories understood and
encouraged this; Labour did the opposite. Mr Field points out that one of Mr
John Major's prominent speaking engagements in last year's election campaign
was at a do-it-yourself store.
This perception that Labour must appeal to the aspirations of the ordinary
voter is not new. It is at the centre of the thinking of most of the
'modernisers' in the Labour party, including Mr Peter Mandelson, Mr Giles
Radice, Mr Nick Raynsford and the potential leader of a resurgent
opposition, Mr Tony Blair. It is emphatically not the same as saying that
any party hoping to win must ape the Conservatives.
Mr Field is no closet Tory. In his second lecture tonight he will draw on
his position as chairman of the parliamentary select committee on social
security. When Baroness Thatcher was in office she occasionally called him
in for a chat. Now he is merciless in his analysis of the divisive effect of
her government's policies. He flays her with accusations. The very rich have
done very well. The rest have not. The bottom 80 per cent have not increased
their share of total income, no matter how you measure it. The top 20 per
cent have. The pay of the poorest tenth of British male wage-earners is now
lower, as a proportion of median earnings, than it was when records began in
1886. The number of people dependent on welfare has grown more since 1979
than it did in the previous 30 years. Two-thirds of the population live in
households with incomes below the average . . .
Old Labour reaches two old conclusions. Either more must be spent on social
security, or the present budget should be reallocated. The leader of the
party, Mr John Smith, has appointed a Commission for Social Justice to see
how these alternatives can be worked out. Echoing President Bill Clinton, Mr
Field wants to get people off welfare. He wants total spending reduced,
individual dependent's incomes increased. He proposes a 'Commission on
Economic Opportunity' which would work out policies necessary to
re-establish full employment as a Labour goal. Another Labour thinker, the
self-exiled Mr Bryan Gould, was talking of much the same thing in the BBC TV
programme 'On the Record' at the weekend.
I hope Sir Norman is still listening tomorrow night. As a former social
security minister and the progenitor of private pensions, he should turn on
his tape recorder. The member for Birkenhead proposes to 'give people
control over their own pension capital ..' He clearly believes that in this
he has a winner equivalent to the sale of council houses. His complex
exposition of the idea indicates that he is better placed to point the way
than he is to draw the map. He recognises that unitisation of pension assets
would jeopardise the principle that pensions should equal half to two thirds
of final salaries. He wants a phased-in move to 'voluntary friendly
societies' in which individuals, not employers, own the funds. Money
purchase schemes should be reformed; employers should continue to
contribute, as the best do now.
Mr Field has floated other big-bang wheezes. He has suggested that the
savings on state pensions could facilitate a cut in the standard rate of
income tax to 15p. He has favoured 'workfare' as a concomitant of full
employment. The common thread has been to give people the dignity of earning
their own money, while allowing them to keep as much of it as possible. Sir
Norman might laugh and say that that is what Conservatives want. Mr Field
tries to show how his party might successfully offer an alternative, one
that serves the interests of the bottom 80 per cent. We will have to take
Labour seriously when it overcomes its understandable irritation at the
bumptiousness of the member for Birkenhead and adopts his central theme.
Meanwhile, the pickings are there for Sir Norman.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Letter: Depressing not to have manufacturer among rights
issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R M DANTZIC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I find it somewhat depressing that the rights issue season should have
'kicked off' without any representation from the manufacturing sector. With
the government's heavy funding programme, equity capital is likely to be in
short supply and, accordingly, the City's traditional 'first come, first
served' method of allocating capital needs to be supplemented with a more
pro-active approach. Institutions, and company corporate advisers, should be
encouraging the manufacturers and exporters to re-finance to take advantage
of the opportunities created by sterling's decline rather than the retailers
and importers of whom we already have a surfeit.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Letter: UK export effort in danger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J A LARKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Trade Indemnity's paper on the reinsurance of export credits ('Warning
over lack of cover for exporters', January 26) highlights a major concern.
Recent publicity about the portfolio management system and the problems of
obtaining medium-term support from the government has overshadowed a
potentially far more serious problem for the majority of UK exporters. We
estimate that if political risk capacity cannot be found either from the
government or the private sector Pounds 4bn of UK exports could be left
unprotected. Most UK companies could not take these risks themselves and
would have to withdraw from the markets involved.
This would be a disaster. We therefore hope the government will take these
proposals for a partnership with the private reinsurance market seriously
and give all assurance to UK exporters that they will continue to top up NCM
Credit Insurance's existing reinsurance arrangements as long as this is

FT  02 FEB 93 / Letter: No urging on ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr YASUO NOZAKA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am writing in connection with your article 'Japanese urge Britain to
re-enter ERM' (January 28). This referred to a speech given by Minister
Tamon Kitabatake of this embassy to a seminar held by the Anglo-Japanese
Parliamentary Group on January 27.
When I read the article I was concerned that the headline and the first
paragraph might be somewhat misleading, as they imply that Japan is urging
Britain to re-enter the exchange rate mechanism. What Mr Kitabatake stressed
was the importance of a stable pound for Japanese investment. He did not
urge Britain to re-enter the ERM.
We appreciate that re-joining the ERM is a matter of considerable political
and economic significance, and we would certainly not take it upon ourselves
to urge upon the UK government any particular course of action.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Letter: Coal recommendations should not be accepted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The select committee has made a brave effort to find ways of keeping
miners at work when the demand for coal is falling. But when it recommends
further protection for coal, it seems prepared to hurt other legitimate
commercial interests.
Generators which produce electricity cleanly, efficiently and at a true
commercial price might expect to be competitive in the new electricity
industry. Instead, if they are not beneficiaries of the new coal deal, they
may well be forced out of the market. That is hardly what they expected when
the government announced the electricity privatisation in its White Paper of
February 1988. It promised that the new industry would be subject to
competition and 'protected from fluctuating political pressures'. I hope
that Mr Heseltine will take account of this when he prepares the White Paper
of February 1993.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Letter: Coal recommendations should not be accepted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr HAROLD HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial ('The committee and the colliers', January 30) on the
the subject of the trade and industry select committee's report on the coal
industry has the same reassuring statement about the lack of effect on the
natural gas industry which the authors of the report would like the public
to believe.
The offshore natural gas producers do not share this comfortable view;
neither should those employed in the offshore industry or the 300,000 whose
onshore jobs support its activities.
The committee's recommendations threaten both existing and new gas-fired
power plants (CCGTs) and therefore the offshore projects supporting them.
The committee recommends reducing gas use on existing projects, ignoring the
substantial capital investments already made and the contracts entered into.
Future CCGTs and offshore developments are the subject of recommendations to
restrict their development, despite the fact that the committee has had to
admit that not a single witness challenged the position that gas-fired
plants are the cheapest form of new power generation.
In our view the committee failed properly to address the consequences for
gas arising from its recommendations. Its consideration of the gas side of
the energy balance was perfunctory and its conclusions on the subject buried
away in several places. There was no attempt at a full and impartial study
of the implications for Britain's vigorous offshore industry arising from
the overall recommendations.
This offshore industry, far from needing expensive long-term subsidies, is
itself a significant taxpayer, having contributed over Pounds 115bn since
operations began. It is responsible alone for a quarter of all the
investment in UK's productive industry.
It is time the 55,000 workers whose jobs will be affected if the government
adopts these recommendations were given consideration equal to those
employed elsewhere in energy production. The government should not accept
these recommendations as they stand.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Letter: Gains may be costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PHILIPPE LEGRAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan (Economic Viewpoint, January 28) suggests an exercise
for to 'some economic modeller (not for the busy executive)'. As a
not-so-busy student at the London School of Economics, I believe his
question should be re-phrased.
He suggests weighing up the gains from the boost to output provided by a
larger budget deficit in a recession and the costs of a higher debt burden
to future generations.
But what if the gains are in fact costs? The unprecedented slide from fiscal
virtue to fiscal debauchery of about 6 per cent of GDP in two years has been
accompanied by prolonged recession and high long-term interest rates (which
cripple the investment needed for future growth).
In contrast, the fiscal tightening of a similar size in 1981 produced rapid
growth and falling interest rates. Mr Brittan seems harnessed to the failed
pseudo-Keynesian ideas of the past.
Britain can only gain from cuts in profligate current expenditure which is
undermining confidence and hampering present and future growth.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Letter: Matter of course, not eccentric
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MASAMITSU IGAKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read your newspaper's article (January 25) about Yanase, a Japanese
car dealer which makes staff use public transport to get to work, with much
interest. The article presented the policy as unusual and even eccentric.
However, I take it as a matter of course.
In Japan for a long time many office workers have been told by their
employers to use trains and buses in big cities.
Yanase was a special case because the workers were allowed to drive into the
city centre. The only reason was that they dealt in cars.
The article also included a comment from the Japan Automobile Manufacturers'
Association. It thought it was more important to improve the transport
infrastructure. This response is quite understandable. Car manufacturers are
always sited outside cities in the countryside. For workers in these
factories there is no alternative but to use their own cars. For city centre
workers, however, using public transport is the rule rather than an
eccentric exception.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Fight for the final frontier: The rise of Russia's satellite
launch industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Kazakhstan, Russian rockets are being readied to take on their US and
European counterparts. The US vice-president has called for a tough line to
be taken in delicate talks between Washington and Moscow. China is waiting
in the wings to pick off the losers.
It may sound like the cold war, but it is 1993 and the battleground is
commerce, not ideology. The prize is a slice of the commercial space launch
market worth Dollars 2bn a year.
The Russian space industry is offering to launch western satellites for
about half the cost normally paid in the west, and in some cases much less.
But a price war could undermine western companies' struggle to diversify out
of defence contracts. The Clinton administration has indicated that it might
protect what it sees as a strategic industry and end the Bush doctrine of
supporting this area of Russian industrial strength.
Cut-price launches would bring many benefits. Telephone calls and satellite
television should become cheaper. There could be improvements in air traffic
control, weather forecasting and environmental monitoring. Companies might
be able to make economic use of the weightlessness and vacuum of space in
precision manufacturing.
Many western companies are keen to capitalise on Russia's price advantage in
the space industry. 'Everyone who wants to put up satellites is thinking
about the Russians,' says an executive at an international satellite
services operator.
In December, for instance, London-based Inmarsat, one of the world's top
satellite operators, gave Russia its first commercial launch contract, worth
Dollars 36m. The equivalent launch with the international market leader,
Europe's Arianespace, costs more than Dollars 60m.
More western contracts should follow. Lockheed, one of the largest US
defence contractors, has signed a pact with Russia's Khrunichev Enterprise,
the builder of the world's most reliable rocket, the Proton. The joint
venture will try to sell cut-price launches on Protons to companies and
governments around the world.
'This is the tip of an iceberg that will lower the cost of transportation
into space,' says Mr Mel Brashears, assistant general manager of Lockheed
Missiles and Space.
The iceberg is big enough to threaten the dominance of the west's launch
industry. Built on the requirements of arms and space races, the Russian
space industry still launches more than 50 rockets a year for scientific and
medical research, ground observation, and telecommunications. Mr Yuri Milov,
deputy director of the Russian Space Agency, says it could presently conduct
four to five big commercial launches a year, and more in future with foreign
investment. Arianespace, by comparison, had 10 launches last year.
The western launch industry also has roots in defence and is suffering from
the fall in the value of contracts which has followed the end of the cold
war. Many defence companies have tried to diversify into civil work such as
commercial satellite launching.
Four western companies have been successful in this business. Paris-based
Arianespace, owned by more than 50 European aerospace and finance companies
and five governments, has half the market and sales of FFr5bn (Pounds 600m)
a year. Its FFr14bn order book represents three years' work.
In the US, General Dynamics and Martin Marietta, both defence contractors,
have their Atlas Centaur and Titan rockets, and McDonnell Douglas, the
aerospace company, has the Delta rocket. Their biggest customer is still the
US government, but they also undertake commercial contracts.
Despite Arianespace's dominance in launching commercial satellites, it is in
the US where efforts have been greatest to ward off the Russian assault.
Vice-president Al Gore has endorsed industry calls for 'fair market pricing'
and limits on the number of launches made by eastern competitors.
'The emergence of (space industry) competitors from non-market economies
increases the opportunities for predatory pricing - the very same economic
weapon that foreign countries employed in the 1980s to target and destroy
the American manufacturing base,' he said in a speech immediately prior to
the November elections which outlined the incoming administration's
aerospace policies.
The Clinton administration has the power to prevent Russian commercial
launches by refusing export licences for satellites. This would be a
reversal of the previous administration's policy of encouraging both the
Russian and Chinese space industries in an attempt to encourage economic
reform.
Lockheed is confident that Washington's authorisation of its deal with
Khrunichev, at a time when Bush administration officials were working
closely with their successors, is a sign that policy will not change much.
Yet the pressure for protection of the western launch industry is likely to
strengthen as Russia seeks to increase its commercial launches.
Further Russian price cuts are already on the table. Russia has offered to
launch South African satellites on converted SS-18 or SS-25 intercontinental
ballistic missiles. The sophisticated guidance systems in the missiles
should allow the accurate placing of a satellite in orbit. The price is
Dollars 10m.
In an attempt to avoid a damaging dispute, Russian government and industry
officials are holding informal talks with their American counterparts, as
well as with the European Space Agency and European Commission. A tripartite
deal setting quotas and price floors for Russian launches could emerge later
this year.
But commercial pressures may quickly mount. Within days Eutelsat, the
Paris-based group which provides satellite telecommunications between
European countries, will choose to launch its next satellite with either
General Dynamics, Arianespace or Proton. Mr Jean Grenier, Eutelsat's
director general, acknowledges his organisation's pro-European 'solidarity'
with Arianespace and a recent success with the General Dynamics rocket.
But the Russians also get approval: 'We need reliability and a good price
and without any doubt the Russians have a lot of experience, they have
invested a lot of money and talent in their space industry.'
A second contract for Proton would confirm the arrival of the Russians as a
significant presence in the satellite launch market. But in so doing, it
might also increase the prospect of a trade war in space.

   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Philip Larkin loved to hate Archie Shepp, the US tenorist who shared a
double bill earlier this week at Islington's Union Chapel with cornettist
Nat Adderley. Larkin thought his sound was 'like Flight of the Bumble Bee
scored for bagpipes and concrete mixer'. In those days, the mid-1960s, Shepp
and his avant-gardists claimed they were trying to make order out of chaos.
Twenty-odd years on, the old order has prevailed and the brutal stylist has
given way to a populist blues-inflected post-bopper.
Accompanied by his regular band of Horace Parlan (piano), Wayne Dockery
(bass) and Steve McCraven (drums), Shepp began in a lugubrious mood but
progressed through mellow compositions from his last album I didn't know
about you, to a funk piece which involved James Brown style 'ow'
exclamations. Surprisingly, given his doleful appearance, old Shepp has a
fine singing voice which he uses enthusiastically - a deep blue baritone
crooning on a ballad like his own 'Deja Vu' or shouting the blues, which he
is also prone to.
The tenor playing, while it retains much of the gruffness and rough edged
familiarity with the melody, is growing more friendly with age and Shepp
sounds more comfortable savouring a ballad than punching out tough phrases.
Parlan, who shares the writing with the leader, is an empathetic accompanist
and combines a Monk-ish right hand with a less percussive left for
bittersweet chords.
Cornettist Nat Adderley leads a similarly distinguished regular band which
features elder statesman Jimmy Cobb in the traps and the promising young
altoist Vincent Herring, alongside Walter Booker on bass. An altogether more
zippy affair, Adderley's set is delivered with gags and patter while the
numbers swing hard and fast.
Younger brother to the late altoist, Cannonball Adderley, Nat is an agile
horn player and alternates between the crisp, silvery tones of the muted
instrument and fatter, unfettered blowing. Choice material, from Zawinul's
'Scotch &amp; Water' to his own big earner, 'The Worksong', is moved along
briskly by Bargad who pecks away at the keyboard furiously and Cobb, a
metronomic time keeper. Booker, a ragged improvisor, provides dark shading
for Adderley (in 'Autumn Leaves' for example) and natters cheerfully
throughout young Herring's fierce solo spot in Hank Mobley's 'This Idea Of
You'.
Islington's Union Chapel, incidentally, is an unusual and atmospheric
addition to the London jazz circuit, though the reverberating sound may not
be to everyone's taste. The octagonal floorplan and cavernous vaulted
roofspace accommodated over 1000 worshippers for the Adderley/Shepp
double-bill whose Sunday matinee performance commenced shortly after a
handful of Congregationalists had left their pews]

FT  02 FEB 93 / Arts: Varady in 'Otello' - Vienna Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Saturday Julia Varady sang her first Desdemona at the Vienna State Opera,
which provided her with with a well-worn production by Peter Wood, and a
seasoned Otello and Iago. Or rather, perhaps, over-seasoned in the case of
Vladimir Atlantov, and under-seasoned in that of Renato Bruson. Neither of
them seemed remotely inclined to adjust his standard performance to his
colleagues. Atlantov bawled at unstinting volume - sometimes effectively,
but sometimes pitched wild - and hammed in a manner one had thought long
gone; Bruson stamped gruffly through his role, a solid character without
subtlety.
In the circumstances Miss Varady made a brave but qualified impression. Her
keenly focused voice made her partners sound rough, and passages in the
mezzo range told more strongly than lighter-voiced sopranos can make them
do. Her musical intentions were admirably precise, her dignity impeccable.
In the other hand, she cannot pass for Italian; her timbre does not float,
and the curves in her line never suggested lyrical innocence - at some cost
to the essential pathos. Her brimming vitality and self-possession do not
make an ideal Desdemona.
As Emilia, Roderigo and Montano, Margarita Lilova, Wilfried Gahmlich and
Claudio Otelli were all more than competent. Benedikt Kobel, singing his
first Cassio here, cut an unusually personable young figure  - a plausible
ladies'-man, for once - though his tenor began to display some colour and
ring only in Act 3. The Vienna chorus stood in lines and walked through
their well-trodden moves without excitement; the Vienna Philharmonic offered
moments of beautiful playing, though Adam Fischer's conducting was unequal
to the full range of Verdi's great score. He and Bruson wrong-footed one
another throughout the evening.

People who prefer pandas will want to see the latest episode of The Ark (BBC
2, 9.25). Waving a bouquet of withered bamboo at her fans, Ming Ming arrives
at the crumbling establishment in Regent's Park, at the same time that other
animals are being crated up and shiped out. Whether one likes zoos or
loathes them, it remains the case that director Molly Dineen has produced an
inventive, well-crafted film dealing with what may well be the last days of
London Zoo.
If you missed My Beautiful Laundrette (C4, 10.00), now is the night to catch
a thoughtful and highly atmospheric film which gives a memorable picture of
London. Tonight sees the last episode of Europe means Business: The
Apprentices of Dresden (BBC2, 5.00), the worthwhile series revealing the
cogs of business live in united Germany. The apprentices in question are of
the Dresdner Bank, opening new branches in the former East where savings
accounts used to pay only 3.25 per cent and personal accounts were unknown.
Out of Sight, Out of Mind in the First Tuesday series (ITV, 10.40) goes over
familiar territory for the socially-concerned film-maker.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Arts: Creme de la creme goes sour - William Packer reflects
on the Barclays Young Artist Award
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oh dear: here we go again - for nothing is more dispiriting than to find
oneself yet again playing the critical curmudgeon when the whole point of
the exercise is the celebration of youth and hope and precocious
achievement. So the Barclays Young Artist Award comes round again, for the
ninth time and, at Pounds 10,000 to the winner and a further Pounds 10,000
shared between the other finalists, very generous it is. Drawn from London's
post-graduate colleges, nine young artists, if we count collaborating twin
sisters as one, make it to this year's final exhibition - three from
Goldsmiths'; four from the Slade; two from Chelsea; no-one from either the
Royal College or the Academy Schools. Seven are women.
The young, like the poor, are always with us, and I am ever less convinced
that they should be encouraged in this way. I can see well enough how
attractive the scheme must seem - young artist starving in garret, help when
most needed and all that - but in truth young artists need encouragement no
more than the rest of us. Some of them, of course, have much to offer in
prospect, but those committed to their vocation will persist in any case. As
for the quality of the work, student work is by definition, well, student
work. Test it in open competition by all means, but to limit it to itself is
to indulge in a kind of special pleading.
But if there is to be such a student competition, one drawn moreover from
the very cream of the country's art students, skimmed at their most
ambitious and particular, the very least we might expect is a fairly broad
trawl through the full range of student activity. A certain mature
accomplishment might well be lacking, but in its place surely we should find
some excitement, idiosyncracy, experiment, above all some variety. If you
cannot take any risks when you are a student, when can you take them?
It seems that the riskiest thing to do nowadays, if student preferment is
aspired to, is to work directly from the visible world. Is there really not
a single student in all the London post-graduate schools of a sufficient
quality to interest the selection panel who is working from the life-model
as painter or sculptor, or looking at landscape or still-life, or modelling
or carving, or even welding and assembling, the unique object? Evidently
not. Is it because, such technical, disciplined and analytical instruction
is no longer to be had in the modern art school? Are such arcane
preoccupations actively discouraged? Who can say?
What we get instead, distilled in the Barclays' selection, is the critical
orthodoxy of the international market-place of the late 20th century. The
important thing is to strike an attitude, make a statement, present an
image, an idea, a formula. If it is about art, or may be made to bear a
feminist, socio-political or economic reading, so much the better. Glenn
Brown (from Goldsmiths', that seminary of the thinking artist) makes
paintings of reproductions of paintings, that follow every mark of the
original images in the closest detail - yet offer nothing of their reality
of surface and texture, and the active qualities of their making. They are
'completely devoid of vitality' remarks the catalogue approvingly.
The only other painter is Suzanne Walker (Slade), whose large canvasses each
carry as image a single flat, black silhouette. These turn out to be derived
from tower-blocks, thus enabling her 'to discuss both the language of
painting and its relevance to contemporary urban life . . . the epitome of
post-war idealism turned sour.' Laura Thomson (Chelsea) is a painter too, of
sorts, but makes of her painting a performance to be registered on video. A
single line appears on the wall as she pulls away the strip of masking-tape.
Face to the wall, her arm describes a broad black circle around her body.
The rest is sculpture, photography and installation. From high on the wall
of an otherwise empty white space, the recorded voice of Georgina Starr
(Slade) drones on in impenetrable, indulgent monologue, 'a highly emotive
'absent presence''. Tacita Dean (Slade) offers a series of photographic
tableaux after a 'Martyrdom of St Agatha', she of the severed breasts.
Siobhan Hapaska (Goldsmiths') has filled narrow channels of perspex with
brown sugar to make cumulative minimalist reliefs, thereby, we are told,
'redefining categories, discovering unexpected potential for speeded up or
slowed down communication.'
Hilary Wilson (Slade) makes wooden bed-ends that she leans against boxes of
various sizes, confounding expectations of ease and comfort, these rather
'sites of physical displeasure and psychic unease.' Renato Niemis (Chelsea)
has simply made two small rooms or large boxes, roughly the size of a
rubbish skip, and as roughly made of timber and board, the one floor
carpeted, the other plain. The artist stresses 'the inadequacy of these
meagre, jerry-built structures as containers for human aspirations.'
And at last we come to the joint-winners of the Award, the Wilson twins,
Louise and Jane (Goldsmiths'), with their photographic and mixed-media
installation, a metal crush-barrier, a patch of paint, a number of
photographs leant negligently against the wall, showing corners, stairs and
doorways littered with odd scraps and remnants, vaguely suggestive of some
active destruction. The ensemble arouses 'the guilty suspicion that one is
somehow responsible for the sordid circumstances, if only through
indifference or neglect.' Or not, as the case may be.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Arts: Thoughts on 'The Sleeping Beauty' - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Music is one thing, movement is another. But put the two together, and the
amalgam is something else again. To hear Tchaikovsky's score for The
Sleeping Beauty is marvellous, but not half as marvellous as hearing it
accompany the vision Tchaikovsky had in mind. And here is the main pleasure
of Ninette de Valois's 1977 Royal Ballet production of Beauty, 90 per cent
of the time. Simply, it tells its story with near-constant musical detail.
To return to this after three years in which London has seen both Bolshoy
and Kirov productions is like walking through clover after mining for gold.
Looking again at de Valois's staging, I marvel at the near-perfect harmony
(until late in Act Two) it weaves between sight and sound. This is at its
clearest in the big mime scenes - at the end of the Prologue, for example,
when Monica Mason's slighted Carabosse lays her fateful prophecy on the
royal court and Genesia Rosato's Lilac Fairy overrules her; or when Rosato
returns in Act One, to reassure the court about the lifeless Aurora ('She is
not dead, but sleeps'). Every gesture, every opening of an eye, every
lighting effect, makes a visual frame that answers the music's tapestry
movingly.
Yet however good it is to see this Beauty, listening to Mark Ermler's
conducting of the score brings no joy. He has flamboyance and panache, yes;
but he clots the lucid textures of Tchaikovsky's wonderful orchestration,
and - worse - he keeps tugging the music from beneath the dancers' feet by
his notions of rubato. Royal Ballet dancers try to be careful timekeepers at
all times, but if the company is fully to recover from its 1980s recession,
it must recover its old musicality and dance in real phrases. With
conducting as egotistical as Ermler's, however, this will not be possible.
Darcey Bussell, dancing her first Princess Aurora on Saturday night, coped
more than handsomely with the double threat of debut nerves in the supreme
19th-century classical role and a difficult maestro. When Kenneth MacMillan
made the ballerina role of his three-act Prince of the Pagodas on her, he
was preparing her for this role. (He dedicated his production to Margot
Fonteyn, the Royal's greatest Aurora.) And if Bussell now learns to unfold
all the role's musical and poetic nuances, she will reward both us and
herself for years to come. Already she combines expansiveness, innocence,
and technical command in near-ideal measure.
There has never been anything wrong with this production that could not be
out right by listening to Tchaikovsky more feelingly. The two big Act Three
pas de deux - for the Bluebird and his Princess, and for Aurora and her
Prince - are conceived too little as musical revelations of character, too
much as showstopping arrays of big steps. And the production has already
begun to flag - in lighting, musical timing and dramatic sense - as the
Prince enters the Lilac Fairy's boat to the sleeping castle. Why do we see
Carabosse when the music tells us she is just a memory? Why does the Prince
keep looking back? And so on.
The Royal is dancing Beauty with more confidence and attack than in the late
1980s. Among the many soloist performances on Saturday, Nicola Roberts and
Bruce Sansom stand out. Jonathan Cope, dancing the Prince, is no actor and
(unlike Bussell) has no assurance in addressing an audience. But he is noble
in the way he stands, in the flowing amplitude of his dancing, and in the
self-effacing good manners of his partnering. He and Sansom are almost alone
among Royal male dancers in the way they do not try to take their steps by
force.
As for the women, Bussell is almost the only one under the age of 30 who is
truly classical. In current Royal Ballet style, you try to dance firm and
brisk beneath the waist, and soft and gentle above the waist; and then, like
an afterthought, you try to synchronise the two. (Not everybody succeeds.)
Royal dancers are more classical and more vivid when they mime, because then
they follow a single impulse. But this mime/dance dichotomy used not to
exist here, and it should not now. Dance should simply take mime virtues and
make them lyrical and brilliant. And Tchaikovsky's score tell you this too.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Arts: Elgar's Lux Christi - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the passing benefits that accrue from the present fashion for
recording entire areas of a composer's output is that live concerts often
include rarities which one would not otherwise hear. Over the past couple of
years Richard Hickox has been working through Elgar's oratorios and he has
now reached obscure territory.
The latest instalment is Lux Christi, or 'The Light of Life', as Elgar's
publishers preferred to call it. Timed with an eye on the market-place,
where Hickox's recording of Caractacus has just arrived this month, Sunday's
performance at the Barbican could well win supporters for a work that has
been so overshadowed by the masterpieces that followed as almost to
disappear into oblivion - a forgotten prototype for the fully-finished
product.
Elgar remarked in later life that Lux Christi had been conceived against the
odds, by a poor wretch teaching all day, resigned to composing after dinner
with a splitting headache. But, he added, the 'spirit and will' were there.
That shows through not in any tangible sense of resolve, for the music lacks
direction and its quality is up-and-down, but in its very personal tone.
This is a score which searches deep in its soul for what it wants to say at
its finest moments.
In this performance those almost always occured when Jesus was singing, in
the person of the bass John Shirley-Quirk. His magnanimity of utterance and
long-breathed vocal lines remain as imposing as ever. Arthur Davies sang the
blind man who is restored to sight, not without some constriction in the
voice, though he has both the outgoing romantic ardour and the quiet sense
of wonder for the music. Judith Howarth was the soprano Mother; Linda Finnie
the contralto Narrator.
The choruses are not the work's strength. Elgar was still feeling his way
towards the grand structures that crown his mature oratorios, but the London
Symphony Chorus concealed howfour-square much of the writing is with their
sheer energy. Hickox himself, conducting an attentive London Symphony
Orchestra, still rushes at climaxes, which arrive in a few bars rather than
over several pages, as they should; but his passionate Elgar is preferable
to the old, sedate style.
Unlike its successors, Lux Christi is short enough to allow another piece in
the first half of a concert. On Sunday, that should have been Maria Joao
Pires in what one imagines would have been a deeply-considered performance
of Beethoven's 'Emperor' Piano Concerto, but Pires was ill and her place was
taken by Jon Kimura Parker - ruthlessly exact, a brilliant organiser of the
pianistic effects that make the surface of this concerto sparkle, but not
often more.

FT  02 FEB 93 / People: Civil servants' stores
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Working for The John Lewis Partnership, the high street retailer owned by
its staff, has sometimes been likened to a career in the civil service - it
is not hard to see why.
Stuart Hampson, 46, who took over as chairman yesterday, was a civil servant
for 13 years and his new deputy chairman, David Young, 50 (right), has been
almost twice as long a civil servant as he has been a John Lewis partner.
Both men are Oxford graduates and joined John Lewis in 1982.
David Young, who retains his job as finance director, spent most of his
civil service career in the Ministry of Defence, before joining John Lewis.
Before becoming finance director he ran a number of stores including Peter
Jones in London's Sloane Square. The deputy chairman traditionally chairs
the principle executive committee, a conference of directors which discusses
policy.
Meanwhile, the group has also promoted a third ex-civil servant to its board
 -Luke Mayhew, the 39-year-old director of research and expansion. Born in
New Zealand and educated at Oxford also, he worked in the Department of
Industry between 1974 and 1978. From there he went to Thomas Cook Travel and
then British Airways where he rose to be general manager human resources. In
May 1991 he was appointed chief executive (Europe) of Shandwick, the
troubled public relations group, and in June 1992 he joined the partnership.

FT  02 FEB 93 / People: Gottlieb - aiming to prick the rent balloon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Gottlieb, owner of two London restaurants, has been elected joint
chairman of the Property Market Reform Group, an organisation campaigning
for changes to British property leases.
Gottlieb, 45, is a fierce critic of several 'iniquitous' aspects of the
commercial lease system, namely its lack of transparency, its biased
arbitration procedures, its upward-only rent review clauses and privity of
contract, which makes original tenants liable if a subsequent tenant
defaults.
'Rents are now becoming the main cost factor for all retailers and the
simple fact is that rent increases are forcing businesses into bankruptcy,'
he says. 'That is not the way to foster economic growth.'
Gottlieb is the proprietor of Smollensky's Balloon and Smollensky's in the
Strand. He became convinced of the need for reform of the commercial
property system after writing an article in a trade magazine about his own
experience. This generated a huge response from the restaurant industry; he
is vice-chairman of the Restauranteurs Association of Great Britain, which
is a member of the Property Market Reform Group. This was launched last
summer with the intent of persuading parliament to legislate against
practices such as upwards-only rent reviews.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Business and the Law: Bank loses claim for negligence of
property valuers - Legal briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Commercial property valuers facing a pile of negligent valuation claims
arising from the collapse of the London commercial property market should
take heart from a High Court decision last week in a case brought by The
Private Bank &amp; Trust Company against Sallmanns (UK). The bank claimed to
have made advances relying on an allegedly negligent valuation made by
Sallmanns in June 1990 on an office development in north London. But the
Court ruled that the commercial property market in London had not collapsed
at June 1990 as the bank claimed and that the valuer could not reasonably
have been expected to foresee the speed and extent of the imminent collapse
in commercial property values. Hugh Williams, of solicitors Williams Davies
Meltzer, who represented the valuers, said: 'Encouragingly the court showed
itself willing to place itself in the position of the valuer at a critical
time in the commercial property market rather than adopting the hindsight
vision of pundits who claim subsequently to have been able to foresee the
market collapse and who suggest that the valuer in the field should likewise
have done so.'

FT  02 FEB 93 / People: Persimmon splits role
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yorkshire-based Persimmon, regarded as one of the best regional
housebuilders, is splitting the role of chairman and chief executive. The
present incumbent, Duncan Davidson, will continue as executive chairman.
John White, 41, becomes group chief executive as part of a reshuffle of
board responsibilities. White, who has been with the group since 1979, was
formerly executive chairman of the housing division responsible for the
Midlands and south east England, and is replaced by Mike Farley.
Mike Allen, 48, who has been with the group since 1976, becomes deputy
chairman. He retains responsibility for the Yorkshire and north east England
markets.
Davidson, 51, has ambitious plans to expand the company's size and has
decided to strengthen senior management accordingly. 'We would like to
double output to about 4,000 homes a year by the mid-1990s,' says Davidson
who, with his wife, owns just over a fifth of the company. 'The timing of
expansion, however, will depend upon recovery in the housing market.'
Davidson says the decision to split the functions of chief executive and
chairman is in line with the recommendations of the Cadbury committee. He
stresses, however, that the decision was not prompted by that report: 'It is
just coincidental that we believe this is the right thing to do for a
company of our size and at our stage of development,' he says.

FT  02 FEB 93 / People: Hawley resigns from HMH
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mel Hawley has resigned as chief executive of Haden MacLellan Holdings, the
industrial conglomerate, only a year after his promotion to the post.
His responsibilities have been taken on by Harold Cottam, appointed chairman
last September, and by the heads of the two main divisions, Clive Mayhead
and Richard Taylor.
Cottam says these two were 'almost joint managing directors' so it was
difficult for the chief executive 'to add a great deal of value in
operational terms'.
As he, Cottam, had been brought in to help 'restore the group's fortunes, to
look at its management structure and to transform its image in the City, it
was difficult for the ceo to contribute in that area' either. He adds that
Hawley, 47, lived in Yorkshire when the group's head office was in Surrey,
and so he had 'become a little remote'. The parting was natural, with a
reasonable settlement.
Hawley, a chartered accountant whose links with companies that are now part
of Haden MacLellan - notably London and Midland Industrials - go back more
than 20 years, became chief executive in February last year when Philip
Ling, his long-time leader, became non-executive chairman.
Cottam, formerly managing partner of Ernst &amp; Young, is in the process of
withdrawing from his remaining roles at the accountancy firm. He is spending
most of his time with HMH, which last year saw its first-half pre-tax profit
slide from Pounds 7.9m to Pounds 2.4m and slashed its interim dividend.
One of the chairman's goals is to recruit a financial director - a new post
for HMH. Cottam says: 'In a sense everyone has been a finance director . . .
and that's not the way to do it' - a neat piece of counter-culture when part
of the Ling credo was: 'It doesn't matter who gets it right so long as
someone does.'

FT  02 FEB 93 / Business and the Law: Second Marshall case opinion given -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRICK COURT CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The preliminary opinion in the second Marshall case was delivered last week.
The case concerns compensation payments made under UK legislation for
breaches of EC sex discrimination laws. The European Court has been asked to
rule whether national limits on such compensation payments are lawful.
In the first Marshall case, the court ruled that Miss Marshall was entitled
to rely on the provisions of an EC directive in her action for wrongful
dismissal on grounds of sex discrimination against her employers,
Southampton and South West Hampshire Area Health Authority.
Under the relevant UK legislation, the maximum compensation which could be
paid to Miss Marshall at the time was Pounds 6,250. The Industrial Tribunal
assessed her loss at Pounds 18,405, which included Pounds 7,710 in respect
of interest.
The Area Health Authority paid the capital sum, but appealed against the
tribunal's award of interest.
In his opinion Advocate-General Van Gervan rejected an argument put by the
UK and Irish governments that the court should restrict itself to ruling on
the question of the interest payable. He said the court should also consider
the much wider point of a general compensation limit. In order to deal with
this issue, it was necessary to decide the scope and content of the relevant
EC law rights.
The advocate-general found that the relevant provisions of EC law did give
rise to rights which could be relied on by individuals in their national
courts against member states and public authorities.
These rights comprised not only the right to obtain an effective judicial
remedy against sex discrimination, but also the right to obtain specific
compensation, which had not previously been recognised by the court.
Mr Van Gervan said national compensation limits were not, in themselves,
unlawful, but that the compensation awarded had to be adequate in relation
to the damage sustained. That did not mean that the compensation had to be
equal to the damage. It was for the national court to assess the adequacy of
the compensation in every case and remedies for breaches of Community law
should be comparable to those for breaches of domestic law.
The question of interest was divided into two:
'legal interest' - to compensate for any delays in the payment of the
damages agreed by the national court - was due from the date of delivery of
the national decision establishing the amount of compensation;
and 'compensatory interest', which is a component of the compensation
package, should form part of any award, otherwise that award would not be
adequate in relation to the damage suffered and thus breach the Community
rights of the individual concerned.
C-271/91: M H Marshall v Southampton and South-West Hampshire Area Health
Authority, Opinion delivered on 26 January 1993.
Discriminatory tax treatment not unlawful.
In a case involving tax benefits in Germany, the ECJ found that national tax
rules, which made certain tax allowances dependant on the German residence
of the taxpayer, were not contrary to the provisions of the Rome Treaty
dealing with establishment rights and the rules against discrimination.
C-112/91: Hans Werner v Finanzamt Aachen-Innenstadt, ECJ FC 26 January 1993.
Preliminary references to the European Court.
The European Court gave a salutary reminder last week to national courts
wishing to refer preliminary questions to the ECJ. An Italian court had
referred two questions to the ECJ for preliminary ruling concerning
broadcasting restrictions and their compatibility with EC competition law.
However, the questions were, according to the court, so laconic and lacking
in precision that it was impossible to identify the questions to be
answered.
The court stated that it was the duty of the national court to identify the
factual and legal framework within which questions for preliminary ruling
were raised. As this had not been carried out by the Italian court, the ECJ
could not answer the questions referred.
Joined cases C-320/90, C-321/90 and C-322/90: Telemarsicabruzzo SpA and
others v Circostel, Ministero delle Poste e Telecommunicazioni et Ministero

FT  02 FEB 93 / Business and the Law: Out-of-court settlement - Industry is
still paying a heavy price for ignoring a fast, cheap alternative to
litigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The American writer Ambrose Bierce defined litigation in his Devil's
Dictionary as 'a machine which you go into as a pig and come out of as a
sausage'.
He could have added that you must also pay for the privilege. Court-based
justice is slow and expensive and for every winner produces a loser. The
cost of a two-year commercial dispute culminating in a one- or two-month
trial can run into millions of pounds.
Yet during the UK's deepest recession in 60 years, when businesses ought to
be doing all they can to cut variable costs, they are spending more and more
on fighting costly battles in the courts.
The Centre for Interfirm Comparison, an independent research group, says
that on average London law firms reported a 25 per cent growth in litigation
in 1992. That came on top of an average 43 per cent rise in litigation in
1991.
There has been some progress in the search for cheaper and fairer methods of
handling commercial disputes in the UK over the past two years. But industry
has been slow to embrace the concept of alternative dispute resolution (ADR)
 -which in the UK mainly takes the form of mediation - despite Confederation
of British Industry (CBI) backing.
In November 1990 the CBI supported the launch of the Centre for Dispute
Resolution. CEDR is a non-profit making organisation, backed by industry and
professional advisers, dedicated to reaching better commercial solutions to
domestic and international business disputes.
Founder members included BAT, Ford (Europe), Grand Metropolitan, ICI, Smiths
Industries and Trafalgar House Construction, plus a dozen of the UK's
leading law firms and four of the big accountancy firms.
Six months later membership of CEDR had passed 100. New recruits included
RTZ, Legal &amp; General, Midland Bank, BOC Group, Prudential, John Laing, John
Mowlem Construction, British Telecom and Black &amp; Decker. Today membership
totals more than 250 with almost 50 per cent drawn from commerce and
industry. Many companies have actively promoted ADR.
CEDR has established links with a growing number of UK and international ADR
organisations and is to supplement the work of the London Court of
International Arbitration. The Law Society, the Bar and the Lord
Chancellor's Department have all expressed support for ADR as a concept.
In its first two years 230 cases, involving more than Pounds 800m, were
referred to CEDR, of which about 25 per cent went on to complete formal ADR
processes. CEDR estimates that more than Pounds 30m in potential legal costs
have been saved and substantially more if management time is included.
So, with CBI-backed industry support, goodwill from the professions and at
least the beginnings of a sound record, why has ADR failed to take off in
the UK?
Dr Karl Mackie, CEDR's director, says: 'The low level of experience of
lawyers and clients with the process is still an obstacle and the
traditional adversarial mindset and culture of lawyers and clients in
litigation a positive barrier.'
But old habits dying hard is not a complete answer. While lawyers' interests
are unlikely to make them the first to suggest it, Dr Mackie concedes that
CEDR has made 'considerable headway' in recent months in persuading lawyers
to take ADR more seriously.
The real problem is in industry, where there is lack of awareness of ADR and
what it has to offer, edged with a large dose of scepticism.
In America the success of ADR techniques came from publicity surrounding the
successful resolution of business disputes involving well-known companies.
Examples include the four-year IBM/Fujitsu computer software copyright
dispute, Borden's Dollars 200m trust action against Texaco and American
Can's Dollars 41m action for breach of contract against Wisconsin Electrical
Power.
In the UK no company which has been through ADR has yet been prepared to
talk about the experience in any detail. Industry has had to judge the
process from brief second-hand accounts of anonymous disputes provided by
CEDR.
All that may be about to change, however. Although not a household name, one
of the two companies involved in the largest dispute handled by CEDR so far
has allowed its lawyers, Warner Cranston, to talk about the resolution by
mediation of its Pounds 27m claim against a product design consultancy.
The company, Autocar Equipment, an automotive equipment manufacturer and
distributor, agreed with an American to manufacture and market in the UK a
steriliser he had invented and patented for the dental industry. Successful
UK marketing required several design changes. Autocar approached a London
product design consultancy and subsequently accepted its quote for cost and
time.
The design changes took a lot longer and cost a lot more than anticipated.
Autocar felt it had lost market opportunities. Eventually the American
exercised his right to terminate the agreement with Autocar under US law and
Autocar decided to sue the design consultancy for negligence and breach of
contract and lost profits.
Mr John Wright, the Warner Cranston partner handling the case for Autocar,
said initially they went down the traditional route. A writ claiming Pounds
27m was issued in April 1989 and a split-trial was agreed - the first trial,
expected to last eight weeks, to determine liability, the second to
determine damages.
Traditional negotiations failed to produce a settlement but did narrow the
issues. Eventually, four months before the date for the first trial, the
design consultancy suggested one final attempt should be made to settle the
dispute by mediation. Autocar agreed and together they approached CEDR.
Two mediators, Mr Michael Burton QC and Dr Karl Mackie, were nominated and a
date fixed for the hearing. The mediation took a day. It began with a short
opening summary of each side's case in open session followed by a series of
private caucuses, or open and frank discussions, between the mediators and
each side in turn about their respective cases.
The case was eventually settled late in the afternoon for less than Pounds
1m, but only after the defendants had increased their original offer by more
than 70 per cent. Both sides appeared satisfied with the outcome. 'In a
way,' says Mr Wright, 'they had had their day in court.'
The total cost of the mediation was less than Pounds 20,000 for both
parties. Avoiding two trials lasting as much as four months overall saved
somewhere between Pounds 1m and Pounds 1.5m for each side, he says.
Even if mediation fails all that has been lost is the cost of a day's
mediation, he adds. For it to work, however, both sides must be willing
participants and they must have top managers there who are capable of taking
decisions on the spot because the function of mediation is to persuade each
side to move away from their entrenched positions.
ADR provides a cost-effective, simple and quick alternative to litigation.
It will not always work and it will not be suitable in all cases. But as the
Autocar case illustrates the potential savings are enormous. Business
continues to ignore ADR at its cost.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Technology: Unix's survival at stake - Technically Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEW days before Christmas last year, Novell, a US computer networking
company whose annual sales are now close to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) signed
a letter of intent to acquire Unix Systems Laboratories, a company in which
AT&amp;T has a majority stake and which is responsible for the licensing and
development of the Unix computer operating system.
The deal, worth Dollars 350m, has to be ratified by 11 other computer
companies which own shares in USL. These include Amdahl, Fujitsu, ICL,
Motorola and Sun Microsystems. It is nevertheless remarkable, given the
history of Unix, that there has been a dearth of comment on a development
which may fundamentally reshape the open systems movement. It may simply
have been the imminence of the New Year; others see more sinister forces at
work.
To recap briefly: open systems imply a common set of rules for interworking
so that no supplier has a technical advantage over any other in developing
standard products.
Unix is one of a number of operating systems vying to be adopted as the open
systems standard. The development of such an operating system would have to
be free from the control of any one manufacturer or group of manufacturers.
Unix was created by AT&amp;T at Bell Labs but has since been widely licensed,
leading to a damaging multiplicity of 'standard' versions. These include
Sunsoft's Solaris and IBM's AIX.
The competition includes IBM's personal computer operating systems OS/2, the
Open Systems Foundation's OSF1 and Microsoft's Windows NT, a new operating
system which has yet to be launched commercially.
AT&amp;T established USL, and encouraged other companies to Take stakes in it,
to promote the idea of Unix development independent of itself or any other
company. In doing so, it showed it had learned the lessons of the 1980s when
plans to establish a standard Unix between AT&amp;T and the aggressive
workstation company, Sun Microsystems, provoked an industry war.
Novell, however, is one of the industry's newly emerging dominant forces
with some 60 per cent of the global market for networking software. The
1990s are set to be the decade of computer networking so Novell, along with
Intel and Microsoft, can claim to be an architect of the new world order in
computing.
So by selling off USL to Novell, has AT&amp;T thrown away the idea of an
independent Unix? And if it has, does it matter?
The answer to the latter question would seem to be 'No', judging by the lack
of controversy over the proposed sale. Why should that be?
One possible answer is that AT&amp;T and the rest of the industry are already
anticipating that Windows NT will be the operating system of the future and
have thrown in the towel.
Windows NT - standing for 'New Technology' - is Microsoft's first multiuser,
multitasking operating system suitable for powerful network servers. It is
Microsoft's attempt to lay siege to the market for enterprise-wide
computing, taking advantage of the shift away from mainframes and mainframe
operating systems.
Microsoft has a deserved reputation for tenacity in bringing reliable
products to market even if there are several false starts on the way. But
coming as it does from a background in stand-alone personal computers, it
has little experience of enterprise data processing. It knows this very well
and is taking steps to remedy its deficiencies.
But multiuser computing is complex and critics argue that Windows NT will
have to go through several versions before it approaches the reliability and
robustness of Unix.
Many believe that Unix represents the best opportunity of developing a
genuinely open operating system for the 1990s and beyond. With the loss of
an independent USL, however, there may be again a proliferation of Unix
variants - to nobody's advantage.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Technology: SmithKline cures a corporate headache
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES ARNOLD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Group decision-making is central to corporate life, but it can be
time-consuming and socially awkward for many managers. In a move that
introduces a touch of the television game show to business, SmithKline
Beecham is trying to take the headaches out of joint decisions.
The Anglo-US pharmaceutical group's solution is Teamworker, dreamt up by
Tony Gear and Martin Read of Decision Dynamics, a small UK communications
company. It consists of handsets, similar in design to pocket calculators,
linked by radio to a centraI standard microcomputer. This is loaded with
special software which presents data in logical order to the participants,
who vote or register opinions on the keypads. The results appear instantly
on a large screen.
Teamworker is also used by the Ministry of Defence, Manchester University,
and Allied Breweries, where it shows what the members of tasting panels
think about differing beer flavours.
The Head of SB's Gastrointestinal R&amp;D Category, Leanne Wagner, says the
system makes research and development meetings much more effective. It was
adopted to cut the length of time spent reviewing SB's extensive project
portfolios.
'Our practice has always been to brainstorm in groups of 12 to 15 staff from
a variety of disciplines, as well as to gather smaller groups dealing with
individual therapeutic areas,' she says. 'The idea of portfolio review is to
pinpoint where our resources should best be concentrated and evaluate
research opportunities.' But this was often time-consuming and complex.
Wagner says meetings are now better organised. 'The computer gives the cue
for each project option to be presented and for its technical and commercial
attractiveness to be discussed.' A group vote then shows instantly where
disagreements arise, without participants being influenced by others'
opinions.
'Social pressure is thus considerably diminished; participants can disagree
without confrontation, producing a more honest spread of opinion. It becomes
much more difficult for a senior member to dominate the meeting,' Wagner
says. This is important when people from different disciplines are involved.
John Dent, SB's former senior vice-president of project management, says
meeting times are now much shorter. 'We normally took a 15-day yearly
meeting to review our portfolio, and that has been cut to around four.'
He is not sure whether the decisions are actually better. 'But one point
which is important is that everyone understands what decision has been
reached. At least this way, people who disagree have a fairer chance of
being able to persuade the others.'

FT  02 FEB 93 / Technology: Clean steel gets to melting point - A saleable
Austrian breakthrough that makes dirty blast furnaces obsolete
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Executives are breathing more easily these days at Voest-Alpine, the
state-owned Austrian industrial group, thanks to a new order from the Far
East which could open up sales prospects around the world for a cheaper and
cleaner way of making steel.
The group has just won an order from the big South Korean steel concern,
Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco), for its Corex technology for reducing iron
ore directly to hot metal. According to Herbert Steinwender, president of
Voest-Alpine Industrieanlagenbau (VAI), the group's engineering unit, it is
in discussion with 35 other steel companies about possible orders.
Direct reduction (DR) and smelting reduction (SR) technologies have
tantalised steel makers for decades. The idea is that the oxides and other
impurities present in iron ores can be removed in a single thermal process,
using an ordinary hydrocarbon or coal as a reduction agent.
This would enable steelmakers to dispense with the cumbersome and expensive
traditional processes of refining coke from coking coal in huge ovens and
then using the coke as a reduction agent in immense blast furnaces.
SR plants could also be operated economically on a much smaller scale than
blast furnaces, thus opening the way for new entrants into the steel
industry.
Another feature that has increased interest in recent years is that SR
plants produce substantially fewer emissions than coking plant-blast furnace
complexes. In the 1960s, the focus was on natural gas driven DR plants, but
interest faded with the sharp rise in gas prices in the early 1970s. In the
mid-1970s, Willy Korf, the maverick German mini steel mill entrepreneur who
died in an air crash in 1990, started development of a coal-based SR system,
originally called the KR (Kohlereduktion) process and later changed to
Corex.
In 1979, Voest joined Korf in building a 60,000 tonne per year pilot plant
at Kehl, on the upper Rhine in Germany, and four years later took over the
whole project when Korf's business collapsed. VAI won its first commercial
contract for a 300,000 tonne per year Corex plant from Iscor, the South
African steel company, in 1985. But the installation had considerable
teething problems, and was not running properly until two years after its
commissioning in 1987.
Since then, things have been tense in Linz, to say the least. 'We have been
hoping a long time for a second contract,' Steinwender says. Some executives
felt that VAI should have put in a Corex plant at the Linz works of its
sister company, VA Stahl, to demonstrate its confidence in the technology.
But this was difficult to justify economically as long as newly modernised
iron making facilities, which were well adjusted to downstream facilities,
were working effectively. 'So we are very happy that Posco has come along.
It is the third largest steel company in the world,' he says.
The Posco order is for a plant that is double the size of Iscor's. VAI will
not disclose the value of the order, but says normally a plant of this size
would cost Sch3bn (Pounds 179m). Questions have been raised about how much
further the technology can be scaled up without running into new
complications. Steinwender says the next step up to a plant of about 1m
tonnes per year should be achieved without difficulty, as the equipment
needed has already been used in DR plants.
Opinions are divided within the group as to whether Corex will be as big a
success as Voest's development in the late 1940s of the LD (named after its
Linz and Donawitz steelmaking sites) basic oxygen technology process for
converting iron into steel. That technology is now universally used in
integrated steel works around the world and has produced a steady income
stream for the group for decades.
VAI claims that total Corex plant costs for producing a tonne of hot metal
are about 20 per cent less than those in a coking plant-blast furnace
complex. Total energy requirements are about 15 per cent less, but
considerably more excess energy is available for driving a power station.
Still, the snag for many producers, like Voest itself, is that as long as
old, fully depreciated plant is still working well, it is difficult to
justify investing in Corex. And, as Othmar Puhringer, deputy chairman of
Austrian Industries, Voest's parent company, says, 'there is already a
significant overcapacity of hot metal in the world'.
Puhringer believes that market development will take some time. 'The real
boom will take place when environmental controls get more stringent.
'We did not see this when we developed the process, but it is a beautiful
by-product.'

A total of 380,000 new businesses were started in 1992, a fall of 22 per
cent on the year before and well below the peak of 520,000 in 1990,
according to National Westminster Bank.
Since 1988 an estimated 2.4m new businesses have been formed of which two
thirds are still thought to be trading.
More businesses are making use of the founder's personal resources to start.
In 1992, 65 per cent used their own money compared with 37 per cent in 1991
while just 20 per cent used bank finance compared with 41 per cent.

Durham University has launched an Industry and Commerce Club to encourage
collaboration between its academics and companies in north-east England.
The university has taken its lead from the much higher level of informal
contact between universities and industry in the US and believes many
businesses are unaware of the relevant expertise academics have in product,
planning and management problems.
Ninety companies, from small businesses to multinationals, attended the
launch. The university hopes the club will enhance the performance of
north-east industry. First-year membership is Pounds 200 plus VAT a

Hertfordshire to boost the local economy.
More than 100 business people and representatives of business organisations
attended the first meeting of the Hertfordshire Business Forum last month.
The main instigators of the initiative are the county's Training and
Enterprise Council, the county council and its development organisation,
which was set up to attract investment.
Traditionally prosperous Hertfordshire has been spurred into action by the

British exporters believe regulations and red tape will represent the
largest non-tariff barriers to selling in continental Europe, followed by
discrimination against non-local goods and services.
One in 10 exporters regard Germany as the most difficult sales destination
because of the high-quality standards and competitive pricing demanded,
according to a survey of 450 small businesses by Barclays Bank. France was
seen as most likely to impose red tape or to discriminate against imports.
Despite this 81 per cent of exporters were optimistic about future
prospects. One third have increased their export sales and promotion and a
similar number have made new contacts abroad.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Unloved expense -
Mounting pressure to drop the burden of small company audit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER nearly 30 years with the same accountant, Ellen Lunn recently
switched. SA Lunn, the family-owned plumbers' merchants she runs with her
husband, now gets a better service but she still resents paying for an audit
she is convinced she does not need.
'I can understand the necessity for an audit in a large concern where there
is a lot going on and they are dealing with other people's money, but I
don't see the need in a small business,' she says. Lunn and her husband are
the only shareholders in the Farnborough-based company, which has a
workforce of 12, sales of just over Pounds 1m and no bank borrowings.
The audit is costly - the present accountant charges Pounds 2,500 for
preparing annual accounts and carrying out the audit - and also takes up
time. 'Half a day goes on the meeting with the auditor, usually at an
inconvenient time, and then there are the follow-up queries. If we weren't
required by law to have an audit we wouldn't need to employ a certified
auditor and we could go to a bookkeeper or do the job ourselves,' she says.
Lunn is not alone among small business owners in querying the value to small
businesses of the audit. This issue has also vexed governments, the
accountancy profession, banks and tax authorities for more than a decade.
For the third time in 10 years the Department of Trade and Industry is
engaged in a review of the small company audit and it expects to produce a
discussion document in the next month or so.
Spurred by growing concern about the burden of red tape on small firms,
there appears a growing consensus that the small company audit must go. But
the debate is by no means over and there is certain to be heated discussion
about the level at which the audit ceases to be necessary. There is also
disagreement over whether or not it needs to be replaced by a simplified
report on the finances of the smaller firm.
Defenders of the small company audit argue that it provides an independent
review of the business for suppliers, banks and taxman. It also forces the
business owner to keep his or her accounts in order.
Abolitionists say the audit is an unnecessary expense; that the requirement
to file accounts with Companies House ensures records are kept; and that
outsiders have other ways of monitoring performance. Freed from the audit,
small business owners would regard their accountant as a friend and adviser,
not as an official snoop.
Like so many of the regulations that control business, it is the smaller
company that bears the heaviest burden of red tape. The typical company with
sales below Pounds 20,000 pays the equivalent of 4 per cent of turnover by
way of audit fees, compared with 0.8 per cent for the company with sales
between Pounds 100,000-Pounds 200,000, say consultants Graham Bannock &amp;
Partners.
Opposition to abolition of the small firms audit has mainly come from the
tax authorities, the banks, the Chartered Association of Certified
Accountants and many small accountancy firms. There are signs that the banks
are coming round to the idea, while the Institute of Chartered Accountants
in England and Wales, though it did not oppose the plan in the past, is now
more positive.
The ICA suggested in a consultation document last August that companies with
sales up to the VAT registration threshold of Pounds 36,600 should no longer
be required to undergo an audit. Those with sales up to Pounds 300,000
should be able to dispense with the audit if shareholders were unanimously
in favour.
But removal of the audit would not free companies from external checks. The
ICA wants in its place a 'compilation report', based on financial
information in the annual report and accounts. This report would have to be
signed off by a qualified accountant.
Banks are prepared to back the proposal for removing the audit for companies
with sales of less than Pounds 36,600, but are not keen for larger companies
to jettison the audit, even if all shareholders agree. The British Bankers'
Association says it wants to go 'one step at a time'.
Feedback from ICA members to the consultation document has shown 70 per cent
are in favour of relaxing the audit rules, although most demanded that
shareholders voted unanimously in favour even in the smallest of companies.
In spite of more than a decade of debate many accountants still appear
confused at the likely impact of removing the small firms audit. Many argue
that it would not make much difference to the smaller firm while claiming it
would lead to a sharp reduction in accountancy fees.
Much work involved in the audit results from the need to comply with the
Companies Act, says Lance Blackstone of London accountants Blackstone
Franks.
'A lot of time is taken up with checks for compliance purposes,' he says.
'Without an audit there would be fewer notes to the accounts.'
Others are less sure. 'We are sceptical about the extent of the savings
which the proposals can be expected to secure,' says Paul Chisnall,
assistant director at the BBA.
But the deep-seated fear of many of the 14,000 accountants who are
registered auditors is that abolition of the statutory audit will allow
companies to turn to cheaper bookkeepers to compile accounts. 'Companies
would shop around for any Tom, Dick or Harry to sign their compilation
report,' says Panos Mavron, a sole practitioner.
There is little doubt that many small companies would opt for the cheapest
solution to the chore of preparing accounts. But great care will be needed
in framing any new rules.
The introduction in 1981 of abbreviated accounts for small businesses had
the perverse effect of increasing the amount of work involved, since they
could only be compiled from the full accounts.
Proponents of abolition point to the US and many countries in continental
Europe which do not require small companies to have an audit or to publish
accounts. This has not prevented the development of a strong small business
community.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): BBC's capital venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These are venturesome times. Prime Minister John Major returns from India
and makes a plea for industrialists to become 'merchant venturers' while BBC
2 launches a prime-time series on venture capital entitled The Adventurers.
The six-part TV series follows a year in the life of Grosvenor Venture
Managers, a medium-sized company which will back most deals apart from
start-ups. The series provides an intriguing picture of a little-understood
financial sector.
A problem is that while the fly-on-the wall technique is good at conveying
impressions it falls down on explanations. Why should the BBC be devoting
six Sunday evenings to venture capitalists? What is their contribution to
the economy and how are they different from bankers - apart from driving
smarter cars?
This last question is crucial to the debate going on within pensions funds,
banks and the venture firms themselves on whether venture capitalists earn
their keep.
What is the viewer to make of venture capitalists from the first two
episodes? They do not appear to lead lives which are obviously more exciting
than those of many other City professionals though episode two conveyed the
brinkmanship involved in some of their deals.
Despite the liberal use of Grand Prix scenes, episode two could only confirm
the essentially humdrum nature of the game. The buzz provided by the
Troubleshooter series is lacking, presumably because investing money is less
visual than making sports cars or brewing beer.
The Adventurers was conceived at a time when venture capital still retained
something of its buccaneering image for backing start-up, high-technology
businesses. It has reached the screen at a time when a growing number of
those involved are only too happy to drop the venture tag and settle for the
more prosaic title of provider of private equity.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Vaz motion attacks BCCI liquidator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EARLY-DAY motion critical of Touche Ross, liquidators of the failed Bank
of Credit and Commerce International, yesterday won the backing of around 25
MPs after being tabled by Mr Keith Vaz, the Labour MP.
The motion came as MPs on the cross-party Treasury and Civil Service
Committee considered a draft report calling for compensation to be paid to
customers who lost money after the collapse of BCCI.
But the draft report, which also suggests the Bank of England should
shoulder more of the blame for the collapse, is the subject of intense
debate between the Labour and Conservative MPs on the committee. Its
criticisms may be toned down when the committee debates it next week.
Describing the progress of the liquidation as 'painfully slow', the motion
tabled by Mr Vaz notes that despite fees of Pounds 1m a week, 'no money,
apart from statutory compensation has been paid to depositors, local
authorities, or former employees of BCCI.'
It welcomes the government's move to 'consider' Touche's removal as
liquidators. Mr Neil Hamilton, trade and industry minister, said last week
that such a step followed 'representations.'

FT  02 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Scientists warn of increase in
jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
URGENT government action is needed to regenerate UK industry, an all-party
alliance of politicians, industrialists and scientists warned yesterday.
The Parliamentary and Scientific Committee said: 'Without change, we shall
at best become a manufacturing arm of Japanese, American and German
companies whose governments have for years taken a more positive attitude to
science and technology and to manufacturing industry than UK governments.
At the worst, this will lead to chronic mass unemployment with ensuing
community unrest.' The committee does not usually advise the government
directly, but it has sent its report to the prime minister and ministers
responsible for industry, science and education. Its warning follows a
conference, which the committee organised with the Royal Society, on Japan's
emerging lead in technology.
Sir Gerard Vaughan, chairman, said: 'The message from the conference was
clear and extremely disturbing: unless we make major changes, this country
will become largely a labour market for other countries, without an adequate
manufacturing base of our own. This will be disastrous for our future
prosperity.'

FT  02 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pledge on citizenship within
European union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, insisted in the Commons yesterday
that citizenship of the European union as envisaged in the Maastricht treaty
would involve no new duties for British citizens beyond the existing duty to
comply with community law as it was enforced, where necessary, by the UK
courts.
As MPs embarked on the tenth day of the line-by-line committee stage of the
European Communities (Amendment) Bill, there were protests from some
Euro-rebels that discussion of the Maastricht treaty had become irrelevant
in the wake of the devaluation of the punt.
Mr Tony Marlow, Tory MP for Northampton North, argued that the legislation
had become 'manifest nonsense' while Mr Dennis Skinner (Lab, Bolsover) said
it was 'crazy' to continue debating the bill when the exchange rate
mechanism was in effect dead.
But Mr Michael Morris, chairman of the committee of the whole House of
Commons, ruled that the state of the ERM was not relevant to the citizenship
provisions of the treaty under discussion.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said the treaty did 'not mean that we
scrap our own nationality or citizenship or that we subordinate it. It means
that running alongside our rights and obligations as British citizens is
European citizenship.'
Mr Bryan Gould, Labour MP for Dagenham, whose opposition to Labour's support
for the treaty sparked his resignation from the shadow cabinet last year,
claimed Maastricht would impose a duty of European citizenship which was
greater than the duty of citizenship of a single country. He called for a
referendum before the treaty could be ratified by Britain.
Leading Labour Euro-rebel Mr Peter Shore, MP for Bethnal Green and Stepney,
accused his own front bench of having failed to rise to the 'intellectual
level' required by the Treaty and of being 'lulled into acquiescent silence'
on its provisions.
Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat spokesman, won support from some Tories
when he argued that the controversy over citizenship of the European union
strengthened the case for allowing British voters to make their attitude
clear through a referendum.
Mrs Gwyneth Dunwoody (Lab, Crewe and Nantwich) said it was 'shaming' that
Labour leaders were not prepared to vote for an amendment moved for
'probing' purposes by Mr Blair and which sought to delete the citizenship
provisions from the bill.
Some Tory opponents of the bill joined with Labour backbenchers in voting
for the amendment, which was defeated by 280-75. Debate was adjourned until
Thursday.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory pit rebel warns ministers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POTENTIAL Tory rebels over the 31 threatened coal pits sought to increase
pressure on the government yesterday as ministers began the final stage of
discussions on the forthcoming energy white paper.
Mr Winston Churchill, chairman of the Conservative coal group, used a speech
to the Coal Industry Society to spell out the political risks to ministers
of failing to accept fully the recent Commons trade and industry committee
report on pit closures. 'Michael Heseltine cannot afford to court defeat on
this issue, which would be deeply damaging to the government and almost
certainly fatal for his own political prospects,' he said.
In broad terms, he added, adoption of the committee's recommendations would
save about 25 pits immediately and some 20 in the longer term. This
assessment contrasts with the judgment of some committee members that the
proposals would save 13 to 17 pits.
Mr Churchill said that the proposals would save the taxpayer almost Pounds
1bn in the first two years - taking into account the cost of the redundancy
and retraining packages proposed in October.
He added that recent movements in exchange rates had offered a timely
reminder to people in the power generation industry that if they wanted
security of supply without the volatility of exchange rates then they would
do well to sign up for long-term contracts with British Coal.
Senior ministers are in intensive discussions about the white paper with a
wide range of interests in the energy industries.
The complexity of the deal that needs to be struck means that final
government decisions will not be taken this week and ministers will have to
work hard to meet the planned deadline of the end of the month.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Magazine regrets 'distress' to PM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW STATESMAN and Society, the left-wing magazine being sued by Mr John
Major over an article in last week's issue, said in a statement yesterday
that it 'very much regretted' any distress caused to the prime minister.
Similar letters went to Mr Major's solicitors and those acting for Ms Clare
Latimer, also referred to in the article, and who is also suing the
magazine. The letters conclude: 'Just as speedily as the litigation was
commenced so we now hope that litigation can be speedily brought to an end.'
The New Statesman's considered reply from its lawyers says the article 'was
intended to be a serious and responsible criticism of the Press generally
for conducting a whispering campaign based on rumours which, when
investigated by the Press, had been found to be totally unsupported by any
evidence.
'That clearly was a comment on a matter of public interest since the
rumour-mongering and whispering campaign involved the Prime Minister.
'The article was never intended to assert that an affair, let alone an
adulterous relationship, had ever taken place between the Prime Min ister
and Ms Clare Latimer.'
It points out that the writs were issued and served before there was any
chance for the magazine to put the record straight in a formal statement and
says it will make any other public statement that might be needed to
vindicate Mr Major's and Ms Latimer's reputations. These views will be
repeated prominently in this week's New Statesman.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Two Guinness trial charges are dropped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSECUTION of Mr Thomas Ward in the final Guinness trial was scaled
down yesterday when two of the three charges against him were dropped for
lack of evidence.
The charges dropped on the order of the judge alleged that Mr Ward, a US
lawyer and former Guinness director, was guilty of false accounting and
dishonestly procuring the execution of a valuable security in relation to
the Pounds 5.2m he received after the company's 1986 takeover of Distillers.
Mr Ward still faces a third charge, which he denies, alleging that he stole
the Pounds 5.2m from Guinness.
At the start of his defence, Mr Ward told an Old Bailey jury that Mr Ernest
Saunders, the former Guinness chief executive, had agreed he should be paid
a fee that was 'in the millions' for his contribution to the takeover.
The two men agreed this after the Guinness bid had been referred to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission, apparently ending all prospect of the bid
succeeding.
Mr Saunders had been unhappy and depressed at the news. His advisers had
told him there was nothing he could do about it and had moved on to work for
other clients, Mr Ward said.
Mr Ward agreed to search for a solution but insisted he be guaranteed
payments of a size similar to those being paid to Guinness's other advisers
such as Bains, the management consultants, and Morgan Grenfell, the merchant
bank.
'I could not continue doing this thing without some understanding that I
would be paid and paid well,' he told the jury.
Mr Saunders had agreed that a fee that was 'in the millions' was fair, he
said.
Mr Ward then explained how he played a major role in negotiating with the
Office of Fair Trading to have the bid de-referred by agreeing to sell off
brands to limit the market share of the combined company.
Earlier, Mr Andrew Trollope QC, for Mr Ward, said his client had made no
attempt to conceal the nature of the Pounds 5.2m payment from the company or
its auditors.
Mr Ward came from a different financial culture where the awarding of
enormous 'success fees' was common practice, Mr Trollope said. Mr Ward had
earned the money through his contribution to saving the bid.
The trial continues today.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rail sell-off poses royal train
problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A QUESTION mark has been put over the future arrangements for running the
royal train as a result of the government's plans for privatising British
Rail.
Department of Transport officials are discussing with Buckingham Palace what
would happen to the train once the planned new regime of a track authority
and franchise-holders operating services is in place. At present the train
is run by British Rail.
Ministers are confident that a deal securing the train's access to track can
be agreed, given the prestige of the service. But the difficulty highlights
the question of charges that will have to be paid to the track authority by
anyone wanting to run a specialist service on the main network.
If there are several franchisees running regional services, arranging for
the royal train to run through a number of regions - for example from London
to Balmoral - would be more complex than now.
MPs are increasingly concerned with the cost of the royal family and the
issue is likely to arise in parliamentary debate of the privatisation. In

FT  02 FEB 93 / Iraq arms inquiry swamped with papers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VOLUME of material gathered by the judicial inquiry into the
arms-for-Iraq scandal is so great that it is likely to delay its conclusion
at least until the end of the year.
Lord Justice Scott, who is heading the inquiry, is believed to have hoped to
conclude his findings by early summer. This is now seen as the earliest date
by which witnesses - including former and current ministers - will begin to
be called. Lord Justice Scott was appointed to lead the inquiry in November
after documents released during the trial of senior management of
machine-tool makers Matrix Churchill indicated the possible involvement of
some government departments in trade with Iraq.
The Scott inquiry has been gathering a large number of documents, many
previously classified, from government departments detailing the involvement
of those departments in Britain's trade with Iraq in the 1980s. Those papers
are in addition to documents made available during the Matrix Churchill
trial and material from extra-governmental sources.
Among documents already made available to Lord Justice Scott's temporary
offices near Victoria, London, are believed to be some from customs
officials that raise questions about the extent of knowledge within the
government about secret projects in Iraq, such as the supergun programme.
Lord Justice Scott, soon after his appointment, invited anyone who had
information relating to alleged breaches of the government's policy on
exports to Iraq - and to what ministers knew about them - to entrust it to
his secretary, Mr Christopher Muttukumaru, an assistant Treasury Solicitor.
Lord Justice Scott has decided to read all relevant documents before
deciding who to call as witnesses.
It is understood that no decision has been made on what evidence, if any,
will be heard in public, or whether the inquiry will seek to subpoena
witnesses.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, has promised the fullest co-operation
from government departments.
One source close to the inquiry said: 'The kind of co-operation we have been
getting already would have been unthinkable had Mrs Thatcher been prime
minister.'

FT  02 FEB 93 / Capital spending in Wales up 8.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL spending in Wales is to total about Pounds 1.5bn in 1993-94,
representing a year-on-year increase of 8.5 per cent, Mr David Hunt, Welsh
secretary, announced yesterday.
Mr Hunt also used Welsh questions to unveil details of seven new industrial
projects involving investment by companies of more than Pounds 13m.
He said the projects, backed by regional selective assistance, would help
create more than 600 jobs and safeguard 260 existing ones in Wales.
The companies concerned include the manufacture of filtration and packaging
products, precision plastic components and poultry processing.
To opposition laughter, Mr Hunt said: 'The Welsh economy is already in the
forefront of the economic upturn.
'We are doing very much better than the rest of the UK, the rest of Europe
and many parts of the world.'
Health authorities in Wales are to get an additional Pounds 750,000 to buy
extra hospital treatment for their patients, Mr Gwilym Jones, the junior
Welsh minister, announced in the Commons.
Mr Jones said at question time that the cash would be spent on cutting
waiting lists in the current financial year.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Plasterboard prices about to rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICES of plasterboard widely used in construction and home improvements are
about to rise for the second time in eight months.
The move is likely to increase builders' fears of further increases for
materials as the economy recovers.
Contractors that have taken jobs at fixed prices simply to cover overheads
could face damaging losses if the cost of materials rose during the work.
British Steel and Pilkington, which supply large amounts of steel and glass
for construction, have announced price increases in the past three weeks.
Prices of some imported timber used in construction have also risen after
sterling's devaluation.
BPB Industries, Europe's biggest plasterboard producer, has told customers
it will raise the prices of some products by more than 10 per cent from the
beginning of next month.
Last summer the company increased prices by an average of about 15 per cent.
The move followed the ending of a bitter European price war between the
three largest manufacturers: BPB, Lafarge Coppee of France and Knauf of
Germany.
Plasterboard prices in France have risen by about a quarter and in Germany
by about 15 per cent since the beginning of last year.
The increases prompted allegations by builders, rejected by the Office of
Fair Trading, that the three companies had colluded over pricing.
Mr John Maxwell, BPB's chief executive, said the company was justified in
trying to recover a small part of its lost margins. He said: 'UK
plasterboard prices fell by more than half in real terms between 1987 and
1992.'
Lafarge and Knauf, which with BPB supply almost all the plasterboard in the
UK, are also expected to raise their prices again following BPB's latest
lead.
Contractors said they will try to resist price increases announced by
Pilkington and British Steel by turning to overseas suppliers if necessary.
Mr Allan Collins, president of the British Constructional Steelwork
Association, said he believed the increases would stick. He said British
Steel was prepared to supply smaller consignments, cut to the finer
tolerances that customers required and competitors found difficult to match.
Prices to constructional steel suppliers are due to rise by 7 per cent to 13
per cent from the end of this month.

FT  02 FEB 93 / ITC will consider separate city TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Independent Television Commission will examine the possibility of
starting a series of city television channels on Channel 5 now that plans
for a national network have been rejected.
The study will be part of an ITC assessment on what to do about Channel 5
after the rejection of the only application to run the national network. It
came from Channel 5 Holdings, a venture backed by Thames Television and Time
Warner.
The original plan drawn up with the Department of Trade and Industry was to
use 33 transmitters, allowing 74 per cent of the population to receive the
channel. The winner of the franchise would have had to pay for the re-tuning
of millions of video recorders.
The ITC will examine using different frequencies, removing the need for most
re-tuning.
The frequencies are those once considered for a sixth national channel,
which was rejected because it would have reached no more than 40 per cent of
the population. The ITC will study whether these frequencies could provide
more scope for city stations.
The 1990 Broadcasting Act would have to be amended to allow separate
licences for city-based services on Channel 5 rather than a single national
licence.
The ITC is expected to spend several months on a technical review and
publish a consultative document on future options for Channel 5 later this
year.
Thames was last night considering the ITC statement. The company has not yet
ruled out seeking a judicial review of the rejection of the Channel 5 bid.

FT  02 FEB 93 / New Forth road bridge could open by 2000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SECOND road bridge across the Firth of Forth could be built by the end of
the century, Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said yesterday.
Mr Lang announced that a feasibility study will be conducted into building a
privately funded bridge alongside the existing Forth road bridge with
associated road links. A scheme for a rapid transit system linking the
bridge and Edinburgh airport with the centre of the city will also be
considered.
Several construction companies have already indicated that they are
interested in building the new bridge and the new roads. The government
envisages that both projects would be funded from tolls levied on the
existing and the new Forth road bridges.
The new bridge would cost about Pounds 275m to build. New roads linking the
bridges with the existing Edinburgh bypass and the M9 motorway, as well as
improvements to the M90 on the north side of the crossing, would cost about
Pounds 100m, Mr Lang said.
The Scottish Office also proposes that British Rail build new stations both
on the north side of the crossing in Fife and on the south side to improve
rail traffic across the Forth.
Mr Lang said that tolls on the bridges would be set at the equivalent of the
2s 6d levied when the first road bridge was opened in 1964. That would mean
a toll at today's prices of Pounds 1.25 compared with the present actual
toll of 40p.
The toll on the present bridge might be increased while construction of the
new bridge was under way to help finance the new project and to deter
unnecessary journeys across the existing bridge, where capacity will be
exhausted by the end of the century.
Miller Group, the Edinburgh-based construction company, announced that it
was forming a consortium with John Laing and GTM-Entrepose of France to bid
for the contract to build the bridge and the associated roads. Bank of
America would arrange finance.
Construction groups Balfour Beatty and Trafalgar House, with Kleinwort
Benson, the merchant bank, are also understood to be considering bidding for
the project. Other construction groups expected to be interested include Sir
Robert McAlpine and Tarmac.
Trafalgar House and Kleinwort were partners on the privately financed
Dartford toll bridge across the River Thames and are working on the
privately financed Birmingham northern relief road. John Laing and GTM
Entrepose are jointly building a privately financed Severn bridge.
Observers believe that about six or seven groups may bid for the contract.
The Scottish Office would select the winner from a shortlist of three.
Mr Lang implied that completing the project by 2000 was optimistic, although
it could be done if the feasibility studies were completed in two to three
years, and the bridge built in four years.
The government's announcement that it favoured a second road bridge brought
a mixed reaction. The regional council in Fife welcomed the move as crucial
to the region's economic interests.
But Edinburgh district council said that a second Forth road bridge would be
'an environmental disaster for Edinburgh, west Lothian and the south of
Fife'. It would do nothing to relieve traffic congestion but add to it by
encouraging more people to cross the Forth, the council said.
Mr Lang said that a new road bridge was necessary and that extra demand on
the crossing could not be met just by increasing rail capacity.
The present bridge, built to carry 14,000 vehicles a day, carried more than
50,000 cars on each of 100 days surveyed last year, mainly during peak
periods such as the summer holiday season. Traffic increased by 5 per cent
in 1992 in spite of the recession, the Scottish Office said.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Post Office flotation hints prompt anger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HINTS that privatisation of the Post Office as a single unit is becoming an
increasingly favoured option in Whitehall have prompted angry opposition
from Labour and trade unions.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, yesterday confirmed
that a series of proposals for the Post Office's letter delivery, counters
and parcel businesses is under consideration at the Department of Trade and
Industry.
The government is so far committed only to selling the parcels division.
Other options include selling the letters and counters businesses separately
or retaining them. But Mr Heseltine said on BBC radio: 'There would be very
strong arguments put to me . . . that the Post Office should remain as a
single unit.'
He said discussions were at a preliminary stage. 'I have not got papers in
front of me that I could put to my colleagues,' he added. 'They have
therefore not been consulted or involved.' Downing Street confirmed there
was no timetable for considering the issue at cabinet level and that
decisions were 'some way off'.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said yesterday: 'Mr
Heseltine is contemplating selling off more than 150 years of a universal
letters service to pay for five weeks' worth of his government's debt.
'I would have thought this government was in sufficient difficulty over the
pit closure programme and British Rail to get into another bruising
confrontation with the public over privatisation of the Post Office.'
Mr Alan Johnson, general-secretary-designate of the Union of Communication
Workers, said there was no public mandate for privatising the Post Office.
'Politicians who are embroiled in the difficulties caused by the coal fiasco
and rail privatisation would be sensible to avoid tampering with a popular,
successful service which has been publicly owned for over 350 years,' he
said.
'Selling off a public asset may raise a quick buck, but at the expense of a
postal service widely acknowledged to be the best in the world.'
The Treasury will push strongly for the maximum revenue to be raised from
the sale, and so might favour the Post Office being sold in one piece. The
Post Office has been profitable without subsidy for 16 years, and last year
made a net profit of Pounds 152m on turnover of Pounds 5.1bn. A conventional
share flotation could raise Pounds 2bn.
Mr Heseltine said he would have to take into account the extent to which the
Post Office's employees could have greater involvement, and the need for
competition and value for money. He reaffirmed his commitment to a
nationwide delivery service and a uniform affordable price structure.
The Post Office's management has stayed out of the argument over
privatisation, saying only that Royal Mail should stay in one piece. It is
thought to favour privatisation on the grounds that it would gain access to
outside finance for expansion.
Buckingham Palace confirmed that the Queen, in whose name the Royal Mail
operates, had been advised of the options under review by the government. It
indicated that she would not attempt to block any sell-off. The Queen acts
on the advice of her ministers, an official said.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Low taxes urged for lottery and pools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDUCING tax on football pools and imposing a low rate of tax on the new
national lottery would be the best combination for all parties, including
the government, a study commissioned by the Sports Council has concluded.
London Economics, the consultancy, found that a 7 per cent tax on national
lottery proceeds would help beneficiaries, lottery players and government.
Reducing the pools levy from 37.5 per cent to 30 per cent and increasing
winnings accordingly would produce additional pools turnover of about Pounds
150m a year together with higher revenues for all concerned.
The Treasury has not yet announced the level of tax to be imposed on the
lottery but it is expected to be less than 20 per cent.
Even taking into account the effect on tax revenues of the re-direction into
the lottery of consumer spending from other areas, a 7 per cent lottery tax
would mean the government losing nothing.
It would also allow 35 per cent of turnover to go to the five nominated
causes - Pounds 450m on the conservative estimate that the lottery would
have revenues of Pounds 1.5bn a year. The five beneficiaries are sport, the
arts, heritage, charities and the millennium fund.
The London Economics study, which looked at 141 lotteries around the world,
concluded that the proportion of prize money critically affects the success
of a lottery. A one percentage point increase in the payout ratio of 50 per
cent would raise turnover by about 6 per cent.
Round the world the payout ratios for lotto games where players choose
numbers are in the band 46 per cent to 50 per cent. Passive ticket lotteries
are mainly 41 per cent to 45 per cent, while the payout on instant lotteries
based on scratching cards 55 per cent to 65 per cent.

A PROPOSED change to the duties of Acas, the conciliation service, would
breach commitments imposed by international law, the Trades Union Congress
said yesterday.
The government's Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill, now before
parliament, removes from Acas the duty to encourage collective bargaining.
The TUC argues that this would breach the International Labour
Organisation's Convention 98. This obliges signatories, which include
Britain, to encourage full development and use of arrangements for
collective negotiations.

DEMAND for graduates fell in every area of business activity except part of
the financial sector during the six months to October last year compared
with the same period in 1991.
But graduate salaries are still rising faster than inflation according to
the Statistical Quarterly bulletin of the Central Services Unit for Graduate
Employment. Demand for graduates in finance excluding banking, insurance and
actuarial jobs rose 24 per cent.
The report also shows that overall demand, measured by the number of
advertised posts in the unit's Current Vacancies magazine, fell by 4.8 per
cent compared with a year earlier.

BRITAIN'S 300-plus enterprise agencies, which provide advice to new and
small businesses, have established a national federation to represent their
interests, Charles Batchelor writes.
Business in the Community, which co-ordinates community activity by large
companies, acted as an informal umbrella organisation for the agencies until
last June when it announced plans to end the relationship.
Sir Graham Day, chairman of Cadbury Schweppes, has agreed to be the
federation's founding president. A senior Cadbury executive, Mr John Guest,
will be chief executive for the first year.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Call for textile training boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEXTILE and clothing comp-anies should invest more in training managers,
says Lancaster University's textile industry research group.
Training systems in textiles and clothing are better organised in Germany,
Italy and France, it says in a report. Training provision in Britain is
closer to the poorly co-ordinated systems in Greece, Portugal and Spain. Dr
Roger Penn, one of the authors of the report, criticised the 'lack of
effective training'.
The report's recommendations include:
Greater investment in training management. 'The textile industry needs to
accept that training does not end once professional and technical
qualifications in textiles have been attained.'
Better co-ordination between employers and education and training
institutions. The Department of Trade and Industry should take a lead. A
modification of pay to reflect individuals' training development. Unions
could take a lead by insisting that such issues became integral to
collective bargaining.
The industry is concentrated in north-west England, the east Midlands, the
Scottish borders and Ulster.

FT  02 FEB 93 / How banks can dodge obstacles to a 'warm sell': The data
protection registrar's growing concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISCLOSURE of Mr Norman Lamont's credit card details in The Sun in December
was a temporary embarrassment for National Westminster Bank, which issued
the card. But banks may regret for a long time having interested the data
protection registrar in how they use personal customer information on
databases.
Mr John Lamidey, assistant registrar with responsibility for financial
services, has become worried by several aspects of how banks use customer
data. He believes they may not only be evading their own code of practice
introduced last March, but could also be breaking the 1984 Data Protection
Act.
Mr Lamidey's intervention on behalf of Mr Eric Howe, the data protection
registrar, comes at an awkward time for banks. They have grown increasingly
interested in using the details they hold about customers' current and
savings accounts to sell them other products from insurance to holidays.
This is becoming more important for high street banks as they try to raise
other forms of income to compensate for losses on bad lending in the late
1980s. Banks are making large investments in insurance subsidiaries in the
hope of being able to 'warm sell' to existing customers.
The potential conflict between confidentiality of customer information and
banks' efforts to sell a wider variety of products was recognised in the
code of practice adopted by the banks.
This says banks and building societies will observe 'a strict duty of
confidentiality'.
Specifically, the code says that banks will not disclose details of accounts
or names and addresses to third parties - including other companies within
the group - except in tightly controlled circumstances. One is where
disclosure is made 'at the request, or with the consent, of the customer'.
Banks have paid less attention until now to the fact that the Data
Protection Act also imposes controls. This is likely to become more
important as banks make use of 'relational databases' which calculate from
personal and account details what sort of products might interest a
customer.
The eight 'data protection principles' say that companies should take
'appropriate security measures' to protect the data they collect and should
also obtain and process data 'fairly and lawfully'.
Mr Lamidey has started to question whether they are complying with the
second requirement.
The situation was summed up neatly in a recent report by Smith New Court,
the firm of stockbrokers, which pointed out that the code was 'an obstacle'
for Black Horse Financial Services - Lloyds Bank's insurance sales
subsidiary. Mr Lamidey is worried about two ways around the 'obstacle'.
The first is that while banks may not directly disclose names and addresses
of customers who they think are interested in insurance to their own
subsidiary, they may send out a mail shot on behalf of the subsidiary to
each customer.
The second is that banks may make it difficult for customers to avoid giving
consent to the broad use of data by asking them to sign their consent as a
condition of getting a particular financial service.
He cites a clause now inserted in forms for Barclays products such as
Barclaycard and Barclays Holiday Club.
Mr Lamidey thinks that a bank may not be obtaining data fairly if it makes
the wider use of data a condition of gaining a service.
It may not even be acting fairly if it makes it hard for the customer to
refuse consent for other uses - for example by insisting on a separate
letter.
An example of what concerns him is Barclays' application form for a personal
loan. It gives the bank permission to use all customer details on its
central information system unless the customer writes a separate letter to
his or her own branch giving account details.
Lloyds Bank wrote to all customers earlier this year asking them to give
express consent for names and addresses to be passed on to its sales
subsidiaries. But application forms for some products now tell people that
they will be sent other marketing material - without a choice being offered.
Mr Lamidey wants to meet banks to discuss such issues. Whatever the outcome,
it is clear that in future banks are likely to face far wider monitoring of
how they use data. Mr Lamidey is already asking questions about whether
customers of telephone banks are adequately protected.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Save &amp; Prosper to end free banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROBERT FLEMING Save &amp; Prosper is expected to announce today that it is
introducing some transaction charges for banking customers whose accounts
remain in credit. Reaction to the move is likely to be watched closely by
other banks.
The bank, which has about 50,000 customers, said yesterday that it could not
comment on its plans. However, it expected to make an announcement today
which would affect the terms for some of its current accounts.
Mr Ian Lindsey, the group's banking director, said that the bank wanted to
inform its customers first of any changes to their accounts. It had about
six different forms of account with different terms and conditions.
The group was among the financial services groups which introduced free
banking for customers in credit in the 1980s as competition between building
societies and banks for personal customers' business grew.
The large high street banks are all considering introducing charges for
customers in credit, but none has disclosed any immediate plans to do this.
Most banks only charge when personal customers' accounts are overdrawn.
A study by the Association of Payment and Clearing Services found that the
clearing system cost the banks Pounds 4.5bn a year.

DEMAND for graduates fell in every area of business activity except part of
the financial sector during the six months to October 1992 compared with the
same period in 1991.
But graduate salaries are still rising faster than inflation, according to
the Statistical Quarterly bulletin of the Central Services Unit for Graduate
Employment. Demand for graduates in finance excluding banking, insurance and
actuarial jobs rose 24 per cent.
The report also shows that overall demand, measured by the number of
advertised posts in the unit's Current Vacancies magazine, fell by 4.8 per
cent compared with the same period a year earlier. Vacancies in systems
analysis, software design, security and protection and hotel and catering
management fell by more than 90 per cent, it found.

FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Economy: Downing Street steps up campaign to kill rumours
 -Sunday newspaper story dismissed / Officials stress PM's support for
Lamont
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY was a day that had the government's spin doctors in a spin.
Number 10 Downing Street and the Treasury were working flat out to assure
the world that there were no economic policy differences between Mr John
Major, the prime minister, and his chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont.
For the second day running government officials were denying a story in The
Sunday Times that Mr Major had taken overall charge of economic policy and
was aiming to cut bank base rates to 4 per cent.
Instead the prime minister's office, the Treasury and Bank of England
underlined that last week's surprise cut in bank base rates to 6 per cent
from 7 per cent was an act of policy that had been thought through and
agreed among the UK monetary authorities. And so it appears to have been.
A sharp fall in sterling in Far East trading early yesterday forced the
government to reiterate its unusually explicit denial of a single newspaper
story. For reasons not altogether clear, reports on the UK economy in The
Sunday Times tend to exert a powerful influence over foreign exchange market
trading in Tokyo.
But the intensity of the government's publicity offensive pointed to the
bigger problem of faltering credibility that has dogged the re-balancing of
UK economic policy and the person of the present chancellor since Britain
left the European exchange rate mechanism on September 16 last year.
Rumours and suggestions that UK policy is being made 'by the seat of the
pants' and that the prime minister, rather than the chancellor, is in the
driving seat have been around for some time. As far as any dispassionate
observer can tell, they do not apply in these circumstances. But the
confusion surrounding last Tuesday's cut of 1 percentage point in bank base
rates to 6 per cent gave them a new lease of life.
The government story, rehearsed a week ago and repeated yesterday, is that
the base rate cut was agreed in principle by Mr Major and Mr Lamont in the
week before the final decision on January 26. Since then, there have been
numerous reports suggesting that the prime minister was the driving force
behind the reduction.
Downing Street yesterday denied that the cut was Mr Major's doing and said
it was suggested by Mr Lamont. An official who took part in the meeting
between the prime minister and the chancellor said it was a good-humoured
affair in which both men agreed that the rates should be cut and that the
timing should be left to Mr Lamont.
It was the timing and execution of the cut that ran into difficulties,
illustrating that the chancellor is, if nothing else, accident-prone.
A good time to announce the cut would have been when the big increase of
60,800 in the December unemployment figures was made known on Thursday
January 21. However, the authorities had other things on their minds - they
were gearing up to announce the appointment of Mr Eddie George as next
governor of the Bank of Eng-land.
Having missed that opportunity, Monday January 25 would normally have been
the occasion for the Bank of England to begin softening up financial markets
to expect a cut. However, this proved impossible, because of technical
difficulties on the domestic money market caused by a shortage of bills in
the hands of the discount houses.
Because the Bank of England was unable to push rates lower in its money
market dealings, it took the unusual step of announcing a minimum lending
rate of 6 per cent on January 26. There was a whiff of panic about this move
for those who were unaware of the money market problems.
Concern about the government's action was fuelled by anger among the
marketmakers in gilt-edged stock who had been positioning themselves for a
large auction of new government bonds the following day and found themselves
carrying large capital losses following the Bank's move.
Mr Lamont's presentation of events was not helped by the curious conventions
of purdah, the period of self-imposed exile from the press and public events
that Treasury ministers and officials undergo before the Budget each year.
The last on-the-record interviews given by the chancellor had given the
clear impression that he was reluctant to cut interest rates for fear of
breaching the government's target of holding underlying inflation within the
1 per cent to 4 per cent range for the life of the present parliament.
His isolation from the media, together with that of Treasury ministers such
as Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary, and Mr Stephen Dorrell, the
financial secretary, made the eventual rate cut all the more difficult to
sell as a considered act of policy.
There was no discussion among officials and policymakers about a more
drastic lowering of borrowing costs than the 1 percentage point cut.
The government was, and is, concerned not to trigger a free-fall of the
pound for fear of increasing imported goods prices and putting its inflation
target in jeopardy.
The US approach of bringing short-term interest rates down to 3 per cent has
not been considered relevant to UK conditions, in spite of the length of the
recession. UK officials say the drastic cut in US interest rates was aimed
largely at preventing a 'credit crunch' in the US banking system and geared
to building up US bank profits. US interest rates charged to the consumer
have fallen far less than those at which the banks borrow from each other.
The irony of the latest rate cut is that Mr Lamont went ahead with his
decision with the specific aim of boosting confidence in the economy after
hearing bad news of rising unemployment, falling output and declining retail
sales in the latest batch of government statistics. The controversy that has
surrounded government policy over the past week will have done nothing to
help his goal.

FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Economy: Experts at odds on pound's value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE relative value of the pound is not something on which economists easily
agree. The latest slide in sterling has done little to narrow their
differences, and the arguments about whether the UK's currency is overvalued
or undervalued continue.
Last year, before the UK left the exchange rate mechanism and floated the
pound on the foreign exchanges, the Treasury plus a number of City and
academic economists argued that the pound was correctly valued at a central
rate of DM2.95.
Their main argument was that the price of tradeable UK goods was roughly on
a par with European goods, converted at the exchange rate prevailing then.
Others argued that DM2.95 was too high, and was pricing UK goods out of the
international marketplace. They pointed to the size of the UK's visible
trade deficit in the middle of a recession as evidence that manufacturing
industry was unable to compete against Europe.
The latest drop in the pound to around DM2.38 puts sterling about 15 per
cent below its old ERM floor of DM2.778. Predictably enough, some of those
economists who thought the pound was correctly valued before devaluation now
argue that the exchange rate has slipped too far and will lead to higher
inflation.
Others are looking for it to fall even further before industry can regain
international competitiveness.
Mr Bill Martin, chief economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, believes that the
pound needs to fall to roughly DM2.00 and to parity against the dollar, over
the medium term, before the country can deliver reasonable growth levels and
relatively low unemployment. Low inflation would be delivered by the
government acting to restrain consumer spending.
But Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist at Kleinwort Benson, says there is
already evidence to suggest that the UK currency is heavily undervalued
against the European currencies, if fairly valued against the dollar.
'You only have to look at some of the industry location decisions which are
being taken at the moment, such as Hoover's decision to close its factory in
Dijon, in France, and concentrate on its factory in Scotland,' he says.
Economists will continue to disagree as long as different ways exist of
assessing the currency's value.
Those who argued that sterling was appropriately valued at DM2.95 when
Britain was in the ERM were using the 'purchasing power parity' valuation
method. This states that the correct exchange rate between any two
currencies is the one that equalises the price of the same traded item in
both countries.
The problem with this method is that it ignores other economic fundamentals,
apart from export prices, which determine whether a currency is valued at a
sustainable level on the foreign exchanges.
Thus Mr Martin argues that the PPP method gives a misleading view of a
currency's value.
It is all very well for the companies that have survived to price their
goods on a par with Europe and the US, but that ignores those companies that
went out of business in the 1980s, unable to compete with the pound at that
level.
The other method for assessing the value of a currency is to use
macroeconomic models to estimate the exchange rate at which the economy can
return the trade account into balance in the medium term.
The two methods tell very different stories. For example, the PPP method
suggests that the D-Mark is overvalued, while the second method suggests
that the currency, given Germany's large trade surpluses during the 1980s,
was undervalued.
It is probable that they will continue to tell a similarly inconsistent
story about sterling as the latest drop in the currency makes its mark on
the economy.

FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Economy: 'Lame-duck' chancellor's political capital
running out - Many Tories hope the tenant of 11 Downing Street will soon be
ejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DENIALS from Downing Street are no longer enough. The public support offered
by Mr John Major yesterday did nothing to disguise the weakness of his
chancellor.
In the eyes of his colleagues on the Conservative benches at Westminster, Mr
Norman Lamont is a lame duck. He has the office of chancellor but he lacks
its political authority.
That is not the assessment of political enemies but rather of a broad swathe
of the Tory party - ministerial colleagues among them. It is impossible to
find more than a handful who expect him to remain in No 11 after the summer.
There is a chance they are wrong. The atmosphere which seeps from the
lobbies, bars and corridors of Westminster is notoriously febrile. The mood
of Tory MPs swings from euphoria to despair with alarming speed.
It is hard to recall that Lord Lawson, blamed widely among Conservatives for
the country's present economic mess, was not so long ago praised as the
architect of an economic miracle. The Tory party is never slow to erect
pedestals for its leaders. It is equally quick to demolish them.
Mr Lamont has first-hand experience. He was attacked for his economic policy
before last year's general election; praised for the same policy after it.
In the wake of sterling's ignominious exit from the European exchange rate
mechanism last September many thought he should resign.
But the interest rate cuts which followed and the growth strategy in
November's Autumn Statement brought a reprieve, even a brief moment of
acclaim.
By January Mr Major had rejected the advice of friends to switch the
chancellor to the Home Office in a pre-Budget reshuffle. His decision
reflected a combination of stubborn loyalty and his concern not to upset the
political balance of his cabinet.
Mr Lamont had skilfully aligned himself with the Euro-sceptics. His
departure would have given dangerous ammunition to the opponents of the
Maastricht treaty.
But keeping him carried a price.
The two most precious commodities for any chancellor are the confidence of
the City and Westminster, and the instinctive trust of the prime minister.
The uncomfortable truth is that the Tory party no longer has faith in Mr
Lamont's ability to deliver the economic recovery he has promised so often.
His political peers are quite happy to believe he is reading a script
written in No 10. And in politics, perceptions often count for more than
reality.
A throwaway remark from a middle-ranking minister catches the general mood:
'I don't blame Norman but I don't know anyone in the party who thinks he is
an asset as chancellor.' A backbench colleague is more blunt: 'He should be
allowed to deliver the Budget and then packed off to the Home Office.'
Cabinet colleagues are not briefing against the chancellor. But they make
little pretence of expecting him to stay on for more than a few months.
Instead they tend to shrug their shoulders, pause and then speculate about
his successor.
Other ministers suggest he plays a muted role in cabinet discussions which
go beyond a narrow definition of Treasury interests. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
home secretary, and Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, are
established as front-runners for the succession. Sir Norman Fowler, the
party chairman, and Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, are other
possible 'compromise candidates'.
There is some sympathy for Mr Lamont. The disintegration of the ERM strategy
was a collective rather than an individual failure of government. Sympathy,
however, does not easily translate into confidence.
A graphic example of the chancellor's weakness came last week in the typical
reaction on the Conservative benches to the latest cut in interest rates.
Instead of the applause he might have expected, Mr Lamont instead found the
move greeted with deep suspicion: had he been panicked into the move or had
Mr Major demanded it?
There is no evidence of personal animosity between the two Downing Street
neighbours. Neither has yet formed a fixed view on the shape of the Budget.
Their meetings are described by insiders as perfectly amicable.
But that is only half of the story. Mr Major and Mr Lamont have never been
close political friends. If there is little animosity between them, there is
no instinctive rapport. As one insider puts it: 'They have to work at it.'
The prime minister knows that his premiership hangs on securing economic
recovery before the recession does irreparable damage to public finances. So
it is hardly surprising that he is taking a keener than usual interest in
the Budget and has taken the lead in promoting a new industrial strategy.
But tacit acknowledgement by Mr Major's aides that he has been driving
policy is hard to square with public pronouncements that Mr Lamont is in
charge.
Downing Street sees the risks on financial markets of a public rift. Mr
Major has acted to bolster Mr Lamont's standing. But it may be too late.
Public expressions of confidence in the chancellor serve only to underline
his weakness. Too many at Westminster remember Mrs Margaret Thatcher's
description of Mr Nigel Lawson as 'unassailable'.

FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Economy: How European slowdown is blocking exports / A
look at why devaluation has failed to deliver the hoped-for competitive edge
to manufacturers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXPERIENCE of the west Midlands suggests that the competitive advantage
given by sterling's devaluation is being blunted by the slowdown in other
European economies, especially that of Germany.
The slowdown in these economies is diminishing opportunities for a sustained
increase in manufactured exports.
Mr David Botterill, chief executive of the West Midlands Engineering
Employers' Federation, said: 'On balance, those companies that have
established export positions are finding it (the devaluation) favourable and
a counter to any diminution in these markets. For those with less
established positions its not clear whether increased inquiry is translating
itself into orders.'
Market pressures in the larger European economies are increasing. Mr Eddie
Kirk, chairman of Frederick Cooper which exports specialist metal coatings
and rubber products to Germany, said devaluation would change nothing
overnight, but German companies were 'more ready to take price cuts to hold
on to their market share' because home demand for German manufacturers was
falling.
Devaluation poses problems for pricing policy. Sterling has been trading at
about DM2.40 until this week, compared with its previous ERM floor of
DM2.778. Mr Kirk doubted the wisdom of pricing at present exchange rates.
The calculation at Frederick Cooper is that, in the medium term, sterling
will recover against the D-Mark as German interest rates come down. For Mr
Kirk, pricing at DM2.70 is a realistic rate. But it eliminates some of the
competitive advantage.
Mr Stephen Hayes, finance director of Bromsgrove Industries, explained that
with automotive component exports, devaluation has 'enabled us to secure the
larger share of contracts which are overseas-based, where we're on a dual
source'. Bromsgrove is finding its share of a supply schedule raised while
that of, say, an Austrian company is diminished.
Yet overseas customers are not prepared to allow companies the full margin
of improvement implicit in the devaluation. They see that devaluation has
given companies the potential to make greater sterling profits at the same
selling price and so push for price reductions.
Mr Stephen Birch, export sales manager of Kenrick &amp; Jefferson, the security
printer, said that in price negotiations long-standing customers are telling
the company that the effect of devaluation should be taken into account in
the agreed selling price.
On the other hand prices of imported materials are rising. Hampson
Industries reported that the sudden change in foam and fabric import prices
for its furniture division forced it to offer its customers a choice of
higher delivery prices or delayed deliveries while it re-sourced its
materials.

FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Economy: Clarke cool on ERM prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Political Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, said last night that the government
was unlikely to consider rejoining the European exchange rate mechanism 'for
some considerable time'.
He said on BBC's Newsnight programme that 'recent events put off rather than
bring forward the prospects of our going into the ERM.
'Right now, obviously, I think everybody can see that not only have we left
the ERM but there is no immediately foreseeable prospect of our going back
in, because the ERM itself is in a very uncertain state.
'Britain rejoining the ERM is not an option we are looking at at the
moment,' he continued. 'It does not seem to me very likely we will be
looking at it for quite some considerable time. There would have to be some
reform before we went back into anything like the ERM.'
The home secretary added: 'Actually, I think we are doing rather well
outside the ERM. The turmoil which is affecting some of these markets is
having a less adverse effect on Britain so far, and by and large we have
successfully managed a reduction of our interest rates to the lowest in
western Europe.'
Mr Clarke also played down any rift between the prime minister and the
chancellor of the exchequer.
'Whenever I meet them, they seem to be working very closely together and to
be on extremely good terms, and have a very clear idea of what they are
doing,' he said.
In the Commons earlier, Tory and Labour backbenchers attempted
unsuccessfully to halt the debate on the measure giving legal effect to the
Maastricht treaty on the grounds that after the devaluation of the Irish
punt the exchange rate mechanism was in effect dead.

FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Economy: Abbey National widens margins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEY National, the second-largest mortgage lender, yesterday said it was
widening its margins by cutting interest rates on some of its accounts by
more than the cut in its mortgage rate announced last week.
The bank, which shed its building society status in 1989, is cutting gross
rates by 0.95 of a percentage point on the highest band (Pounds 25,000 plus)
of Instant Saver, its instant access savings account, and by 0.7 of a point
across the board on its High Interest cheque account.
Its interest-bearing current account will continue to pay 0.5 per cent
gross.
The bank's mortgage rate was reduced by 0.51 of a point to 7.99 per cent on
loans of less than Pounds 60,000 in response to last week's 1 point fall in
base rates.
Abbey National said it had to widen its margins. If it had passed on to
borrowers the full base-rate reduction, it would have had to cut savings
rates by even more. It suggested that cuts to its 90-day savings account
would not be as great as on Instant Saver.
Rates on lower balances in the Instant Access account are being reduced by
smaller percentages.
The reduced savings rates come into effect today while existing borrowers
will have to wait until March 1 for reductions to monthly mortgage payments.

FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Economy: Scientists warn of rise in jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
URGENT government action is needed to regenerate British industry, an
all-party alliance of politicians, industrialists and scientists warned
yesterday.
The Parliamentary and Scientific Committee said: 'Without change, we shall
at best become a manufacturing arm of Japanese, American and German
companies, whose governments have for years taken a more positive attitude
to science and technology and to manufacturing industry than UK governments.
At the worst, this will lead to chronic mass unemployment with ensuing
community unrest and instability.'
The committee does not usually directly advise the government but it has
sent its report to the prime minister and ministers responsible for
industry, science and education.
Its warning follows a conference on Japan's emerging lead in technology,
which the committee organised with the Royal Society.
Sir Gerard Vaughan, chairman, said: 'The message from the conference was
clear and extremely disturbing: unless we make major changes, this country
will become largely a labour market for other countries, without an adequate
manufacturing base of our own. This will be disastrous for our future
prosperity.'
The committee points out that the combined research and development
expenditure of five Japanese companies - Hitachi, Toyota, Matsushita, NEC
and Fujitsu - matched all such private-sector spending in the UK.
It says: 'The government must manifestly exert leadership in promoting
recognition that science and technology are a crucial part of manufacturing
industry and that both are essential for this country's future.'

FT  02 FEB 93 / World Trade News: EC condemns US 'bullying' over contracts -
Long-running row about public procurement comes to a head
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community's senior trade official, Sir Leon Brittan, yesterday
condemned as 'unilateral bullying' Washington's threat to freeze out EC
companies when awarding US federal contracts.
His comments followed a statement earlier in the day from Mr Micky Kantor,
US trade representative, that the federal government would stop buying goods
and services from some or all European Community nations if the EC did not
end discrimination against US goods in public procurement contracts by March
22.
'This is the second aggressive trade measure in the first two weeks of the
new (Clinton) administration,' the European Commission said, referring to
dumping duties of up to 109 per cent provisionally levied last week on US
steel imports from seven EC states and 12 other countries.
Sir Leon said: 'I cannot believe it is in anybody's interest, European or
American, to attempt to deal with trade issues in this way. We do not accept
this form of unilateral bullying.'
He urged the US to show restraint, and said he would be discussing the
crisis with Mr Kantor in Washington during his first formal meeting with his
US counterpart on February 11.
The US action follows an almost year-long effort to reverse an EC 'utilities
directive', which came into force on January 1 and gives EC companies
preference in bidding for public utility contracts in sectors such as
telecommunications, power generation and transport.
The sanctions will only hit products not covered by the procurement code of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, such as telecommunications,
airports, waterways and services.
However, if the US withdraws from the Gatt procurement code, it will be free
to broaden the retaliation to include an estimated Dollars 500m worth of EC
contracts covered by the agreement. It will also send a signal that American
commitment to the Gatt is second to its determination to ensure what it sees
as fair play for its companies.
Mr Kantor called the action 'a measured first step'. He said that despite
many attempts at negotiation during the past year, 'the EC has simply
refused to show a sufficient desire to conclude a balanced agreement'.
The US complains that the EC directive discriminates against purchases with
more than 50 per cent foreign content by requiring Community utilities to
apply a 3 per cent price preference to 'European' bids and giving utilities
the option of rejecting non-European bids.
Sir Leon claimed Washington had not accepted an EC proposal which would have
frozen the dispute until a global solution was found. The US had yet to
respond to a broader EC document aimed at solving all outstanding issues, he
added.
He pointed out that Washington had protectionist policies of its own. He
listed the Buy American Act, the procurement policies of state governments
in the US and access to US utilities markets.
A US trade official said that in exchange for a liberalisation of the EC
Utilities Directive, the US had offered to bring a number of American states
into the Gatt government procurement code, and to deal with any 'legitimate
market access problems' EC companies might have with private utility
bidding.

<TEXT>
PRIME MINISTER Brian Mulroney of Canada has moved to quell speculation that
he will resign before a general election later this year. However, his
message, to his Progressive Conservative party caucus and to several
possible contenders, falls short of a commitment to stay.
Mr Mulroney is said to have told MPs that in the absence of an announcement
of his resignation, they should assume he is staying on. Some political
observers still think it possible that the prime minister, in office since
September 1984, will quit in a month or so.
Tories continue to lag far behind the opposition Liberals in opinion polls,
and Mr Mulroney's personal popularity is at rock-bottom. The latest Gallup
poll gives Liberals the backing of 49 per cent of decided voters, compared
with 19 per cent for the Tories.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Miners call strike at Peabody Coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PEABODY COAL, the largest coal producer in the US and a subsidiary of the
UK-based conglomerate Hanson, faces a strike by all 7,700 of its miners
today after union leaders last night called for industrial action over what
it claims are unfair labour practices.
Mr Richard Trumka, president of the United Mine Workers of America, said
that the strike would initially be limited to Peabody, but could be extended
to mines owned by other members of the employers' trade body, the Bituminous
Coal Operators Association, if the BCOA continued to refuse to negotiate a
wage agreement with the unions.
Talks between the unions and employers started on November 6, but the UMWA
claims that since then the BCOA has made no serious attempt to reach
agreement. Mr Trumka said that Peabody and other BCOA affiliates had
'refused to respond to even the most simple information requests' from the
union. The union called for miners to stop work at Peabody from midnight
last night, when the 1988 wage agreement expired.
Mr B R Brown, the chief negotiator for the BCOA, said last night: 'We were
unable to discuss any issues of substance because the United Mine Workers
union raised procedural objections and made take-it-or-leave-it demands,
refusing to talk unless the BOAC agreed to those demands.'
A prolonged strike at Peabody would be extremely damaging for the company,
and its parent, Hanson. In 1991 Peabody produced about 92m tons of coal from
71 mines, generating sales of about Dollars 1.7bn. Only Hanson's tobacco
interests make more money for the parent group than Peabody, which reported
net income of Dollars 263.5m in 1991, 13 per cent of Hanson's total profits.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Clinton streamlines rules for Medicaid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday ordered his administration to relax
controls on how states manage their portions of Medicaid, the national
programme that provides healthcare coverage for low income families.
Mr Clinton told the National Governors' Association that he had ordered the
Department of Health and Human Services to streamline its procedures for
granting waivers from Medicaid rules for states which seek new ways of
handling their healthcare problems.
Governors from both parties have complained for years that state budgets are
collapsing under the burden of Medicaid, as the federal government imposes
more and more requirements on them without providing the necessary funds.
Medicaid accounted for 14 per cent of states' budgets in 1990. and is
expected to balloon to 25 per cent by 1995. Total Medicaid spending will
amount to Dollars 189bn by that year with states picking up Dollars 81bn of
the bill.
Many states have tried innovative approaches to healthcare reform, but some
complain that DHHS waiver procedures have slowed them unnecessarily. Some
proposals, such as Oregon's plan to ration healthcare by limiting coverage
to a fixed list of medical procedures which produced real improvements in
health, have been rejected.
The Clinton administration is committed to producing a comprehensive reform
plan for the US healthcare system within 100 days, and the governors have
urged him to leave as much flexibility as possible for states.
The NGA has produced its own plan, endorsing the managed competition
approach which is also expected to form the core of the Clinton
administration's proposals. The governors also urge greater federal support
for primary and preventive medicine, including an expanded programme of
vaccinations for children.
The New York Times reported that Mr Clinton was considering a proposal for
the federal government to become the sole buyer for vaccines, which it would
then distribute free, either to public clinics or to private doctors.
President Clinton yesterday named Mr Kenneth Brody of Goldman Sachs, the New
York investment bankers, as his choice as chairman of the Export-Import
Bank.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Violence rebounds on Medellin: Colombia is taking a hard
line in the battle on drugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HUGE blast that ripped through the heart of the Colombian capital on
Saturday showed just how difficult it is for the government to protect the
public from the random terror tactics of the Medelln drugs cartel.
The 20 people killed by the car bomb were mostly shopkeepers, street sellers
and children.
Ten days ago two car bombs hit affluent office and middle-income residential
zones in northern Bogota, triggering intensive security operations, which
led to the discovery of 1,500 kilos of dynamite.
The government has said it will not negotiate with Pablo Escobar, the leader
of the Medelln drugs cartel, who it is assumed is responsible for the bombs,
and there appears public support for the position. The drug and guerrilla
violence which previously led people to support surrender negotiations and
peace talks appears now to be rebounding on its perpetrators. The public
approves of the increasingly hard line adopted by the government since the
breakdown of the peace talks with left-wing guerrilla groups in the first
half of last year and Pablo Escobar's escape from jail in July.
Colombian television newscasts are preceded by a string of photos showing
the nation's most wanted men - guerrilla commanders, bombers, drug
traffickers - and the rewards offered for information on them. This tactic
has produced results, with two rebel leaders and six traffickers killed or
captured as a result of tipoffs. A senior Medelln police officer said that
over 10 solid tips are phoned in every day.
Letters from Pablo Escobar to the government, threatening further violence
and demanding 'political' treatment, have received short shrift. He has
spent six months on the run from over 1,000 specialist troops in the Medelln
area, and has failed to negotiate a new surrender; the Bogota bombs are
evidence of a new approach.
Pablo Escobar said he was forming an armed rebel group, and that all further
dialogue should be carried out on the same terms as for guerrilla
organisations. A government communique dismissed this as an attempt to
disguise criminality as politics, in order to bargain for an amnesty.
Over the past year, the two guerrilla groups, FARC (the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia) and ELN (National Liberation Army), have been found
promoting poppy and coca growing, processing and transport operations.
Police commanders say the Escobar organisation has also contracted many of
its assassinations of policemen and car bombings to guerrilla units and
members of the Medelln popular militias. This has dispelled most remaining
doubts about the links between guerrilla and trafficking activities.
Under the state of emergency declared in November and extended for another
90 days last month, the government has stepped up military operations and
introduced special legislation to attack sources of guerrilla funding. A new
anti-kidnap law approved by the president also raises penalties and freezes
assets of victims and their families - over 1,100 known kidnaps were carried
out in 1992, the majority by guerrilla organisations.
The military and police budgets have increased substantially between 1991
and 1993, allowing the formation of new counter-insurgency companies, arms
purchasers, higher wages and expanded intelligence networks. Economic
targets such as oil and coal infrastructure are receiving greater protection
and several bombs have been successfully defused in urban areas.
Despite guerrilla attacks, which brought oil exports to a standstill in
November, reducing the country's growth rate, the government still
calculates the economy grew by 3.3 per cent last year. While businesses cite
security as their chief problem, the economic mood is more optimistic than a
year ago. Companies have adapted to the regular power cuts and electricity
rationing is gradually being reduced.
The economy thus continues to show the resilience it has demonstrated even
through the 1980s when the rest of Latin America was suffering recession.
Most independent analysts agree that 1993 growth should be between 3 and 4
per cent and expect the 25 per cent annual inflation rate to drop by another
2 percentage points or so. According to Mr Eduardo Lora, director of the
economic research group Fedesarrollo, higher public spending, private
investment projects and the oil industry will all help growth.
The government is starting 1993 with a sweeping modernisation programme
designed to streamline state institutions in line with the economic
liberalisation of the last three years. Apart from abolishing some entities
and restructuring others, the programme involves cutting some 23,000 jobs,
which is generating hostility among labour unions. A national strike of
public employees, including teachers, has been called for mid-February.
None of this has done much to improve the popularity of President Cesar
Gaviria, which sank after power rationing was introduced and Escobar escaped
from jail. However, political attention is even now shifting away from Mr
Gaviria to the candidates for next year's presidential elections.

polls, and Mr Mulroney's personal popularity is at rock-bottom. The latest
Gallup poll gives Liberals the backing of 49 per cent of decided voters,
compared to 19 per cent for the Tories.
In preparation for the coming campaign, Mr Jean Chretien, Liberal leader,
last week began a series of speeches in which he plans to outline the
results of an exhaustive review of party policy.
Mr Chretien pledged that a Liberal government would reduce the federal
budget deficit both in absolute terms and relative to gross domestic
product. The Liberals would 'seek to cancel' a CDollars 4.4bn (Pounds 2.3bn)
contract placed by the Canadian armed forces last year for European EH-101
anti-submarine helicopters.
Mr Chretien has also promised to scrap the 7 per cent goods and services
tax, introduced in 1991, which has proved one of the heaviest millstones
around Mr Mulroney's neck. The Tories have challenged Liberals to specify
how they would replace revenue generated by the GST.
Meanwhile, the government said yesterday that Mr Mulroney would meet US
President Bill Clinton in Washington later this week.

FT  02 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Kuwait cashes in on its Dollars 10bn
defence prize - But the emirate's insistence on reinvestment is taxing
foreign contractors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Arabian peninsula has become, since the Gulf war, the most lucrative
arms market in the world, but it is also becoming the toughest.
Kuwait, alone, is proposing to spend more than Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.6bn)
on arms procurement by the end of the decade. But, faced with a rash of
other spending needs, it is insisting that 30 per cent of the value of any
defence contract be reinvested in the emirate.
Defence contractors will not be alone in searching out investment openings,
since Kuwait wants all contracts worth more than KD1m (Pounds 2.1m) to
return 30 per cent in reinvestment. That would generate investment exceeding
Dollars 3bn over the next seven years, making the 'offset' scheme the
biggest such programme anywhere.
By comparison, the offset target set by the Saudi Arabian government for the
al-Yamamah project, a deal worth Dollars 30bn-Dollars 40bn, is Dollars 1bn
of reinvestment by British Aerospace and other contractors over a decade.
Even this target is proving hard to meet. After five years, 12 projects have
been approved but just one implemented - a Pounds 10m Glaxo pharmaceutical
manufacturing plant.
It is not surprising that Kuwait's offset proposals are boggling the minds
of defence contractors. 'It's a phenomenal task,' says one western official.
'There's very little here to invest in.'
Kuwait's ability to absorb foreign investment has been further diminished by
the effects of the war. According to local economists, wartime damage to
Kuwaiti businesses, the government's decision to cut the state's population
from 2.2m to 1.4m, and low business confidence have seen the non-oil economy
shrink by as much as 40 per cent.
The National Bank of Kuwait, the emirate's biggest, concluded in its latest
economic bulletin that 'given the new realities of reduced size of
population, high priority assigned to rebuilding defence infrastructure and
restoration of the oil sector, businessmen dealing with Kuwait will have to
scale down their expectations of upcoming major projects, at least for the
coming two years'.
But Kuwait's government hopes the offset programme will make up for the
paucity of locally-inspired investment.
In particular, the scheme aims to encourage investment in education and
training for Kuwaitis, high-technology industries, and joint venture
manufacturing and assembly plants capable of exporting throughout the Gulf.
After the war the government allowed Kuwait's non-oil industries to lie
moribund. It has now changed tack and reverted to its pre-war policy of
seeking to diversify as much as possible away from oil.
Accordingly, the offset scheme's architects at the Finance Ministry have
devised a 'multiplier' system as an incentive to steer investment into
target areas.
Any sum invested, for instance, in a training project would be multiplied
fivefold so that a Dollars 10m investment would count as Dollars 50m worth
of offset. Investment in research and development carries a multiplier of
three.
Recognising that few contractors relish the administrative burden and
complexity of offset programmes, the ministry has added other incentives.
The scheme will in some cases permit foreign companies to set up
majority-owned joint ventures in the Gulf state; the government has hitherto
insisted that Kuwaiti interests in any joint venture must always exceed 50
per cent.
In the end, however, the incentive for foreign contractors is simply the
huge bounty offered by Kuwait's defence programme. 'Companies will sign up
readily because they want to do the deal, then worry about the problems of
finding investment later,' says a US official.
Hughes Aircraft Systems, the US defence group, has been first to bite. Last
month it undertook to find reinvestment worth Dollars 27.6m on a Dollars 93m
contract to supply an early warning system. Raytheon, which has a Dollars
370m contract to supply five Patriot missile batteries, is discussing a
Dollars 120m offset commitment. So far neither company has submitted
specific investment proposals.
Kuwait's biggest arms deal since the war, General Dynamics' Dollars 2bn
contract to supply 236 M1A2 Abrams battle tanks, will not carry a full 30
per cent offset quotient, though, as the deal falls under the auspices of
the US foreign military sales structure, whereby Kuwait will receive the
equipment at the same price as would the US military.
Kuwait's next large military purchase is likely to be armoured personnel
carriers, a deal British officials hope GKN will secure, with a possible
Dollars 1.2bn order for up to 300 Warriors.
British Ministry of Defence officials are already looking at ways to set up
a structure to manage the offset, perhaps through an assigned offset office
in Kuwait or London.
But, as one US official remarks, British, French and other international
defence groups competing for a share of Kuwait's Dollars 10bn defence prize
should not spend too much time examining potential offset deals.
'The US firms were wise to get off the mark first,' he says. 'Kuwait is
going to run out of investment opportunities pretty quickly.'

THE leader of the Amazon's largest surviving tribe yesterday protested to
Brazil's President Itamar Franco about an invasion of illegal goldminers
threatening his people.
Mr Davi Kopenawa Yanomami told Mr Franco that the Yanomami people faced
extinction from diseases such as malaria and influenza brought into their
territory by the garimpeiros (miners). He called for immediate action to
remove the miners.
According to government figures 11,000 garimpeiros are operating illegally
inside the reserve in northern Brazil where the remaining 9,000 Yanomamis
live. Health Ministry officials recently withdrew from the area, warning of
a repeat of the 1987 invasion which resulted in 1,500 tribespeople dying
from malaria.

FT  02 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Foreign investors push developing states
to margins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVELOPING countries have been increasingly marginalised by foreign
investors over the past decade, with their share of global inflows falling
from 25 per cent to 19 per cent, according to an Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development report, writes David Dodwell, World Trade
Editor.
Just 10 countries - led by China and Hong Kong, Singapore, Brazil and Mexico
 -accounted for three-quarters of the inflow. This occurred at a time when
dwindling access to bank lending increased developing countries' reliance on
foreign investment.
The decade saw Japan emerge as the world's leading foreign investor, with a
strong shift towards investment in services and high-technology industries.
The report notes that the impetus for a quadrupling of investment from
Dollars 48bn in 1981 to an average of Dollars 188bn (Pounds 124.5bn) in 1989
and 1990 was economic growth, market integration, the globalisation of
business, the growth of regional economies, and technological innovation.
What happens in the 1990s will depend largely on these factors, it adds.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Rabin faces up to impasse on deportees: Decision by Israeli
PM amounts to big reversal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE announcement by Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin last night that
Israel will take back 100 of the 400 Palestinians it dumped unceremoniously
on a bleak Lebanese hillside in mid-December was his first public
acknowledgment that the expulsions had, in international terms at least,
seriously backfired.
There is no guarantee that the steps announced by Mr Rabin will resolve
either the immediate plight of the stranded deportees, who are likely to
reject them as inadequate, or the threat hanging over the Middle East peace
talks. But they amount to a significant reversal by Mr Rabin.
Since, in his dual role of prime minister and defence minister, he virtually
bounced his Labour-led government into approving the controversial
expulsions, many ministers had let it be known they felt the decision was a
serious miscalculation from which some diplomatic escape should be sought.
However Mr Rabin continued to insist, in his characteristic growl, that
there was no going back on what he said was a decisive blow against Islamic
fundamentalists waging a violent campaign in Israel and the occupied
territories against the Middle East peace process. He was buoyed by the
unanimous approval of the expulsions handed down by the Israeli High Court
last week.
The court decision, however, simply acted as the signal for a veritable
barrage of pressure from the Clinton administration for concessions which
would defuse growing international calls for action by the United Nations
security council to enforce Resolution 799 demanding the immediate
repatriation of the Palestinians.
President Bill Clinton had expressed himself during the election campaign
and through several of his foreign policy appointees to be a good friend of
Israel. But the prospect of having to cast the first US Security Council
veto in more than two years in Israel's favour, and of perhaps seeing the
Middle East peace negotiations expire so soon after taking office, was
clearly not something relished by Mr Clinton or by Mr Warren Christopher,
his secretary of state.
By yesterday, Mr Christopher and Mr William Harrop, the US ambassador in Tel
Aviv, had talked Mr Rabin round to offering a compromise. Mr Rabin said
Israel had to establish 'an infrastructure of understanding' with the new US
president.
Mr Rabin has almost certainly achieved that. Within minutes of his
announcement, Mr Christopher said any further action by the UN against
Israel was unnecessary - even counter-productive. The US has pledged to work
to get all the Arab parties - including the Palestinians - quickly back to
the peace table.
But it was by no means certain that the obstacle the expulsions placed in
the way of the 15-month-old peace talks had been removed. For a start, the
deportees themselves, mostly sympathisers of the Hamas fundamentalist
organisation which opposes the negotiations, said they would accept nothing
short of full implementation of Resolution 799.
This puts the Palestine Liberation Organisation, which backs the talks, in a
difficult position. The secular PLO, to which the Palestinian negotiating
team from the West Bank and Gaza owes allegiance, is a bitter opponent of
Hamas. Many of its leaders may well support a return to negotiations.
But it will be very difficult for them as long as Resolution 799 is not
fully implemented.
Mr Rabin faces another problem among his own people. Israelis overwhelmingly
supported the expulsions, but now the government has been seen to weaken its
stance in the face of international pressure, undermining the perceived
security benefits.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Aircraft group to receive Dollars 280m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ISRAELI government has agreed to provide a Dollars 280m (Pounds 185m)
restructuring package to Israel Aircraft Industries, the country's biggest
company, in the latest move by the state to bolster its struggling defence
sector.
IAI, which says it will report a loss for 1992 of between Dollars 50m and
Dollars 60m, will use the package to pay for the dismissal of 1,500 of its
17,400 workers and to invest in a new generation of civilian products in an
attempt further to decrease its traditional reliance on defence markets.
The defence sector, hit hard in recent years by declining world markets for
military equipment, has become one of the biggest burdens on the Labour-led
government as it tries to reduce the state's involvement in industry.
In December, the government pumped more than Dollars 280m into Israel
Military Industries to back a recovery plan which will cost 2,500 jobs out
of its 7,500-strong workforce.
That followed an earlier injection of Dollars 100m in state funds for IMI.
IAI said it had been hit by a Dollars 100m shortfall in expected sales in
1992 - ironically, mainly because of the recession in the civilian aircraft
sector in Europe and the US.
Under the terms of the government package, it will receive Dollars 50m in
cash, will convert a Dollars 30m state loan into cash and equity capital and
will receive Dollars 200m in state loan guarantees.
It will get a further Dollars 3m in research and development grants.
The company said it expected to break even in 1993 on sales of Dollars 1.5bn
and planned to return to profits in 1994.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Bophuthatswana - the slow trek to inevitable oblivion: Patti
Waldmeir finds little future for the homeland in any ANC-dominated South
African government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is no logic to Bophuthatswana except the terrible logic of apartheid.
That is the argument made by black anti-apartheid leaders who want to see
this testy little black 'homeland' abolished, and its territory
reincorporated into a new South Africa blind to both colour and ethnicity.
They argue that 'Bop', as it is disparagingly known, is a creation of
apartheid and should disappear along with its creator; that it was granted
independence by an illegitimate regime in Pretoria (the only government ever
to recognise it); and that there can be no argument for continued autonomy.
The reality, as always in South Africa, is not so simple. For as the
homeland's President Lucas Mangope points out, 'Bophuthatswana cannot and
will not be wished away.
'For us to change our constitutional dispensation, the change will have to
be for something better or alternatively a future which at least is as
good.'
The crux of his argument is economic: Bophuthatswana, a nation of 2m Tswana
people which gained nominal independence from Pretoria in 1977, has more to
lose economically from reincorporation into South Africa than any other
homeland.
Economic growth in recent years has exceeded that in almost every other
independent African country: the Bop economy grew at a real annual rate of
18.4 per cent in 1985-89, which compares well with even the best-run African
economies and far exceeds the performance of other independent homelands
(Transkei grew by 3.1 per cent, Ciskei by 7.4 per cent, and Venda by 11.4
per cent over the same period).
Critics argue that, as South Africa' best-endowed homeland, it is bound to
be the most prosperous - Bophuthatswana is home to one of the world's
largest platinum producers, and its proximity to the industrial heartland
near Johannesburg has made it the only homeland with any significant
industrial development. They ignore the fact that, on a continent which
scarcely distinguishes itself by the quality of economic management,
Bophuthatswana clearly excels.
But however strong Bop's economic argument for remaining independent, the
politics of the new South Africa will win out in the end. Bop officials
continue to pay lip service to their demands for self-determination as a
homeland for the Tswana people, and back their claims with historical
arguments about how the British split their nation in 1910, making part of
it a crown protectorate (Bechuanaland, now independent Botswana) and
treacherously ceding the rest to the new South African republic.
They argue that Bophuthatswana's independence from Pretoria only redressed
this historical wrong.
Government officials - including Mr Mangope's eminence grise, Mr Rowan
Cronje, former minister in the Rhodesian government of Mr Ian Smith and now
Bophuthatswana's minister of state affairs, defence and civil aviation -
insist Bop could 'go it alone' as an independent state after South Africa is
unified.
But realistically, the homeland could not survive with a hostile neighbour
in the republic: along with the subsidy, Bop would lose another quarter of
its budget if Pretoria cut off payments from the Southern African Customs
Union, and remittances from half the homeland labour force, which works in
South Africa.
The ANC, for its part, makes clear that no such subtle methods would be used
if it were in power: ANC officials say privately that they would 'finish Bop
off' within days, if necessary through military means.
Faced with the inevitability of reincorporation, Bop has shifted the focus
of its political battle to demanding substantial regional autonomy in the
new South Africa, in alliance with right-wing Afrikaners who dominate the
western Transvaal and northern Cape regions, over which are strewn six of
the seven separate bits of Bophuthatswana.
As presently envisaged, Bop's dream of a 'TswanaBoereland' is unrealistic:
it would cover a huge chunk of South Africa, including some of the best gold
mines, and would jealously guard mining royalties, company and other taxes
for the regional government.
The ANC will grant only far more limited autonomy to this or any other
region in the new South Africa, and a long battle lies ahead before a final
deal.
A recent Amnesty report concluded that the Bop authorities 'have continued
to rely on their powers under security legislation to silence their
opponents. Violent coercion has occurred through harassment, detention and
torture of activists and use of excessive force against demonstrators'.
In the end, Bophuthatswana must make its peace with the new South Africa and
must make the best deal it can with the ANC; however stubbornly it clings to
sovereignty - Bop recently opened its own information office in Latvia, of
all places - its days of independence are surely numbered.

MOROCCO has signalled its readiness to lift exchange controls on current
account operations.
It has advised the International Monetary Fund that it wishes to comply with
the IMF's Article 8, under which countries are also required to allow
foreign investors freedom to repatriate their capital investments and remit
their profits.
In a further liberalisation measure, private citizens will be entitled to
higher foreign currency allowances than previously, allowing payment for
medical treatment and education abroad.
Tunisia made a similar approach to the IMF over Article 8 early in January.
The moves mark a big step for both countries towards liberalising their

<TEXT>
MR MUNGUL DIAKA, governor of Zaire's capital Kinshasa, yesterday banned all
political meetings and public gatherings in the wake of last week's riots in
which at least 65 people died, Reuter reports from Kinshasa.
The governor, an ally of embattled President Mobutu Sese Seko, also
announced that any newspaper considered to be inciting hatred and violence
would be seized. The capital, a sprawling city of 3m people, remained tense
yesterday but appeared quiet, despite bursts of rifle fire and the dull boom
of heavier weapons being heard throughout Sunday night. State radio said
some looting continued.
Central Kinshasa was virtually deserted again. Few cars were on the streets,
although growing numbers of pedestrians were venturing outside. The smart
Gombe district, which includes embassies and the luxury Intercontinental
Hotel packed with rich families escaping the violence, has been declared a
military 'operational zone.' However, Zairean residents said they had no
trouble entering or leaving the area.
The military zone was clearly meant not so much to stop looters as to warn
soldiers from Belgium, Zaire's former colonial power, not to land to
evacuate their nationals.
At least 400 Belgian paratroops have arrived in the Congolese capital
Brazzaville, just across the river, but Mr Mobutu has denied them permission
to enter Zaire. Several dozen French troops are already in Kinshasa to
protect French citizens, with Mr Mobutu's approval.
Belgian companies operating in the country have repatriated most of their
expatriate staff from the capital, several of the companies said yesterday,
Reuter writes from Brussels.
Belgium on Sunday asked all its citizens in Kinshasa to gather to be
repatriated. There were around 1,000 Belgian nationals in Kinshasa.

<TEXT>
A PLAN by Taiwan's president, Mr Lee Teng-hui, to transfer power from
old-guard conservatives to a younger generation has triggered a power
struggle in the ruling Nationalist party, agencies report from Taipei.
Mr Hau Pei-tsun, the 73-year-old premier, announced at the weekend that he
would soon resign to mend a rift between liberal and conservative factions.
Mr Hau, leader of the conservative faction, is recommending that Mr Lin
Yang-kang, 65, head of the government's judicial branch, be chosen as his
successor.
Mr Lee is reported to favour Mr Lien Chan, 56, who now holds the post of
governor of Taiwan.
Pressure for Mr Hau's resignation increased after the Nationalists saw their
share of the vote plunge to a record low of 53 per cent in the December 19
parliamentary elections, the first in four decades.
When parliament convened yesterday, Nationalist legislators supporting Mr
Hau, in an apparent move to embarrass Mr Lee, did not back the party's
endorsement of Mr Liu Sung-fan as president of the parliament.
In addition, the 50 opposition lawmakers of the Democratic Progressive Party
walked out during the swearing-in ceremony and took their oaths outside the
meeting hall, saying they did not want to take the oaths in front of the
Nationalist flag.
The ruling party retained a parliamentary majority but the DPP more than
doubled its number of seats to 50 in the 161-seat legislature.

JAPANESE business confidence has fallen sharply over the past three months,
according to a survey of senior executives published yesterday which showed
that 70 per cent do not expect their company's performance to improve before
the final three months of the year.
The survey by the Keidanren, the leading employers' federation, found that
seven out of 10 top business executives think their company's profits will
only start to recover between October and December.
The 252 business leaders forecast Japan's economy would grow by 2.5 per cent
in the coming fiscal year from April, down from the 2.9 per cent they
forecast in a similar survey in November. About 44 per cent of the
respondents said the economy as a whole would only begin to recover towards
the end of the year.
The results of the survey will add to pressure on the Bank of Japan to cut
interest rates and on the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to bring forward
plans for an emergency public spending package to stimulate the ailing
economy.
Business leaders will renew their calls for a more expansionary policy at a
meeting with LDP leaders on Friday. Officials figures for business and
consumer confidence due to be published today will confirm the depressed
state of the economy.
The momentum behind the downturn was underlined yesterday by official
figures showing that sales of cars were down 10.5 per cent last month
compared with January 1992 and that sales of lorries were 15 per cent lower.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Israel seeks EC restraint over deportees issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL yesterday urged the European Community to show restraint in the
Palestinian deportees controversy so as not to disrupt efforts to strengthen
bilateral trade ties.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, made the plea during talks in
Brussels which included meetings with Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission
president and senior EC commissioners, and a dinner with EC foreign
ministers.
The EC last December condemned the Israeli decision to deport more than 400
Palestinians to Lebanon. Work to update the 1975 EC-Israel trade accord
slowed down, but the Community has been reluctant to take additional steps
because the Israeli government led by Mr Yitzhak Rabin is viewed as more
flexible in the Middle East peace talks than its predecessor led by Mr
Yitzhak Shamir.
Mr Peres said yesterday that Israel, Egypt, the US and the EC were working
jointly to resolve the deportee controversy in a manner 'acceptable to all
parties', but he declined to offer details. He noted however that Israel
could not comply with present UN resolutions because they made no reference
to the Hamas deportees.
Mr Peres singled out Israel's willingness to be constructive in an interview
yesterday. Recent measures included an end to settlements in the occupied
territories, an end to subsidies for Jewish housing in the West Bank and
Gaza, and a change in the law banning contacts with the Palestine Liberation
Organisation.
The Israeli foreign minister said the Egyptians had been very helpful in
trying to resolve the row over the deportees. He also invited EC foreign
ministers - the so-called 'troika' - to visit Israel, declaring that his
government wanted to have a relationship with the Community 'more or less
parallel with the US'.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Union spice in Cathay Pacific glamour: Air hostesses set
awkward agenda for Governor Patten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN STARK contrast to their advertising image of passive glamour, Cathay
Pacific's air hostesses have sparked a controversial re-evaluation of Hong
Kong's labour laws, following the ending of their 17-day strike on Saturday.
It is a theme that could prove awkward for Governor Chris Patten.
Mr Patten's push for further democracy has helped earn him the label of a
man of the people. He has proposed a more representative government, despite
opposition from a conservative business lobby, and made a great show of
introducing transparency and accountability into the administration.
But although he has talked of Hong Kong having a first-world economy and a
third-world environment, he seems unlikely to want to alter the colony's
working environment by encouraging its nascent trade union movement.
The flight attendants' strike initially focused on the issue of being forced
temporarily to fill junior positions. The dispute escalated when Cathay
Pacific fired three flight attendants for following union recommendations
not to 'work down'.
Neither Cathay nor the strikers wanted the issue to be politicised, but when
the airline insisted on retaining its legal right to discipline striking
staff - and ultimately to sack them - the dispute evolved into a debate over
whether workers should be allowed to strike.
The argument literally moved onto Mr Patten's door-step, when the so-called
'perfume picket line' relocated to the entrance of Government House in the
hope of forcing his support. However, the strikers' only glimpse of the
governor was when he drove out en route for the airport and Bali, and the
administration has kept surprisingly quiet on the issue.
Employees are allowed to strike, but they have to face the consequences of
any breach of their employment contract. Dr CK Law, research director at
South China Brokerage, says: 'The labour laws in Hong Kong are very much out
of the 19th century.'
One vocal commentator might have been expected to take sides in a fight
between a group of workers and a traditional British company, has been
noticeably silent: China. The fact that Beijing-controlled company CITIC
Pacific is a big shareholder in Cathay is one possible explanation, but it
is also likely that Beijing would not wish to see the trade union movement
strengthened prior to 1997.
Cathay itself has urged change, since the wildcat strike that started the
walk-out - and may have cost the company more than Dollars HK200m (Pounds
16.6m) - was started with the agreement of just 114 of the 3,700 members of
the Flight Attendants Union (FAU).
Furthermore, Mr Martin Lee, leader of the United Democratic party, has been
highly critical of the role of Mrs Katherine Fok, the Commissioner for
Labour, who turned down requests by legislators for the appointment of a
special conciliation officer for the dispute. 'We were compelled to draw the
conclusion that the people above (Mrs Fok) did not want her to do anything,'
said Mr Lee, who indicated that the administration could be influenced by
the fact that Cathay Pacific is a company controlled by both British and
Chinese interests.
Mr Lee's party, which thus far has been a staunch supporter of Mr Patten,
controls 12 of the Legislative Council's 60 seats. It would expect support
from other liberal factions, for any legislative changes which the United
Democrats put forward. But this might not be enough.
Mr YN Yiu, deputy commissioner for labour, said a review would be conducted,
but he emphasised that the review would 'have to take into account local
conditions.' He said that minimum statutory benefits for Hong Kong workers
were already at least as good as those in other similar South Asian
economies.
The Co-operative Resources Centre, the conservative political grouping,
welcomed the government's review, but it is also unconvinced of the need for
drastic change.
CRC spokesman Mr Ronald Arculli pointed to the fact that there had been very
few labour disputes in Hong Kong's history and said 'one wonders whether the
current difficulties are not being unduly politicised by the unions.'
The last major industrial dispute in Hong Kong, was the 1989 strike by China
Motor Bus drivers, which lasted 2 days and was almost immediately resolved
to the satisfaction of the union. Since then, a tight labour market has
enabled dissatisfied workers to obtain alternative employment.
February will herald the review by the Legislative Council of Mr Patten's
controversial blueprint for political reform, and it is easy to assume that
this will overwhelm any reaction to Hong Kong's most high profile industrial
dispute - despite the attempts of Martin Lee.
As Dr Law said: 'If the business community stands firm, I don't think the
government will make any changes. I think the issue will just die down'. The
business community appears happy to dismiss the strike as a glamorous
aberration.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Aircraft group to receive Dollars 280m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ISRAELI government has agreed to provide a Dollars 280m (Pounds 185m)
restructuring package to Israel Aircraft Industries, the country's biggest
company, in the latest move by the state to bolster its struggling defence
sector.
IAI, which says it will report a loss for 1992 of between Dollars 50m and
Dollars 60m, will use the package to pay for the dismissal of 1,500 of its
17,400 workers and to invest in a new generation of civilian products in a
bid to underpin its strategy of decreasing its traditional reliance on
defence markets at home and abroad.
The defence sector, hit hard in recent years by declining world markets for
military equipment, has become one of the biggest burdens on the Labour-led
government as it attempts to reduce the state's large-scale involvement in
industry.
In December, the government pumped more than Dollars 280m into Israel
Military Industries to back a recovery plan which will cost 2,500 jobs out
of its 7,500-strong workforce.
That followed an earlier injection of Dollars 100m in state funds for IMI.
The government, facing historically high unemployment levels of more than 10
per cent of the workforce, is reluctant to see big closures in the defence
industries, which account for a large proportion of Israel's industrial
output. IAI's annual overseas sales of around Dollars 1.25bn alone account
for some 17 per cent of Israeli industrial exports.
IAI said it had been hit by a Dollars 100m shortfall in expected sales in
1992 - ironically, mainly due to the recession in the civilian aircraft
sector in Europe and the US.
Under the terms of the government package, it will receive Dollars 50m in
cash, will convert a Dollars 30m state loan into cash and equity capital and
will receive Dollars 200m in state loan guarantees.
It will get a further Dollars 3m in research and development grants.
The company said it expected to break even in 1993 on sales of Dollars 1.5bn
and planned to return to profits in 1994.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has begun a one-month inquiry into the impact of the
merger between British Airways and Dan-Air, the ailing UK airline, on
services between Belgium and Britain, writes Andrew Hill.
Belgium complained about the possible anti-competitive effects of the deal
at the end of November. The Commission explained yesterday that it did not
begin its formal investigation until January 19, because Belgium did not
initially provide enough information about its complaint.
It announced in November that it would not investigate the Dan-Air takeover
because it was too small to fall under Brussels' jurisdiction, but Belgium
activated a previously unused clause in the EC's merger rules which allows a
separate inquiry into the implications for a national market.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Russia aims to make free market 'irreversible'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government will this month try to make the free market system
'irreversible' by greatly extending the system of mass privatisation
auctions throughout the country.
Around 300 medium-sized or large enterprises in 41 regions of Russia are
scheduled to be privatised through voucher auctions over the next six weeks.
The sales include 10-15 very large companies with 10,000-plus workers each.
If successful, these auctions will raise the tempo of sales considerably,
from 11 in December and around 25 in January.
The exercise, which should involve up to 5,000 large enterprises in the
course of this year, is the largest sell-off of state assets ever attempted
and is being seen as central to overall reform under way in Russia.
Mr Anatoly Chubais, the Russian deputy prime minister in charge of
privatisation, said at the World Economic Forum in Davos yesterday that he
expected 'fierce political battles' with communists and their supporters in
parliament over the reforms, but millions of people now supported the
programme. 'I believe we won the privatisation process in 1992 and if we win
only part of what we want to do in 1993, it will be enough to make the whole
process irreversible for all time,' he said.
Russian citizens have been sceptical about sales, reflected in low prices
for the privatisation vouchers. Nearly all of Russia's 150m population have
received one voucher, each of which has a nominal value of Rbs10,000 and can
be exchanged for shares. However, in the secondary markets, where it is
estimated that 20-30 per cent of voucher holders are selling their vouchers
immediately, prices obtained are only Rbs4,000-Rbs5,000.
Money raised from the sales is split between central and local government
and the companies themselves.
The Russian government more than doubled gas prices for industrial and
household consumers yesterday in an effort to bring energy prices closer to
world levels. Industrial users will pay Rbs3,600 per 1,000 cubic metres, up
from a maximum of Rbs1,600. Household users will pay Rbs600 per 1,000 cu m,
up from Rbs216. Gas industry officials said the price rise was to cover
investment needs.

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIGNS of confidence returned to the Dublin financial markets yesterday,
after the 10 per cent devaluation of the punt at the weekend, writes Tim
Coone in Dublin.
Foreign exchange dealers reported heavy fund inflows, reversing last week's
outflows and pushing the punt up to its new ceiling within the ERM band of
DM2.44. The Irish gilts market was also active. The National Treasury
Management Agency, which manages the government's debt, placed around
IPounds 150m of 5- and 10-year maturity stocks on the market, which dealers
say were quickly taken up.
On the Irish stock exchange, the ISEQ overall index gained almost 5 per
cent, with financial and food stocks performing particularly well. The most
active buyers on the foreign exchange market were corporations and foreign
banks.
Dealers said overseas buyers were still exercising caution, and that much of
yesterday's dealing was related to profit-taking resulting from positions
taken out by speculators before the weekend.
The central bank dropped its overnight lending rate from 100 per cent to 14
per cent yesterday, and the key one-month interbank interest rate fell
sharply to 16 per cent from over 40 per cent, where it stood most of last
week.
Concerns linger that commercial lending rates, particularly mortgage rates,
might still be increased if interbank rates do not fall further.
The building societies hinted yesterday that they might still be obliged to
increase mortgage lending rates, at present standing at about 14 per cent,
if the one-month rate does not fall below 14 per cent.
Analysts say much now hinges on sterling's performance. Further weakness of
the pound could undermine the effect of the devaluation.
The punt was yesterday trading at about 1.03 to the pound, still well above
the level of 0.93 to sterling before sterling was taken out of the ERM last
September.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Bundesbank attack on Emu plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEADING member of the Bundesbank policy-making council last night
criticised as 'much too ambitious' the timetable for European economic and
monetary union.
Mr Reimut Jochimsen, president of the North Rhine-Westphalia central bank
and a favourite to take over as Bundesbank vice-president later this year,
said he favoured ratification of the Maastricht treaty but attacked the plan
for monetary union by the end of the century.
He also said he opposed the idea that movement to a single currency would be
irreversible and automatic.
Speaking at Nuffield College, Oxford, he said Germany and its EC partners
decided to speed up European union after the breach of the Berlin Wall in
November, 1989 because of 'the idea that Germany would want to escape from
its obligations of European integration'.
He admitted that recession-hit European countries were facing difficulties
in meeting the public debt and deficit targets laid down in the treaty. This
was because 'the Maastricht treaty was never subjected to a test of how it
would be fitted in to medium-term cyclical developments'.
Although long-term German interest rates were not particularly high, he
conceded the Bundesbank's monetary policies - the result of 'persistent
imbalances in the German policy mix' - were causing difficulties abroad.
'Germany in year three (after re-unification) is putting a burden on Europe.
This has to be dealt with - it has to be solved. But we are tied up with the
political issue of whether the Maastricht treaty will be ratified (by all 12
EC countries) or not. This is taking far too much time - time we do not
have.'
Commenting on the devaluation of the Irish punt, he said realignments in the
European Monetary System should be made less dramatic, so that they were no
longer 'the end of the world'.
He added: 'This would help get the EMS off the ground again, and avoid
turning it into an ever more political process, where heads of state and
government announce what is happening.'
On Germany's domestic economic problems, he said the country was in
recession but was not entering a 'cumulative downturn'.
Since Germany was likely to run a current account deficit for 'some years',
monetary policy had to remain cautious. He warned that the German
government's deficit reduction package announced last month was based on
forecasts of 2.9 per cent annual economic growth after 1994 which could turn
out to be over optimistic.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Italian Socialists promise not to leave coalition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S Socialist Party last night pledged its full support for Prime
Minister Giuliano Amato's shaky four-party coalition.
Party leader Bettino Craxi quashed rumours that the Socialists were
considering withdrawing from the government after a police raid on their
offices last week.
'We have always supported the government,' Mr Craxi said after a crisis
meeting of party leaders. 'We have always opposed and we will continue to
oppose a government crisis which would only hurl us into an abyss.'
If the Socialists pulled out, the government would fall.
Behind the scenes, however, Mr Craxi was earlier reported to have threatened
to leave the coalition. This threat, coupled with the tension in the party
over the fate of Mr Craxi, has obliged Mr Amato to place the plight of his
government above that of his party.
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has played an important part in encouraging
the prime minister to take this position. On Sunday he pointedly summoned Mr
Amato to the presidential palace.
The extent of Mr Scalfaro's influence in keeping the coalition alive was
also underlined by former president Francesco Cossiga, who observed
yesterday that there was a return to a strong presidency. Mr Amato's
position towards Mr Craxi has been followed by Mr Claudio Martelli, justice
minister, and Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, environment minister.
Mr Amato, who refused to attend yesterday's meeting, needs all the support
he can muster on Thursday when his government, with only a slim majority,
faces a series of no-confidence motions from opposition parties.
This comes as the coalition risks being undermined by a bitter battle
between Mr Craxi - the prime minister's notional party superior and former
close colleague - and the Italian judiciary.
Mr Craxi has received three separate advisory notes from Milan magistrates
that he is under investigation for alleged corruption and illegal party
financing. Parliament must consider whether to waive his parliamentary
immunity.
He has rejected any suggestion of wrong-doing and has gone on the offensive,
claiming the magistrates are out to undermine Italian democracy. He claims
they have over-stepped their authority in the 11-month-old Milan corruption
scandal and are conducting a campaign of denigration of himself and the
Socialist party.
The mere prospect of a political chaos rattled financial markets on Monday.
Bonds opened sharply lower and failed to recoup, and the lira had slipped on
opening to 934 against the D-Mark from 928 on Friday.

<TEXT>
THE Irish government yesterday denounced the management of the European
exchange rate mechanism and warned that, without closer co-operation, member
states' currencies risked being 'picked off one by one' on the foreign
exchange markets.
However, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, last night threw
his weight behind the European Monetary System, arguing that it had a good
long-term record in promoting monetary stability and economic convergence
across Europe.
Mr Dick Spring, Irish minister for external affairs, told his European
Community counterparts meeting in Brussels that a more effective collective
response was needed to deter speculators following the weekend devaluation
of the punt.
Without naming the French franc, which has received substantial support from
the Bundesbank, he suggested some countries were receiving more support than
others.
The 10 per cent devaluation of the punt last Saturday led to speculation
that the franc would soon come under attack. But Mr Michel Sapin, the French
finance minister, yesterday insisted that France and Germany would continue
to support the currency. 'If the franc is attacked we will fight back with
the same determination and the same methods.'
The franc has been shrouded by speculation since last week's reduction in UK
base rates. Mr Sapin criticised the British for renewing the tension in the
ERM with an 'every man for himself' policy.
However, Mr Schlesinger also hinted, in a speech in London, that more
realignments might be needed before Europe reached the final goal of fixed
exchange rates as part of economic and monetary union.
Speaking to the Overseas Bankers' Club at the Guildhall, the Bundesbank
president warned that, with Britain having no firm plans to rejoin the
exchange rate mechanism, there would be 'less compulsion' for the UK to take
the necessary steps ahead of union to harmonise its economy with the rest of
Europe.
He went out of his way to sound conciliatory about Britain, suggesting that
for Europe to go ahead with economic and monetary union without the UK would
be inappropriate. In a determinedly positive reference about the EMS, Mr
Schlesinger said the recent spell of currency turbulence in Europe did not
mean the system had failed.
Mr Berie Ahern, Irish finance minister, said at the weekend that smaller
countries were at a disadvantage, while France was able to get a 'separate
deal' in support of the franc.

'ALWAYS dispose of the difficult part in the title; it does less harm there
than in the text.' Such was the advice of the ineffable Whitehall mandarin
Sir Humphrey Appleby, from the BBC TV satire Yes, Minister, to a naive
subordinate enthusiastic about open government.
European Community foreign ministers were conceivably following his script
yesterday when they inaugurated a new era of openness in Community
decision-making, submitting to having the first part of their Council
meeting televised for the first time.
The televised proceedings were very much the 'titular' part. Ministers
delivered speeches on the current Danish presidency's work programme.
There was no debate and little substance, this being reserved very much for
the 'textual' negotiations detailed mostly to ministerial subordinates who
do most of the horse-trading on EC decision-making.
Inside the chamber, it was the older troupers, familiar with showbiz, who
performed most plausibly: Mr Douglas Hurd of the UK, patrician and
authoritative; Mr Roland Dumas of France, feisty and combative; Mr Emilio
Colombo from Italy, gesticulating elegantly and introducing the concept of
'original sin' to EC monetary policy; and Spain's Mr Javier Solana, who
proved Spaniards will always get more of their oar in at such gatherings,
because they can speak so much faster.
They were able to memorise enough to face cameras, and proved masters of the
'There is no time here to discuss' ploy, both to evade substance and exceed
their speaking time. Mr Hurd provided the high point of humour, brazenly
bracketing the secretive British with the gapingly open Danes for 'arguing
most forcibly for this experiment'.
Newcomers scored on substance. Mr Piet Koijmans, Dutch foreign minister,
called for a down-payment for the future' in democratising the EC by giving
the European parliament equal decision rights now with the Council of
Ministers, even before the Maastricht treaty enshrines these rights.
Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, made the one genuinely political
contribution, highlighting the need for action on EC monetary policy after
the weekend's devaluation of the Irish punt. Their interventions excited the
fantasy that televised proceedings of the acrimonious September 1992 finance
ministers' meeting in Bath, just prior to 'Black Wednesday', would have made
compulsive viewing.
For the future, however, viewers keen on openness should insist on a 'nuls
points' score for those such as the Greek ministers, who spoke at length
about Macedonia without once mentioning it, or for Mr Dumas who elegantly
stuck the knife into Britain for 'poaching' a Hoover plant from Dijon to
Scotland, but neglected to mention the UK.
The haphazard system of leaks, briefings, corridor encounters and
door-stepping will continue to be the basic mechanism for learning,
haphazardly, about what ministers get up to in Brussels. Even if yesterday's
performance were extended to all Council proceedings rather than 'work
programmes' and yet-to-be-defined 'major issues', the corridor purveyors of
information would still be in business, on yesterday's evidence.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Krajina fighting worsens amid fear for UN zones

CLASHES between Serbs and Croats yesterday appeared to intensify in Krajina,
the Serb enclave in Croatia, amid fears that the fighting could spread to
other UN zones.
Serb military leaders in Krajina claimed as many as 20,000 Croat troops were
massing in UN Sector West in central Croatia, which has so far been
peaceful. UN officials said they were aware of the reports, but warned that
peacekeepers were prepared to defend the year-long ceasefire line.
The fighting in Croatia came as diplomatic efforts to end the fighting in
neighbouring Bosnia moved from Geneva to UN headquarters in New York. Mr
Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, peace talks co-chairmen, met Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, UN secretary-general, in New York last night.
In Brussels, EC foreign ministers yesterday gave their 'full and unequivocal
support' to the Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia-Hercegovina, and called on
the UN security council to back up what they called a 'coherent and
comprehensive settlement'.
Officials admitted, however, that there had been no substantive discussion
on how to implement and enforce the plan.
There was also strong support for convening a tribunal to judge war crimes
committed in former Yugoslavia, spurred by discussion yesterday of the
report by Dame Anne Warburton on the use of rape - particularly against
Bosnian Moslem women - as a weapon.
Ministers and officials brushed aside suggestions that the Vance-Owen plan
might be seen to endorse land-grabs by Serbia which could set precedents in
other disputes in eastern and central Europe and the former Soviet Union.
In Krajina, Serb military leaders said Croatia had launched a 'general
offensive' along a 25km arc stretching from Obrovac in the north to Skradin
in the south, 11 days after Croat forces pushed across UN lines.
UN officials confirmed reports of tank and artillery duels in the area
around the Serb-held town of Benkovac, in UN Sector South, one of four UN
protected areas comprising Serb enclaves.
Tension was also growing in Sector East, which includes Vukovar, the town
devasted by the Yugoslav army during the seven-month war over Croatian
independence.
The upsurge in fighting came as the fate of the Bosnian peace talks
yesterday hung in the balance.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Moslem president of Bosnia, said he would boycott the
talks, proposed for New York.

FT  02 FEB 93 / New applicants to give up the neutrality habit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRIA, Sweden and Finland said yesterday they would sign up to Maastricht
treaty goals of a common European foreign and defence policy, as their
negotiations to join the European Community opened formally in Brussels.
Attempting to dispel EC concerns that their traditions of neutrality would
make them a brake on Europe's ambitions to develop a collective foreign and
defence identity, foreign ministers of the three applicants emphasised
unequivocal commitment to the treaty.
'Our security is indissolubly linked to the security of the continent,' said
Mr Alois Mock, Austria's foreign minister, adding that his country was
'fully committed to the treaty on European union,' and to the common foreign
and security policy.
Mr Ulf Dinkelspiel, Sweden's minister of European affairs, said 'we wish to
participate fully in the common foreign and security policy'.
He added that while the Swedish parliament had recently restated that Sweden
could not participate in military alliances, his government recognised the
goal of a common defence policy 'which in time might lead to a common
defence,' and would not hamper it.
Mr Pertti Salolainen, the Finnish foreign trade minister, said his
government was 'ready to contribute to the construction of a common European
defence'.
The Maastricht treaty calls for a common foreign and security policy,
developed largely on intergovernmental co-operation between EC member
states, and posits a future defence identity, which is unlikely to start
taking shape until the EC's next constitutional review in 1996.
If Austria, Sweden and Finland join the EC by 1995, as they and EC
negotiators now expect, they would have a voice in that review.
Member states such as France and Spain are therefore determined that they
should sign up in advance to the so-called 'potentiality' of Maastricht -
even though the treaty remains to be ratified by Denmark and the UK.
The three countries also emphasised that they would be bringing wealth and
high social and environmental standards to the Community, along with a
tradition of open government consonant with the EC's promise to bring
decision-making closer to the citizen.
The opening of negotiations was televised, before detailed discussions kick
off today.
The proceedings were suffused with irony as the current Danish presidency of
the EC reeled off a list of membership requirements so intimidating that few
existing member states would apply - and several of which, such as foreign
and defence policy, Denmark itself got opt-outs from at December's Edinburgh
summit.
Though the three applicants have already accepted most existing EC
obligations by signing the European Economic Area treaty between the
Community and the European Free Trade Association, few Brussels diplomats
believe the foreign and defence issue will be as easy to resolve as it was
before yesterday's cameras.
Romania and the EC yesterday signed an association agreement. It is similar
to those signed previously with Poland, Hungary and the former
Czechoslovakia.

FT  02 FEB 93 / The De Benedetti who shunned the limelight: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Camillo De Benedetti, the Italian financier and cousin of Mr Carlo De
Benedetti, died at the weekend after a long illness. Unlike his cousin,
Camillo De Benedetti, 60, tended to shun the limelight, although he was one
of the leading figures in Italian finance, especially insurance.
For many years, he was deputy chairman of Generali, Italy's biggest
insurance group, in which he was also one of the biggest individual
shareholders. More recently, his attentions switched to Fondiaria, the big
Florentine insurer, of which he was chairman until his death.
Camillo De Benedetti took joint control of Fondiaria, then majority-owned by
the Ferruzzi group, in December 1989, in a complex deal arranged with Mr
Raul Gardini, the Italian financier. The transaction divided control of
Fondiaria between Ferruzzi, run at the time by Mr Gardini, and Camillo De
Benedetti's Gaic holding company.
His chairmanship sparked a period of sharp growth for Fondiaria, especially
abroad.
However, the rise of Fondiaria, and the more recent pressure on its profits,
rekindled a sometimes heated relationship between Camillo De Benedetti and
Mediobanca, the powerful merchant bank which is one of the biggest
shareholders in both Generali and the Florentine company.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Compromise may emerge on HDTV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community member states will press on with attempts to find a
compromise over the development of cinema-quality television despite the
announcement by Philips at the weekend that it was suspending plans for mass
production of high-definition television sets.
Philips of the Netherlands and Thomson, the French electronics manufacturer,
have invested heavily in HDTV technology and the Dutch company's decision
underlines the uncertain future of the European HDTV programme.
In December, Britain blocked approval of European Commission plans to inject
Ecu500m (Pounds 406m) into the development of HDTV over five years, saying
other technologies might overtake the standards promoted by the Commission.
Philips said at the weekend there was no point producing sets to the most
advanced standards if the EC did not fund production of HDTV programmes. But
a spokesman for the industry commissioner Mr Martin Bangemann, said
yesterday there was no question of abandoning the programme at this stage.
Denmark, which holds the EC presidency, will try to break British opposition
with a new compromise proposal before the May meeting of EC
telecommunications ministers.
The Philips decision was 'obviously not a positive decision,' a Commission
official said yesterday, but he added Philips was completing research into
HDTV and would be ready to produce sets if funding was made available.
Some senior Commission officials are sceptical about the prospects for the
HDTV strategy, once seen as the flagship of an active EC industrial policy,
and believe Philips' decision could hasten its demise.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Currency system defended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, last night threw his weight
behind the European Monetary System, arguing that it had a good long-term
record in promoting monetary stability and economic convergence across
Europe, writes Peter Marsh.
But Mr Schlesinger also hinted, in a speech in London, that more
realignments might be needed in the system before Europe reached the final
goal of fixed exchange rates as part of economic and monetary union.
Speaking to the Overseas Bankers' Club at the Guildhall, the Bundesbank
president warned that, with Britain having no firm plans to rejoin the
exchange rate mechanism, there would be 'less compulsion' for the UK to take
the necessary steps ahead of union to harmonise its economy with the rest of
Europe.
He went out of his way to sound conciliatory about Britain, suggesting that
for Europe to go ahead with economic and monetary union without the UK would
be inappropriate. In a determinedly positive reference about the EMS, Mr
Schlesinger said the recent spell of currency turbulence in Europe did not
mean the system had failed.
Rather, it demonstrated that the system needed periodic adjustments on the
road to economic and monetary union, a goal which might be reached by the
end of the century.
Referring to the possibility of more realignments, he said: 'There was once
a widely held illusion that the EMS was already a de facto monetary union, a
currency area in which exchange rate adjustments were no longer possible.
'They have been necessary and they cannot simply be banned until monetary
union is established, even though they will become less compulsory as
covergence increases.'

FT  02 FEB 93 / Banks 'may be breaking law' to obtain use of data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS may be both evading their own code of practice and breaking the law in
the way they obtain permission from customers to use personal and account
details, the office of the Data Protection Registrar said yesterday.
Mr John Lamidey, assistant data protection registrar with responsibility for
financial services, said he was seeking a meeting with the British Bankers'
Association to raise concerns over how banks were obtaining and using data.
Mr Lamidey said he was worried about the methods used by some banks to
ensure that their customers gave permission for them to send out details of
financial services and to try to sell the customers other products.
He said clauses in some application forms which say that a customer must
allow personal financial data to be used by all the bank's subsidiaries
could amount to an evasion of the banking code of practice introduced last
March.
He also said that he was examining whether they contravened the first
principle of the Data Protection Act, which says information held on
computer databases must be obtained and processed fairly and lawfully by
companies.
The intervention comes after Mr Eric Howe, the data protection registrar,
launched an inquiry in December to discover how details of the Access credit
card account of Mr Norman Lamont appeared in The Sun newspaper.
The data protection office is also drawing up guidelines to ensure that
companies understand the implications of the Data Protection Act's
requirement that they should protect their data from disclosure by
'appropriate security measures'. Mr Lamidey said he was concerned at a
clause in application forms for Barclaycard credit cards which says the bank
can hold and process any information received about the customer by any
Barclays Group company.
The banks' code of practice says they should not disclose details of
customers' accounts except in tightly controlled circumstances, such as when
consent is given. Barclays Bank said last night it believed it was complying
with both the code of banking practice and the Data Protection Act. It
retained the right not to deal with new customers who did not want to give
such permission.
The British Bankers' Association said it was unaware of the data protection
registrar's concern over the issue and had no reason to believe that members
were breaching either the law or the code of banking practice.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Major seeks to restore market faith in sterling: Further
interest rate cuts ruled out - Downing Street denies division over policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, JAMES BLITZ and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday moved to damp expectations of further cuts in UK
interest rates as the government mounted a concerted campaign to restore
confidence in sterling, economic policy and Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor.
With the pound under downward pressure on the foreign exchanges, Downing
Street, the Treasury and the Bank of England sought to reassure markets that
Mr Lamont was in full charge of economic policy and that there were no
splits with the prime minister over interest rates.
Sterling plunged to a historic low of DM2.3550 in yesterday's far east
trading after weekend press reports of a split triggered a sharp burst of
speculative selling.
The pound recovered slightly in London to close at DM2.3800, more than a
pfennig down from last Friday's close. In New York it made further gains,
finishing at DM2.3876.
Measured against the Bank of England's sterling exchange rate index, the
pound ended sharply lower at 77.4. The index, which is monitored by the
chancellor as a guide to the currency's strength, fell to a record low of
77.3 yesterday morning from 78.2 on Friday night.
In a day which saw continuing tensions in the European exchange rate
mechanism following the devaluation of the Irish punt, British economic
policy was assailed by Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister.
Mr Sapin criticised the UK for failing in its obligations to the EC.
'Britain has no right to run a policy on the lines of 'I'll try to save
myself and too bad for the rest of you'. Especially as it isn't working,' Mr
Sapin said.
However the UK authorities insisted that last week's one percentage point
cut in bank base rates to 6 per cent was consistent with the government's
target of returning to economic growth with low inflation.
In a speech to the Overseas Bankers' Club in London, Mr Robin
Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank of England governor, said he had supported the
rate cut for this reason.
For the second day running, Downing Street denied weekend reports that Mr
Major was the driving force behind the rate cut and was seeking an eventual
reduction in interest rates to 4 per cent. A Downing Street official said
the decision last week to cut base rates to 6 per cent had been proposed by
Mr Lamont.
Doubts continued, however, among Conservative MPs at Westminster over the
political authority of Mr Lamont amid widespread expectations that he will
be moved by the prime minister after the March 16 Budget.
Speculation about differences between Mr Lamont and Mr Major has been
fuelled by the prime minister's decision to take a closer involvement in
Treasury policy in the run up to the Budget.
The chancellor has long been regarded as more cautious on interest rate
cuts. But government officials suggested that yesterday's developments would
make further rate cuts less likely.
Downing Street said the weekend reports of Mr Major wanting big cuts in the
cost of borrowing had backfired because of their impact on the pound. 'The
one thing that damages the likelihood of interest rate cuts is talking about
interest cuts,' it said.
Separately, aides to Mr Lamont made clear that he does not regard further
cuts in the cost of borrowing as likely before the Budget. 'Interest rates
are as likely to go up next as they are to go down,' they said.
Government officials pointed out that there has already been a substantial
loosening of policy since sterling left the ERM in September and that the
effects of this have still to work through fully to the economy.
The Treasury pointed out that 1m households will gain this month from a
three percentage point fall in mortgage rates that are set annually and that
more households will benefit in this way in the months ahead.
Meanwhile, the government said that it believed the recent turmoil on
currency markets, renewed by the weekend devaluation of the Irish punt, was
strengthening Britain's hand in its attempts to reform the ERM.

FT  02 FEB 93 / State milk monopoly challenged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN FOODS, Britain's largest private sector dairy group, yesterday
threw down a direct challenge to the Milk Marketing Board by announcing
plans to buy milk directly from farmers once the MMB's statutory monopoly
over supply is abolished next year.
The group is setting up a co-operative venture, the Northern Milk
Partnership, to which it hopes to recruit more than 5,000 dairy farmers in
England and Wales in the next few months.
Northern Foods has promised to buy all its milk needs from members of the
partnership and to pay them more than the price paid by Milk Marque, the
voluntary co-operative into which the MMB plans to transform itself after
the market is opened to competition.
Legislation to end the MMB's 60-year-old monopoly is before parliament and
is expected to take effect by the summer of next year. The MMB will also be
required to dispose of Dairy Crest, its dairy-processing arm.
Northern Foods buys 2bn litres of milk, worth Pounds 500m, a year.
'We have had good service from the MMB over the years, but now that it is to
go, we want to ensure security, quality and efficiency in our milk supply by
dealing direct with our producers,' said Mr Christopher Haskins, chairman of
Northern Foods.
The planned partnership will be a non-profit joint venture, owned and
financed equally by Northern Foods and by the producers joining it.
As well as offering producers contracts for long-term supplies, Northern
Foods would transport their milk and advise them on matching their output to
market needs.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Delors seeks social policy on jobs crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACQUES DELORS, president of the European Commission, yesterday denounced
job-poaching in the European Community and led calls for a relaunch of EC
social policy to help tackle the unemployment crisis in Europe.
As EC foreign ministers headed by France warned that monetary instability
and competitive devaluations were undermining the EC's single market, Mr
Delors criticised 'social dumping' whereby certain countries were
downgrading workers' rights to attract foreign investment.
Mr Delors' remarks at a meeting of EC foreign ministers in Brussels were
widely seen as an attack on the UK. He combined them with a call for an
early meeting of the Group of Seven industrialised countries to co-ordinate
growth, possibly in April.
The Clinton administration has expressed interest in closer economic policy
co-ordination within the G7, but US relations with the EC have become
strained after last week's imposition of anti-dumping duties on EC steel
exporters and yesterday's decision to restrict EC bids on federal public
procurement contracts.
At yesterday's opening session of EC foreign ministers, France followed Mr
Delors and other EC members in urging a 'relaunch' of EC social policy to
defend workers' rights and guard against 'social dumping'.
Mr Roland Dumas, French foreign minister, said employment could not be
created by countries outbidding each other for investment. He attacked the
recent decision by Hoover, the US multinational, to relocate from Dijon in
France to Cambuslang in Scotland as a 'serious incident'.
Mrs Elisabeth Guigou, French minister responsible for European affairs,
appealed for 'fair competition' among EC member states. She drew attention
to the the 1986 Single European Act providing for sustainable,
non-inflationary growth, a high degree of economic convergence, social
cohesion and solidarity among EC members.
EC diplomats said the reference reflected French concern about the impact on
its competitive position of maintaining a strong franc but also described it
as an attack on the UK for opting out of the Maastricht treaty's social
protocol. It was also implicit criticism of Britain's decision to promote
growth by floating sterling outside the European exchange rate mechanism and
progressively cutting UK interest rates.

FT  02 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Sellers hurt Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING UK pharmaceuticals group Glaxo was one of the few significant
casualties in an otherwise very buoyant London market yesterday, as US
investors sold the international drug manufacturer heavily. Analysts,
seeking a rationale, focused on an article in a US financial magazine, but
the slide in the shares appeared to herald weakness throughout the sector.
The US article, officially published yesterday, featured an interview with
four senior institutional investors. One highlighted Glaxo and Merck as his
key sells, arguing that Glaxo's gross margins are 82 per cent while pre-tax
margins are only 35 per cent.
Glaxo shares, which had been up 16p at the start of trading on the
beneficial effect of a stronger dollar against sterling, turned around to
record an equivalent fall to 678p on heavy turnover of 7m. The slide
prompted marketmakers to look around for the next victim. Wellcome, 14 ahead
at first, closed 25 down at 876p.
Demand for RBoS
The best individual performance of any FT-SE 100 Index stock came from Royal
Bank of Scotland (RBoS), which raced up 21, or 9.1 per cent, to 251p, the
highest level for the shares since the early 1980s. The rise compared with a
3.1 per cent increase in the FT-Actuaries banks index and a 1.6 per cent
gain in the FT-SE 100.
Much of the rise in RBoS was attributed to one of the leading marketmaking
firms having to scramble to cover a short position in the stock, triggered
by some rather exaggerated expectations of the price RBoS may get for
Charterhouse Bank.
The latter has been up for sale for many months and there are strong hints
that two Continental banks, Germany's BHF and Credit Commercial de France
are each about to buy a 45 per cent stake, leaving RBoS with 10 per cent.
Banking analysts said Charterhouse would probably fetch a sale price of
Pounds 200m, but there were stories circulating in the market yesterday that
a much higher figure might be on the cards.
LIG weakens
Photo-processing to condom manufacturer London International (LIG) fell 22
to 249p as the company warned that profits would be even lower than it had
signalled last year.
The company took the unusual step of telephoning analysts individually
rather than putting out an announcement via the Stock Exchange information
service.
LIG said laboratory closures in the troubled photo-processing arm were
taking longer than previously expected. Most pharmaceuticals specialists
chopped their figures for this year and next. Smith New Court was at the low
end, coming down by Pounds 4m to Pounds 33m for this year and by the same
amount to Pounds 43m for 1994.
Arjo Wiggins firm
Troubled paper maker Arjo Wiggins Appleton saw a reversal of fortunes as the
company broker upgraded its recommendation. The shares rose to their highest
level since plummeting in September when Arjo chopped its interim dividend.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew moved its recommendation from a corporate hold, which
many would see as a sell recommendation in view of the firm's relationship
with the company, to a long term buy. UBS believes the signs of recovery in
the US - where Arjo generates 75 per cent of its profits - and the recent
management changes augur well for the company. However, the broker sounds a
note of caution on prospects for high quality coated paper manufacture in
continental Europe. The shares rose 10 to 173p with 4.7m traded, showing
signs of a chart break-out.
Kwik Save adrift
Discount food retailer Kwik Save retreated as a number of factors combined
to build negative sentiment against the stock. Prominent among these were
reports that the private German discount food group Aldi is actively
searching for fresh superstore sites in the south-east. Kwik Save closed 8
adrift at 801p.
There were also whispers that Asda would use the proceeds of its Pounds 347m
rights issue last week to fund expansion of its Dales discount chain, again
threatening Kwik Save's market domination. Asda shed  1/2 to 63 1/2 p xd in
turnover of 27m shares, with a further 19.5m done in the options market.
Finally, news that Iceland Frozen Foods is to strengthen its high street
position through a joint venture with Littlewoods also weakened sentiment
against Kwik Save. However, the move was seen as good news for Iceland
Frozen, with analysts predicting that it would enhance earnings by around
Pounds 80m by next year. Profit forecasts for this year were increased from
around Pounds 61m to Pounds 68m.
Banks were in the vanguard of the market's advance, still responding to last
week's interest rate cut and the prospect of more to come, and reflecting
increasing optimism ahead of the reporting season to be led by Lloyds Bank,
19 up at 559p.
National Westminster moved ahead 17 to 459p and Barclays finished 16 higher
at 436p. Abbey National advanced 11 1/2 to 380 1/2 p. The biggest turnover
in the sector (10m shares) was in Bank of Scotland, which closed 2 1/2
firmer at 132p.
The property sector was buoyant as two brokers adopted more positive stances
amid speculation of further interest rate cuts. Among those stocks
benefiting yesterday, British Land improved 11 to 209p, Land Securities 12
to 486p and MEPC 12 to 364p.
The latest slide in sterling triggered a fresh flurry of strong domestic and
international buying of oil shares.
BP jumped 8 1/2 to 254p - a two-day rise of 16 1/2 - on heavy turnover of
14m shares, with shares held by US investors now thought to account for some
23 per cent of BP issued capital. Shell advanced 15 to 573p on 4.9m traded.
Second-line oil stocks raced ahead, led by Clyde, 6 up at 46p, and Goal, 7
firmer at 62p. Premier rose 1 3/4 to 29p on heavy turnover of 8.6m, still
supported by bid speculation.
Burmah Castrol's big D-Mark exposure saw the shares climb 18 to 698p.
Among aerospace and engineering stocks, British Aerospace climbed 21 to 274p
in trade of 8.7m shares.
The renewed strength led to speculation that the company may deliver a
higher than originally forecast dividend for 1992. Vague talk of a possible
bid for BAe from GEC, a penny easier at 290p, was also heard in some
quarters.
Rolls-Royce, a beneficiary of the recently signed Al-Yamamah 2 defence
contract, of which BAe is the lead contractor, moved up 6 1/2 to 133p.
Broker's recommendations in the US led to strong demand for British Steel
and the shares firmed 4 to 77p, with volume climbing to 18m by the close.
Sterling's weakness against the D-Mark and dollar helped a number of
internationally traded stocks. Hanson moved forward 7 to 257 1/2 p and BAT
Industries gained 17 at 978p. Mining group RTZ was lifted 17 to 680p.
Auction house Christies International rose 14 to 155p on unusually high
turnover of 10m shares as one investor bought a block of 5m shares at a
premium 165p a share.
Alexon moved ahead 9 to 74p on rumours that a predator was eyeing the
retailer. Next, off 1 1/2 at 143 1/2 p, was the mentioned candidate,
although most analysts were sceptical.
NatWest Securities shifted its stance on Tesco, turning long-term seller of
the stock, downgrading and advising clients to switch into J. Sainsbury or
Kwik Save. The house blames Tesco's limited earnings growth potential.
However, the shares gained 6 at 265p, helped by a Nomura upgrade. Sainsbury
closed 5 ahead at 580p.
Kingfisher advanced 8 to 557p, aided by a buy note from Kleinwort Benson,
which believes the recent weakness in the shares to be overdone. The house
also took Guinness off its sell list. The shares finished 7 stronger at
460p.

FT  02 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities near peak in higher volume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON stock market appeared in no doubt yesterday regarding the
developments of last weekend, when the UK prime minister denied press
reports of an impending 2 percentage-point cut in base rates, while
devaluation of the Irish punt threw the ERM currencies into turmoil.
Investors took the view that economic growth remains the UK government's top
priority, with weakness in sterling and the consequent inflation risks lower
down the agenda.
The fall in the pound, an immediate benefit to export prospects, brought
strong gains across the range of the blue chips, and belief that rates will
be reduced at Budget time in six weeks drove interest rate-linked issues
ahead.
Share prices rose sharply in another well-traded session. The FT-SE 100
Index finished at 2,851.6, within 10 points of its all-time high, and
showing a gain on the day of 44.4, or 1.6 per cent. At the day's peak, the
Footsie touched 2,854.5, pressing hard on the all-time high of 2,861.5
achieved on January 4 this year.
Investment demand finally spread across the full range of equities, and the
FT-SE Mid 250 Index kept pace with the FT-SE 100 to record a gain of 1.2 per
cent at 2,988.8. Turnover in non-Footsie stocks, slightly higher than last
week, constituted just over 64 per cent of the day's Seaq volume total of
793.4m shares. The weight of investment activity in equities was signalled
again by a high retail worth of Pounds 1.51bn in Friday's session.
Equity analysts appeared ready to see sterling renew its fall, perhaps to
the DM2.30 area which, according to some currency specialists, would have
the same effect on corporate earnings as a one-point reduction in base
rates.
The currency effect was most noticeable in the oil sector, which heavily
outperformed the rest of the market. Close behind were the building
material, property and banking sectors, all three likely beneficiaries from
lower interest rates.
Out of favour, on the other hand, were the utilities, where the switch to
growth stocks coincided with uncertainty among the electricity gener-ating
issues in the wake of political calls for aid to Britain's coal industry.
Pharmaceutical shares continued to suffer as investors reacted to possible
shifts in the US medical market under the Clinton administration.
The equity market put aside worries about the impending weight of rights
issues which had restrained it at the end of last week. The new share
trading account, which opened yesterday, appears likely to be dominated by
currency and interest rate factors rather than by apprehension over equity
and gilt-edged funding.
Nomura Research Institute said its analysts are now expecting 22 per cent
growth in share earnings on UK stocks this year. They also expect market
earnings estimates to improve as the year progresses.
The past two weeks have also seen a return to high levels of equity trading
volume, which now exceed even the levels recorded in the final quarter of
1992, themselves a substantial improvement over the thinly traded sessions
suffered earlier in the year.
Securities trading houses yesterday reported increasing volumes of private
investor business, as well as the continuing flow of institutional trading.

FT  02 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECLINE of sterling and the subsequent hopes of a cut in interest rates
led to a strong showing in the derivatives sector, on the first day of the
new equity account, writes Joel Kibazo.
In stock index futures, trading in the March contract on the FT-SE opened at
2,843, which some traders took to indicate an uneventful session. However,
speculation that the UK government would be forced to cut interest rates led
to strong buying by both US and UK houses, driving March strongly forward to
trade at a healthy premium for most of the day. Dealers said there was some
good arbitrage activity at the higher levels.
In the afternoon, a strong Wall Street only served to boost further buying
of the March contract and it closed at 2,870, up 48 from the previous finish
and at a 17-point premium to the underlying cash market.
The recent decline of interest rates now means that fair value has fallen to
between nil and -1 for this account. Turnover was a healthy 10,018
contracts.
The traded options were also busy and saw turnover of 51,866 contracts by
the close, with strong two-way business in Asda making a large contribution
to the total. It had 19,579 lots transacted, and was followed among stock
options by British Steel with 3,668 contracts and Hanson with 2,437 lots.
Volume in the FT-SE 100 option was 17,162.

FT  02 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow draws strength from NAPM
report
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US SHARE prices staged a solid advance yesterday, aided by a bullish
economic report from the National Association of Purchasing Management,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 22.15 higher at 3,332.18 and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 3.74 to 442.52, while volume on the New York SE
totalled 238.6m shares. The Nasdaq composite appreciated 5.43 to 701.77.
The market opened firmer, buoyed by strong gains in overseas equities,
notably in Tokyo, Frankfurt and London. On a lighter note, analysts were
suggesting that superstitious investors may have been buying stocks
yesterday following the Dallas Cowboys' victory in Sunday's Super Bowl.
History shows that the stock markets do well in the years that follow a win
by a team from the National Football Conferece - the Cowboys are from the
NFC.
Ultimately, however, the market drew its strength from the NAPM's January
report, which showed that its index of manufacturing activity nationwide
climbed from December's 55.4 to 58.0 last month, a bigger improvement than
analysts had forecast. The NAPM figures were just the latest in a string of
reports showing that the economic recovery is picking up pace.
American Express was the day's feature, rising Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 24
3/4 on 6.6m shares traded as investors responded to the unexpected news over
the weekend that Mr Jim Robinson, the company's much-criticised chairman,
had resigned.
Last week the share price fell sharply after Mr Robinson had apparently won
a bitter battle to stay on at the beleaguered travel and financial services
giant. Yesterday, Mr Richard Furlaud, a key member of the board of
directors, was named non-executive chairman.
RJR Nabisco put on Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 8 3/4 in volume of 6.9m shares on
reports that the company is considering issuing a second class of stock
pegged to its food business. RJR may also have been buoyed by an Illinois
court ruling that rejected a smoker's allegation that tobacco companies
deliberately concealed the full dangers of smoking from consumers. News of
the court judgment aided other tobacco stocks.
On the Nasdaq market, Lilly added Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 23 3/4 after
announcing fourth-quarter net income of 39 cents a share, almost double the
20 cents earned a year earlier.
Leading technology stocks, which took a beating from profit-taking last
week, were back in favour. Intel rallied Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 111 1/4 as
3.2m shares changed hands. Canada
TORONTO ended on a slightly firmer note after fairly heavy trading. The TSE
300 index gained 5.4 at 3,310.9 and rises led declines by 329 to 310. Volume
came to 37.5m shares.
Canadian Bond Rating Service downgraded certain debt and securities of
several members of the Edper group of companies, citing concern over
earnings and significant share value declines.
Among the stocks affected by the downgrades, Royal Trustco fell 48 cents to
CDollars 1.22, Coscan Development 40 cents to 60 cents, Brascan 'A' CDollars
 5/8 to CDollars 9 3/8 , Trizec 'A' 10 cents to CDollars 1.90 and Trilon
Financial 'A' 55 cents to CDollars 2.15.

FT  02 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Strong dollar is the centre of
attention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER the weekend devaluation in Ireland, a surge in the US dollar pushed up
equities in dollar-sensitive countries like the Netherlands, Switzerland,
Sweden and, selectively, Germany, while others like Italy and Spain got less
of a boost, writes Our Markets Staff.
However, Mr Andrew Bell, director of European strategy at BZW, was not
convinced that the bourses had their thinking mechanisms engaged. 'In the
1980s,' he said, 'industrial demand in Europe was good, and a rise in the
dollar gave exports an added attraction; now, Europe is in recession and it
is questionable whether the US recovery will be big enough to bail it out.'
ZURICH was higher in moderately active trade as the strong dollar and lower
Swiss interest rates led banks, insurers and chemicals higher. The SMI index
gained 29.6 to 2,120.7, having peaked during the session at a high for the
year of 2,132.6.
UBS bearers added SFr13 to SFr917 while insurers took their lead from Swiss
Re certificates, SFr11 higher at SFr553. Zurich Insurance bearers put on
SFr10 to SFr2,230.
Among dollar-sensitive issues, Roche certificates were SFr30 higher at
SFr4,130 and Sandoz certificates added SFr60 to SFr3,160. Swissair rose
SFr18 to SFr543 on further consideration of its co-operation talks with KLM.
AMSTERDAM had another firm session, the CBS Tendency index rising 0.8 to
98.4.
Royal Dutch led the gains, up Fl 1.90 to Fl 149.90, helped by the Opec
output cuts. Philips shrugged off the postponement of its high definition
television project to add 20 cents to Fl 23.70. The truckmaker, Daf, hit a
new all-time closing low of Fl 4.55, down Fl 1.45 in active but small-lot
retail trade, with investors worried at the lack of a long-term refinancing
agreement.
STOCKHOLM saw the Affarsvarlden General index rise 17.2 to 912.2 in turnover
of SKr673m. Forestry companies were among the main beneficiaries, MoDo B
adding SKr20 to SKr230
Astra A rose SFr15 to SKr701, supported by the dollar, renewed interest
after upbeat analysts' reports and hopes for its annual results, due in
three weeks. Electrolux B rose SKr11 to SKr228 ahead of its results this
week.
FRANKFURT ended off its highs with the DAX index up 13.31 at 1,585.16, but
standard dollar-sensitive plays like the carmakers did better than that,
with Daimler DM12.70 higher at DM584.50 and Volkswagen up DM6.20 at
DM284.50.
Both Daimler and VW have been distinctly out of favour with industry
analysts this year, but since the end of 1992 they have risen by DM47.50,
and DM41.50 respectively.
Turnover rose from DM4.3bn to DM4.5bn. Equities were also supported by
firmer German bond prices on revitalised hopes that key interest rates might
be cut at Thursday's Bundesbank meeting. This speculation coincided with
market talk that unions in Germany's public sector would agree to 1993 pay
rises of below 4 per cent in negotiations with employers this week.
PARIS focused on Paribas and the oil majors as the CAC 40 index rose 13.69
to 1,785.90 in relatively subdued turnover of FFr1.86bn.
The banking group's shares, hit hard on Friday before the release of better
than expected 1992 results, recovered FFr16.60 to FFr379.80. In oils, strong
on higher oil prices, Elf Acquitaine put on FFr4.20 to FFr328.50 and Total,
due to release its results a week today, rose by FFr5.90 tp 227.50.
MILAN was clouded by the troubles plaguing Prime Minister Giuliano Amato's
Socialist Party, and doubts about the prospects for any further Italian
interest rate cut. The Comit index rose 0.49 to 487.40.
Fiat fixed L70 higher at L4,410 and rallied to L4,500 after hours after
managing director Mr Cesare Romiti was quoted as saying he expected a profit
for 1993.
Ready mixed concrete company Calcestruzzi, part of the Ferruzzi-Montedison
group, dropped L460 to L7,690 after reports that its chairman was questioned
by police about contributions to political parties.
Gaic, which controls insurer La Fondaria, was L240 higher at L1,430 amid
speculation over future control following the death at the weekend Mr
Camillo De Benedetti.
DUBLIN ignored reservations about the recent progress of the sterling/punt
relationship, and reflected the weekend devaluation of the punt in an ISEQ
overall index up by 76.47, or 6 per cent to 1,347.50. Sceptics were saying,
however, that equities will begin to struggle again unless sterling shows
signs of strengthening, or the punt leaves the ERM altogether.

FT  02 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Interest rate hopes
sustain Nikkei revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LATE afternoon arbitrage buying pushed share prices higher and the Nikkei
average closed above the psychologically important support level of 17,000
for the third consecutive trading day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index gained 109.86 at 17,133.64, its high point of the day.
It dipped to the day's low of 16,957.56 during the morning on profit-taking
and remained around the 17,000 line for most of the session.
Volume dropped to 170m shares from Friday's 324m, with some large-lot
investors cautious at the quick rise in equity prices. The lack of fresh
news also affected activity. Advances outscored declines by 511 to 399, with
210 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on
1.13 at 1,300.01, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 1.13 at
1,058.79.
In spite of the low level of activity, mounting expectations of an imminent
cut in the official discount rate supported sentiment. Buying by public
funds also improved the mood.
Some brokerage issues turned higher on hopes of increased market activity
after the expected interest rate cut. Nikko Securities firmed Y4 to Y669 and
Nomura Securities appreciated Y30 to Y1,530.
Gajoen Kanko, the most active issue of the day, forged ahead Y44 to Y226 on
buying by speculative investors. Nippon Housing Loan, the debt-ridden
housing loan company, jumped Y24 to Y313 in active trading following reports
that creditor banks would forgo interest payments on loans.
Oji Paper dropped Y55 to Y816 in reaction to Friday's news that it is to
merge with Kanzaki Paper. The latter was one of the best performers of the
day, climbing Y35 to Y650.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y20,000 to Y590,000 on recommendations
by a UK broker. Profit-taking hit steels and heavy industries, which were
higher last week on hopes of lower interest rates. Nippon Steel receded Y3
to Y295 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries eased Y1 to Y527.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 31.66 to 18,455.11 in volume of 60.8m
shares inflated by cross-trading - selling and buying back stocks in order
to realise profits without changing the portfolio.
On the OSE stock futures market, volume in January fell to the lowest for
three years. A total of 665,989 contracts changed hands, down by 36.5 per
cent from December's level. Options trading dropped by 21 per cent to
470,692 contracts, the lightest since November 1989.
Roundup
POLITICAL and economic developments played an important part in some of the
Pacific Rim markets.
SINGAPORE continued its march into record territory and the Straits Times
Industrial index finished 24.28 stronger at a new peak of 1,644.44 on steady
demand from institutional buyers.
December trade figures showing a nominal 38.1 per cent rise in domestic
non-oil exports provided the catalyst. Volume expanded to 104.92m shares
from Friday's 95.52m, with gains outpacing falls by 217 to 41.
Among shares meeting strong demand, Wearne rose 16 cents to SDollars 3.52,
Singapore Bus Services was 35 cents higher at SDollars 6.75 and Neptune
Orient Lines moved ahead 8 cents to SDollars 1.51.
TAIWAN put on 3.8 per cent in active trade as political tensions eased after
Saturday's announcement that Premier Hau Pei-tsun was willing to resign.
The weighted index ended 126.67 higher at 3,501.23 after Saturday's
123-point advance.
HONG KONG relinquished some ground in subdued trade, with the market wary
about Governor Chris Patten's political reform proposals, which will be
brought before the Legislative Council later this month. The Hang Seng index
finished 53.62 lower at 5,697.78.
Among actively traded stocks, HSBC Holdings, pressured by sterling's weekend
decline, fell HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 59, while Hang Seng Bank shed 50
cents to HKDollars 56.50.
AUSTRALIA closed barely higher as volume was cut by lack of interest and a
public holiday in Victoria.
The All Ordinaries index edged forward 0.9 of a point to 1,529.1.
BANGKOK moved lower as a market consolidation continued. Banks were active
as the SET index lost 8.73 to 965.75.
BOMBAY saw a day of relentless selling which left the BSE index down 46.55
at 2,634.24. Tata Steel slipped Rs1.25 to Rs226.25 amid rumours that a
broker facing liquidity problems was unloading his holdings.

BUENOS AIRES ran into profit-taking following Friday's surge on government

FT  02 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Equities move on fiscal and currency
speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan was the powerhouse of an equity world dominated by currency and
monetary economic speculation last week. While the US put in a modest
performance and Europe was indecisive, Tokyo gained 3.6 per cent on mounting
expectations of an imminent cut in the official discount rate, taking the
FT-Actuaries World Index to a rise of 1.1 per cent in local currency terms.
Researchers from Salomon Brothers in Tokyo say the Bank of Japan (BoJ)
showed no resistance to last week's continued rally in money markets, which
set the stage for a probable reduction of 75 basis points in the official
discount rate, from the current 3.25 per cent to 2.50 per cent.
However, says Salomon, the BoJ will not allow a bubble economy revival:
'Once the economic recovery has taken firm hold, the BoJ will waste little
time in returning interest rates to normal levels.'
In Europe, the big battalions cancelled each other out: the UK celebrated
its base rate reduction; but disappointing company results and continued
earnings downgrades depressed sentiment in France and Germany.
On the periphery, Ireland moved higher on what the currency speculators were
expecting, a devaluation of the punt. However, Davy Stockbrokers of Dublin,
which in mid-January said this offered scope for a post-devaluation rally of
10 to 15 per cent, is not so bullish now.
Things have changed in two or three weeks, says Mr Robbie Kelleher, Davy's
head of research. In mid-January, notes Mr Kelleher, the punt was standing
at a sterling exchange rate of Pounds 1.04 to Pounds 1.05, with the
possibility of a devaluation and some upside in sterling. Since then the UK
currency has been weak, weekend forecasts of further UK interest rate cuts
have made things worse, and even after a 10 per cent devaluation the punt is
still around Pounds 1.03.
The currency theme persists on the other side of the Atlantic, where Mexico
fields the biggest drop of the week with a setback of 6 per cent in local
currency terms.
Mr Federico Laffan of Latin American Securities says there were a number of
factors here: the increased strength of the peso against the dollar,
offering currency gains, seems to have prompted some profit-taking; the
offer for sale of shares in Grupo Carso, the conglomerate which manages
Telmex, led to fears of oversupply; and, by the latter end of the week,
there were fears of delays in the approval of NAFTA, the North American free
trade agreement which had been seen as a boost for the Mexican economy.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Franc survives important test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH franc and Danish krone were victims of a short burst of
speculative selling yesterday morning following the 10 per cent devaluation
of the Irish punt against all the currencies in the European exchange rate
mechanism, writes James Blitz.
In recent months, the devaluation of ERM currencies has been followed by
strong selling of the next weakest in the system, and this pattern was
repeated yesterday.
The French franc fell sharply in the first hours of trading, to a low of
FFr3.3950 against the D-Mark, while the Danish krone was seen as low as
DKr3.8750 to the D-Mark, near to its floor of DKr3.9016. Three-month French
francs were quoted as high as 15 per cent at the peak of the pressure.
However, the selling of both currencies eased off later in the morning, even
though their respective money market interest rates remained high. The
French franc closed at FFr3.380 per D-Mark, while the krone finished at
DKr3.8501.
The tensions were partly relieved by the market's acceptance of the size of
the punt devaluation. The Irish currency climbed to the top of its new ERM
bands. The French franc and Danish krone even spent part of the day on their
ERM floors against the Irish currency. The punt's strength allowed a
remarkable cut in Ireland's overnight rate of lending from 100 per cent to
14 per cent.
Mr Mark Brett, an economist at BZW in London, said the franc's swift
recovery from selling pressures was highly significant. 'People were
prepared to take big speculative positions against the franc in September,
but they are not prepared to any more,' he added. 'If the crisis does not
come on the big day, it will not come at all.'
Mr Mark Austin, Treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, said the franc
and krone are not safe yet. 'There is still the fundamental problem of real
interest rates that are too high and show no signs of coming down,' he said.
Sterling recovered sharply against the D-Mark in European trading yesterday
after plunging to a historic low of DM2.3550 in Monday's Far East dealing.
The recovery, to a close of DM2.3800, gave the impression that the sell-off
had been the result of speculative trading by banks rather than the
off-loading of long-term positions. In Tokyo, the pound bottomed out at
Dollars 1.4500 against the dollar, a level not seen since 1986. It finished
European trading at Dollars 1.4535 and later ended in New York at Dollars
1.4590.
Mr Brett, of BZW, said the most worrying problem for the pound is that
one-year sterling interest rates are now an unprecedented 200 basis points
or so below the D-Mark's.
This puts the current one-year forward rate for buying D-Marks at around
DM2.4150 to the pound. In Mr Brett's view, this is an attractive rate for
D-Mark purchasers and will keep the pound weak well into the future.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Money Markets: UK rates fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS in the sterling cash and futures markets assumed that UK base rates
would be as low as 5 per cent by the time of the March Budget, in spite of
strenuous claims by the government that it did not want to lower the cost of
borrowing, writes James Blitz.
Newspaper reports that the UK government was considering cutting base rates
to 4 per cent to stimulate recovery had a dramatic effect on short sterling
futures.
The March contract rose 15 basis points in the morning to 94.50, which
prices three-month money at Budget time at 5.50 per cent. That would be
consistent with base rates at 5 per cent. The contract later fell back to
finish at 94.42.
The June and September contracts were also sharply bid up, to 94.76 and
94.77 respectively. This underlines even more firmly the view that base
rates will be down at the 5 per cent level by summer.
Rates in the sterling cash market declined sharply, helped by a small
shortage of Pounds 800m forecast by the Bank of England.
This came as a considerable relief to the market after a week of very tight
money, which had seen the overnight lending rate up at 100 per cent.
Three-month money came down by  1/8 percentage point to 6 3/16 per cent,
while the one-year rate was bid as low as 5 5/8 per cent.
More importantly, the yield curve for both 'depo bills' and certificates of
deposit continued to slope right down to the one-year level, suggesting that
the market has not ruled out a rate cut to below 5 per cent.
The weekend devaluation of the Irish punt forced a sharp rise in money
market rates in France as pressure was again put on the French franc in the
European exchange rate mechanism.
The cost of one-month French francs was quoted as high as 15 per cent, from
about 13 1/2 per cent on Friday, although the Bank of France did not change
officially posted rates at its regular market intervention on a Monday. It
later came down to about 13 1/2 per cent as pressure eased.
The March French franc contract tumbled a further 23 basis points to end at
88.22. The contract is now 223 basis points lower than its closing level on
January 18. Nothing better illustrates the speed with which dealers have
revised expectations of an easing in French - and German - rates.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian output cut fuels LME
zinc price rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZINC PRICES jumped to fresh eight-week peaks at the start of trading on the
London Metal Exchange yesterday as the market absorbed news that Cominco,
the Canadian group, is to cut its production of the metal by 50,000 tonnes
this year.
But profit-taking forced prices to retreat and analysts suggested further
substantial cuts in the output of refined zinc were needed if prices were to
move back up to the industry's break-even level of 54 US cents to 55 cents a
lb (Dollars 1,190-Dollars 1,212 a tonne).
'We need two or three more cuts of the Cominco size if stocks are to come
down and prices to rise,' suggested Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Carr
Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of the Banque Indosuez Group. 'I don't expect any
other producers to follow (Cominco) quickly but if the zinc price stays at
the present level for another three months there will be more producer
cuts.'
Zinc for delivery in three months touched Dollars 1,140 a tonne on the LME
in early trading yesterday before easing back to close at Dollars 1,129.75,
still Dollars 11.75 up on Friday's close.
Last week Pasminco of Australia announced a restructuring that would remove
about 25,000 tonnes of zinc a year from the market but Mr Bielski said
Cominco's cuts were more significant because they involved a reduction in
refined metal production rather than mine output. He estimated that another
50,000 to 100,000 tonnes of refined metal production would have to be cut
this year simply to bring the market back into balance. However, as world
zinc stocks had risen to the equivalent of 9 weeks consumption, more cuts
would be required to whittle them down. Stocks would have to be reduced to
about five weeks consumption before zinc prices would show any substantial
rise.
Sumitomo Metal of Japan said depressed prices were forcing it to cut nickel
production from April 1 to an annual rate of 15,900 tonnes for at least the
first half of the 1993-94 financial year. Analysts estimated this might take
5,000 tonnes out of the market this year, 'not nearly enough to make an
impact on prices,' said Ms Karen Norton at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of
the Royal Dutch/Shell group.
Billiton in its latest Metals Report points out that most of the several
nickel production cuts which have been announced are mainly reductions in
planned 1993 output rather than genuine cuts. It still expects a nickel
supply surplus this year and for the price to fall from an average of
Dollars 3.18 a lb in 1992 to Dollars 2.75 this year.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: North Sea oil prices steady on
Opec hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH SEA Brent oil prices firmed yesterday after adding more than Dollars 1
a dollar a barrel late last week in response to US proposals for an oil
import tax. However, the price of North Sea Brent crude for March delivery
slipped back towards the close of the market to end barely changed from
Friday.
Traders expressed the belief that the US proposals for an import tax, even
if they came to nothing, could galvanise the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to take action to support oil prices.
Indeed, initial steps by Mr Alirio Parra, Opec president, to secure
agreement for a cut of around 1m barrels a day in Opec output for the second
quarter seems to have formed a consensus. Nigeria indicated yesterday it
would cut its production from its current output level which it says is 2.4m
b/d.
Overall Opec output remained high in January at 25.05m b/d according to
Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, the trade publication, compared with the
organisation's ceiling of 24.58m b/d.
Market traders believe Opec could have problems making its next deal stick
since members have signally failed to abide by the current programme of
cuts. 'There is no doubting their seriousness over a production cut, but
will they follow through and will it be 1m barrels?' said Mr Gary Ross,
chief executive of Petroleum Industry Research Associates in New York.
Nevertheless, hopes for a production cut by Opec members should support
crude prices in the run-up to the next meeting on February 13.
There is some doubt about whether refined product prices in Europe will
benefit from any action by Opec as much as crude prices. Cambridge Energy
Research Associates points to high product stocks, low demand and mild
weather which have depressed prices.
Algeria's state oil and gas monopoly, Sonatrach and British Petroleum signed
a Dollars 45m exploration agreement in Algiers at the weekend, Francis
Ghiles reports.
The agreement covers five blocks around Sour El Ghozlane, 100 miles south of
Algiers, a region where oil was first exploited 50 years ago but where
virtually no exploration has been conducted recently.
The agreement also allows for the joint exploitation and marketing of gas.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold production record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD PRODUCTION outside the former eastern bloc countries reached a new peak
last year, according Mining Journal's International Gold Newsletter. It is
estimated to have risen 3.4 per cent or 59.9 tonnes from the 1991 level,
from 1,781.6 tonnes to 1,841.5 tonnes.
Mines in the US are estimated to have shown the biggest tonnage increase:
27.6 tonnes or 9 per cent, to 327.6 tonnes, mainly because of the continued
expansion of several large mines.
South Africa's gold output also remained buoyant and was up by 12.8 tonnes,
or 2 per cent, to 613.9 tonnes.
Australia, which saw a drop in gold production in 1991, reversed the trend
last year and produced an extra 3.5 per cent or 8.5 tonnes to take its total
to 242.7 tonnes. This was still a little short of 1990's record 243.1
tonnes.
Canada is one of the few big producers where output is estimated to have
fallen. Mining Journal suggests output was down by 13.6 tonnes or nearly 8
per cent to 163.1 tonnes because of a large number of mine closures in
1991-92, most of them higher-cost underground mines.
Production is also estimated to have fallen in Brazil, by 8 tonnes (10 per
cent) to 72 tonnes. The most notable increases last year were in Indonesia
(up by 21.7 tonnes or 120 per cent to 40.1 tonnes); Papua New Guinea (up by
11.2 tonnes or 17.5 per cent to 75.5 tonnes) and Ghana (up by 12.2 tonnes or
47 per cent to 38 tonnes).
Mr David Bird, editor of the newsletter, says that, in spite of the extended
decline in prices last year, many gold mines survived through forward
selling and more selective mining, which yielded higher grades.

FT  02 FEB 93 / World Commodities Prices: Tea
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There were 13,394 packages for the day, reports the Tea Brokers Association.
Landed demand was selective. Better liquoring Assams sold readily at
slightly easier rates, others declined by 5-10p. Bangladesh teas met limited
support below valuation. Bright Africans were a strong feature and often
dearer, but medium and plainer descriptions proved irregularly easier.
Offshore: only fair demand with prices 2-4p lower. The highest price
realised this week was 226p for a Rwanda PD. Quotations: quality 210, good
medium 175p, medium 152p, low medium 110p.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Soviet collapse leaves Indian
tea trade in a stew - The price being paid for over-dependence on a single
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO OTHER single factor has done as much harm to the international marketing
of Indian tea as the over-dependence on one single market, the erstwhile
Soviet Union, which in 1991 took 104.5m kg out of total Indian export of
203m kg.
Assured of such a big market, Indian exporters withdrew largely from several
traditional markets, including the UK, and the vacuum was filled largely by
Kenya, Sri Lanka and Malawi. But last year, India had to resort to
aggressive marketing in the countries which it had earlier vacated, since
Russia and the other CIS constituents bought only about 45m kg.
In spite of the sharp setback in Russian purchases, India could ship more
than 180m kg of tea in 1992. The Indian tea companies cannot, however, claim
credit for the fairly high level of exports as this was facilitated to a
great extent by a shortfall of more than 125m kg in world tea production.
According to Mr Mumtaz Ahmad, director of McLeod Russel, while the Indian
tea producers were happy selling bulk teas to the Soviets at 'artificially
high rupee prices because of a skewed rupee rouble exchange rate', many
other big tea importing countries got used to the 'light and bright Kenyan
teas whose quality remain uniform throughout the season. The quality
perception of tea drinkers has undergone a revolutionary change in many
countries.' Assam tea, on the other hand, is thick and creamy and its
quality does not remain uniform throughout the year. An international
blender using Assam tea has, therefore, to maintain a high stock level.
At the recent international tea convention in Delhi, some overseas delegates
complained that India, which earlier could sell any tea in the Soviet Union,
had neglected quality. Mr Krishna Kumar, managing director of Tata Tea,
concedes that 'our manufacturing processes, both in the field and the
factory were geared to offer a product-mix to a particular buyer which now
require a complete review and redefinition'.
Moreover, as the Indian tea industry made handsome profits, thanks to the
Soviet buying, the tea company managers became complacent and the cost of
production rose sharply. The government also did not feel shy about making
tea the most taxed industry in the country. But with their profit margins
now under severe pressure, the tea companies are desperately seeking tax
relief.
According to Mr Susim Mukul Datta, chairman of Hindustan Lever, the two
principal challenges faced by the industry are 're-establishing itself in
the markets where it has become near strangers and competing with the low
cost producers who are attuned to the tastes prevalent in these markets.'
India may be producing a lot of bad teas, but it also grows some of the
finest in the world.
Besides assurances about quality and competitive prices, international
buyers, according to Mr Ahmad, want to be sure that India will remain a
reliable supplier of tea in the long run.
The doubt arises from the fact that the 540m-kg Indian domestic market is
growing at an annual average rate of 3 per cent. The international buyers
also have strong reservations about the export infrastructure, including
documentation and shipping facilities available in India, which will have to
be improved significantly to catch up with neighbouring Sri Lanka.
There is a consensus in the industry that Indian tea production can be
raised substantially by changing certain cultivation practices and raising
the rate of replantation. While the average yield of tea in India is 1,761
kg a hectare, clones giving yields of more than 3,000 kg a hectare are now
available.
Mr Ahmad believes that Indian tea production by the turn of the century
could be raised to 1,000m kg, which should leave an exportable surplus of at
least 250m kg.

New York arabica COFFEE prices were near session highs at midday in a
technical correction to last week's price plunge. London's robusta market
continued to claw back some lost ground, closing with gains of up to Dollars
12. Dealers said they were looking for a close above 60 cents for the New
York March contract to give the recovery added momentum, although conditions
were nervous and a resumption of the downtrend could still not be ruled out.
ICO talks about a new pact end on Friday. London COCOA futures closed with
gains of around Pounds 21, boosted by the weakness of sterling against the
dollar. Dealers said the market had convincingly breached resistance at
Pounds 723 a tonne and should now move up to test the Pounds 742-Pounds 743
area on May. On the LME COPPER traders were awaiting developments from
Chile's Ventanas smelter where workers are mulling an improved pay offer;
reports of strike action at a Mexican copper refinery also made for some
caution.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Eastern
German farming needs more pruning - Labour cuts have not gone far enough to
put the agricultural sector back on its feet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OUTSIDE of the cafe had been smartened up and the food served inside was
well up to western standards. But beneath the new paint it was still
possible to glimpse the scars of 40 years of neglect. The grocer's shop next
door was in a similar state and the newly-installed shelves were an obvious
indication of recent investment. But most of the rest of the buildings in
this village of Buchholz in the former East German land of Brandenburg, 50
km (30 miles) south-west of Berlin, still looked drab and unloved, much as
they did under the communists.
I was visiting the local farming company. Less than three years ago most of
its land and farm buildings formed the basis of a production co-operative.
But these are no longer permitted under the united federal government. All
4,500 that existed under the previous regime have been liquidated to be
converted into partnerships or corporations or split up into small farms.
Responsibility for this rural restructuring is with the Berlin-based
Treuhand and although it is now more than three years since the wall came
down much still remains to be completed. Indeed the Treuhand is still having
to administer hundreds of farms, many of which are insolvent and still
losing money.
Reasons for the slow progress are many and varied. In spite of a reduction
in the total farm labour force in the five former eastern lander from
848,000 to 208,000 there are still probably twice as many as can be
profitably employed. But an even more serious problem is the continuing
dispute over ownership of thousands of individual parcels of land.
Back in May 1945, when the Russians took over the administration, the new
rulers confiscated all the farms of more than 100 hectares (250 acres). Of
the total East German land area of 6m hectares one-third was taken and in
1949 redistributed in small parcels among farm workers.
It was not until the second phase of the communist land reform, which began
in 1953, that all of the farmland including the small farms created in 1949,
were thrown together and merged into large co-operative units. Later still
the management of arable land on the now massive farms was separated from
that of the large intensive livestock units that had been built on it.
The Treaty of German Unity which was agreed in 1989 decreed that only those
farmers, or their successors, who were forced into co-operatives from 1953
onwards would be entitled to reclaim their land. The original larger
landowners whose farms were confiscated in 1945 were given no rights to
recover their property.
Since then, however, test cases have been brought to the federal courts by
some of those landowners and it has been conceded that they should have been
better treated. It remains to be seen how ownership of the 2m ha involved
will be resolved between those who claim historical rights and those who
were given confiscated land by the East German government in 1949 and have
since believed it was theirs.
Needless to say, however, binding decisions on who owns what are central to
the security and viability of the new farming corporations. The one in the
village of Buchholz is a good example.
Under the communist regime the 1,200 ha carried 1,500 cattle (of which 500
were dairy cows) and ran an intensive 300-sow pig breeding herd, finishing
all the progeny for meat. The labour force was 110 people.
As the managing director admitted while we enjoyed some refreshment in the
village cafe it was quite a shock when the community suddenly found itself
having to try to operate according to market forces. Indeed when the
magnitude of the problem was realised there was a temptation to dissolve the
whole enterprise.
After further consideration, however, it was decided to form a limited
company from among the workers and attempt to make the farm profitable. The
pig enterprise was closed because the buildings, put up only 12 years
before, were inconvenient and would have taken more labour than could be
afforded. The enormous impractical concrete sheds now stand empty as a
monument to a failed system.
A review of the cattle operation revealed that it too was losing money by
European Community standards, and numbers were drastically reduced. The beef
enterprise was cut to just 70 head of bull beef and the dairy herd to 385
very ordinary milkers, plus replacement young stock. The manager said he
intended to improve the quality of the herd by breeding his own replacements
from the present cows; a task which has taken many an expert, enthusiastic
cattle breeder a lifetime to achieve. He does not have that much time.
Meanwhile on the arable side of the farm it was decided to put 30 per cent
of the land into set-aside in order to guarantee some income in the form of
EC compensation payments. Needless to say the labour force has been cut by
almost 80 per cent to 24 people. I judged that to compete with most other EC
farmers and produce commodities at community prices it would be necessary
for the management to reduce staff again to no more than 12.
Overshadowing it all is the fact that the ownership of some of the land
being farmed, including that on which the main farm buildings stand, is
still in dispute. The manager hopes that the federal government will provide
time for this to be sorted out by allowing those who occupy the land to
lease it for 12 years.
He also hopes that the Treuhand will agree to extend the repayment schedule
for loans it made to the Buchholz farming company and continue to forgive
interest payments. Altogether these amount to something like Pounds 1m and
as the manager admitted the company has still made substantial losses in
each of the two years it has been trading.
He was convinced that everything would come right and the farm would be
showing a profit within two or three years. I did not like to tell him my
opinion that without a great deal more financial help from the federal
government his company's position was hopeless. And this was said to be one
of the better examples of a privatised East German co-operative.
United Germany's new agriculture minister, Mr Jochen Borchert, appointed 10
days ago, will understand the problems of former east German agriculture
better than most. His father's farm was one of those forcibly merged into a
big co-operative in 1953. The family fled to the west at that time taking
their young son, Jochen, with them. Since reunification he has successfully
reclaimed ownership of the land and is currently renting it to another
farming company.
So, he will have an intimate knowledge of the strong emotions and enormous
financial difficulties involved. But whether it is possible for him to be
successful in using that knowledge to find solutions to these most intricate
problems that are acceptable to all concerned may be another matter.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: Base rate hopes spark strong recovery in
UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK GOVERNMENT bonds rallied strongly yesterday morning following reports in
the weekend press that the Bank of England may reduce interest rates by as
much as 2 percentage points.
Short-dated gilts outperformed longer-dated issues initially, leading to a
steepening of the yield curve.
Dealers said short-dated gilts surged at the start of trading, on press
reports suggesting the prime minister has a base rate target of 4 per cent
in mind. Base rate was cut from 7 per cent to 6 per cent a week ago.
The rally enabled the Bank of England to sell the remainder of its
outstanding tap stocks - a Pounds 150m tranche of 2 1/2 per cent
index-linked stock due 2009 announced after last Wednesday's gilt auction.
The Bank said later in the day a further Pounds 750m of stock would be
available for sale, consisting of the following amounts: Pounds 300m of 9
3/4 per cent stock due 1998; Pounds 200m of 10 per cent stock due 2001;
Pounds 100m of 2 per cent index-linked stock due 1996; and Pounds 150m of 2
1/2 per cent index-linked gilts due 2024.
The Liffe gilt futures contract moved from 102.00 at the opening to a high
of 102.05, before ending the day at around 102.03. Cash bonds gained around
half a point, with the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 1998 rising from 111 9/32 to
111 25/32 .
EUROPE'S main government bond markets opened on a note of caution, fearful
of further tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism despite the
weekend devaluation of the Irish punt.
French government bonds were initially marked down on fears that the French
franc could be the next currency to come under pressure in the foreign
exchange markets.
But as the franc firmed slightly against the D-Mark, French bonds rallied.
The Matif futures contract, which opened at 112.36, rose to end at 113.14.
Elsewhere in Europe, prices of German government bonds were marked up
initially, on expectations that investors would flock towards the safe haven
of the D-Mark bloc.
The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 93.10, moved to a high of
93.21 but closed little changed.
HOPES that the Bank of Japan would cut the official discount rate helped to
lift Japanese government bond prices, with the rally continuing in London
trading.
The weak state of the Japanese economy has fuelled hopes of a further 50 to
75 basis point easing in the official discount rate, currently at 3.25 per
cent. The easing speculation pushed rates on three-month certificates of
deposit down to 3.43 per cent yesterday, compared with 3.52 per cent on
Friday and 3.70 per cent 10 days ago.
The March futures contract rose from its opening level of 109.53 to close at
109.58 in Tokyo, but continued to make gains in the London trading session
to reach 109.71. In the cash market, the benchmark No 145 opened with a
yield of 4.315 per cent, and closed at 4.295 per cent, corresponding to the
high price of the day.
US Treasuries eased slightly at the long end of the maturity range yesterday
in the wake of a stronger-than-expected purchasing managers' report.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was off its lows for
the day, down  3/16 at 105 1/16 , yielding 7.203 per cent. The two-year note
was unchanged at 100 1/8 , to yield 4.168 per cent.
Prices opened slightly lower ahead of the day's main economic number - the
National Association of Purchasing Management's January report. When the
NAPM announced that its index of manufacturing activity had risen to 58.0
last month, up from 55.4 in December, prices fell even further - economists
had been expecting an NAPM figure of only 56.7.
Although the market's reaction to the news pushed prices lower across the
board, traders said the selling was not particularly strong, and mostly
represented profit-taking. Prices recovered some of their losses in the
afternoon, but the Treasury's announcement of a Dollars 67bn first-quarter
borrowing requirement, and word from the White House of a Dollars 30bn
fiscal stimulus package, had little impact on the market.
THE benchmark government bond table has been changed to include a different
Danish bond issue. The 8 per cent bond due May 2003 now replaces the 9 per
cent November 2000 issue. The 8 per cent bond due 2003 is recognised as the
new 10-year benchmark bond.

FT  02 FEB 93 / International Bonds: US dollar sector set to pick up with
issues worth Dollars 1bn expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER batch of Canadian dollar Eurobonds was launched yesterday,
following a flood of paper at the end of last week, as borrowers took
advantage of swap opportunities.
Activity in the US dollar sector is also set to pick up. Two supranational
agencies, the Inter-American Development Bank and the Asian Development
Bank, are preparing to launch new issues totalling Dollars 1bn.
The IADB took bids last night for a Dollars 500m 10-year offering. An IADB
spokesman said bids were invited from its four regular arrangers - Salomon
Brothers, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and CSFB - and from three rotating
houses - Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and IBJ International. The IADB said
it was looking for bids within a yield spread of 20 basis points above the
comparable US Treasury.
The IADB plans to borrow Dollars 4.4bn in 1993, one-third in dollars,
one-third in yen and the rest in European currencies.
The ADB is also expected to raise Dollars 500m, but no decision on the
maturity of the issue has yet been taken. The issue is expected to emerge
later this week or next week.
Meanwhile, last week's heavy supply of Canadian dollar paper has left
dealers with some inventory on their books. The distribution of issues by
Credit Foncier de France and the Kingdom of Denmark was proceeding rather
slowly, syndicate managers said.
However, the World Bank's CDollars 250m 10-year Eurobond, launched
yesterday, met firm demand, despite a rather aggressive pricing to yield
just 22 basis points over comparable Canadian government bonds.
Dealers reported strong demand from Asia and North America, mainly because
of the World Bank's pedigree. The deal also had some rarity value, since it
is the World Bank's first Canadian dollar offering since 1990. The spread on
the World Bank Eurobond tightened slightly to 20 basis points once the
syndicate was broken.
Meanwhile, the development of the collared floating-rate note structure in
the sterling market has caught the attention of UK building societies. After
the first such issue, a Pounds 100m three-year deal for the Leeds Permanent,
via Salomon Brothers last Thursday, a second Pounds 100m deal for Bradford &amp;
Bingley via NatWest Capital Markets followed on Friday.
The collared structure incorporates a minimum interest rate (floor) and a
maximum interest rate (cap), and has become a viable instrument in the
sterling market since the latest base cut to 6 per cent last Tuesday.
Yesterday, the Halifax Building Society launched a Pounds 100m 10-year issue
of floating-rate notes which pay interest at  1/16 point below the London
interbank offered rate, with a minimum coupon of 7 per cent and a maximum of
10 3/4 per cent.
Save &amp; Prosper, the fund management group, yesterday launched the China
Dragon Fund, its first authorised unit trust to invest directly in mainland
China.
The unit trust will invest up to 10 per cent of the funds in Chinese listed
'B' shares and unquoted Chinese investments.
The remainder of the funds will be invested in Hong Kong-based companies
with a strong exposure to mainland China, S&amp;P said.

FT  02 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Spain's government bonds top
performance league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S higher-yielding government bond markets topped the bonds
performance league in January, according to figures from JP Morgan
Securities, helped by the relative stability within the European exchange
rate mechanism.
Spain was the top-performing government bond market last month in both local
currency and US dollar terms, with a return of 3.29 per cent in pesetas and
3.56 per cent for dollar-based investors. Italy was the second-best
performing market in local currency terms with a gain of 2.82 per cent,
followed by the Ecu market with a return of 2.46 per cent.
'The higher-yielding European markets . . . outperformed other government
bond markets during January, pointing to the fact that high-yield investment
strategies may be coming back into fashion,' according to JP Morgan.
The Bank of Spain cut its intervention rate from 13.75 per cent to 13.25 per
cent in January, helped by the combination of economic weakness and the
stability of the peseta.
'In both Italy and Spain, restrictive fiscal policies continue to weigh on
economic activity, and Europe's recession has dampened the positive effects
on trade position resulting from the recent currency devaluations' (of the
peseta and lira), according to JP Morgan.
Most of the European central banks lowered interest rates, either through
the official interest rate or by indirect market intervention, last month.
The US dollar depreciated against the Canadian dollar and most European
currencies, helping to enhance foreign bond returns for US-based investors.

FT  02 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Accounting rules force
capital shift at British Land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH LAND has exchanged one form of complex capital instrument for
another in response to UK Accounting Standards Board proposals which would
have threatened to increase the company's borrowings.
The board has told holders of convertible bonds in a subsidiary that these
will be exchanged for cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares at
the end of March at a cost of up to Pounds 100,000.
Holders of its 8.625 per cent bonds in British Land Company (Jersey)
maturing in 2011 will receive preference shares of Pounds 1 each in British
Land after 60 days' notice is complete.
The action follows the Accounting Board's December issue of Fred 3, the
exposure draft on capital instruments, which states convertible bonds must
be classified as debt on the balance sheet.
Mr John Weston Smith, finance director, said the British Land board had
always regarded the bonds as equity as they are convertible into shares, and
that the exchange would maintain this definition and keep the company's
gearing and interest cover low.
Fred 3, in fact, classifies preference shares under a new category of
non-equity shareholders' funds. The company was careful to say it regarded
the bonds as 'being in the nature of equity capital'.
The shares will be issued at a price of Pounds 1,000, equivalent to the
nominal value of a bond, and redeemable at the same price. The gross
dividend will be 8.625 per cent of the redemption, equivalent to the gross
interest on the bond - or 6.469 per cent net dividend at current tax rates.
The company said that shareholders approved the creation of the shares and
'appropriate alterations' to the company's articles of association at the
last annual meeting.

year

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN PACIFIC, the transport, resources and property group that was
forced to restructure by the long North American recession, staged a
turnround in the final quarter of 1992 and expects to be profitable in 1993.
Operations at the group's rail, road and marine transport units remained
depressed, but the thriving PanCanadian Petroleum oil and gas subsidiary
doubled its contribution. Forest product losses were much lower, while
property and hotels improved.
Mr William Stinson, chairman, said that 'slowly improving economic
conditions together with rising efficiency should lead to a return to
profitability in 1993'.
CP posted a CDollars 2.7m (USDollars 2.1m) profit in the final quarter of
1992, against a loss of CDollars 29m a year earlier, but after special
charges the final loss came out at CDollars 254m, or 80 cents a share,
against a loss of CDollars 887.6m, or CDollars 2.79, in 1991.
Revenues were CDollars 2bn, compared with CDollars 2.5bn, but the decline
was partly due to disposals.
For the whole of 1992, the company posted a loss of CDollars 37.4m before
special charges, against a loss of CDollars 16.2m a year earlier. The final
loss rose to CDollars 478.3m, or CDollars 1.50 a share, against a deficit of
CDollars 913.8m, or CDollars 2.87, in 1991. Revenues fell to CDollars 8.9bn
from CDollars 10bn.
The 1992 special charges covered continued rail and truck rationalisation
and manpower cuts, and a write-down of CP's investment in its US industrial
products associate.
CP Rail performed poorly because of the recession. The western coal
operations were hit by a strike, but have since been expanded by acquisition
and should improve in 1993.
Telecommunications were not profitable. The group's stake in Unitel
Communications, the Canadian telecoms company, has dropped below 50 per cent
following the CDollars 150m purchase by AT&amp;T of the US of a 20 per cent
interest.
PanCanadian, with sharply higher earnings from rising oil and gas
production, is spending CDollars 430 m on exploration and development this
year, up 2 per cent from 1992.
CP Forest should return to profitability in the second half of 1993, while
Marathon Realty's and CP Hotels' progress may be held back by the slow
recovery. Container shipping has a slightly better outlook, while the
associate Laidlaw is improving.

FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: J. P. Morgan raises Dollars 1bn
for private equity fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
J. P. MORGAN, the US banking group, announced yesterday it had raised more
than Dollars 1bn for its Corsair Partnership, a new private equity fund that
will make strategic investments in banking companies in the US and
worldwide.
The blue-chip New York bank has invested Dollars 100m of its own money into
the fund, giving it the largest single stake.
The rest of the Dollars 1bn has come from 46 different partners, including
financial institutions, pension funds, public and private companies, wealthy
individuals and small investment partnerships.
Mr Nick Paumgarten, a J. P. Morgan managing director and chairman of
Corsair, said the fund planned to invest minority stakes in undervalued
banks that have an existing management team and business plan, but which
need of fresh capital.
Each investment will be made with the full support of bank managements, and
Corsair will not seek to control or acquire the banks in which it invests,
although it will offer access J. P. Morgan's banking expertise.
J. P. Morgan may be taking a gamble with Corsair, because it is entering a
relatively crowded market. Other similar investment partnerships, run by
such big guns of investment banking as Goldman Sachs, Lazard Freres and
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, have been taking private equity stakes in banks for
several years.
Many of these partnerships have enjoyed large returns from their
investments, primarily because US banks reached a trough in terms of
performance and capital strength more than two years ago, and the industry
has been steadily recovering ever since.
Mr Paumgarten admits that Corsair is arriving late on the scene, but
believes there are 'incredible' investment opportunities outside the US,
particularly in parts of Europe and the Far East.

FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Peruvian government upholds sale
of airline
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PERUVIAN government has upheld the sale of the state-owned airline
Aeroperu to a consortium headed by the Mexican carrier Aeromexico.
Aeromexico and partners bid Dollars 54m for the airline, but the sale was
challenged on the grounds that the Peruvian carrier would be controlled by
foreign investors, contrary to Peru's privatisation rules.
While Aeromexico would own only 47 per cent of Aeroperu, it was maintained
that its close ties with its Peruvian partners gave it effective control.
However, Peru's economy minister said the sale was a 'closed case'.
Aeromexico will, therefore, gain control of Aeroperu's flights to Europe and
expand business into South America.
The sale comes as Aeromexico, which has around half the Mexican market, is
holding talks with Mexicana, Mexico's other principal airline, on a possible
merger.
Mexicana is expected to make heavy losses this year, and its owners are keen
to team with the more efficient rival. In spite of a recent law against
monopolies, the government appears willing to let the merger go ahead.
Investors in Aeromexico and Mexicana will, it is reported, create a holding
company to manage both airlines, with Aeromexico having majority ownership.
The new holding company may well seek an alliance with Continental Airlines,
since Mr Alfredo Brener, Mexicana's main shareholder, will acquire an
interest in the Houston-based carrier when, as expected, it emerges from
bankruptcy protection soon.

IMASCO, the financial services, tobacco, fast-food and retailing group,
posted a 17 per cent gain in profit in the final quarter of 1992 on revenues
that rose only 2 per cent.
The company has succeeded in turning around Hardee's, the US fast-food unit.
In Canada, tobacco products continued to improve, but financial services
were hit by bigger loan loss provisions. Drug stores did well, but other
retail operations continued weak.
Fourth-quarter earnings were CDollars 110.7m (USDollars 86.8m), or 88 cents
a share, against Dollars 94.4m, or 74 cents, a year earlier.
Revenues were ahead at Dollars 2.02bn, against Dollars 1.99bn.
Operating profit for Imperial Tobacco, which has 66 per cent of the
cigarette market, rose 8 per cent, while Canada Trustco's contribution
dropped 70 per cent because of the special provisions.
For the whole of 1992, Imasco, 40 per cent controlled by BAT Industries,
reported net profit of Dollars 380.4m, up 15 per cent from 1991, equal to
Dollars 2.97, against Dollars 2.56. Revenues were little changed at Dollars
7.98bn.

FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Blockbuster improves to Dollars

BLOCKBUSTER Entertainment, the US video rental chain which acquired the
Cityvision group in the UK, yesterday reported after-tax profits of Dollars
45.1m in the final three months of 1992, taking the total for the year to
Dollars 142m.
In the fourth quarter of 1991, Blockbuster made an after-tax profit of
Dollars 29m, and for all of 1991 Dollars 93.7m. At the earnings per share
level, the Florida-based company - whose recent expansion moves have
attempted to create a 'full-service' home entertainment group, rather than
one narrowly focused on video rental - saw a figure of 77 cents in 1992, up
from 56 cent in the previous 12 months.
Blockbuster said revenues increased by 31 per cent to Dollars 1.98bn in 1992
overall, although this partly reflected the impact of acquisitions and
expansion. In the fourth quarter, revenues for video stores which had been
in operation for more than one year increased by 5.8 per cent.
Yesterday, Blockbuster's finance director, Mr Gregory Fairbanks, was said to
be comfortable with earnings estimates for the first quarter of 1993 that
fall in the 18 to 20 cents a share range.
He also estimated that Blockbuster commanded about 15 per cent of the US
video rental market at end-1992, up from about 12 to 13 per cent in 1991.
By the end of last year, the company had 3,127 video stores, of 2,002 were
company-owned (including 775 stores in the UK, under the Ritz name). The
remainder were franchised.

FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Banco do Brasil benefits from
debt repayments

BANCO do Brasil, the state-controlled commercial bank that is Brazil's
second-largest financial institution, announced profits of Dollars 446.8m
for 1992, up 77 per cent over the 1991 final figure of Dollars 252m, writes
Bill Hinchberger in Sao Paulo.
The bank attributed the improved performance primarily to a reduction in
non-performing domestic loans and interest payments by the Brazilian
government on its Dollars 44bn overseas debt. Banco do Brasil holds about
Dollars 6bn in Brazilian foreign debt, a figure roughly equivalent to its
entire net domestic assets, according to Mr Gil Garcia, the bank's chief
accountant.
Overdue domestic loans were gradually reduced in relation to overall loan
operations during the last three months of 1992, Mr Garcia said.

FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Nakamura outlines plans to iron
out Ilva's troubles - Changes at the ailing steel group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR HAYAO Nakamura conforms little to the stereotype of the Japanese business
manager, despite his uniform blue suit and Nippon Steel badge on his lapel.
He has spent more than 30 years working in Italy, mostly with Nippon Steel,
speaks good Italian, and has just accepted a remarkable challenge. He has
agreed to take over as chief executive of Ilva, Italy's ailing state-run
steel group.
The 56-year-old Mr Nakamura is the first Japanese to be recruited into such
a senior post in a state-run European industry. He has also been offered the
job in a country which has been the most protective about letting in
Japanese industrial competition.
'I was surprised that Ilva was desperate enough to ask a foreigner, but at
the same time I was taken by the brave decision,' he said yesterday. 'I
first thought it would be easier if I didn't accept the offer.'
His appointment, announced on January 22, followed the dismissal of the Ilva
board by IRI, the Italian state-holding company which is the shareholder of
the steel group. Mr Nakamura, who left Nippon Steel last month, will take
over on February 18.
Unlike most Japanese executives who are reserved, he is prepared to give
straightforward opinions. He has few illusions about the problems of
tackling Ilva with its debts of over L8,300bn (Dollars 5.5bn) and the urgent
need to restructure as the group struggles to cope with excess capacity and
falling European steel prices. Ilva, which emerged from the remains of the
former Finsider group, is expected to have losses for 1992 near L2,000bn.
He already knows the Italian steel industry well, having worked on the
extension of the vast Taranto complex in the mid-1970s and helped Ilva with
its Novi Ligure rolled coils facility. But being an outsider, Mr Nakamura
says, will allow him to take what could become drastic restructuring
measures. An insider - or even another European executive - would have found
it more difficult to take painful decisions.
The implication of these comments is that he plans big changes in the
Italian steel industry. He believes the restructuring process will take up
to three years and can be achieved via a mixture of changes in management,
finance and production. He regards it as important to eliminate political
appointees in Ilva management - this is also the philosophy of Mr Michele
Tedeschi, the increasingly powerful chief executive of IRI.
Further resort to outside talent will be limited, he says; and he claims
that he has no plans to bring in former colleagues from Nippon Steel.
The most pressing problem he envisages will be dealing with the workforce
and Ilva's suppliers. He wants to instill a greater sense of responsibility
for Ilva's products among the 40,000 strong workforce. He warned Italy's
highly unionsed workforce that he would not be seeking consensus at any
price, and that he would take a tough line on strikes and overtime.
He appears determined to tackle head-on the restructuring of the vast
Taranto complex located in the heel of southern Italy. The importance of
Taranto to local employment makes the issue of restructuring this plant
politically sensitive. But having advised on the plant's engineering, he
reckons he is one of the few outsiders who know how to run Taranto.
On the financial side, he anticipates Ilva will transfer two-thirds of its
debts to a separate corporation. This is a pattern which IRI is also
following with Iritecna, its troubled general contracting group, whose board
was dismissed last week.
He denies suggestions of special ties being developed between his former
employers, and Ilva. But he recognises technological ties may be enhanced,
especially in new steelmaking processes; and in an increasingly competitive
international market his new employers in Italy may need all the help they
can get.

FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: ASC may act over Campbell bid
complaints
</HEADLINE>

THE Australian Securities Commission (ASC) has reacted to criticism of the
takeover bid by Campbell Soup, the US food group, for Arnotts, the
Australian biscuit maker.
Mr Michael Braham, the ASC's New South Wales regional commissioner, said
yesterday he had received complaints alleging shareholders had been misled
by statements from Campbell which suggested the company would not extend its
takeover bid beyond last week.
Mr Braham said Campbell had now stated that its final offer of ADollars 9.50
for Arnotts would be neither increased nor extended beyond February 5.
'The ASC is concerned where directors or their advisers use ambiguous
language during takeover bids when communicating to shareholders or speaking
to the media with the result that shareholders are confused,' he said.
'The ASC is considering issuing a practice note setting out its views on
statements made during takeover bids. The ASC believes that companies and
their advisers should take care not to make statements which, while not
factually inaccurate, may mislead shareholders and the market or create
uncertainty.'
MR John McCarthy, head of ANZ Bank's property and investment services
division, has been appointed managing director of RJI, the New Zealand
property company, writes Terry Hall in Wellington.
RJI, with assets of over NZDollars 1bn (USDollars 526m), is the biggest
property company listed in Australasia. Mr McCarthy's appointment follows
the resignation of RJI's founder chairman and executive director, Sir Robert
Jones, last year.
Mr McCarthy said he would manage the business from Sydney, and did not rule
out the possibility that the company's head office would be moved from
Wellington. Although most of the company's shareholders were New Zealanders,
he said 60 per cent of the property assets were in Australia.
