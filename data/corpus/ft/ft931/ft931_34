FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Bank of East Asia exceeds

BANK of East Asia, Hong Kong's third-largest listed banking group, has
announced a 36 per cent increase in net profits to HKDollars 685.3m
(USDollars 89m) for 1992, up from HKDollars 504.4m a year earlier.
The profit figure, after transfers to the bank's inner reserves, was above
market expectations due to unexpectedly high non-banking earnings. The bank
operations reported a 28 per cent increase in profits, aided by unusually
wide interest rate margins and a higher rate of growth in both deposits and
loans.
Bank of East Asia is the first of Hong Kong's banks to announce its 1992
results, and analysts are anticipating a sector average of close to 30 per
cent growth in net profit.
Mr David Li, chief executive, predicted an improved performance from the
banks in 1993. The sector has been hit by a government-imposed ceiling of 70
per cent on mortgage financing, but this is expected to be revoked as a
result of lower property prices.
Bank of East Asia proposed a final dividend of 52.5 cents a share, making a
full-year pay-out of 80 cents a share in 1992, compared with 62.5 cents in
the previous year.
Malayan Banking (Maybank), Malaysia's biggest bank, has announced pre-tax
profits in the six months to December 31 1992 of MDollars 346.53m (USDollars
138.6m), a 27 per cent rise on the MDollars 272.1m reported for the
corresponding period in 1991, Kieran Cooke reports from Kuala Lumpur.
Mr Ahmad Mohamad Don, managing director, said the bank expected to maintain
its profitability in the second half, even though the Malaysian economy was
showing signs of slowing down.
Total customer deposits stood at MDollars 35.2bn at the end of the reporting
period, a 28 per cent increase over the 1991 figure. Loans and advances
stood at MDollars 33.8bn, a 10 per cent increase on 1991.

FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Thai carrier registers 85% fall
in net profits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THAI Airways International, Thailand's partially-privatised national
airline, yesterday reported an 85 per cent fall in net profits to Bt120.01m
(Dollars 4.7m) for the first quarter to December 31, down from Bt792.23m a
year earlier, AP-DJ reports.
Gross revenues edged up 0.3 per cent to Bt14.09m from Bt14.05m, but
operating revenues fell 1.7 per cent to Bt12.19m. Pre-tax profits,
meanwhile, tumbled 88 per cent to Bt144.44m from Bt1.61bn.
Operating profits from airline activities fell 61 per cent to Bt638.89m from
Bt1.63bn. Charges for aircraft depreciation rose 29 per cent to Bt1.89bn.
The airline's shares, which began trading in July, represent nearly 6 per
cent of the total capitalisation of the Thai stock market. The share price
fell Bt1 yesterday to Bt53.00 in moderate trading.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Research lowered its earnings forecast for the full
fiscal year to Bt2.2bn from Bt4bn. It said it had expected the airline to
derive Bt1.5bn of its profit from the sale of three DC-10 and four Airbus
jets this year.
However, the decline in earnings in the latest period was 'larger than we
were going for,' Ms Sarah Knaggs, BZW analyst, said.
She noted the first-quarter result was particularly significant because it
came during the tourist high season, when the airline was expected to pull
in the most revenue.
Thai Airways company said an explanation of the steep fall in earnings would
be released today, following disclosure to the stock exchange authorities.

FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Bridgestone reveals plans for
senior management shake-up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BRIDGESTONE, Japan's largest tyremaker, yesterday announced a senior
management shake-up, with the promotion of the chief executive of its US
operations to run the group.
Mr Yoichiro Kaizaki, Bridgestone's executive vice-president in charge of its
Bridgestone/Firestone operations in North America, will become the group's
president. Mr Akira Yeiri, the current president, is resigning but will
remain an adviser to the company.
Japan has not witnessed the dramatic upheaval in senior management which has
hit large US companies in the past few months, with the departure of several
senior executives from leading companies such as General Motors, IBM and
American Express.
However, the Bridgestone change is part of a more evolutionary change in
senior management in Japanese corporations brought on by two years of
falling profits at most companies.
The tyremaker's shake-up follows similar changes recently at Sanyo, the
electronics group, Cannon, the camera and copier manufacturer, and Honda,
the carmaker.
Mr Kaizaki, chairman and chief executive of Bridgestone/Firestone, is widely
credited with taking tough action to turn around its US plants, which were
incurring heavy losses after Bridgestone acquired them, for Dollars 2.6bn,
in 1988.
Since then, Bridgestone has invested about Dollars 1bn to modernise the US
plants.
Mr Kaizaki, 59, joined Bridgestone in 1962. He has spent most of his career
outside the mainstream tyre business running the group's chemical and
industrial products division. He moved to the US in 1991 to take over the US
operations. The company did not announce a successor.

<TEXT>
AN Ontario bankruptcy court yesterday postponed until Friday formal approval
of Olympia and York Developments' massive debt restructuring plan on its
Canadian assets, Reuter reports from Toronto.
Court approval - which would effectively allow O&amp;Y to emerge from eight
months of court protection from creditors - was postponed to allow creditors
to consider a legal motion introduced yesterday by Citibank of Canada in
opposition to the restructuring of an O&amp;Y unit, GW Utilities.
Citibank Canada, which voted in favour of the plan because of its claims on
GW Utilities, said in its motion said that a reorganisation of GW Utilities
was unfair. Citibank said it was not trying to overturn the whole plan, but
only the reorganisation.
Under the plan, O&amp;Y would privatise 89.5 per cent-owned GW Utilities by
buying the outstanding shares.

FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Furlaud named to head American
Express board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE board of directors of American Express, the troubled US travel and
financial services group, yesterday named Mr Richard Furlaud as its new
non-executive chairman, replacing Mr James Robinson, who resigned at the
weekend.
The election of the 68-year-old Mr Furlaud, a former president of Bristol
Myers Squibb and a member of the American Express board since 1972, caps a
week of internecine boardroom politics at the company.
Mr Robinson said he would sever all ties to the company last Saturday, only
five days after he had staged a counter-coup by having himself re-confirmed
as group chairman and taking over the same role at Shearson Lehman, the
lossmaking investment banking and brokerage arm.
Mr Robinson's departure and the swift election of Mr Furlaud followed
protests from institutional shareholders to Mr Harvey Golub, the man who
last Monday took over as group chief executive from Mr Robinson.
American Express stock rose by Dollars 1 5/8 yesterday in unusually heavy
trading before closing in New York at Dollars 24 3/4 .
Mr John Keefe, an independent financial services industry analyst in New
York, said the stock market was expressing its approval for the latest turn
of events.
American Express, which is still suffering from shattered morale and the
damage to its reputation caused by last week's management upheavals, sought
yesterday to reassure the market by defining Mr Furlaud's responsibilities
as clearly as possible.
It said that, as chairman, Mr Furlaud would be responsible 'for ensuring
that appropriate issues are identified for the directors to consider,
determining the agenda for board meetings and seeing that significant
matters of interest to shareholders are reviewed by the board'.
Mr Furlaud said he would work with Mr Golub 'to implement the strategies in
place to build the American Express brand franchise, restore Shearson Lehman
Brothers to profitability and strengthen the company's balance sheet'.
Uncertainty remains about the leadership of Shearson. Investors were
outraged last week when Mr Robinson pushed aside Mr Howard Clark Jr, the
Shearson chairman, and assumed the twin roles of both chairman and chief
executive.
It is not known whether Mr Clark might be re-instated at Shearson. American
Express said Mr Golub would work with the board at Shearson on a succession
plan 'to deal with the longer-term executive management structure of the
firm'.
Mr Furlaud was president of Bristol-Myers from 1989 to 1992 and was chairman
and chief executive of Squibb before its merger with Bristol-Myers.
At American Express he serves as chairman of the board's compensation,
benefits and nominating committee and as a director of Shearson.

FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: A Swiss maverick exercises its
muscles - BZ Bank's rise to become the country's fourth most profitable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THERE is a new power in the Swiss financial community
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Martin Ebner's eight-year-old securities house, BZ Bank.
BZ has just published its 1992 results, showing net profits of SFr59.5m
(Dollars 40m), more than double 1991's SFr25.1m.
That makes BZ Switzerland's fourth-largest bank in terms of profits,
exceeded only by the big three universal banks, Union Bank of Switzerland,
Swiss Bank Corporation and Credit Suisse. (In assets, BZ is still a minnow,
with a total of only SFr607.2m, but it has no desire to be a lending bank.)
The buoyant result also shows that the maverick BZ was not just a meteoric
product of the frenzied financial environment of the late 1980s. Few other
banks did as well in last year's volatile securities markets and depressed
economic environment.
BZ has been the biggest player in the Zurich stock market for some time,
with a share of about 20 per cent. It dominates the Swiss covered warrants
market, and its two quoted investment trusts, BK Vision and Pharma Vision,
have massive shareholdings in some of the country's biggest companies.
BK Vision last month showed its willingness to flex its muscles by
challenging the decision of UBS, in which it is the largest shareholder, to
dump from their board Mr Christoph Blocher, the anti-European Community
politician and industrialist and a close associate of Mr Ebner.
Power is what BZ has been all about ever since its beginnings in 1985. Mr
Ebner had been head of research at Bank J. Vontobel, the venerable Zurich
private bank. He wanted the bank to reduce its emphasis on its slow-moving
private client business and instead specialise on research and block trading
for a small number of large institutional clients. Vontobel refused and he
left.
Two large institutions that he had got to know while at Vontobel, Sweden's
Carnegie Fondkommission and the Swiss commodities trading house Gebruder
Volkart, backed him in setting up BZ, but they have since sold out.
The BZ group, with consolidated equity of about SFr1bn and SFr10bn in funds
under management, is now majority owned and controlled by its management.
As for Mr Ebner, he figures in a recent list among the 100 wealthiest Swiss,
with a fortune estimated at between SFr300m and SFr400m.
The group cultivates a modest image. The bank itself has a staff of only 20
who work in a sparsely- furnished open-plan office above a department store
in a nondescript corner of downtown Zurich.
It claims to have only a dozen regular clients, but they include some of
Switzerland's largest pension funds and insurance companies and a couple of
UK merchant banks.
From its beginnings, BZ was one of the most active players on the Zurich
bourse, and one of the most successful. Other brokers soon began to watch it
carefully, and often blindly followed its moves.
This has given the bank extra power, and its persistent opposition to the
development of a national electronic exchange, an issue over which Mr Ebner
resigned from the board of the bourse three years ago, illustrates how
reluctant he is to lose it.
BZ's first and most successful innovation, in 1986, was convincing Swiss
institutions to write options on their registered shares of Swiss companies.
At the time, most companies refused to register shares held by foreigners.
It foresaw that these restrictions would gradually be removed as foreign
pressure forced Swiss companies to fall into line with international
practice. This would cause the shares to rise in value to the level of the
companies' other securities, and the options gave all investors, including
foreign ones, the opportunity to participate in these movements.
The restrictions have now been largely removed, but the warrants continue to
be popular as a tax avoidance device, and BZ leads in both issuing and
dealing in them.
The bank gained wider prominence in 1988 when it launched an audacious, but
ultimately thwarted, bid for Bank Leu, then the country's fifth-largest.
BZ's most controversial move has been into investment trusts. In July 1991,
the group, together with Mr Blocher, bought a controlling stake in Pharma
Vision. It was then a sleepy trust with large holdings in the big Swiss
pharmaceutical companies, Ciba-Geigy, Roche and Sandoz, as well as some US
shares and Ems Chemie, the Swiss speciality chemical company controlled by
Mr Blocher.
Three months later, a similar trust, BK Vision, was formed to hold stakes in
banks. BK got off to a strong start, as some of BZ's powerful clients
exchanged their bank shares for its shares, and already has assets of
SFr1.2bn.
Mr Ebner and Mr Blocher portray these ventures as the leading edge in
shareholder power in Switzerland. As Mr Blocher, chairman of Pharma Vision,
said shortly after the takeover: 'Pharma Vision focuses on a small number of
promising holdings. This facilitates communication with the management of
the respective companies. Thus Pharma Vision assumes a role which cannot be
played by the individual shareholder in an increasingly anonymous and
fragmented shareholder community.'
That is a laudable aim, even if it makes company directors uncomfortable.
But critics claim that in a small market like Switzerland's, and one in
which disclosure requirements are still primitive, BZ's concentration on
large blocks of shares of a very few companies offers opportunities for
manipulation that would not be available in more transparent markets.
Mr Ebner makes no apologies for the group's policy of focusing on only a few
Swiss shares, saying he prefers to stick with what he knows best. Also, the
group concentrates on blue-chip issues, where liquidity and transparency are
high.
He acknowledges that BZ has some power over the companies in which it holds
large blocks of shares, but he insists he uses it responsibly. He is not
interested, for example, in insider information that might move the market
in the short term. Rather, he wants to support managers who he believes will
make their companies perform well in the longer term.
That may be all there is to it. But it is intriguing that the directors of
UBS have chosen - by sacking Mr Blocher - to invite a confrontation with BK
Vision and Mr Ebner now.
They, like Mr Ebner, cherish power, too.

FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Metra takes majority stake in
Italy's Sanitari Pozzi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER step towards the concentration of Europe's sanitaryware market was
taken yesterday with the purchase by the Finnish Metra group of 51 per cent
of Sanitari Pozzi, Italy's leading producer.
The holding is being bought by Allia, the French sanitaryware company
controlled by Metra.
The price of the deal, which will take place via a reserved capital
increase, has yet to be agreed. However, the sale should net at least L20bn
(Dollars 13.7m) for Finanziaria Pozzi Ginori, the quoted holding company
which owns both Sanitari Pozzi and the Richard Ginori fine china group.
Allia will have an option, expected to be exercised, on the remaining shares
in Sanitari Pozzi.
Sanitaryware accounted for about half Finanziaria Pozzi Ginori's 1991 sales
of L209bn.
Bankers say Sanitari Pozzi, controlled by Mr Salvatore Ligresti's Premafin
holding company, has been on sale for some time.
No figures for its earnings are available, but it is believed to have been
making losses in recent years. The sale will realise an unspecified capital
gain for Finanziaria Pozzi Ginori.
The deal marks the second foreign acquisition of a big Italian sanitaryware
maker in less than three years.
In July 1990, Blue Circle, the UK cement and home products group, bought
Ceramica Dolomite, the country's second-biggest sanitary and bathroomware
maker, for L80bn.
The latest deal consolidates Metra's position as one of Europe's leading
makers of sanitaryware.
Apart from Allia, Metra controls Keramag in Germany, as well as a number of
companies in Scandinavia. The group, listed in Helsinki and traded on SEAQ
in London, also makes diesel engines and locks.
Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, the bank which floated 20 per cent of
its shares last year, has released preliminary figures for its first year as
a listed company.
Gross operating profits rose by 22.6 per cent to over L1,600bn, while
interest income jumped by 24.4 per cent to L2,900bn. Fee earnings increased
by 15.4 per cent to L3,600bn. The comparisons are all adjusted for changes
linked to the flotation.
Direct deposits from customers rose by almost 13 per cent to L69,000bn,
while total customer loans climbed 13.6 per cent to L70,000bn.
The proportion of the bank's troubled loans rose to 3.65 per cent from 3 per
cent in 1991 as a result of the recession in Italy.
However, the ratio remained below the Italian average, said the bank.

DEN norske Bank, Norway's biggest bank, is considering a sweeping
reorganisation of its corporate structure to strengthen its healthier
operations which have been weakened by five years of massive credit losses
and mounting non-performing loans.
The bank is considering establishing a holding company structure under which
a so-called 'good bank,' its healthy operations, would be established.
A 'project bank' would also be established. This would hold non-performing
loans, high-risk loans and property acquired by the bank which served as
collateral for loans which became non-performing.
DnB has acquired property valued at an estimated NKr3bn (Dollars 437m) and
owns property worth another NKr3bn. The bank also has about NKr10bn in
non-performing loans. These three portfolios accounted for nearly 10 per
cent of its assets at the end of last year.
In November, DnB said it would establish DnB Eiendom, a separate unit under
the bank's current structure, comprising real estate commitments stemming
from the bank's own property, property acquired as collateral from customers
unable to fulfil commitments and a substantial number of property loans
which require 'special' competence.
DnB Eiendom is expected to be operating this year, and if successful DnB
could take a further step by reorganising into a holding company structure,
but it does not expect this to happen in 1993.
Although finance ministry officials have so far rejected a scheme to help
revive the banks in which their bad loans would be transferred to a bank
established by the state - a so-called 'bad loan' bank - the government has
said it might consider proposals by individual banks to establish their own
subsidiaries into which they could off-load non-performing loans.
The ministry is expected this spring to present a paper on the future of the
banking sector and which may provide an indication of the government's
position on bad loan bank subsidiaries. The state currently owns about 70
per cent of DnB's share capital after last year providing the bank with
NKr1.5bn in preference capital and a NKr600m state guarantee.

Portugal

<TEXT>
AHOLD, the Dutch retail and supermarket group, said yesterday its Portuguese
joint venture, Jeronimo Martins Retail (JMR), planned to take full control
of a large Portuguese supermarket chain, Ino Supermercados.
The deal will add 54 supermarkets and annual sales of some Dollars 200m to
the JMR joint venture, which presently consists of 40 Pingo Doce chain
stores with annual sales of over Dollars 300m. JMR now enjoys a 10 per cent
market share in Portuguese food retailing. An Ahold spokesman said the terms
of the deal would be finalised and disclosed 'within several weeks'.
Est. Jeronimo Martins &amp; Filho Holding, the leading Portuguese food producer
which is the 51 per cent majority shareholder in JMR, has already acquired
Inovacao Sgps, the parent company of Ino Supermercados.
As part of the deal, two other Inovacao subsidiaries - a chain of mainly
non-retail hypermarkets, called Feira Nova FN, and a smaller cash-and-carry
operation - were also acquired.
Discussions are under way between Ahold and Jeronimo Martins as to whether
the Feira Nova operation, with annual sales of Dollars 210m, should also be
absorbed by JMR. Ahold stressed yesterday that its primary business interest
remained food retailing.
When JMR was formed in July last year, Ahold paid Es7.7bn (Dollars 54.4m)
for its 49 per cent stake. The Pingo Doce chain was fully-owned by Jeronimo
Martins. Under the terms of the venture, both partners have equal voting
rights and take key management decisions unanimously.

FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Argentaria opens with profits of
Pta67.4bn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ARGENTARIA, the state-owned Spanish banking corporation due for partial
privatisation, reported net profits of Pta67.4bn (Dollars 607m) and a
cash-flow of Pta200m in 1992, its first full financial year.
Mr Francisco Luzon, chairman, said Argentaria's 'excellent' results
guaranteed 'a successful flotation', but he said the government, which is
Argentaria's sole shareholder, had 'not as yet taken an explicit decision'
to put the banking group on the market.
'All the necessary conditions are in place for us to go to the market as
soon as the shareholder decides,' Mr Luzon said.
The government would not comment on the timing of the flotation, but
analysts believe the finance ministry, which is seeking to raise funds
through disposals to reduce the public deficit, is anxious to give the
go-ahead as soon as possible.
Mr Luzon said he hoped there would be 'a major share placement' both in
Spain and abroad which would bring in 'some 200,000 shareholders'. He said
he wanted Argentaria to be 'a liquid, blue-chip stock' in Spain and on the
New York and London stock exchanges.
Argentaria was created in May 1991 when the government pooled five financial
institutions it controlled, including Banco Exterior which is now the
group's flagship bank, into a single banking corporation. The 1992 net
profit represented a 14.7 per cent increase on the income earned by
Argentaria's units during 1991.
The banking group, which is particularly active in the mortgage market in
financing local authorities, had average total assets last year of
Pta9,717bn, making it Spain's largest financial institution.
Mr Luzon said Argentaria's return on assets last year stood at 0.98 per
cent, up from the 0.86 per cent calculated for the group in 1991.

PERSTORP, the Swedish speciality chemicals and plastics group, benefited
from its acquisition programme and the devaluation of the krona to record a
21 per cent rise in profits in the four months to December 31.
Earnings after financial items increased to SKr81m (Dollars 11.5m) from
SKr67m, as sales rose 10 per cent to SKr2.61bn.
The group said recession had affected its markets, although it had benefited
from an upswing in the US.
It expects that its profits for the year to August will at least equal last
year's SKr228m.

Fleming American Investment Trust saw its net asset value per share rise 33
per cent to 279.3p for 1992.
There was an increase in small company exposure to 25 per cent, where there
is additional potential for capital growth, said Mr Iain Saunders, chairman.
Gross revenue rose from Pounds 3.87m to Pounds 4.11m. Higher expenses and
interest led to a cut in earnings from 1.26p to 0.73p, and the dividend is
reduced from 1.25p to 0.7p with a final of 0.35p.

Microvitec, the information systems and services group, has sold its Logitek
distribution business to management for Pounds 2.49m cash, reducing gearing
to under 50 per cent.
Net asset value of the loss-making business is about Pounds 3m. The second
half 1992 results of Microvitec were affected by depressed sales and low
margins in Logitek, and that had been a factor in the decision to sell.
Microvitec will now concentrate on its core businesses of designing,
manufacturing and selling products, providing systems integration solutions
and maintenance and software applications in the publishing and accountancy
markets.
It will hold a 20 per cent stake in the purchaser, to be called Logitek
Distribution.

Olives Property is to write off its investment in Continental Paper as an

receivership.
Olives has a total investment of Pounds 1.35m, represented by 7.5 per cent
cumulative preference shares of Pounds 1, in Continental and its UK
subsidiaries.
The effect of that, and eliminating capital reserves resulting from the sale
of ordinary shares in Continental in March 1992 when it ceased to be an
associate, is to reduce Olives' net assets from 71p at end-1991 to 50p per
share.

Part of the increase stemmed from sterling's devaluation against the D-Mark

Earnings emerged at 3.15p (1.62p) on a net basis or 2.94p fully diluted. The

HOSKINS BREWERY, the USM-traded Leicester-based real ale brewer, said
yesterday that it was 'at an advanced stage of negotiations which may or may

Directors made the announcement 'in the light of the movement in the share
price last week'. The shares firmed 1p to 40p yesterday.
Hoskins, one of the UK's smallest quoted brewing groups, entered the
limelight late last year after attempts by dissident shareholders to oust Mr
Barrie Hoar as chairman and his brother Robert as a director were easily
defeated at an extraordinary meeting.
At the time, Mr Barrie Hoar said: 'A great deal of time and money has been
spent which will be hard to recoup in these difficult business conditions.'

FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Lower interest costs boost Haynes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER INTEREST charges helped Haynes Publishing Group, which produces car
and motorcycle maintenance manuals, jump by 34 per cent at the pre-tax level
to Pounds 1.5m for the six months to November 30, compared with Pounds
1.13m.
Mr Max Pearce, chief executive, said the result had been achieved 'with no
help from either the US or UK economies'. Sales were ahead less than 2 per
cent at Pounds 11.1m.
There was a sharp reduction in debt from Pounds 1.3m at the end of the last
financial year to Pounds 156,000 at the interim stage. Net interest charges
fell from Pounds 240,000 to Pounds 86,000. Mr Pearce said the group expected
to be cash positive by the end of the current year.
Haynes aimed to build a cash pile for expansion into Europe, developing
manuals for alternative markets such as home security and, in the longer
term, for acquisitions.
The interim dividend goes up 1p to 3.5p, payable from earnings per share up
33 per cent to 9.05p. The shares advanced by 15p to 288p.
Meanwhile, costs were being controlled through a redundancy programme which
resulted in Pounds 203,000 (Pounds 453,000) exceptional charges in the UK.
About 10 per cent of the 200-plus jobs would be cut by the end of the year.
A further Pounds 100,000 charge was expected in the second half.
Trading continued to be most difficult in the UK, which was hampered by
losses of some Pounds 250,000 from general publishing. Mr Pearce said these
losses - which were Pounds 1.2m for the whole of last year - would total
about Pounds 500,000 for the year.
Operating profits in the UK, after exceptionals, were Pounds 830,000,
compared with Pounds 619,000.
In the US, Haynes recorded an 8 per cent increase in operating profits from
Pounds 1.14m to Pounds 1.23m, with sales for the Chevy Pick-Up manual
outstripping all others. Mr Pearce said the group had a 50 per cent share of
the US market.

FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Delaney rid of loss divisions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DELANEY GROUP has been left with its Christies Panel Products fitted bedroom
retailer following its shopfitting division going into receivership and the
sale of its furniture division.
The directors believed that without its loss making businesses Delaney could
begin to advance again.
The shares, which were suspended last Thursday pending the announcement,
fell 1p to 8p when dealings were resumed.
Melton Medes, which holds 12 per cent of Delaney, has made a loan of Pounds
800,000 repayable at the end of this year and secured on the shares of
Christies.
Delaney called in the receiver following the collapse of negotiations for
the sale of companies in the shopfitting division - Display and Shop
Equipment, Lawn Shopfitters, Halon Electrical Contractors, Northgate
Aluminium Systems and Multiflex (MSC).
At the same time Stanley Wood and Traditional Furniture Stores, which made
up the furniture division, were sold to Mark Billings for Pounds 4. The
resulting write off was estimated at Pounds 1.15m.
The shopfitting division was blamed for many of Delaney's problems. The
furniture division reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 780,000 on sales of
Pounds 2.23m in the 11 months to November 30.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EXCEPTIONAL costs involved in fighting off Monarch Properties put Ewart
Pounds 260,000 into the red for the six months ended October 31; the interim
dividend is passed.
From turnover of Pounds 1.94m (Pounds 1.79m) this Northern Ireland-based
property developer made an operating profit of Pounds 20,000 (Pounds
104,000).
Exceptionals of Pounds 279,000 represented the cost of an extraordinary
meeting.
That was called by Mr Philip Monahan, chairman of Monarch, a private company
based in the Republic, in an attempt to oust members of the board and
replace them with two of his own nominees, 'with a view to radically
re-defining the strategic direction of Ewart.'
After its narrow defeat Monarch's 29.2 per cent holding was acquired by
Patternbread Establishment, which 'is positively committed to the further
growth of Ewart and supportive of the strategy pursued by the board', said
Mr Derek Tughan, chairman of Ewart.
He said the reduction in operating profit was entirely the result of
increased interest charges, stemming from the financing of recent investment
acquisitions and the inclusion of interest relating to the shopping centre
development at Ross's Court, now completed.
Prospects for the Laganbank development received a boost with confirmation
of government backing for the project.
Losses per share were 1.39p, against earnings of 0.44p from which an interim
dividend of 0.25p was paid.

FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Recovery at Marine Midland

<TEXT>
MARINE MIDLAND Banks, Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's US subsidiary, reported a
substantial recovery from losses for both its 1992 fourth quarter and its
results for the full-year.
The New York-based bank, which has Dollars 17.1bn (Pounds 11.3bn) in assets,
said net profits in the fourth quarter were Dollars 35.7m, compared to
losses of Dollars 23.8m in the last quarter of 1991.
For the whole of 1992, net profits were Dollars 109.2m, a significant
turnround from losses of Dollars 189.9m for 1991.
Mr James Cleave, president and chief executive, said this was the first time
Marine Midland had returned to profit for three years. He said 1992 was a
benchmark year in the bank's recovery and pledged to continue to focus on
controlling expenses, especially in light of the soft New York state
regional economy.
Fourth quarter operating expenses were Dollars 241.4m, up slightly from
Dollars 238.3m in the same period of 1991. The bank's revenues in the
quarter were Dollars 283.3m, against Dollars 258.6m a year earlier.
Bad debt provisions amounted to Dollars 3.4m in the fourth quarter, down
sharply from Dollars 41m. Provisions for the whole year were Dollars 73.2m,
down from Dollars 230m in 1991.
The bank ended 1992 with a Tier One risk-weighted capital ratio of 9.12 per
cent. The return on assets rose to 0.66 per cent in 1992, against a loss on
assets of 1.06 per cent in 1991.

<TEXT>
UNITED DISTILLERS, the spirits division of Guinness, has sold 70 regional
spirits brands in the US to Heaven Hill Distilleries, America's largest
independent family-owned spirits company.
The terms of the sale were not disclosed.
Mr Crispin Davis, managing director of United, said yesterday that the deal
formed part of the group's reorganisation strategy in the US, following the
acquisition of Glenmore Distilleries in 1991 and its merger last year with
Schenley Industries.
'By transferring ownership of these regional brands - which are in the lower
price range - to Heaven Hill, we have substantially rationalised our brand
portfolio in the US and can continue to concentrate on developing our core
brands in the spirits market,' he said.
The 'non-strategic' brands sold to Heaven Hill include JW Dant, Ezra Brooks
and Yellowstone bourbons, Philadelphia and Guckenheimer blended whiskies,
Boord's vodka and gin, and Coronet US brandy.

FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Iceland Foods to move into Littlewoods
outlets - Profits expected to rise 19% to at least Pounds 55m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Iceland Frozen Foods jumped 21p to 668p as the high street food
retailer announced a Pounds 27.5m placing to fund its move into Littlewoods
outlets and forecast a 19 per cent rise in annual profits to at least Pounds
55m.
Mr Malcolm Walker, chairman, said the move into Littlewoods reinforced
Iceland's recent transformation from freezer centre to high street food
retailer. 'Frozen food has become more about convenience food than bulk
buying,' Mr Walker said.
Analysts were encouraged by the Littlewoods deal which is expected to add
Pounds 100m to sales in a full year.
Many upgraded their forecasts for 1993 from about Pounds 63m to more than
Pounds 66m.
'Any deal that represents one year's organic growth and is done without any
cost to the balance sheet has to be applauded,' said Mr David Shriver of
County NatWest.
Iceland has agreed to take over the foodhalls in 48 of Littlewoods 127
stores, with an average floor space of 4,100 sq ft. The food group will only
pay a rent based on the turnover it achieves in those stores.
However, it will have to re-equip the food halls, at a cost expected to be
about Pounds 20m. This would be funded by the placing, which has been
underwritten by NM Rothschild &amp; Sons.
Mr Walker said Iceland had decided a placing was the most prudent option, in
light of the group's decision to keep gearing at less than 50 per cent. 'It
gives us a little comfort factor,' he said.
Investors were offered 4.3m new Iceland shares at 640p, representing about 4
per cent of the existing equity. The deal is not expected to be dilutive.
Iceland also announced that it would increase its target of store openings
for the current year from 50 to 60, for a total of about 680, including the
Littlewoods outlets. The increased openings would also be funded with
placing proceeds.
The group's aggressive expansion programme was announced amid forecasts of
record turnover of Pounds 1.04bn for the 53 weeks to January 2, against
Pounds 889m.
On a like-for-like basis, Iceland saw a 10 per cent increase in sales, while
food inflation was estimated to have been just 2 per cent. Mr Walker said
the increase in sales was primarily due to more customers walking through
the door. Individual transactions were roughly similar at about Pounds 7.50.
Chilled foods provided the group's greatest growth in 1992, increasing an
estimated 25 per cent year on year. Frozen food accounted for just over 50
per cent of sales, while basic groceries represented 22 per cent of
turnover.
The final dividend is forecast to rise by 18 per cent to 6.9p for a total of
10p. This compares with a total of 8.5p last time. Earnings per share are
estimated to be not less than 41.2p, a rise of 19 per cent. On a
fully-diluted basis the increase is 17 per cent to 37.5p.

FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: CRT shares fall on profits setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at CRT, which stands for consultancy, recruitment and
training, its areas of activity, declined from Pounds 2.61m to Pounds
689,000 in the six months to October 31. The shares fell from 100p to 888p.
Mr Karl Chapman, chief executive, said the group had been 'on the back foot'
in the period following Pounds 30m-worth of acquisitions in three years. CRT
was 'now back on the front foot' after the restructuring, reorganisation of
the business and the acquisition of the 160-strong Wetherby Training
Services chain and Convergent Communications, bought in May for a combined
Pounds 1.74m.
The group said it saw 'the next 18 months positively' and lifted the interim
dividend to 0.65p (0.575p). Earnings emerged at 0.91p (3.47p).
Mr Chapman ascribed the profits decline to a poor performance from Doctus,
the consultancy side, and the 'substantially increased second-half weighting
of the training division's profits', adding that a large proportion of the
full-year's Pounds 5.4m investment in the group, taken through the profit
and loss account, was spent in the first half.
Mr Barrie Clark, finance director, said the investment was a 'prerequisite
for the future', reckoning that within the next two years various 'standards
and kitemarks' could be obligatory. Both this and CRT's growing use of
expensive software in its 12 Pitman Training Centres would help rationalise
a 'fragmented and underdeveloped' industry.
The pre-tax outcome was knocked back by reorganisation costs of Pounds
629,000. More than 100 of CRT's 1,000 workforce were made redundant - mainly
in consultancy, where the French operation was closed, and recruitment,
where five offices were closed.
Mr Chapman said the Wetherby acquisition allowed CRT to distribute the
group's Pitman training - franchising the brand is currently being piloted.

FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: South West Water launches Pounds 35m bond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH WEST Water yesterday announced a Pounds 35m bond issue, becoming the
second water services company in a week to launch a fund raising.
Most of the money raised through the private placement will be used to pay
for Haul-Waste, the waste management business acquired last month from
English China Clays. Of the Pounds 27.5m purchase price, Pounds 25m is due
on completion, expected within a week.
The bond issue, which is redeemable in 1998 and bears interest at 8.375 per
cent, follows last week's Pounds 144.5m rights issue and other fund raising
from Wessex Water. Wessex will use Pounds 113m of the money to buy Waste
Management Ltd from NFC, the transport and logistics group.
South West holds net cash of about Pounds 80m but decided against using the
money, most of which is in short term investments, because it is earning
reasonably high rates of interest. South West, which has one of the highest
capital expenditure plans among water companies, is likely to become a net
borrower by the end of its financial year on March 31.
Mr Ken Hill, finance director, said Haul-Waste would become South West's
main waste subsidiary.

FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Medicine can come in many forms - Jane
Fuller considers whether the doubts concerning company doctors are justified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH 80,000 companies going bust last year and another 80,000 forecast to do
so this year, it is a bad time for doubt to be creeping in about the
efficacy of company doctors.
These professionals are brought in short-term to carry out the financially
essential - but difficult and unpleasant - tasks that the previous
management either shrank from or were ill suited to doing.
They close factories, axe staff, sell businesses and assets. They keep open
bank credit lines with one hand and tease new money out of institutional
investors with the other. If they succeed, they hand over the stabilised
company to new long-term managers.
But the view has gained currency that this recession is proving a bad one
for an elite group of high profile and highly paid company doctors.
Sir Lewis Robertson recently lost Lilley, the Glasgow-based contracting and
construction group, to receivership. In a long career, it was the first of
his seven rescues to fail and can be contrasted with cases from the last
recession, such as Triplex Lloyd, which are now healthy.
Mr Roy Barber saw Astra Holdings, the defence company under investigation by
the DTI, go into receivership. Shareholders in Davies &amp; Newman, under Mr
David James's care for two years, were left with nothing when it was wound
up after Dan-Air, its airline subsidiary was sold last year for Pounds 1 to
British Airways.
It is easy to see why the longest recession since the Second World War has
provided a hostile environment for corporate rescues. 'It is a difficult
time to sell property and non-core subsidiaries, and more difficult to turn
round what remains,' Mr Barber says.
Mr Trevor Swete, managing director of Postern, a corporate rescue firm,
says: 'By definition company doctors are on a tight wire. All their charges
have severe financial difficulties and one or two of those wires will
break.'
The focus on well publicised failures runs the risk of devaluing the role
outsiders can play in saving companies. This is the message of two recent
studies by firms of accountants.
In one, the insolvency arm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, formerly known as Cork
Gully, called for the reform of the 1986 Insolvency Act to foster a 'rescue
culture'.
In the other, Grant Thornton warned that many businesses risked insolvency
because they were not ready to cope with the end of recession, in particular
the need to seek extra finance. One of Grant Thornton's criticisms was that
companies showed a reluctance to seek the help of professional advisers.
The implication of both studies is that there is a clear need for company
doctoring in all its forms.
Leaving aside the up-market end of the profession - Mr James's latest fees,
for instance, are Pounds 35,000 a month (partly for office overheads) - a
great deal of remedial work is already being carried out by people who would
not describe themselves as company doctors.
One of the big lending banks says that only four or five of the 130-plus
'live work-outs' in its intensive care unit are in the hands of company
doctors.
The preferred route is to get the changes implemented by the existing
management, albeit with the banks wielding the big stick. 'They often come
to accept that if they don't do what we want, they won't have a future,
because we won't put more money in,' says the banker.
If a revamping of management is necessary, the newcomer(s) will not
generally be a short-term company doctor but long-term executives, typically
a new chief executive and/or finance director.
There are several examples of fresh management being recruited from
companies in the same sector - Mr Archie Norman (ex-Kingfisher) at Asda, the
supermarkets group, for instance.
Another option is to bring on to the board a director with a reputation for
pushing through changes such as Mr Michael Beckett, whose charges have
included Tace and Ultramar. He describes himself as a 'very independent'
non-executive director who is called upon 'to clean up the boards. In 1991 I
got rid of 27 directors'.
Even insolvency practitioners do more work related to company rescues than
receiverships, according to Mr Steve Hill, an insolvency partner at Coopers
&amp; Lybrand.
But whatever hopes are raised by the new people or the new approaches,
serious limitations remain.
Some patients will be lost. Mr Swete points out that most company doctoring
does not start until a banking covenant has been breached, putting the banks
in the driving seat.
'Generally the banks bring in a company doctor and in this situation the
shareholders have lost an effective voice,' says Mr Paul Myners, chairman of
Gartmore Investment Management.
Perhaps the lesson is that shareholders should act earlier. One
institutional investor says the best safeguard against a business becoming
company-doctor material lies in a properly constituted board. But he adds
that this is a 'counsel of perfection'.
More commonly, shareholders appear slow to act - other than by selling out
quietly. They shy away from getting together to call for change until
'disaster is at hand'. Even if the patient survives the initial financial
trauma, a company has to have orders, sales and cash flow to service its
debt and pay other creditors. In other words, many of the walking wounded
are awaiting economic recovery.
Mr Eugene Anderson, who was brought in to restructure Ferranti
International, the electronics and defence group, in 1990 after a huge fraud
was discovered, said recently it needed orders to generate cash. 'We have
bids out for about Pounds 400m of business. If we win only Pounds 100m, that
would totally transform us. We're at a very critical stage.'
Finally, it is worth pointing to the successes as well as the failures of
company doctors, although it can take years to tell whether the medicine has
really worked. Last week Stakis, with Sir Lewis Robertson as chairman and an
industry man, Mr David Michels (ex-Hilton International) as chief executive,
announced a Pounds 28m rights issue and the Pounds 50m sale of its nursing
homes division.
On a less public level, survival tips are being offered daily to
debt-strapped businesses by a raft of advisers. Mr Swete gives the example
of a company which had found a buyer for an asset, but was advised to spread
out the payments to avoid the risk of the bank taking the money and pulling
the plug.
In contrast to the priorities of a bank-appointed receiver, a company
doctor's 'primary duty is to the company; the secondary one, to whom ever
brought him in,' Mr Swete adds.
The real world dictates, however, that if the interest of the company
diverges too much from that of the bank, it will not succeed.
Banks claim that they are not trigger happy when it comes to calling in
receivers. The head of one intensive care unit says that over the past two
years only a third of the companies in that unit have gone bust.
The motives are not altruistic. 'It is a simple economic truth that
businesses are worth more intact, without taint of insolvency,' says Mr
Hill.
To avoid that taint, the more company doctoring that goes on, and the
earlier advice is sought, the smaller the final bankruptcy toll of this
recession will be.

FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Bullough declines by 60% to Pounds 8.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BULLOUGH, the office products and refrigeration group which issued a profits
warning in December, yesterday reported a 59 per cent decline in full year
profits but is maintaining its dividend despite taking 'a heavy knock' in
its French office furniture business.
After allowing for restructuring costs of Pounds 3.32m, pre-tax profits in
the year to October 31 fell to Pounds 8.54m from Pounds 20.8m in the
previous year when the outcome was boosted by Pounds 994,000 of exceptional
items.
Mr Robert Steel, managing director, blamed the Pounds 12.3m profits decline
on operating losses and restructuring costs in the office products division.
Turnover slipped by 5 per cent to Pounds 276.9m (Pounds 292.6m); earnings
per share fell to 4.45p (11.55p).
As expected the final dividend is being maintained at 4.3p making an
unchanged total for the year of 6.05p.
Turnover in the core office products division fell 12 per cent to Pounds
104.4m (Pounds 118.8m) and a Pounds 7.82m operating profit turned into a
Pounds 736,000 loss. Losses in Atal, the French office furniture company
acquired four years ago, accounted for Pounds 5.8m of the decline.
Mr Steel said Atal had had an appalling year because of falling demand and
pressure on margins. Last autumn a new management team was installed and has
introduced a Pounds 2.4m restructuring programme including accelerated job
cuts.
Among the group's other businesses, seven of the eight small companies in
the engineering division increased sales and six increased profits. Overall
the division lifted operating profits to Pounds 2.97m (Pounds 2.6m) on
turnover which grew to Pounds 33.7m (Pounds 31.2m).
Net borrowings at the end of October stood at Pounds 15.3m (Pounds 7.8m),
representing 17 per cent (9 per cent) of shareholders funds.
Looking ahead, Mr Derrick Battle, chairman, said the order book was slightly
ahead of last year and noted that the avoidance of the heavy losses in the
French office furniture business 'should lead to a useful recovery in our
overall profitability.'
COMMENT
The problems at Atal, which was acquired for some Pounds 19m in September
1988, should probably have been dealt with earlier and more firmly. But
since last autumn a more robust approach to problems at Atal has been
adopted and another 200 jobs have been cut. The absence of losses and
restructuring costs alone should be sufficient to boost group profits
significantly this year, providing there are no other nasty surprises. Cash
deposits of Pounds 13.2m should be sufficient for any small 'fill-in'
acquisitions without straining the balance sheet. Meanwhile, maintaining the
dividend has helped calm investor nerves and since December the shares have
begun to climb again. This is a recovery stock with foreign exposure. With
pre-tax profits expected to rebound to Pounds 14m or Pounds 15m this year,
producing earnings of between 7.2p and 7.8p per share, the stock is trading
on a prospective p/e of about 14.7. Accepting the risks, the shares are a
buy.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Unilever shakes up head offices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNILEVER, the multinational consumer products group, yesterday announced a
modest reduction in staff levels at its head office in London following a
review of the way the group serves its 500 operating companies worldwide.
The reorganisation, proposed last June, will involve physical transfer of
some operating company managements away from the head offices where they
have been located for historical reasons.
Staff levels will rise by a 'small' amount in the Netherlands as a result of
transfers from London.
Unilever had restricted the reorganisation by ruling out an amalgamation of
the dual head office structure, split between the Netherlands and the UK
since the 1930s. Nevertheless, the relatively small reduction in the head
count, involving less than 100 redundancies in the UK, is likely to lead to
disappointment among observers hoping the cuts would have been been deeper.
The new centre will have 1,075 staff - 675 in London and 400 in Rotterdam.
In addition, 260 jobs that support operating companies will be dispersed
from the two head offices to locations near the businesses they serve.
National managements in the UK and the Netherlands, which are currently
housed within the head office will also be separated, although they will
remain physically within the head office complexes. In the UK this will
involve 190 jobs and in Rotterdam 140 jobs.
At the end of last year Unilever's head office staff count was just short of
1,800 people.
Unilever said the new structure would 'clarify roles and responsibilities,
simplify reporting lines and bring about closer relationships between
support staff and those they serve'.
Mr John Campbell, food manufacturing analyst at NatWest Markets, said the
important decision was to separate the national and operational managements.
'There will be some who will be disappointed that the cuts were not more
dramatic,' he said. 'I suspect that was unrealistic bearing in mind the
nature of what these people do.' Unilever was the world's largest producer
of fast-moving consumer goods so the head office was unlikely to be much
smaller, unless the two headquarters were unified.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Rivals gather to woo the UK's dairy farmers: Guy de
Jonquieres on ventures being formed to take over from the Milk Marketing
Board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For 60 years, Britain's 30,000 dairy farmers have been sheltered from harsh
commercial realities by the monopoly purchasing umbrella of the Milk
Marketing Board (MMB). Now they are being wooed by the very organisations
from which the MMB was originally set up to protect them - the big dairies
and food processors.
With about 18 months to go until the MMB's statutory monopoly is abolished,
large milk users across the country are competing to line up secure supplies
once producers become free to sell to whomever they choose.
The most striking initiative was launched yesterday by Northern Foods, the
country's largest private-sector dairy group, which hopes in the next year
to persuade between 5,000 and 6,000 English and Welsh farmers to join it in
a planned co-operative venture, the Northern Milk Partnership.
The non-profit venture would supply exclusively the 2bn litres of milk,
worth Pounds 500m, which Northern buys annually for its liquid milk sales
and food-manufacturing businesses.
Though no other large users appear to be planning similar arrangements,
several are seeking to interest farmers in supplying them direct from next
year. They include the UK subsidiary of Nestle, the Swiss food group, the
Danish-owned MD Foods (formerly Associated Dairies) and the Co-operative
Wholesale Society.
The MMB, meanwhile, is urging farmers to remain loyal after its planned
re-birth as a voluntary co-operative trading under the name Milk Marque. It
hopes to supply 80 per cent of the Pounds 3bn annual milk market, a share
some observers believe it would have to achieve to cover its high costs.
Northern's initiative is widely seen as a pre-emptive strike to limit Milk
Marque's market power. The venture would account initially for 17 per cent
of the total UK milk market and aims for as much as 25 per cent in the
longer run. However, it faces a number of uncertainties.
The biggest hurdle is overcoming farmers' traditional mistrust of bigger
customers. The partnership has scored a minor public relations coup by
naming as its chairman Mr Richard Smith, a bluff Yorkshire dairy farmer with
120 cows, who resigned as an MMB director last year because he disagreed
with the Milk Marque Scheme.
To woo producers, Northern Foods is offering to buy all its needs from the
partnership's members at prices higher than those paid by Milk Marque. The
company would negotiate its contract collectively with producer
representatives and guarantee farmers regularly monthly payments.
Mr Christopher Haskins, Northern Foods' chairman, says the project is 'a
totally new concept of co-operation'. By bridging the gap between producers
and marketers, he believes it could serve as a model in other parts of
agriculture at a time when the government is seeking ways to reduce
Britain's food trade deficit of more than Pounds 5bn a year.
Mr Haskins believes the venture will prosper economically by cutting out the
MMB's bureaucracy and costs. It will have a permanent staff of only 25, to
be housed in Northern Foods' Hull headquarters, compared with the 560
employed at the MMB's head office.
The partnership will concentrate on recruiting farmers close to Northern
Foods' network of dairies. The company will transport milk directly from the
farm gate, instead of relying on the MMB to collect supplies, often from
remote parts of the country, and store them at central depots.
Northern has a reputation as a highly efficient operator, both in liquid
milk delivery and in its food-manufacturing businesses, which are leading
suppliers to Marks and Spencer. The group has stripped huge costs out of
Express Dairies since it was acquired from Grand Metropolitan last year.
However, competition is expected to reduce Northern Foods' cost advantage by
making rivals more efficient. The MMB has already announced plans to shed 60
per cent of its head office staff and is expected to restructure its charges
for milk collection to benefit farms close to dairies.
Though Northern Foods has historically paid producers about 1p per litre
more than the national average for milk, that premium may be harder to
sustain in a liberalised market. Some observers believe the desire to keep
producers loyal to the planned partnership could lead it to over-pay in the
future. That, in turn, could push up prices across the market.
On the other hand, if the venture succeeds as well as Northern Foods hopes,
some analysts think the group could face pressure from milk producers for a
share of corporate profits - and even for a direct stake in its dairy and
processing operations.
With so many uncertainties looming, other dairy groups seem likely to
hesitate before committing themselves to following Northern Foods' example.
Unigate, for instance, says that once the MMB monopoly ends it will buy milk
through whichever channel the producers favour.
MMB, meanwhile, was out to minimise the scale of the Northern Foods
challenge.
'It's not unexpected,' Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive, said yesterday. 'But
I have heard nothing that would make the planned venture more attractive
than Milk Marque. Our role in life is clear: we're there to represent
farmers. Who will represent farmers in the Northern Foods set-up?'

FT  02 FEB 93 / Moody's cuts Sweden rating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN, the heaviest borrower in the international capital markets in the
past three months, had its long-term debt rating cut yesterday.
The downgrading to Aa2 from Aa1, by Moody's Investors Service, the US credit
rating agency, comes at a difficult time for Sweden, which needs to raise
substantial further amounts internationally to finance its large budget
deficit.
The cut comes just days after Sweden launched the biggest-ever foreign bond
issue in the Japanese domestic bond, or 'Samurai', market. The Y200bn
(Pounds 1bn) issue ran into difficulty because of the aggressive pricing at
a time when the country's credit rating was already under review for
possible downgrade.
Moody's, which has had the country's rating under review since last October,
pointed to Sweden's weak economy, sizeable deterioration of public sector
finances and high level of unemployment.
'These imbalances can only be corrected gradually, and may delay a needed
recuperation of investment,' Moody's said. 'This, in turn, may hurt the
country's long-term competitiveness and creditworthiness.'
About Dollars 39bn (Pounds 25bn) worth of outstanding foreign currency debt
is affected.
However, dealers said that there was little impact on the price of the bonds
because a reduction of two notches in the country's credit rating had been
rumoured.
The move leaves Sweden in the unusual position of having conflicting ratings
from the biggest credit rating agencies. Standard &amp; Poor's, the other big US
agency, said it had no plans to downgrade Sweden from its current AAA.
Ms Anne Wibble, the Swedish finance minister, said she was not surprised by
the downgrade, as Sweden was already on the observation list.
However, she added that the decision underlined the serious Swedish economic
situation and the importance of the policy in the finance bill implying
structural reforms and measures needed to increase growth.
Sweden has almost completed its SKr230bn (Pounds 21bn) borrowing package
announced last autumn.

FT  02 FEB 93 / ICI invests Dollars 200m in US titanium plant joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries' titanium dioxide subsidiary, Tioxide Group, is
paying Dollars 200m (Pounds 132m) for a 50 per cent stake in a North
American joint venture.
The deal, one of ICI's largest single investments in recent years, is with
Kronos, a subsidiary of NL Industries of Houston, Texas. The deal gives the
British company a half-share of a 100,000 tonne-a-year chloride titanium
pigment plant in Lake Charles, Louisiana. The plant was officially opened
last October.
Simultaneously, ICI announced it was postponing the construction of a
CDollars 175m (Pounds 94.3m) plant at Becancour, Quebec, with an annual
capacity of 60,000 tonnes. By postponing the plant, ICI avoids adding to
overcapacity in the North American titanium dioxide market which is
presently suffering from low prices, reduced operating rates and poor
profitability.
ICI also announced it was shutting down part of its site at Tracy in Quebec,
with the loss of 60 jobs. The partial closure will result in the complete
elimination of waste acid pollution from the site, according to the group.
Although ICI had a government licence to discharge waste, it had recently
run foul of local municipal authorities which were calling for the plant's
closure.
The deal offers ICI immediate access to Kronos' proprietary chloride
technology for manufacturing titanium dioxide, an area in which the British
group has little experience. Chloride-based products are used in paints for
the top-coats of vehicles and high durability coatings. The alternative
technology using sulphate is used for products in inks, fibres and ceramics.
The joint venture, due to be completed during the second quarter of the
year, needs to be cleared by the Federal Trade Commission. ICI presently
imports titanium dioxide equivalent to less than 10 per cent of the US
market.
NL Industries has been suffering from the poor state of the titanium dioxide
market. It reported a net loss of Dollars 18.8m on sales of Dollars 694m
during the first nine months of last year. The titanium dioxide division's
operating income for the first nine months fell 37 per cent compared with
the same period in 1991.
ICI said the deal had no implications for UK-based titanium dioxide plants.

FT  02 FEB 93 / UK trading outlook ominous, says survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE trading outlook for UK companies remains 'ominous', with under-capacity,
cancelled orders and cash flow problems still rife, according to a survey by
Trade Indemnity, the credit insurance group.
The survey of nearly 600 companies, conducted during December 1992,
contradicts some other recent findings suggesting that industry may be
slowly moving out of recession.
'We continue to express fears that the frost may yet get the green shoots,'
Trade Indemnity said. 'There is still plenty of gloom out there and the
pessimists' views are supported by the damage being done to cash flow by
seemingly insurmountable late payments problems.'
According to Trade Indemnity, overall activity levels among Britain's
businesses are little changed. Thirty per cent of companies say they are
working at less than half capacity and most believe that immediate prospects
for any improvement are bleak.
Nearly half of the survey companies - from all sectors of the economy and
with annual turnovers ranging from well under Pounds 1m to more than Pounds
50m - do not expect any upturn in activity in the first three months of
1993.
Trade Indemnity also warned that companies remain vulnerable to any economic
upturn. Growing numbers of companies, confronted with continuing, high
levels of cancelled orders, are still reducing stocks of raw materials,
work-in-hand and finished goods, it said.
When orders start to pick up, the rate of company failures - already at
record levels - could rise further as businesses are unable to respond to
the increase in demand.
The survey also found that nearly one half of businesses with an annual
turnover of less than Pounds 1m are working below half capacity. And no
small companies reported in December that they were being paid on time, with
average payment nearly one month after the due date.
Among all companies, only 3 per cent said they were being promptly paid and
a quarter had seen a recent rise in bad debts.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Big rise forecast in growth of US manufacturing industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US manufacturing industry is poised for its fastest growth in four years, a
sharp increase in the Purchasing Managers' Index indicated yesterday.
Boosted by an increase in new orders, the index rose from 55.4 per cent in
December to 58 last month, the highest level since July 1988.
This was higher than financial markets expected and, taken with other recent
strong data, could lead economists to revise upwards their estimates of US
growth this year.
The index has been above the 50 per cent level that indicates an expanding
manufacturing sector since last October, when it registered 50.7 per cent.
The Purchasing Managers' Index, based on a monthly questionnaire to over 300
industrial companies, is regarded as a reliable barometer of trends in
manufacturing.
In a separate report yesterday, the Commerce Department said construction
spending rose 6.2 per cent last year, the biggest increase in six years.
However, spending was down 0.4 per cent in December and figures for October
and November were also revised down.
Mr Robert Bretz, a spokesman for US purchasing managers, said low levels of
corporate inventories and rising order books indicated the economy would
continue to strengthen in coming months.
If the purchasing index remained above about 53 per cent - the average for
last year - growth of real gross domestic product was likely to exceed 3 per
cent this year, he said.
Yesterday's figures follow reports last week of a 9.1 per cent increase in
new orders for durable goods between November and December and economic
growth at an annual rate of 3.8 per cent in the fourth quarter. Sales of
existing homes at the end of last year were reported at their highest level
in 13 years.
Most components of the purchasing index sent encouraging signals. The index
for new orders rose from 64.4 per cent in December to 67.2 per cent.
The index for production rose from 59.4 per cent to 64.6 per cent. However,
the index for export orders did less well, rising to 53.9 per cent against
53.3 per cent in December.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Israel to take back 100 deportees: Pressure from US prompts
reversal of policy on stranded Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ISRAEL announced last night it would take back 100 of the more than 400
Palestinians it expelled to Lebanon in December and halve the term of exile
for the remainder in a dramatic reversal of policy prompted by intense
pressure from the US.
The 396 deportees still stranded in south Lebanon, all alleged Islamic
fundamentalist militants from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, said
before the decision they would not accept any solution except full
compliance with United Nations Security Council resolution 799 calling for
the immediate return of all those expelled.
But Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, made clear the concessions
were part of what he called 'a package deal' which would ensure that the US
blocked any further action against Israel in the Council over the issue.
Mr Rabin, who until yesterday publicly refused to back down on the
deportations, said Washington had also agreed to press all parties to resume
the Middle East peace talks. The Palestine Liberation Organisation had
previously said it would not return to talks until the deportees went home.
After a special cabinet meeting in Jerusalem, Mr Rabin described the
initiative as a difficult step for the government. It originally ordered the
unprecedented expulsions to strike against Hamas, a powerful Islamic group
in the West Bank and Gaza, and the smaller Islamic Jihad group which had
both carried out a series of killings of Israeli soldiers. But the
deportations incurred overwhelming international condemnation.
'We had to face the international community, with the reality of a new
administration in the US which I believe is friendly towards Israel and we
had to create with it an infrastructure of understanding which would enable
us in the next four years to exhaust the opportunity of peacemaking,' Mr
Rabin said.
The Clinton administration had pressed hard for concessions since the
Israeli High Court approved the expulsions last week. The US wanted to avoid
a confrontation at the UN and to preserve the fragile peace process. Last
night at the UN in New York Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state,
said the move made further action on the matter by the Council unnecessary
and even counter-productive.
Mr Rabin said the returning deportees would be brought back within a few
days 'to their previous status' - a return to jail for most. The rest would
remain exiled for one year instead of two. Israel would also provide them
with humanitarian aid.
The EC last night welcomed the Israeli cabinet's compromise as a 'very good
step' which would help to put Middle East peace talks back on track, Lionel
Barber adds in Brussels.
But Mr Niels Helvig Petersen, Danish foreign minister, declined to offer
total endorsement of the plan or indicate whether it would lead to a speedy
resumption of talks to update the 1975 Israeli-EC trade agreement.

<TEXT>
Much time and thought went into Unilever's head office review as the
Anglo-Dutch giant continued to wage war on bureaucracy. But it is perhaps
surprising that the outcome was not more radical.
Unilever has devolved greater management responsibility to the operating
level. But it has preserved the cumbersome division and duplication of
functions between London and Rotterdam. Reasons of tax and history make this
a particularly knotty problem. But the incoming co-chairman, Mr Michael
Perry, had a fine opportunity to remould Unilever in a far more inventive
spirit. It is a pity he did not take it.

ICI is getting into the habit of pulling off tidy deals. Yesterday's tie-up
gives its Tioxide subsidiary a share in existing production capacity in
North America and access to valuable technology which can be deployed
elsewhere. Competitors in the overcrowded titanium dioxide market may also
be pleased, since ICI shelved plans to build its own plant in Canada. That
underlines the dilemma for ICI chemicals after the demerger of the
pharmaceuticals side. Maintaining a presence is expensive: a Dollars 200m
cash outlay in this instance. But thanks in part to over-capacity, Tioxide's
operating margins are probably less than half the 30 per cent achieved in
1989. Unlike pharmaceuticals, ICI chemicals will not enjoy a fancy rating.
Funding its ambitions with paper will be far from easy.

FT  02 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Iceland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are different ways of peeling the same banana in the food retailing
sector, as Iceland's perky trading record illustrates. By sticking to
limited-range high street stores, Iceland has long defied conventional
wisdom. Its latest decision to open 48 outlets within Littlewoods' stores
typifies its lateral thinking.
By opening an additional 60 stand-alone stores, Iceland will increase its
total trading space by about 20 per cent this year. That represents one of
the fastest growth rates in the sector, as the market has been quick to
appreciate. But with speed comes uncertainty. Opening so many new outlets
imposes great demands on the management's adaptability. Making the
Littlewoods' space sweat may also prove trickier than expected. A dedicated
food retailer should certainly squeeze better returns than Littlewoods did.
Nevertheless, it seems odd to create a combination resembling a poor
shopper's Marks and Spencer when the wisdom of such joint trading formats is
coming under scrutiny.
Iceland's share placing is also puzzling. Its progress in reducing gearing
to 41 per cent suggests it could easily have coped with the Pounds 20m cost
of fitting fridges at its Littlewoods sites. Iceland is clearly giving
itself leeway to buy further parcels of stores - with the shrinking Gateway
being the most obvious seller. But it will have to tread carefully.

FT  02 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: British Steel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Paradoxically, given the row about US duties, things may be looking up for
British Steel. This is only partly because the company has limited sales in
the US. The row appears to be concentrating minds in Europe about cutting
capacity. British Steel would benefit because its efficiency advantages
would come into play in a more evenly balanced market. With sterling weak,
it stands a better chance than its German competitors of making last month's
price rises stick. Unsurprisingly, its shares are in demand, especially
among US investors attracted by possible currency gain. Yesterday they rose
a further 5 per cent.
The bull case, though, is flawed. Detailed debate on European cutbacks has
yet to start. It would be rash to assume the UK will escape additional
burden just because British Steel has already closed Ravenscraig. Other
European countries may demand further sacrifices, especially given British
Steel's exchange rate advantage. Besides, the economic downturn in Europe
hardly bodes well for demand. Cheap imports from eastern Europe continue to
depress prices.
British Steel is unlikely to revisit its earnings peak of 28.2p in the year
to March 1990, not least because it no longer has net cash in its balance
sheet. Investors cannot expect 8.75p dividends again. Last year's reduced
dividend of 4.5p might be sustainable in the medium term. On a presumed
yield of 6 per cent, shares would have a cruising altitude of around 100p
against 77p last night. Patience will be required. British Steel would need
profits of above Pounds 200m to cover such a dividend twice. Even if all
goes well in Europe, the company may not be back in profit for another
couple of years.

<TEXT>
It does not say much for the government's credibility that investors
apparently prefer to believe the Sunday press on interest rates than
official word from Downing Street. Strenuous denials from Number 10 could do
nothing to dissuade the equity market from the view that rates are heading
lower. Thanks to further slippage in the pound, overseas earners led the
equity market higher. But handsome gains in interest rate and
inflation-sensitive sectors - such as banks and property - confirm a strong
belief in easier money. Only a poor performance from Glaxo and Wellcome
prevented the FT-SE 100 from testing its all-time high.
Whether investors are right to view the government's credibility gap with
such equanimity is another matter. A lower exchange rate is doubtless part
of the government's scheme to help fund the public sector borrowing
requirement and promote an export-led recovery. But that is no easy outcome
to orchestrate. Sterling's fall could get out of hand, especially when
policy is in the hands of a government blown this way and that by short-term
policy considerations.
Foreign currency borrowing would at least signal intent to intervene if
necessary. That might help control the exchange rate as well as fund the
PSBR. Lower German interest rates and a weakening D-Mark might eventually
help avert a sterling crisis. But without a clear framework for monetary
policy - let alone an explicit exchange rate target - the government might
still have to tighten before it or the equity market would like.

FT  01 FEB 93 / International Company News: PolyGram in UK video purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLYGRAM, the music company 80 per cent owned by Philips of the Netherlands,
has bought the UK operations of Vision Video from General Electric Capital
of the US.
The acquisition of the company, which sells videos to retailers, makes
PolyGram the UK's leading supplier of videos for the 'sell-through' market,
ahead of the BBC.
Vision Video was originally part of Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group, but
has had several owners since.
PolyGram is believed to be paying Fl 10m (Dollars 5.5m) for the company,
mostly through the assumption of debt.
According to the Gallup market research and polling organisation, PolyGram
last year took 7.7 per cent of the UK market in 'sell-through' videos in
value terms. 'Sell-through' involves customers buying, rather than renting
films. Vision Video had a 4.9 per cent market share. The combined total
would put the enlarged group ahead of the BBC, which was the 1992 market
leader with a 10.5 per cent share.

FT  01 FEB 93 / International Company News: Philips suspends plans to
produce HDTV televisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, is suspending plans to produce for
market televisions using High-Definition Television technology (HDTV).
The move is the result of the UK government's decision in December last year
to block a European Community Ecu500m (Dollars 412m) funding programme to
develop and market HDTV.
Ms Angelique Hoogakker, a company spokeswoman, said yesterday that because
there were no programmes on the horizon for the European HDTV standard
HD-Mac, the company felt it was pointless to produce HDTV-Mac televisions.
'We will complete the research and development of the HDTV-Mac set but we
will not start to produce them until there is a firm indication that there
will be programmes.
'The whole thing is dependent on money becoming available for the action
plan to back production of such programmes,' said Ms Hoogakker.
Mr Henk Bodt, head of Philips' consumer electronics division, said that to
push ahead with HDTV-Mac production would be like introducing a car on to
the market when there was no petrol available.
Philips said yesterday that once it had completed HDTV research, it would
focus on wide-screen television technology.
Full development of HDTV-Mac was to form one of three strands of the Dutch
company's drive to capture increased share in consumer electronics, the
others being CD-I compact discs and DCC audio tape. Philips has not paid a
dividend for two years, and has made some 50,000 redundancies since 1990.

FT  01 FEB 93 / The tide turns against another corporate Titan: Alan
Friedman analyses the hasty Amex boardroom departure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE board of directors of American Express, the troubled US travel and
financial services group, will meet today to discuss the election of a new
chairman, following the surprise resignation of Mr James Robinson at the
weekend.
It is understood that Mr Richard Furlaud, a board member and former
president of Bristol-Myers Squibb, the drugs company, may be named as
interim non-executive chairman.
Mr Robinson, who has run American Express for 15 years, said on Saturday he
would sever all ties with the company by February 22. He will resign as
group chairman and will also give up his new positions as chairman and chief
executive of Shearson Lehman Brothers, the loss-making brokerage and
investment banking subsidiary.
'In this environment, with all the attention focused on management problems
at IBM, Westinghouse and other major corporations, my staying at American
Express would leave Harvey (Golub) and the company encumbered by issues that
have nothing to do with reality - and for what purpose?' Mr Robinson's
statement said. The choice of a successor at Shearson is expected to take
several weeks.
But Mr Robinson, 57, began last week by turning the tables on those in Wall
Street who had demanded his resignation in the wake of heavy card losses and
a share price slump. By the weekend Mr Robinson, faced by angry
shareholders, recognised he had to go.
In September a group of American Express directors, including Mr Rawleigh
Warner, the former Mobil chairman, insisted that Mr Robinson prepare to
resign as chairman and chief executive.
The prime reason for the push was the obvious failure of Mr Robinson's 1980s
strategy of trying to construct a financial services supermarket by way of
an expansion that at various stages included plastic cards, travel services,
the Shearson Lehman brokerage and investment banking business, private
banking, cable television and insurance.
Mr Robinson's foremost adviser in his boardroom troubles has been Mrs Linda
Robinson, his wife, an ambitious public relations executive.
His strategy was to put a brave face on his coming resignation as chief
executive, denying he was being forced out. By last Monday he had persuaded
the board to install Mr Harvey Golub, his chief deputy, as chief executive.
But what really surprised American Express shareholders, however, was that
Mr Robinson last Monday not only salvaged his job as chairman, but also
pushed aside close friends and had himself named chairman and chief
executive of Shearson, the loss-making subsidiary. Among those pushed aside
was Mr Howard Clark, Jr, the Shearson chairman whose father - Mr Howard
Clark Sr. - was Mr Robinson's predecessor at American Express and who had
himself turned against Mr Robinson in recent weeks.
Although Mr Robinson said he was not available to be interviewed, close
associates say both he and his wife perceived Shearson as his comeback
vehicle, or may have hoped to restore it to profitability and eventually buy
it from American Express. Mrs Robinson, in turn, has been dubbed the 'Lady
Macbeth' of American Express by the US media.
The opposition to Mr Robinson's tenure at American Express intensified
immediately after it was announced last Monday that he would stay on. At the
same time the company disclosed nearly halved 1992 earnings and figures for
its core Travel Related Services (TRS) division that showed a 75 per cent
crash in profits between 1990 and 1992.
By last Tuesday investors had dumped American Express stock in trading that
topped three times the normal volume. Within 24 hours the selling had wiped
more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m), or 8 per cent, off the company's market
capitalisation.
Analysts doubted Mr Golub's claim that he was in charge, viewing him as
beholden to Mr Robinson. By Wednesday three board directors, including Mr
Warner, had quit American Express, following Mr Robinson's apparent victory.
It did not help Mr Robinson's image that as directors were resigning on
Wednesday night he was celebrating his wife's birthday at a lavish and
socially notable party in New York's East Village.
On Thursday Mr Golub faced an open rebellion from some institutional
shareholders who told him Mr Robinson was now proving an albatross to the
company, dragging down morale, image and the share price.
By Friday it was rumoured that Mr Richard Furlaud, a director and the former
president of Bristol-Myers Squibb who has been a key player in the boardroom
drama, had become concerned about possible shareholder lawsuits. .
Mr Robinson remained defiant even on Saturday afternoon, when he finally
announced he would sever all ties with American Express.
He dismissed as 'a big misperception' the idea that his carrying on as
chairman of the group would impinge on Mr Golub's ability to act as an
independent chief executive. He replied to Wall Street's overwhelming vote
against him by railing against 'unnecessary confusion in the minds of some
investors and the press'. And he claimed that 'the good of the company has
always been and continues to be my primary and overriding concern'.
Now American Express faces more disarray and insiders say it will be up to
Mr Golub and what remains of the board to restore a semblance of stability,
make new appointments and then get on with turning the group around.
Shearson - alone among big US securities firms - suffered heavy losses in
1992. American Express must meanwhile face credit losses and its steady loss
of market share and customers.
The future management direction of American Express is likely to see more
tough measures by Mr Golub to reduce losses at the troubled Optima credit
card division and to re-launch other card products and seek cost savings in
the TRS division and at Shearson. It is not inconceivable that Shearson will
eventually be sold.
In broader terms Mr Robinson's downfall, coming just five days after he had
pulled off the most dramatic counter-coup seen in years in corporate
America, is notable among the recent string of top-level management
upheavals at blue-chip companies such as IBM, General Motors and
Westinghouse.
The reasons are twofold. Firstly, Mr Robinson was among the last of the
quintessentially 1980s corporate Titans.
His departure - more than others - is another sign that the mind-set of the
past decade is over.
Secondly, his departure reinforces the growing trend toward greater
shareholder democracy in America. It suggests no chairman and chief
executive should believe himself to be invincible or unaccountable.
The revolution at American Express is thus both a cautionary tale and a
potentially salutory lesson for corporate America. The next few months will
show whether or not the company can profit from the pain.

Mr Christopher Rodrigues, chief executive of Thomas Cook, said selective use
of statistics was seriously under-estimating the degree of concentration
that would occur in the holiday tour market if the merger went through.
In December, Owners Abroad and Cook announced a tie-up which will give
Owners increased access to the Cook retail chain and some of its products.
In return, Cook will take a 10 per cent stake in Owners Abroad.
Airtours has argued that the combined group's total market share would be 25
to 27 per cent. Owners Abroad says it would be about 30 per cent. In a
submission to the OFT last week, Mr Rodrigues argued that some popular
destinations would be dominated to a far greater extent by the enlarged
Airtours and Thomson, the market leader.
To the Balearics, for instance, the two companies would have 74 per cent of
the market; to Florida, they would have 44 per cent; to Turkey 85 per cent;
to the Canary Islands 76 per cent; and to Malta 61 per cent.
'My position is that the public position is sufficiently vulnerable that it
(a referral) must be considered,' Mr Rodrigues said. 'The OFT has to say to
itself there appears to be a serious possibility that this merger could
change the basis of competition.'
Last year Cook's share of the retail market fell from 11 per cent to 9 per
cent, according to Mr Howard Klein, chairman of Owners Abroad. That position
was being reversed after mistakes a year ago when 'pricing . . . was not
communicated as well as it should have been', according to Mr Rodrigues.
He denied Cook would be under pressure in travel retailing if Airtours
takeover went ahead and said: 'Thomas Cook is not known for sitting on its
hands.'
The Consumers' Association and the Association of Independent Tour Operators
are among those calling for a referral. Airtours argued there have been no
significant structural changes in the industry since 1990 when the MMC
cleared Thomson's bid for Horizon Holidays.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THOMAS COOK, the travel agency and financial services group, has added its
weight to calls for the Office of Fair Trading to recommend a referral to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission of Airtours' hostile bid for rival
Owners Abroad.
Mr Christopher Rodrigues, chief executive of Thomas Cook, said selective use
of statistics was seriously under-estimating the degree of concentration

FT  01 FEB 93 / Pits facing closure will be offered for sale, says coal
chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW possibility of reprieve for some of the 31 threatened coal pits
emerged yesterday as Mr Neil Clarke, the British Coal chairman, said that
any which would still be closed under the government's revised scheme would
be offered for sale.
His statement came as Mr John Major and senior ministers prepared to
finalise proposals for the draft white paper on energy in the light of
Friday's report by the cross-party trade and industry committee of MPs.
The white paper, due to be discussed by cabinet on Thursday, must take
account of the committee's plans to increase the annual market for
deep-mined British coal by 16m tonnes or more for five years at a cost of
about Pounds 500m.
Mr Clarke told The Money Programme on BBC television: 'If they are going to
be closed and people wish to operate them, as far as I am concerned they
will be offered for sale to those who wish to operate them.'
Such a move would not take the pits off the political agenda completely,
however, as private mining companies might well seek redundancies or new
working practices in order to cut costs. Estimates of how many pits would be
saved if the committee's recommendations were adopted go as high as 25,
although others have been more cautious in their assessment. Mr Keith
Hampson, a Tory committee member, suggested the report's plans could save 13
to 17 of the pits.
At Westminster, opinion appears to be hardening that, in order to avoid
risking defeat in the Commons, the government needs to raise its own
proposals of expanding the market for coal by about 12m tonnes, to save
around half the threatened pits.
Tory MPs on all sides of the argument have intensified their lobbying of Mr
Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary.
He has been holding meetings with individual MPs, but in the run-up to
publication - expected around the middle of this month - he will be seeing
lobbies such as the Conservative coal group. He is also likely to meet the
executive of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers.
Mr Heseltine should resign over the pit closure row, according to 53 per
cent of those questioned for a Mori survey for the Coalfield Communities
Campaign, an all-party association of coalfield local authorities.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When it comes to tackling the challenge at IBM, there is one man who'll be
sure the right candidate for the job is Northern Telecom's just departed
chief executive, Paul Stern. That man is Paul Stern.
Having stepped down from the Canadian telecommunications group at 54, he is
still young enough to oversee the protracted turnround Big Blue may need. He
is also an American, with computer industry experience as the first
president of Unisys. What's more, his success in broadening Northern's
horizons is undeniable.
On the other hand - as witness his red Ferrari and the title of his book
about his career, Straight to the Top - he is self-assured to a fault.
Indeed, some of Northern's big customers as well as fellow-directors there
are far from sorry to see him go.

FT  01 FEB 93 / US group to run BhS data processing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLOTHING and housewares retailer, BhS, is turning over its data
processing operations to a US computing services company in a deal that will
constitute one of the biggest facilities management contracts in Europe.
Computing Sciences Corporation of the US will take over BhS's data
processing centres, computers and 120 data processing staff.
A few BhS computing staff will remain to monitor developments.
The deal is worth about Pounds 10m a year over 10 years and is expected to
save BhS (formerly British Home Stores) a minimum of Pounds 33m over the
term of the contract.
In an unusual development, the two companies plan jointly to market data
processing services and software systems to other companies.
Mr Simon Hughes, BhS logistics director, said the relationship with CSC was
more of a partnership than a commercial contract. The aim was not simply to
save money but to ally the company with a world-class computer group capable
of developing the most advanced technology.
CSC will be responsible for every aspect of BhS's computing operations,
including the management of its computerised cash registers, electronic
transmission of information to suppliers, management and accounting systems,
personal computers and its data transmission network.
Facilities management or 'outsourcing' of computing oper-ations is becoming
increasingly popular with companies and organisations in the public sector
as they seek to cut costs and concentrate on core business.
BhS, with 130 high street stores and annual sales of more than Pounds 600m,
is making a strong comeback after some years of stagnation and falling
profits as part of the Storehouse conglomerate.
CSC in the US has an outsourcing deal with General Dynamics worth Dollars
3bn.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Taikichiro Mori, Tokyo developer: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Taikichiro Mori, the Japanese property developer and one of the world's
richest men, died on Saturday, aged 88.
Mr Mori, who built up an empire through development of more than 80 of
Tokyo's most prestigious office buildings, amassed a fortune estimated at
Dollars 13bn in 33 years.
Control of the group, Mori Building, is expected to pass to Mr Mori's second
son, Mr Minoru Mori. It is understood Mr Mori junior was made president of
the company at a board meeting shortly after his father's death.
Mr Taikichiro Mori, ran a conservative financial policy, eschewing the
rampant property speculation which spread through Tokyo during the bubble
economy years of the late 1980s. However, it is thought that the group has
not escaped the fall-out from the property market's collapse. Tokyo is
facing an unprecedented glut of unsold office space as developments planned
during the 1980's are completed.
Mr Taikichiro Mori became involved in his father's property business in 1959
at the age of 55, just as Japan's economic recovery from the second world
war was gathering momentum. In the following 33 years he was largely
responsible for the remaking of Tokyo as his large office buildings replaced
the city's traditional clutter of narrow lanes crowded with small shops,
workshops and houses.
Despite his great wealth he maintained a modest lifetsyle - he neither drank
nor smoked.
In spite of his traditional personal values he was an avowed modernist as
far as Tokyo was concerned. One of his most treasured projects is the Ark
Hills high-technology office building in central Tokyo.
He began work on the scheme more than 20 years before when he purchased the
first lot of land to make the redevelopment possible.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Monday Interview: Moderate discovers passion - Jozsef
Antall, prime minister of Hungary, talks to Nicholas Denton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The image of Jozsef Antall with a sabre in his hand tests plausibility. A
pen or piece of chalk, perhaps, would better fit his serious demeanour,
didactic style and earlier career as a teacher.
But the political duellist in the prime minister revealed himself at last
week's congress of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the conservative party
whose victory in the 1990 elections ended Communist rule. A challenge by
ultra-nationalists to Mr Antall's moderate leadership inspired a rhetorical
flurry by the premier that was quite out of character: 'If they draw swords,
and stand against the policies of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the
coalition and the government, then en garde]'
Mr Antall, facing the most daunting political struggle in his nearly three
years in power, seemed to relish the fresh adversity. The prime minister's
powerful oratory was all the more remarkable for his physical frailty
resulting from periodic chemotherapy for cancer.
The prime minister summoned up the courage to stand up to Istvan Csurka, the
nationalist writer and leader of the far-right Volk-national wing of the
party. It took a skilful mix of confrontation, humour and appeals for unity
to keep the far right to a quarter of the seats in the powerful party
presidium, the governing body elected by congress delegates. The stakes were
high - Mr Antall threatened to resign if the vote did not go his way.
In the end, Mr Antall appears to have turned the tide on a far-right
movement whose advance had seemed inexorable since Mr Csurka shattered
Hungary's political peace last summer with a virulently nationalist and
anti-Semitic manifesto. The victory of the party's moderate wing has a wider
significance because Hungary, bordered by countries with large and sometimes
oppressed ethnic Hungarian minorities, has been identified by foreign policy
observers as a candidate for Europe's next troublespot.
Mr Antall's instinct for political survival was aroused by Mr Csurka's
suggestion on the eve of the congress that the Forum would be better off
without the prime minister. But the gathering also offered Mr Antall the
opportunity to nudge the party back towards the political centre, in an
attempt to broaden its flagging popular support in time for the 1994
elections.
Recent opinion polls put the Forum's support at a humiliating 8 per cent.
This reflects the economy's contraction by nearly by a fifth over past three
years. In his own defence, the prime minister speaks contemptuously of the
'demagogues and charlatans' who have capitalised on the unfocused discontent
felt by the many Hungarians and east Europeans who are worse off since
communism's demise.
But also driving Mr Antall has been a strongly expressed devotion to the
stability and integrity of Hungary's new democracy. 'For that I have made a
vow and I give my life,' Mr Antall says with a feeling that contrasts with
his usually colourless style. Speaking in his cavernous office in Hungary's
neo-Gothic parliament building, he promises resolve in the face of racist
rhetoric and the violence which might follow: 'If after words come the acts,
then while words are uttered, we must stand against words; and when acts
come, we must stand against acts.'
The parliamentary opposition asks why Mr Antall did not speak out in such
unequivocal terms immediately after Mr Csurka's call last summer for all
true Hungarians to rise up against the conspiracy of Jews, communists,
liberals, journalists and international bankers, which he claimed was
smothering the country's national revival.
'When should somebody stand up? That is the question,' Mr Antall accepts. A
close adviser better explains the prime minister's reluctance: 'Antall is a
political animal and he knows that Csurka has 5 to 10 per cent support in
the population. We don't need Csurka but we need Csurka's votes to stay in
power.'
It has to be said also that Mr Antall shares many of Mr Csurka's prejudices
 -against journalists and communists in particular. But there are limits to
his willingness to accommodate the far right. 'There is a line which one
cannot step across,' says the prime minister. Indeed, whether or not Mr
Antall should have acted earlier, his forceful defence of moderation last
week is a rarity in the current political atmosphere in eastern Europe,
where intolerant nationalism has been rising ominously.
His earlier reticence may be explained in part of the fact that a desire for
political peace - within his party, his three-party coalition government and
the country - has been his first priority since taking office in 1990.
'Nothing can succeed, there can be no justice, no compensation (for property
expropriated by the communists), no economic growth, there can be nothing if
there is no stability,' Mr Antall says.
The advantages of Mr Antall's conciliatory approach have been evident. In
contrast with much of central and eastern Europe, Hungary enjoys a
relatively calm political environment. And the country, with only 10m
inhabitants, has attracted over Dollars 4.5bn in foreign investment since
1988, half of the total for the whole of eastern Europe.
Stability has thus come to look increasingly precious to Hungarians with the
end of the 'age of illusion', as Mr Antall calls the brief euphoria that
followed the end of communism. So too has Mr Antall's international stature
grown - his stolid message finds foreign listeners more receptive as their
expectations for the speed of change in eastern Europe become more
realistic.
Mr Antall's stature is also a matter of political longevity. It says much
about eastern Europe that, after just 2 1/2 years in power, he can call
himself the 'doyen' of the region's leaders and its longest-serving prime
minister.
If Mr Antall is one of the exceptions that proves the rule for east European
politicians, then it is partly because Hungary's Communist regime was
uniquely liberal at least in its later years.
Mr Antall, unlike most of his counterparts in neighbouring countries, and
many of them in Hungary itself, emerged neither particularly compromised,
embittered, nor deprived of access to developments in the world outside. Nor
did he ever cease to consider himself European. 'It is just like patriotism
 -there is indeed a European identity.'
European integration is a question to which Mr Antall has given much
thought. He marked his victory in the 1990 elections with a call for
Hungary's eventual membership in the European Community. He has no fear that
the country's entry would submerge its national identity again so soon after
it had cast off the communist shroud. 'Europe is Europe in that it is made
up of nations with individual identities.'
It is Mr Antall's commitment to the integration of Europe however which
makes him most resentful about what he views as the west's betrayals.
Hungary has felt cheated, he says. The western powers took away two-thirds
of Hungary's territory and left over 3m Hungarians on the other side of the
new borders in the 1920 Trianon peace treaty; they abandoned of Hungary to
Soviet occupation in 1945 and again after the revolution of 1956.
And now Mr Antall feels the west does not care about eastern Europe's
struggling new democracies. 'People feel that again they are being treated
as residents of the last chicken pen in Europe.' Particular bitterness is
reserved for the lack of western resolve, speed and co-ordination in dealing
with the war that rages just over Hungary's southern border in the former
Yugoslavia.
The conflict touches a Hungarian nerve because 400,000 ethnic Hungarians in
the Serbian province of Vojvodina may be the next in line for ethnic
cleansing; and the 2m Hungarians in Romania and 600,000 in Slovakia have
also become the focus of tensions.
Mr Antall thinks that the west should involve itself in eastern Europe not
just out of morality, but out of self-interest too. 'It is not by chance
that both world wars broke out in this region, from Sarajevo to Danzig. The
danger zone is precisely this area which is always neglected.'
It is another gloomy scenario to feed the prime minister's profound and very
Hungarian pessimism. Not even after the Forum's 1990 election victory did Mr
Antall rejoice, nor even after his bravura performance at the congress a
week ago. 'It is not the most comfortable thing to be a Hungarian
politician,' he says with a rare, weary smile.

FT  01 FEB 93 / The importance of being Hillary: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They might have been more honest. For most of the campaign Mrs Hillary
Clinton went into 'cookie-baking' mode, gazing adoringly at her husband and
promising to be a traditional first lady. But within hours of the
inauguration, the old assertive Hillary had reappeared, complete with maiden
name and headband. Husband Bill announced that she was taking charge of a
presidential taskforce on health-care reform and she promptly set up shop in
the west wing of the White House - the domain reserved for senior (and
usually male) policy advisers.
This is not an honorific title. Health-care reform is the nation's most
pressing domestic challenge. Mrs Clinton will lead a group that includes the
most powerful cabinet officials, such Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury
secretary, and Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director. After the announcement,
Mrs Clinton hit the White House phones and spent six hours introducing
herself to congressional leaders. Mr Dan Rostenkowski, the wily chairman of
the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, said she appeared to have 'both
hands on the throttle'.
Mrs Clinton will be easily the most powerful first lady in history (with the
possible exception of Mrs Woodrow Wilson, who gained great influence
following her husband's stroke). Indeed, her remit seems likely to extend to
most aspects of domestic policy. Eyebrows were raised when Mr Clinton chose
Ms Carol Rasko, an aide from Arkansas, as his domestic policy adviser. She
lacked the stature of Mr Robert Rubin and Mr Anthony Lake, her counterparts
in economic and foreign affairs. But then stature was not important - Ms
Rasco and other domestic policy aides will in effect defer to Mrs Clinton,
who is emerging as the chief domestic strategist. Some are already referring
to her as a 'domestic prime minister.'
Mrs Clinton's executive role reflects the political coming of age of women.
She arrives in a Washington where her contemporaries occupy previously
unimaginable positions. Women now fill both Senate seats from California,
the most populous state. The president has a female chief economist and
wanted (and may still get) a female attorney general.
Hillary is as well-qualified academically as Bill (both are graduates of the
Yale Law School) and, as a top Arkansas lawyer, earned five or six times
Bill's meagre salary as governor. She advised him throughout his career, to
the point of chairing the committee that devised the educational reforms now
regarded as his main achievement in Arkansas. As an equal partner for so
many years, her desire for hands-on responsibility is understandable.
Even so, her new position raises questions. After John F Kennedy made his
brother Robert attorney general, anti-nepotism laws were passed to prevent
the appointment of close relatives to powerful positions. By not paying his
wife, Mr Clinton has dodged these constraints. Yet people seem oddly
reluctant to criticise Hillary's role, perhaps because greater
responsibility for women is seen as so obviously a good thing. Yet if Mr
Clinton had put a brother or favourite uncle in charge of health-care
reform, all hell would have broken loose.
Health-care reform is a make or break issue for Mr Clinton. If he cannot
control the dizzying escalation of costs, he has no hope of cutting the
structural budget deficit; and if he cannot extend coverage to the 35m
Americans without insurance, his standing as a domestic reformer will be
nil. So it made sense to turn to somebody he trusted - and somebody who
could wield near presidential authority as a deal-maker. But why not turn to
Mr Al Gore, the official vice-president? He is as capable as Mrs Clinton and
better connected in Washington.
Mrs Clinton's appointment also sends unfortunate signals about the direction
of domestic policy. Perhaps unfairly, she is seen as more of an
'unreconstructed' liberal (left-leaning) Democrat than her husband. This
partly reflects her links with groups such as Ms Marian Wright Edelman's
Children's Defence Fund, a powerful Washington lobby that opposes the tough
restrictions on welfare payments publicly advocated by Mr Clinton. Mrs
Clinton chaired the CDF for years and insisted that her successor - Ms Donna
Shalala - be made health secretary. Mrs Clinton is also thought to have
vetoed the appointment of conservative Democrats to important domestic
policy positions.
The fear is that a 'Marian-Hillary-Donna' axis will insist on the effective
socialisation of American health care, with universal insurance cover backed
up with strict controls on the price and volume of medical services. Mr
Clinton, it is felt, would have more willing to experiment with
'market-based' reforms that offer a more limited role for public
bureaucracies. But it is possible, of course, that Bill and Hillary (Billary
as some call them) have always agreed on policy; Bill just had to be more
careful about what he said.
The US has had almost as many different types of presidencies as there have
been presidents. In an age when power is increasingly distributed equally
between the sexes, a husband and wife working in harness can arguably lead
the country more effectively than either spouse alone. The pity is that the
electorate was not asked more explicitly to support such an intriguing
innovation.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Cracks in the franc fort: Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The renewed wave of currency speculation which battered the French franc and
the Irish punt last week was a sharp reminder that the European Monetary
System (EMS) is not yet out of trouble. The central question is the future
of the franc; for if the franc were to be forced out of the exchange rate
mechanism, the heart of the European Monetary System would have
disintegrated, and the credibility of the EC's target for economic and
monetary union, already damaged by the explosion of Black Wednesday, would
be holed below the water line.
Many people no doubt expect the franc to come in for repeated speculative
attacks right up to the French general elections in March. The markets are
evidently unpersuaded that the Socialist government, which is facing a
calamitous defeat at the ballot box, has the political strength to stand by
its franc fort policy, with its punishingly high real interest rates.
By contrast, the incoming conservative government will have a record
majority in the national assembly; what is more, all their heavy hitters on
economic policy have solemnly endorsed the franc fort policy, including
former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of the centre-right UDF grouping,
former finance minister Edouard Balladur of the Gaullist RPR party, and
former prime minister Raymond Barre. So if the French authorities can hold
the line until the second round of voting on March 28, the franc may be in
the clear.
This scenario may be dangerously misconceived. For the dynamic of the
political situation in France means that the prospective change of
government could trigger more speculation against the franc, not less.
Recent polls suggest the UDF and the Gaullists will between them achieve a
record majority, with perhaps more than 400 seats in the 577-seat assembly.
Such a big increase almost inevitably means a disproportionate increase in
the number of conservative Euro-sceptics, especially among the Gaullists.
Last year half the Gaullists in the assembly, and all the Gaullist senators,
voted to have the Maastricht treaty thrown out; after March 28 we must
assume that the anti-Maastricht contingent will be substantially larger.
By rights, the conservatives should be elated at the prospect of their
smashing victory. In fact, they seem apprehensive at the difficulty of the
situation they will inherit. Intellectually, their leaders are committed to
a continuation of the present economic and exchange-rate policy. But they
know that one reason for the prospective rout of the present government is
precisely the franc fort policy: the Socialists promised that it would bring
low inflation and sound growth, but so far it has delivered much more of the
first than of the second.
In other words, the political mixture after March 28 will be inherently
volatile; the match which could make it explode will be the struggle for the
1995 presidential elections, which will become intense immediately after the
parliamentary elections.
In the first instance this will be a struggle inside the conservative camp,
between Gaullist leader Jacques Chirac and UDF leader Giscard d'Estaing.
Each of them is starting to stake a claim to be prime minister after March,
as a vital spring-board for the presidency; each will seek to mark out an
attractive and distinctive platform, which must include policies designed to
promote economic growth and reduce unemployment.
On character grounds, Chirac is the more likely of the two to break ranks
with the existing franc fort policy. Giscard has for many years been
publicly committed to the objective of Emu, but Chirac has few hard and fast
political principles, he is a natural demagogue, and he may feel strong
pressures to pander to the populist and nationalist wing of his party.
Mr Chirac would not inevitably prefer to abandon the franc fort policy. By
March the Bundesbank may have eased interest rates, and the French economy
may be recovering. But unemployment will still be 3m, and it will take a lot
of growth to bring it down. The Socialists do not have a voluntary option of
abandoning the franc fort so long as Francois Mitterrand is president; but
it must become a debatable alternative strategy for a conservative
government with a 200-seat majority.
The outlook helps explain recent waves of speculation. If a new French
government could decide to change policy, it makes sense to bet on that
change in advance. It also explains press reports that the French and German
governments are thinking of an accelerated move towards monetary union by an
inner core of states.
The president of the Bundesbank has already poured cold water on this idea,
but in any case it seems improbable that this pre-emptive action could take
the form of a very rapid move to monetary union. The Germans would not
surrender their monetary policy except to an independent European central
bank, and that could not be set up in a hurry; and France could not formally
surrender monetary policy to the Bundesbank. So if Paris and Bonn fear that
their present monetary arrangements may become unsustainable, they need to
look around for alternative political initiatives to ensure that any
derailing of the EMS does not cause wider damage to the broad thrust of
European integration.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Cause of concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS will be keeping a close watch on events inside the European exchange
rate mechanism this week following the weekend devaluation of the Irish
punt, writes James Blitz.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank's vice President, said at the weekend that
he hoped the 10 per cent devaluation of the Irish currency, the largest in
the system's history, would bring renewed calm inside the ERM.
Finance Ministry officials in Ireland were also hoping that the country's
banks would bring down wholesale and retail rates of lending in the next few
days.
The market could view the Irish devaluation as an isolated event, which was
principally triggered by the punt's overvaluation against sterling rather
than the D-Mark. They may decide not to put pressure on the other weaker
currencies in the system, the Danish krone and French franc. However, Mr
Avinash Persaud, a currency economist at UBS Phillips and Drew, said
yesterday that the Irish devaluation should cause concern.
'This is the first low inflation country with a big current account surplus
to devalue,' he said. 'The market needs to ask itself whether it is now
targetting countries with high unemployment as devaluation candidates. If
that is the new mentality, the franc and krone will soon come under
pressure.'
The Bank of France's money market operations, today and on Thursday, will be
scrutinised lest the authorities raise official interest rates.
Three-month francs were trading at 13 1/4 per cent on Friday night, 125
basis points above the official overnight lending rate. Tomorrow's
Bundesbank announcement of the rate at which it will offer repurchase
agreements in its weekly money market operations will be closely
scrutinised.
The German central bank holds a council meeting on Thursday, although few
analysts anticipate a cut in official rates.

FT  01 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Ecu activity could spark primary sector
revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Ecu bond market is staging a comeback. The return of two European
governments to the Ecu market, announced last week, boosted hopes that the
recent recovery in secondary market prices will be followed by a revival in
primary market activity.
At its first auction of Ecu bonds since Denmark's rejection of the
Maastricht treaty sent the market into a downward spin last June, the French
government last week sold Ecu710m (Dollars 585.5m) of 10-year notes,
exceeding the indicated size of the transaction. Meanwhile, the UK, which
was forced to cancel its last Ecu Treasury note auction scheduled for
October, will issue Ecu500m of three-year notes on Tuesday.
Other prestigious borrowers could soon return to the market.
The European Investment Bank, which directly on-lends the funds it raises in
the capital markets, had noted a decline in demand for Ecu funding from its
borrowers, but 'clients are starting to ask for Ecu again,' according to Mr
Philippe Marchat, director of finance and treasury at the EIB. Consequently,
the bank is likely to return to the Ecu market in the next few months.
In addition, the European Community is planning to fund part of its Ecu8bn
balance-of-payments loan to Italy in the Ecu bond market, and Belgium is
considering reviving plans for issuing an Ecu-denominated programme.
But the Ecu bond market, which once had no trouble attracting top quality
sovereign and supranational borrowers, has lost some of its charms. It has
made good progress towards recovery, but is still in a fragile condition and
would not be able to absorb the very large issues which can now be placed in
the D-Mark or dollar markets.
Further, for many borrowers, funding levels no longer appear attractive. For
example, France, one of the earliest sponsors of the market, is committed to
a target of raising 15 per cent of its funding in the Ecu market. But the
Ecu market is no longer a cheaper source of funding than the French franc
government bond market. The new French government Ecu OATs launched last
week yield 8.16 per cent, nearly a quarter of a point more than French franc
government bonds.
For other countries, such as Italy and Spain, the Ecu still offers cheaper
funding than domestic markets. But they can also raise cheaper funds, and in
larger size, in the D-Mark sector.
Nevertheless, the partial revival of activity in the primary market, which
had ground to a virtual standstill, should help improve liquidity in the
secondary market.
Secondary market prices have already improved substantially. At the end of
November, Ecu bonds yielded 50 basis points more than their theoretical
value (based on bond yields in component currencies). That spread has
tightened consistently since December, and is now about five basis points.
Dealers also note increased volume in the secondary market, as retail and
institutional investors return.
'The investment community is starting to realise that there may well be a
happy ending to Maastricht after all,' said Mr Jim Pelgrift, executive
director of Morgan Stanley International. In addition, there has been a
realisation that the sell-off had been too severe.
However, dealers are loath to predict when, or if, Ecu bond yields will fall
through theoretical yields. This time last year, Ecu bonds yielded 40 basis
points below their theoretical value. But investors now are likely to
require strong evidence that European monetary union, with the Ecu as the
single currency, is going to happen. Ratification of the Maastricht treaty
by Denmark and the UK would be an important confidence booster.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Risk and Reward: Chicago takes the option into the third
dimension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Chicago Board Options Exchange last week took the financial world into a
third dimension with its introduction of an index of implied volatility on
its actively traded Standard and Poor's 100 stock index options. The
dissemination of the index is likely to be followed within the year by its
own volatility options.
While there has been a plethora of new derivative instruments introduced in
the past six months, the volatility index concept goes to the heart of
options pricing and thus may have applications far beyond the equity index
proposed in Chicago.
The American Stock Exchange is considering a volatility index on its Major
Markets Index, and the over-the-counter foreign exchange options market is
said to be ripe for a similar product.
However, while the concept is intriguing, traders say volatility options
will be redundant, and industry marketing executives say the offering is too
sophisticated for retail investors.
The CBOE's volatility index may turn out to be an innovation without a
market. Volatility is a measure of the speed of a market's movements. Since
an option often becomes less valuable as it approaches its expiry date, a
successful options trader must not only have a clear view of price
direction, but also a feel for market velocity - how quickly the price of
the underlying security will move towards his objective.
That said, it must also be noted that volatility is no mystery, and can be
mathematically derived as a sort of standard deviation of prices. Since
Fischer Black and Myron Scholes introduced the first practical model for
options pricing in 1973, volatility has been the one input to the formula
that cannot be plucked from a newspaper.
However, that is no problem for professional options traders, who program
their computers with the Black/Scholes model or one of its offspring and
calculate implied volatility. Many options shops tweak the pricing model to
their own liking, and several generations of software vendors have lived and
died by the speed at which they can spin the model through traders'
machines.
Options traders quote volatility as readily as premium prices, they chart
volatility movement, and have devised a multitude of strategies for buying
and selling volatility within standard options contracts. Their facility
with options pricing and volatility hedging leaves them with little need for
a volatility index option.
Academics who study options pricing theory say that professional traders
could use the products as a sort of re-insurance. Existing option strategies
to hedge volatility require multiple transactions. A direct hedge, they say,
has fewer transactions costs. They admit, however, that wide differences
between bids and offers in thin markets can cost more than any trading fee,
and spreads on a volatility option are apt to be wide.
But a volatility index's appeal to the broader public may be limited. Mr
Todd Petzel, research director at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, says the
CME has considered volatility indices on its options contracts since 1986,
but has not felt compelled to launch a product. Sophisticated investors do
not need the product, he says, and less sophisticated ones do not follow
volatility and use standard options to bet on price movements.
American Stock Exchange executives also said volatility indices had lower
priority than products with broader retail appeal. That is not to say that a
volatility index would not offer some breathless trading opportunities,
however. Volatility tends to rise ahead of an anticipated event as
uncertainty increases, and fall quickly afterward.
CME Eurodollar options saw implied volatility go from an August low of 15
per cent to an October peak of 49 per cent as traders anticipated a new
Democratic president and his unknown economic policies.
By last week, however, volatility had returned to 18 per cent, with savvy
traders reaping rewards from the wild ride.

FT  01 FEB 93 / US Money and Credit: Deficit hopes spur rally in Treasuries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WASHINGTON insiders have been quick to criticise the two-week old Clinton
administration for policy indecisions or U-turns. Yet opinion polls show the
mood in the country at large is much more forgiving, and for now that seems
to include the bond market.
The Treasury market continued to rally last week, with the yield on the
benchmark 30-year issue ending on Friday night at 7.19 per cent, 10 basis
points down on the week and the lowest in six and a half years, while the
five-year note dropped 20 basis points to 5.54 per cent.
Yet this happened just as the latest economic data showed growth
accelerating in the fourth quarter of last year, to an annual rate of 3.8
per cent, the fastest in four years, and as Clinton officials indicated that
an early priority would be a fiscal stimulus of around Dollars 20bn.
A few months ago, such a combination of figures might well have sent bond
yields soaring, on market fears that a Democratic White House was preparing
to let the inflationary genie out of the bottle.
But for now Wall Street seems happy to buy an altogether sunnier story,
which tells of long bond yields eventually dipping below the 7 per cent
yield barrier, in spite of some inevitable setbacks along the way.
The optimism begins with an examination of the latest statistics on gross
domestic product growth, which are solid, but still modest by the standards
of past recoveries from recession.
The labour market remains weak, as demonstrated last week by news of fresh
job cuts at retailer Sears, Roebuck and the aerospace industry's Boeing and
Pratt &amp; Whitney.
The economy, say the bond market optimists, is sufficiently strong both to
make recovery self-sustaining and to curb any major pump-priming by the
Clinton administration, but not so strong that inflation is likely to
re-appear as a problem in the near future. No tightening of monetary policy
by the Federal Reserve is in prospect.
The President's Dollars 20bn stimulus package, runs this argument, is
sufficiently modest that it will have relatively little real impact on an
economy the size of the US, while allowing Mr Clinton to fulfil his election
campaign promise to 'get America moving again'.
His political credibility established, Mr Clinton can then get down to the
much more important question of cutting the federal budget deficit.
Much of the bond market's optimism stems from signs that the new
administration is seriously addressing the deficit question.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the new Treasury secretary, helped spark last week's rally
with suggestions that the administration was considering both energy and
broad-based consumption taxes to help reduce the deficit.
Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, also helped, when he endorsed Mr
Clinton's pledge to cut Dollars 145bn from the projected deficit for 1997 as
a credible deficit-reduction target.
The long end of the market has also been helped by signs that the new
administration is seriously considering an idea previously floated by the
Bush administration: cutting the federal government's funding costs by
reducing the issuance of 30-year bonds and selling more shorter-dated,
cheaper paper.
There has even been market speculation - which does not appear to be well
founded - that long bond issuance could be cut back sharply as early as this
month's refunding.
But for all this optimism, the bond market's honeymoon with Mr Clinton will
remain volatile, subject to the administration's each passing policy thought
until Mr Clinton spells out just what he plans to do in a February 17 speech
to Congress.
It could yet all end in tears. The new President has shown himself adept at
making promises, but his political backbone remains in question.
For now, Wall Street is giving him the benefit of the doubt.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Spanish Government Bonds: Caution the watchword as orthodoxy
prevails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Spanish government bond market has performed well over the last month,
recovering from last autumn's currency turbulence.
But it seems likely the market may be close to the top of the rally, and
already any monetary easing during this month has been discounted.
It was clear midway through January that a change of perception had taken
place on Spain.
The bond market gained strength from a stable peseta within an improved
European exchange rate mechanism, and rallied strongly as interbank rates
eased.
The Treasury saw its chance and took it. Altogether it is thought to have
raised Pta2,900bn (Dollars 25.36bn) during January - or Pta380bn more than
required.
The reversal in the market trend set in after the peseta's devaluation in
late November, which marked the currency's second realignment within the ERM
in just over two months.
Foreign investors started to return to the Spanish market, and by the end of
December the accumulated Spanish debt held by non-residents rose to
Pta1,870bn from a low of Pta1,600bn in mid-November.
The recent rally in the debt market enabled the Treasury to cut the marginal
yield on one-year Treasury bills by around 70 basis points to 13.041 per
cent at last Wednesday's tender.
More importantly, it awarded Pta803bn when the redemptions due only totalled
some Pta476bn.
The wobble came immediately afterwards, with a general brake on lower
interest rate expectations throughout Europe and amid renewed tensions in
the ERM. The peseta lost 0.7 per cent of its value in a single day.
The Bank of Spain reacted promptly, raising its daily intervention rate by
10 basis points to 13.60 per cent and injecting only Pta100bn into the
interbank market.
The net financing that took place during January, on the back of the
considerable volume awarded in the course of the month, suggested that the
Treasury was already seeking to implement a set of new rules which, with
effect from January 1994, will bar it from borrowing from the Bank of Spain.
The Bank of Spain's rapid response to the end of month wobble suggested that
the Bank, which under the terms of the new guidelines will enjoy a
Bundesbank-style autonomy next year, was prepared without hesitation to
defend the peseta as soon as it came under pressure.
The Bank of Spain cannot be faulted on caution. Ten days ago it announced,
with considerable justification, that the peseta had put the troubles of the
currency upheavals behind it and that normalisation was on line. And yet it
brought the benchmark intervention rate down by only a half-point, from
13.75 per cent to 13.25 per cent.
Independently of any future tensions within the ERM, it is this strict sense
of domestic orthodoxy that has prompted the market to discount further
easing.
The authorities are still a long way from being satisfied that spending is
under control and that wage settlements are indeed moderating.
Furthermore, there is still probably at least Pta1,000bn of debt that will
require refinancing before the first quarter is out.
The fixed-income research department of Madrid brokers FG is forecasting a
conservative policy in forthcoming bond auctions. Large volumes are likely
to be awarded with placing rates standing a little higher than what is being
offered in the secondary markets. The market should be expecting yields of
12.30 per cent for three-year securities, 12.05 per cent on five-year notes
and 11.75 for 10-year bonds.

FT  01 FEB 93 / UK Gilts: Yields fall as investors gamble on rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YIELDS fell as investors gambled that the UK government would cut interest
rates over the next few weeks in a further effort to strengthen signs of
economic recovery.
With the Treasury last week reducing base rates from 7 per cent to 6 per
cent in a surprise move, all the signs are that government ministers think
credit policy is still too tight to support a full upturn.
The stage seems to be set for a moderate tightening in fiscal policy in the
March 16 Budget, accompanied around that time by a further cut in interest
rates to 5 per cent or even less.
In spite of the relative success of last week's gilt auction, in which the
Bank of England sold Pounds 2.5bn worth of medium-dated bonds, concern about
the large volume of funding due over the next two years continued to exert a
dampening influence on price rises.
During the week, most classes of gilts showed a price rise of up to 1 point,
with the 8.75 per cent Treasury bond due in 1997 being quoted on Friday
night at 104 3/16 . Its yield fell during the week by about 25 basis points,
slightly more than that seen for gilts at the longer end of the yield curve.
The chief cause for the decline was the cut in short-term interest rates on
Tuesday, which took these to their lowest level for more than 17 years. The
move came after a series of gloomy statistics about the economy since
Christmas, and on the back of warnings that, unless growth picks up soon,
Britain will face extremely high government deficits stretching into the
late 1990s.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, seems to have taken to heart theories that
without reasonably rapid growth over the next two years the public sector
borrowing requirement will be stuck at around Pounds 60bn or more in the
three financial years from 1993-94.
The plan for the Treasury could now be to tackle the deficit with tax rises
to be phased in during 1993-94 and the following year. At the same time, it
could attempt to boost overall economic demand by a looser monetary policy,
while not losing too much sleep over any falls in the exchange rate.
Backing for this view came with the lack of any apparent unease at the
Treasury during last week as, prompted by the base rate cut, sterling fell
by nearly 5 pfennigs against the D-Mark to a London close on Friday at
DM2.3925. At the end of the week the pound also tumbled through the Dollars
1.50 barrier against the dollar, to a six-year low.
Meanwhile, the Bank said it was satisfied with the outcome of Wednesday's
auction of 8.5 per cent Treasury stock due 2007. On the same day it issued a
further Pounds 550m of gilts which by the end of the week was virtually sold
out. Demand was widespread, with overseas investors well represented, even
though the bonds were over-subscribed by a relatively low factor of only
1.18.
One reason for the small 'cover ratio' was probably that many gilt
marketmakers bought bonds the day before the auction as prices rose in the
aftermath of the cut in interest rates. That sudden burst reduced the volume
of bonds which they needed to buy at the auction to fulfil demand from
customers such as pension funds.
News that the M0 measure of money supply rose during January by a
year-on-year seasonally-adjusted 4.2 per cent - above its Treasury target
range - came as a jolt to those in the gilt market who surmise that
inflationary pressures are relatively low, a factor strengthening the case
for further interest rate cuts.
Mr Ian Blance, an economist at Nikko Securities, thinks yields will be
forced up during the rest of 1993 to accommodate the funding pressures.
'The government will need the support of a great many investors,
particularly those from outside Britain, if it is to sell the desired volume
of gilts,' he says. 'The only way this can happen is for the yield curve to
steepen, with the general rise in yields especially marked at the long end.'
With yields for 10-year bonds likely to see a rise of about 1 percentage
point by the end of 1993, Mr Blance reckons the yield difference between
10-year gilts and the equivalent German government bonds will climb from the
relatively low 116 basis points now to around 200 basis points by the end of
December.

FT  01 FEB 93 / International Company News: Fujitsu to cut prices of desktop
PCs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUJITSU, Japan's largest computer maker, is to sell desktop PCs at
substantially reduced prices, in a move that promises to fan the fierce
price competition in the Japanese PC market.
Fujitsu's move follows an announcement earlier this month by NEC, Japan's
number one PC manufacturer with 53 per cent share of the market, that it
will introduce a series of desktop PCs priced substantially lower than
previous models.
Fujitsu declined to reveal the price range for its new low-cost series but
said they were likely to be comparable to those of NEC's lower-priced
series.
Japanese computer manufacturers have long been able to maintain high prices
due to their strong hold over the domestic market. But recently they have
been forced by the introduction of cut-price US machines to review their
pricing strategies. Compaq, for example, announced a machine at about half
the price of comparable Japanese machines.
The Fujitsu move leaves Toshiba alone among the top five manufacturers in
Japan to maintain its traditionally high pricing strategy.

FT  01 FEB 93 / International Company News: PolyGram in UK video purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLYGRAM, the music company 80 per cent owned by Philips of the Netherlands,
has bought the UK operations of Vision Video from General Electric Capital
of the US.
The acquisition of the company, which sells videos to retailers, makes
PolyGram the UK's leading supplier of videos for the 'sell-through' market,
ahead of the BBC.
Vision Video was originally part of Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group, but
has had several owners since.
PolyGram is believed to be paying Fl 10m (Dollars 5.5m) for the company,
mostly through the assumption of debt.
According to the Gallup market research and polling organisation, PolyGram
last year took 7.7 per cent of the UK market in 'sell-through' videos in
value terms. 'Sell-through' involves customers buying, rather than renting
films. Vision Video had a 4.9 per cent market share. The combined total
would put the enlarged group ahead of the BBC, which was the 1992 market
leader with a 10.5 per cent share.

FT  01 FEB 93 / International Company News: Cominco deficit widens to
CDollars 95m in final period

<TEXT>
COMINCO, the Canadian metals and fertiliser group, suffered a heavy
fourth-quarter loss as a result of soft metal prices and the decision to
write off a third of the cost of its troubled lead smelter at Trail, British
Columbia.
The loss, including the CDollars 50m (USDollars 39.2m) smelter write-down,
was CDollars 95.2m, or CDollars 1.21 a share, against a CDollars 16.3m loss,
or 21 cents, a year earlier. Revenues rose to CDollars 364.6m from CDollars
344m.
The loss for the year narrowed to CDollars 30.2m from CDollars 41.3m, thanks
largely to a gain earlier in the year from the sale of a 46 per cent
interest in Aberfoyle, the Australian mining group.
Cominco's mining and metals business swung to a fourth-quarter operating
loss of CDollars 40.5m from a CDollars 5.5m profit a year earlier, due
largely to an after-tax charge of CDollars 30m to reflect the impact of
lower metal prices on zinc and ferro-nickel inventories.
Canadian Pacific Forest Products, the newsprint producer, suffered a net
loss of CDollars 59.5m or CDollars 1.13 a share in the fourth quarter,
compared with a loss of CDollars 96m or CDollars 2.19 a year earlier, writes
Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
The company, controlled by Canadian Pacific, had sales of CDollars 467m,
against CDollars 481m. The fall was mainly due to a mill shutdown and asset
sales.
For all 1992 the loss was CDollars 248m or CDollars 4.82 a share, against a
deficit of CDollars 571m or CDollars 13 in 1991.

<TEXT>
BIDERMANN, the French textile group, is buying the Armand Thiery chain of
clothing stores from Pinault-Printemps, the heavily-indebted retail concern
headed by Mr Francois Pinault.
The deal, for an undisclosed sum, is part of the disposal programme started
by Mr Pinault after his recent takeover of the Au Printemps department store
chain. The takeover transformed Pinault-Printemps into one of France's
leading retail groups but has left the company burdened by heavy debt.
Armand Thiery is an established group of clothing stores, which includes six
shops under the Brummel umbrella, as well as its signature 53-strong chain.
The company, which Pinault-Printemps acquired in late 1991 as part of the
Printemps deal, made sales of FFr658m (Dollars 122.76m) last year.
Bidermann has extensive interests in the French clothing industry, including
a minority 12.4 per cent stake in Armand Thiery.

BANESTO, the third-ranked Spanish banking group in terms of total assets,
has reported a 27 per cent fall in net profits during 1992 because of
sharply lower extraordinary revenue from disposals.
Provisional results, which excluded Banesto's industrial holding,
Corporacion Industrial, show post tax income last year stood at Pta45.6bn
(Dollars 398.8m), against Pta62.6 in 1991.
The bank had boosted its 1991 balance sheet with extraordinary items

The 1992 gross operating profit rose by 17 per cent to Pta119.6bn and
Pta87.3bn wasput aside for provisions, 18.8 per cent more than in 1991.

units

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NESTLE, the Swiss food group, says it is in the final stage of negotiations
to sell to an unnamed buyer parts of Perrier, the French mineral water
company which it acquired last year after a complex takeover battle.
Nestle said in Paris last week that only preliminary talks were under way.
However, a spokesman at the group's headquarters in Switzerland insisted the
earlier statement was incorrect.
Any deal must be approved by European Commission competition authorities,
which last year ordered Nestle to dispose of a number of Perrier assets in
return for clearing the takeover.
The assets involve springs with a capacity of 3bn litres, including the
Vichy, Saint Yorre and Pierval brands. Brussels has stipulated they be sold
to a single buyer, though Nestle would not say whether it was dealing with
more than one bidder.
The Commission has also set an undisclosed deadline for the disposal. But
Nestle said the deadline was being treated in a flexible manner and could be
extended if necessary. Until the assets are sold, Nestle may not put into
effect an agreement to sell Volvic, one of Perrier's biggest brands, to BSN,
France's largest food company.

FT  01 FEB 93 / International Company News: Philips suspends plans to
produce HDTV televisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, is suspending plans to produce for
market televisions using High-Definition Television technology (HDTV).
The move is the result of the UK government's decision in December last year
to block a European Community Ecu500m (Dollars 412m) funding programme to
develop and market HDTV.
Ms Angelique Hoogakker, a company spokeswoman, said yesterday that because
there were no programmes on the horizon for the European HDTV standard
HD-Mac, the company felt it was pointless to produce HDTV-Mac televisions.
'We will complete the research and development of the HDTV-Mac set but we
will not start to produce them until there is a firm indication that there
will be programmes.
'The whole thing is dependent on money becoming available for the action
plan to back production of such programmes,' said Ms Hoogakker.
Mr Henk Bodt, head of Philips' consumer electronics division, said that to
push ahead with HDTV-Mac production would be like introducing a car on to
the market when there was no petrol available.
Philips said yesterday that once it had completed HDTV research, it would
focus on wide-screen television technology.
Full development of HDTV-Mac was to form one of three strands of the Dutch
company's drive to capture increased share in consumer electronics, the
others being CD-I compact discs and DCC audio tape. Philips has not paid a
dividend for two years, and has made some 50,000 redundancies since 1990.

ruling

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LAWYERS acting for Grupo Torras, the Kuwait Investment Office's troubled
Spanish holding arm, have filed an appeal against a ruling by Madrid's
senior monetary court that had rejected allegations of serious fraud brought
by Torras against seven of its former senior executives.
The move, filed minutes before midnight on Friday, when the deadline for an
appeal expired, sets the scene for continued litigation that threatens the
KIO's orderly withdrawal from its once pace-setting Spanish investments.
The legal battle centres on an attempt by Mr Ali-Rashid al-Bader, chairman
of the KIO since February last year, and by his close friend Mr Mahmoud
al-Nouri, whom he appointed to run Torras three months later, to blame
former KIO and Torras executives for multi-million dollar losses incurred by
the KIO in Spain.
Last week the Madrid court rejected a criminal lawsuit brought by Torras
against Sheikh Fahad al-Sabah, the KIO's former chairman and a cousin of the
Emir of Kuwait, Mr Fouad Jaffar, the KIO's former general manager, Mr Javier
de la Rosa, Torras' former deputy chairman, and four other former senior
Torras managers.
The seven were accused of causing 'fraudulent losses for the company well in
excess of Pta100bn (Dollars 89m)'. Rejecting the suit, the judge ruled that
it did not contain 'a single indication' that fiscal crimes had been
committed by those it accused. The lawsuit had alleged irregularities
including fraud, tax evasion, falsifying public deeds and price
manipulation.
The appeal is likely to be argued through the judicial hierarchy in Spain
and could be pursued, if necessary, in London, the KIO's headquarters. 'The
plaintiffs are very serious about this and they won't give up,' said a
Madrid lawyer close to the KIO.
The renewed litigation could, however, affect developments aimed at
loosening the links that bind Torras, which was put into receivership by its
new management in December, with top Spanish companies. Torras' new
management has said it intended to extricate itself from corporate
responsibilities in Spain.
Torras is negotiating the restoration of discount lines that would assure
its wholly-owned subsidiary Torraspapel, Spain's largest paper producer, of
short-term funding.
It is also seeking boardroom approval for the sale of its 38 per cent stake
in Ebro, Spain's leading food company, and is attempting to write off its
considerable investment in Ercros, the leading domestic chemical
conglomerate which is 36 per cent Torras owned and was put into receivership
last July.

FT  01 FEB 93 / International Company News: Paribas in black but makes heavy
provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PARIBAS, the leading French investment bank, returned to the black last year
with a net profit of FFr900m (Dollars 167.9m), but was forced to make heavy
provisions because of the problems of the property market and small
businesses in France.
The group, which fell into a loss in 1991 for the first time in its history,
managed to maintain operating income at FFr9bn during the year thanks to its
cost-cutting programme.
The board decided to hold the dividend at FFr12 a share.
Paribas' return to profit was clouded by last autumn's scandal over the
discovery of off-balance sheet losses at Ciments Francais, the French cement
company in which it is a sizeable shareholder.
The bank's share of Ciments Francais' losses amounted to FFr400m in the
first half of 1992.
It is awaiting the publication of the cement company's results to discover
the full extent of its second-half losses.
In the meantime, Paribas has had to pay back FFr500m of the money received
last spring from the sale of a controlling stake in Ciments Francais to
Italcementi of Italy.
This has left Paribas with a FFr500m profit on the deal, without taking into
account its share of Ciments Francais' 1992 losses.
In spite of the Ciments Francais debacle, Paribas made an overall profit of
FFr2.8bn on disposals last year which included the sale of stakes in Matra
Communication and Lapeyre.
This profit helped to mitigate the effect of another year of hefty
write-downs.
Paribas was forced to make provisions of FFr7.8bn in 1992, slightly lower
than FFr9.5bn in 1991, mainly on its Compagnie Bancaire and Credit du Nord
banking subsidiaries.
It was also affected by the impact of the continuing UK recession.

Both companies were formed in 1987 through a merger of Vickers Design and

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ensor Holdings, the USM-quoted group with interest in building materials and
motor vehicles, incurred a loss of Pounds 2.1m pre-tax for the half year
ended September 30.
That was well up on the adjusted deficit of Pounds 294,000 recorded for the
same period of the previous year, but significantly down on the Pounds 2.74m
loss reported for the second half of the 1991-92 year.
The first half loss was struck after taking account of an exceptional
provision of Pounds 1.57m which related to the disposal of discontinued
activities. Interest charges rose to Pounds 510,000 (Pounds 447,000).
Turnover of continuing activities totalled Pounds 11.86m (Pounds 12.16m).
Losses per share emerged at 18.1p (1.4p).
Comparative figures have been adjusted to accord with new accounting
policies.

Stonehill also reported a reduction in group pre-tax losses from Pounds

European food business ahead of the single market.
Unilever employs 1,800 people in its joint head offices in London and
Rotterdam, split as to 1,200-600. A small number of jobs are expected to be

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Greyfriars Investment dropped 2p to 15p on Friday after it
announced that an early repayment of a loan note had reduced the net asset
value by 5.4p.
Investment trusts borrow money - 'gear up' is the jargon - when they believe
that the return on equities will outweigh those on fixed interest. However,
the loan note was deep discounted and its repayment entitlement is growing
at 13 per cent a year.
The terms of the loan notes include a covenant; although that has not been
breached, the company repaid half the loan note in August last year, and has
decided it was prudent to pay off the other half now.

<TEXT>
J. ROTHSCHILD Assurance, the life assurance company started at the beginning
of 1992 by Sir Mark Weinberg and Mr Mike Wilson, former executives of Allied
Dunbar, brought in premium income of Pounds 101m in its first year.
New business figures for the group showed that total funds under management,
which are shared between J. Rothschild Investment Management, M&amp;G Investment
Management and Scottish Amicable Investment Managers, were Pounds 290m.
The company sells only through its direct sales force.
Regular premiums accounted for Pounds 18.3m while single premiums were
Pounds 82.7m.
A high proportion of protection, rather than investment, policies accounted
for the high share for regular premiums.
Sir Mark, the chairman, said he was satisfied with the results, which showed
that 'we have established a company of substantial size in just one year'.

FT  01 FEB 93 / International Company News: BZW earnings calculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS de Zoete Wedd, the City security house, has announced how it will
calculate earnings per share under the new accounting standard.
It will issue its own operating earnings per share figure which excludes
profits or losses on business disposals, asset sales and fundamental
restructurings.
The announcement is one of several beginning to appear from City firms
attempting to grapple with FRS 3, the new accounting standard which becomes
mandatory for companies with year-ends after June 22.
FRS 3 provides a profit figure which includes extraordinary items previously
taken below the bottom line, and will be considerably more volatile than the
existing profits figure.
County NatWest has already announced its method of calculating a continuing
earnings figure, and a group of City analysts has put together a working
party to consider a version which might be adopted as the industry standard.
BZW says it will begin publishing its own earnings figure alongside the
reported earnings in its circulars.
The figure will be reached by taking published operating profit, subtracting
net interest, tax, preference dividends and minority interests, and adding
back tax and minority interests attributable to fixed asset and business
disposals, closures and restructuring.

pre-tax profits of IPounds 1.27m (Pounds 1.4m) in the six months ended July
31 against losses of IPounds 82,664.
The result was after an exceptional IPounds 1.29m credit, being the net
effect of the compromise settlement agreed with the company's creditors in
November 1992 whereby all Dana's liabilities were discharged for about
IPounds 100,000.
The retained deficit carried forward increased from IPounds 534,353 to
IPounds 1.58m.
Proposals for a restructuring of the share capital will be put to
shareholders at annual and extraordinary meetings on February 15.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
According to Mr Richard Szpiro, managing director of Wintrust, the merchant
banker, the financial outlook has ceased to deteriorate.
'With a fair wind this should be reflected in our future figures.'
He made his comments while reporting lower pre-tax profits for the six
months to September 30 of Pounds 1.01m (Pounds 1.54m).
He added that the balance sheet had strengthened and the loans and advances
to capital ratio had fallen from 2.5:1 to 1.5:1.
Earnings per share were 5.53p (10p) and the interim dividend is unchanged at
3p.

FT  01 FEB 93 / International Company News: AAH paying Pounds 11m for retail
pharmacy growth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AAH HOLDINGS is expanding its retail pharmacy interests through the
acquisition of Clark Care Group at a total cost of up to Pounds 11.3m.
Clark Care runs 20 pharmacies in Kent and East Sussex. For the year ended
January 31 1992, the latest available period, it made pre-tax profits of
Pounds 210,000 and is expected to contribute not less than Pounds 1.2m in
the year to March 31 1994 as a result of operational synergies and reduced
overheads.
Net assets at end January 1992 were Pounds 756,000, including goodwill.
Initial consideration is Pounds 7.5m, of which Pounds 4.8m is satisfied by
the issue of 842,106 AAH shares; a further 549,658 shares have been placed
on behalf of the vendors with institutions to finance the balance.
Additionally, 636,364 shares have been placed to facilitate the repayment of
all borrowings of Clark Care at completion, which amounted to some Pounds
3.5m. Dependent on the final valuation of net assets, an additional maximum
Pounds 300,000 will be paid post completion.
AAH said with retail pharmacy margins currently under pressure, volume
related purchasing opportunities have increased in importance. Clark Care
will expand group retail turnover by some 12 per cent.

FT  01 FEB 93 / International Company News: Iceland to expand via
Littlewoods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RAPIDLY expanding Iceland Frozen Foods is set to take over the food
retailing operations of Littlewoods, after the privately owned stores
group's decision to withdraw from the market.
The shopworkers' union, Usdaw, has confirmed that it had already held
preliminary meetings with management at Littlewoods and that they would meet
again tomorrow.
Iceland is understood to be the strong favourite to take over the business
that turns over Pounds 100m a year from 60 of Littlewoods' 120 stores. There
are, however, other groups interested in the business.
Iceland already has 600 shops and could be expected to make significant
savings on bulk buying and distribution. It has maintained strong earnings
growth by rapid expansion of the number of stores.
Last year, however, the group enjoyed a further boost when it shifted its
emphasis away from simply supplying bulk frozen food towards the sale of
convenience foods on the high street.
The Littlewoods deal is likely to put Iceland in a stronger position to
compete with the likes of Marks and Spencer in the growing market for
convenience prepared foods.
The deal would give it about 250,000 square feet of extra retail space. It
is likely to pay Littlewoods a percentage of sales.
Littlewoods has been under pressure from the Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway
supermarket chains which have significantly more buying power and larger out
of town shops.
According to Usdaw, Littlewoods has decided to offer the business to Iceland
because of undertakings it has made about staffing levels.
'Littlewoods have been influenced into making the deal by Iceland's
indication it would try to keep on as many Littlewoods people as possible.
'We will seek to ensure their current terms and conditions are protected,'
the union said.

FT  01 FEB 93 / The tide turns against another corporate Titan: Alan
Friedman analyses the hasty Amex boardroom departure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE board of directors of American Express, the troubled US travel and
financial services group, will meet today to discuss the election of a new
chairman, following the surprise resignation of Mr James Robinson at the
weekend.
It is understood that Mr Richard Furlaud, a board member and former
president of Bristol-Myers Squibb, the drugs company, may be named as
interim non-executive chairman.
Mr Robinson, who has run American Express for 15 years, said on Saturday he
would sever all ties with the company by February 22. He will resign as
group chairman and will also give up his new positions as chairman and chief
executive of Shearson Lehman Brothers, the loss-making brokerage and
investment banking subsidiary.
'In this environment, with all the attention focused on management problems
at IBM, Westinghouse and other major corporations, my staying at American
Express would leave Harvey (Golub) and the company encumbered by issues that
have nothing to do with reality - and for what purpose?' Mr Robinson's
statement said. The choice of a successor at Shearson is expected to take
several weeks.
But Mr Robinson, 57, began last week by turning the tables on those in Wall
Street who had demanded his resignation in the wake of heavy card losses and
a share price slump. By the weekend Mr Robinson, faced by angry
shareholders, recognised he had to go.
In September a group of American Express directors, including Mr Rawleigh
Warner, the former Mobil chairman, insisted that Mr Robinson prepare to
resign as chairman and chief executive.
The prime reason for the push was the obvious failure of Mr Robinson's 1980s
strategy of trying to construct a financial services supermarket by way of
an expansion that at various stages included plastic cards, travel services,
the Shearson Lehman brokerage and investment banking business, private
banking, cable television and insurance.
Mr Robinson's foremost adviser in his boardroom troubles has been Mrs Linda
Robinson, his wife, an ambitious public relations executive.
His strategy was to put a brave face on his coming resignation as chief
executive, denying he was being forced out. By last Monday he had persuaded
the board to install Mr Harvey Golub, his chief deputy, as chief executive.
But what really surprised American Express shareholders, however, was that
Mr Robinson last Monday not only salvaged his job as chairman, but also
pushed aside close friends and had himself named chairman and chief
executive of Shearson, the loss-making subsidiary. Among those pushed aside
was Mr Howard Clark, Jr, the Shearson chairman whose father - Mr Howard
Clark Sr. - was Mr Robinson's predecessor at American Express and who had
himself turned against Mr Robinson in recent weeks.
Although Mr Robinson said he was not available to be interviewed, close
associates say both he and his wife perceived Shearson as his comeback
vehicle, or may have hoped to restore it to profitability and eventually buy
it from American Express. Mrs Robinson, in turn, has been dubbed the 'Lady
Macbeth' of American Express by the US media.
The opposition to Mr Robinson's tenure at American Express intensified
immediately after it was announced last Monday that he would stay on. At the
same time the company disclosed nearly halved 1992 earnings and figures for
its core Travel Related Services (TRS) division that showed a 75 per cent
crash in profits between 1990 and 1992.
By last Tuesday investors had dumped American Express stock in trading that
topped three times the normal volume. Within 24 hours the selling had wiped
more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m), or 8 per cent, off the company's market
capitalisation.
Analysts doubted Mr Golub's claim that he was in charge, viewing him as
beholden to Mr Robinson. By Wednesday three board directors, including Mr
Warner, had quit American Express, following Mr Robinson's apparent victory.
It did not help Mr Robinson's image that as directors were resigning on
Wednesday night he was celebrating his wife's birthday at a lavish and
socially notable party in New York's East Village.
On Thursday Mr Golub faced an open rebellion from some institutional
shareholders who told him Mr Robinson was now proving an albatross to the
company, dragging down morale, image and the share price.
By Friday it was rumoured that Mr Richard Furlaud, a director and the former
president of Bristol-Myers Squibb who has been a key player in the boardroom
drama, had become concerned about possible shareholder lawsuits. .
Mr Robinson remained defiant even on Saturday afternoon, when he finally
announced he would sever all ties with American Express.
He dismissed as 'a big misperception' the idea that his carrying on as
chairman of the group would impinge on Mr Golub's ability to act as an
independent chief executive. He replied to Wall Street's overwhelming vote
against him by railing against 'unnecessary confusion in the minds of some
investors and the press'. And he claimed that 'the good of the company has
always been and continues to be my primary and overriding concern'.
Now American Express faces more disarray and insiders say it will be up to
Mr Golub and what remains of the board to restore a semblance of stability,
make new appointments and then get on with turning the group around.
Shearson - alone among big US securities firms - suffered heavy losses in
1992. American Express must meanwhile face credit losses and its steady loss
of market share and customers.
The future management direction of American Express is likely to see more
tough measures by Mr Golub to reduce losses at the troubled Optima credit
card division and to re-launch other card products and seek cost savings in
the TRS division and at Shearson. It is not inconceivable that Shearson will
eventually be sold.
In broader terms Mr Robinson's downfall, coming just five days after he had
pulled off the most dramatic counter-coup seen in years in corporate
America, is notable among the recent string of top-level management
upheavals at blue-chip companies such as IBM, General Motors and
Westinghouse.
The reasons are twofold. Firstly, Mr Robinson was among the last of the
quintessentially 1980s corporate Titans.
His departure - more than others - is another sign that the mind-set of the
past decade is over.
Secondly, his departure reinforces the growing trend toward greater
shareholder democracy in America. It suggests no chairman and chief
executive should believe himself to be invincible or unaccountable.
The revolution at American Express is thus both a cautionary tale and a
potentially salutory lesson for corporate America. The next few months will
show whether or not the company can profit from the pain.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Economics Notebook: The Magnificent Seven set to open up
policymaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN intriguing experiment in UK economic policymaking starts shortly when Mr
Alan Budd, the Treasury's chief economic adviser chairs the first policy
meeting with the panel of outside advisers selected to inject a breath of
fresh air into the way the Treasury assesses the economy.
The seven-strong panel, inevitably dubbed the Magnificent Seven or the 'wise
men', was set up at the end of last year after widespread criticism of the
Treasury's record in economic stewardship and forecasting. Its first report
is due to be published on February 19, just under a month before the Budget
 -and when public unease about the slow pace of any recovery from the
recession is likely still to be high.
Providing it organises itself effectively, the group could turn into a
useful forum for ideas about improving the UK economy's recent lacklustre
showing. In contrast to the secretiveness which characterises much internal
Treasury discussion, the atmosphere in which the group will operate will be
commendably open. Although the formal drafting of the panel's thrice-yearly
reports is currently intended to be left to the Treasury, the department
says it wants the panel's discussions to be entirely free of official
influence. Its reports are to be handed to Mr Norman Lamont, or whoever else
is chancellor at the time, just a day or two before they are made public.
The people on the panel can be divided into two groups. There are three
dissidents - Professor Wynne Godley of Cambridge University, Professor
Patrick Minford of Liverpool University and Professor Tim Congdon, managing
director of Lombard Street Research - all of whom have bitterly criticised
Treasury policies in recent years. All argued for the UK to pull out of the
European exchange rate mechanism well before Black Wednesday last September
when heavy selling of sterling forced Britain's hand. In a particularly
irony, the three were referred to as 'quack doctors' by prime minister Mr
John Major in a speech defending the pound's ERM parity made just six days
prior to the devaluation.
The other four members, all of whom supported ERM membership, are more
broadly representative of the economics establishment. They are Mr Andrew
Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research;
Professor David Currie, head of economic forecasting at the London Business
School; Mr Gavyn Davies, chief UK economist at Goldman Sachs, the US
investment bank; and Mr Andrew Sentance, economics director at the
Confederation of British Industry.
Prior to the first meeting a week tomorrow, each economist will have sent Mr
Budd a 2,000-word paper setting out policy suggestions, analysis and
numerical forecasts. These papers will be printed in full with the first
report. The gathering itself will be in private, which is a pity because it
promises to be lively. Many of the panel members differ strongly with each
other about how they think the economy works and how best to monitor it.
Several - in particular Prof Minford and Prof Congdon - have reputations for
being argumentative. Prof Godley has a quirky sense of humour which may help
ideas to flow. Even so, the genial Mr Budd will need to be on top form to
keep order.
His job as chairman will be to facilitate discussion, not to give his own
views. Although some might see this as yet another sign of Treasury
aloofness, there will be sound reasons for Mr Budd staying in the
background. The usefulness of the panel's reports will depend on on their
conveying outside views unadulterated by official thinking. Also should Mr
Budd divulge Treasury opinions on matters such as interest rates, the panel
members might be deemed to be in receipt of inside information. That could
damage their reputations or even make them liable for prosecution.
After the panel goes home, drafting an account of the meeting will be left
largely to Mr Adrian Cooper, a junior Treasury official known as 'forecast
co-ordinator' and who will be supervised by Mr Budd. Armed with Mr Cooper's
view of what they all said and how any conclusions should be presented, the
Magnificent Seven will return to Great George Street on February 16 to
polish the draft. This is where the real fun will begin. Many of the panel
members agree that little will be achieved if the report is simply a
collection of individual views, without any effort to bring together ideas
or important themes. Although expectations for what the panel can achieve
should not be become too lofty, some of the highly worthwhile aims of the
group may turn out to be incompatible with the Treasury having sole charge
of the report's drafting.
While Mr Budd has good credentials for chairing the panel meetings, he
should not be made responsible for fashioning a report which as well as
being lively and well-written may need to criticise Treasury policies. An
analogy is with the reports of the House of Commons' Treasury and civil
service committee, an all-party group of backbench MPs. Even though the
committee's members represent many shades of political opinions, whoever is
chairman bangs heads together to ensure that its reports generally contain
useful and thought-provoking points. In the case of the panel's reports, Mr
Budd will not have the sense of ownership of their contents to do a similar
job. Indeed, forcing Mr Budd into this role could give present him with an
important internal conflict.
Therefore one of the first acts of the group should be to elect someone
other than Mr Budd to supervise the writing of the assessments. While Mr
Davies and Prof Minford would both probably do the job well, they are ruled
out on the respective grounds of being too close to financial markets and
being too opinionated. The best option is to give the job to Mr Britton, who
has qualities of calmness and experience. He may have to be paid somewhat
more than the meagre allowance of Pounds 125 a report which is all that the
Treasury is currently prepared to give the panel members. A decision to put
Mr Britton in charge of writing the panel's reports would be an important
step to making the Treasury's new experiment a success.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Saab cars to get big capital injection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SAAB Automobile is to receive a SKr2.8bn (Pounds 254m) capital infusion from
its two owners, Saab-Scania and General Motors of the US, as part of a
three-pronged drive to restore the group to profitability.
Combined with rationalisation and the launch of the group's new model later
this year, the injection is meant to turn round the group's fortunes after
four consecutive years of losses.
The funds are to be used for current operations and to assist in developing
future car models. The money will be put into the company during 1993 with
GM and Saab-Scania contributing SKr1.4bn each.
In mid-1991 the joint owners ploughed SKr3bn into Saab, and the car group
received an additional SKr2.5bn subordinated loan from Saab-Scania. When it
first emerged that a new injection was being planned last November,
Saab-Scania president Mr Lars Kylberg indicated it would be the last support
the company would receive.
Saab suffered a SKr1.3bn loss in the first nine months of 1992, and is
expecting a full year deficit of more than SKr2bn. It has warned it faces an
uphill task to return to profitability this year.
Crucial to its prospects will be the success of its new model - a
replacement for the 900 series - which until now has been kept closely under
wraps.
It is also carrying out a cost-cutting programme which will cut more than 20
per cent of its workforce, to save SKr2bn.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Eurobond debt issuance at a record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASED borrowing by European governments boosted the amount of new debt
issued in the Eurobond market to a record Dollars 35.7bn (Pounds 23.6bn) in
January.
The US corporate debt market also had its busiest month ever, with a total
of Dollars 36.9bn, made up largely of refinancings, according to figures
from Securities Data.
While most European governments have finished replenishing their currency
reserves after last autumn's foreign exchange debacle, they still face
mounting budget deficits.
Sovereign borrowers accounted for more than Dollars 8bn of total Eurobond
issues in January, as their increased funding needs forced them to seek
funds outside their domestic bond markets. Volume the previous January
totalled Dollars 34.7bn, of which less than Dollars 5bn was made up of
government debt, according to IFR Securities Data.
'European countries are under pressure to bring down debt levels to meet
criteria for European monetary union, but with weaker economic growth and a
shrinking tax base, this is not going to be an easy task,' said Mr Jim
Pelgrift, executive director of Morgan Stanley International.
The slowdown in most of the world's economies and the prospect of low
inflation is likely to provide favourable conditions for bond markets.
'Every market one looks at, there is potential for a rally,' according to Mr
Tom Skwarek, managing director of capial markets at JP Morgan.
The economic slowdown has discouraged European companies from tapping the
market, since they do not need to borrow to invest. In the US, companies
have been taking advantage of lower interest rates to lock in fixed-rate
financing, as the economy emerges from recession. Volume in January just
topped last January's Dollars 36.9bn record.

THE INTERNATIONAL peace plan for Bosnia, due to be submitted to the United
Nations Security Council this week, is expected to receive a cool response
from the US administration today.
Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the co-chairmen of the Geneva peace conference
on former Yugoslavia, are due to explain the half-finished deal, rejected by
the three warring Bosnian factions at the weekend, to Mr Warren Christopher,
US secretary of state, in Washington
US approval is considered vital if the Security Council is to exert
effective pressure on the Bosnian Serbs, Moslems and Croats to make the
necessary compromises for an agreement. But President Bill Clinton's new
administration is reported to have serious reservations about the plan
because it incorporates some of the effects of the Serbs' policy of 'ethnic
cleansing'.
The mediators are also likely to face criticism of their plan for
transitional power-sharing arrangements. The plan provides for the
dissolution of the present Moslem-led government and its replacement for an
interim period by a nine-member transitional body until free elections are
held.
Although the US administration has not yet taken a policy decision on the
subject, it is said to be leaning towards a possible lifting of the embargo
on arms sales to the Bosnian Moslems. But such a move is strongly opposed by
Mr Vance and Lord Owen, who have stressed that the embargo could not be
lifted selectively and would merely lead to an extension of the fighting.
If the embargo was lifted for one side, it would be like lifting it for
everbody else - 'pouring fuel on the flames,' Lord Owen said in an
interview.
After presiding over four weeks of intensive negotiations between the
leaders of the three factions, the international mediators, who did not want
to prolong the talks indefinitely, finally decided to ask the Security
Council to endorse the plan. They appear to hope that the fear of possible
international military action under a new Council mandate, or the more
effective enforcement of sanctions, will persuade the warring groups to
conclude a deal.
'We are very close to an overall settlement,' Lord Owen said at Heathrow
airport before flying to Brussels for talks with EC foreign ministers. At
the last meeting on Saturday, before the talks were adjourned, only the
Bosnian Croats signed all three parts of the peace package.
Laura Silber reports from Belgrade: Mr Franjo Tudjman, president of Croatia,
vowed to gain control of a disputed Serb enclave following the successful
Croat offensive across UN lines. He warned he would not shrink from using
force to restore Croatia's territorial integrity.

FT  01 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: UK building societies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lower short-term interest rates are a mixed blessing for UK building
societies. While easy money could inject life into the housing market and
stem the flow of repossessions, it is starting to cause difficulties on the
funding side. Last year saw a net inflow of only Pounds 295m, although
deposit balances rose by Pounds 12bn thanks to interest credited. With base
rates now at 6 per cent and likely to fall further, it is easy to imagine a
net outflow occuring in 1993. Doubtless the government would be happy if
some of this money finds its way into the gilts market. It might have second
thoughts if the building societies were left unable to finance any revival
in the housing market.
The societies appear squeezed. If they keep savings rates high to protect
their deposit base, they must either slow the reduction in mortgage rates or
forfeit margin. If the mortgage rate is held artificially high, other
lenders like banks will steal market share. The societies could press for
regulatory permission to raise more funds in the wholesale markets, but that
would not help their margins. Besides, if they seek much extra money from
the bond markets, they might find themselves paying a premium.
The dilemma facing the societies is thus what price they are prepared to pay
for market share of both retail deposits and mortgage lending. One way they
will probably fight back is by offering longer-dated investment products,
say two year bonds. These would allow them to retain customers anxious to
move out along the yield curve in search of a higher return. The funds could
be used to match the fixed rate mortgages they are increasingly offering.
They might even have some left to invest in gilts. That would help cover the
PSBR if the government relaxed its full funding rule. Seeking the societies'
collaboration in this way might be one way of avoiding another unseeming
confrontation over the pricing of national savings products.

FT  01 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Index-linked gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest cut in interest rates strengthens the investment argument in
favour of index-linked gilts. With the government evidently determined to
restore growth at any cost, buyers of fixed-rate gilts might be forgiven for
worrying about inflation. The equity market, meanwhile, has already
discounted a strong recovery in corporate earnings. Index-linked gilts offer
a haven from unexpected inflation and economic disappointment. Judging by
the Pounds 250m stock issued on Wednesday, the authorities are aware of the
funding opportunity.
Even so, index-linked bonds are unlikely to play more than a supporting role
in the government's funding programme while bond market investors remain so
relaxed about the long-term inflation threat. The yield differential between
fixed-rated and index-linked gilts - a rough measure of inflationary
expectations - has hovered at around 5 per cent since sterling was forced
out of the ERM. Equally, the yield on equities is not out of kilter with the
real return on index-linked gilts. Institutions are reluctant to buy
index-linked bonds unless this arithmetic changes.
Given the tax advantages, private investors may be buyers as they switch out
of cash deposits. But the government has good reason to tread carefully. The
recent spate of index-linked issues has done little to improve liquidity.
Yields would rise quickly if the market was asked to take more paper than
could be readily absorbed. That would have a knock-on effect in the rest of
the gilts market the government must want to avoid.

FT  01 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Drop kick for the punt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ireland accepted on Saturday that virtue goes unrewarded in the ERM. On
fundamental criteria like budget deficit and inflation, it did not deserve
the humiliation of devaluation against the D-Mark. That the exchange markets
thought otherwise is a reflection of two factors with increasing bearing on
attitudes to the system as a whole. By sticking with its previous exchange
rate, Ireland was storing up huge problems for itself in terms of
unemployment and deflation; its industry had also become hopelessly
uncompetitive compared with that of the UK which has left the shackles of
the ERM behind. The temptation for other ERM countries to gain competitive
edge through devaluation is all the greater as the economic outlook in
Europe deteriorates.
With hindsight, it would have been more sensible to negotiate a general
realignment last autumn. That would have allowed the D-Mark to appreciate
and kept the other ERM currencies in better relationship to each other.
Instead, the vain determination of finance ministers to stay the course has
not only given speculators easy profits. It has also undermined the
credibility of a system that had previously served Europe well.
In so far as France stood in the way of a general realignment, it must share
the blame for what has happened since. The chances are that the franc will
come under renewed attack. With the support of the Bundesbank, the marauders
may once again be repelled. But that would not be a victory for the system
as a whole. It would look instead as though an express route to monetary
union had opened up for the favoured few, regardless of policy proclamation
to the contrary. The problems of those on the periphery remain exemplified
by Ireland. Its devaluations looks adequate now, but the advantage will
quickly erode if the UK really is set on a policy of slashing interest rates
and allowing sterling to fall. Ireland could then discover that it would
have been better to leave the system altogether.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Chernobyl victims need Dollars 55bn, says Ukraine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DAVOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VICTIMS of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 required medical aid
costing some Dollars 55bn (Pounds 36.4bn), Mr Leonid Kravchuk, president of
Ukraine, said in Davos yesterday at the annual World Economic Forum.
Around 11m people had fallen victim to the disaster in some way, he said.
Estimated health costs came to about Dollars 5,000 per person by
international norms. 'To make these people healthy, we need Dollars 55bn.'
Mr Kravchuk said Ukraine could not do without nuclear energy. But Chernobyl
had become a moral factor for both Ukraine and the international community.
Preparations were now under way to make safe a sarcophagus built over the
failed reactor in 1986. All three reactors at the Chernobyl site would be
shut down by the end of 1993, 'because they are not safe at all'.
There have been several accidents at Ukrainian nuclear facilities recently,
two at Chernobyl. Two of the Chernobyl reactors are operating at the moment.
At other plants, the priority was to modernise operational units and those
still under construction. 'We can introduce up to three units a year,' Mr
Kravchuk added. 'This is why we are looking for technical and financial
assistance from the west.'
Mr Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, said last night he hoped a new Bank fund launched by the Group
of Seven nations to help upgrade nuclear power plants in eastern Europe
could be operating by March.
According to an expert study, the east European states would need help with
60 nuclear plants, 14 of which should be closed.
Mr Attali estimated that the fund would need Dollars 60m for its legal
establishment and Dollars 400m to start work.
According to Mr Eberhard von Koerber, executive vice-president of ABB Asea
Brown Boveri, it was widely recognised that the Dollars 10bn cost of making
nuclear power plants in eastern Europe safe would have to be borne largely
by the west. But so far, even the Dollars 700m agreed at the G7 Munich
summit had not been raised, and 'even when modest funding is arranged, it is
blocked by bureaucratic impediments'.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Leading Article: After the punt devaluation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YET ANOTHER punch-drunk European currency, the Irish punt, has thrown in the
towel. Before the Dutch guilder, the Belgian franc, the Danish krone and the
French franc are forced from the ring, European Community policy-makers
should ask themselves whether what they gain is still worth the pain.
The difficulty facing the ERM is not currency misalignments and it is not
the condemned 'speculators' who are merely the bearers of the bad news.
Their message is that real short-term rates of interest in continental
Europe, now around 7 per cent, are far too high in a deepening Europe-wide
recession. The speculators are not irrational. They are merely giving
governments - or, if not governments, their electorates - credit for common
sense.
Every country in Europe, except Germany (though many would disagree there
too), needs far lower interest rates. The question is whether they will get
them in time. Even Paris, the most resolute upholder of the 'hard ERM', must
recognise that persistence with rigeur may lead not to the sunlit uplands,
but to a breakdown with damaging political, as well as economic,
consequences. Tactical flexibility may now be a more satisfactory route to
the strategic goal of Emu than persistence along the EC's present course.
Rate cut
The only escape would be a large reduction in German interest rates. Various
German financial figures are suggesting early cuts. But how far are these
likely to go? If Germany is to avoid a deep recession in 1993 and perhaps
1994 and France a recession of almost equal intensity, German short-term
rates of interest might have to fall to 6 per cent within a few months. The
chances remain small.
If the Bundesbank is not to provide relief, what are the alternatives?
Greater co-operation over exchange rate intervention is of modest help when
the form of co-operation most needed - looser German monetary policy and
tighter German fiscal policy - is unavailable. Realignments, though
inescapable under severe pressure, are of limited benefit too, unless large.
The problem of persistently high interest rates remains, since realignment
can help here only if subsequent upward realignments against the D-Mark
become credible.
It would have been best to have agreed a temporary suspension of the D-Mark
upon German unification. It remains the best option. Let the Bundesbank
fight its battle for stability unhampered by the monetary consequences of
foreign exchange intervention and relink exchange rates when German
inflation is once more where the Bundesbank wants it. Yet an agreed
suspension of other currencies need not do them much harm. Given the strong
fundamentals of the French economy, in particular, the franc might lose
little value, even with lower interest rates.
Wider bands
An alternative would be temporarily wider bands. But these would have to be
wide enough to allow currencies a reasonable chance of appreciation within
the ERM and so lower short-term interest rates than Germany's.
Under the Maastricht treaty, a country does not have to maintain its parity
within the ERM for more than two years prior to joining in the third stage.
This means that suspension of modification of the ERM need not preclude Emu
at its earliest possible date, provided the full ERM were restored by the
beginning of 1995. Such a restoration could be announced alongside a current
suspension or move to wider bands.
The alternative to greater flexibility is either fighting on or immediate
moves to a mini-Emu. But the latter path would be divisive within the EC and
no less within the putative participants. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank president, has already shown his opposition. Worse, a mini-Emu
would not even help much, unless the Germans were to accept that German
inflation would have a substantially smaller weight than now.
C'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la guerre; and it is not sensible
monetary policy either. European leaders should ask themselves whether their
strategic goal of European union might not be better served by a temporary
retreat than by galloping on to glorious defeats or Pyrrhic victories.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Mr Lamont's big chance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUDGET that he is to present on March 16 is likely to be Mr Norman
Lamont's last, or so many in the City and Westminster think. He must rise to
the occasion. Otherwise, he risks going down in history as an unhappy cross
between the prime minister's poodle and his scapegoat, having presided,
insouciantly, over the deepest recession since the 1930s and the sharpest
deterioration of the public finances to occur in peacetime. Mr Lamont has
nothing to fear but fear itself. He should dare to be bold.
The tasks the chancellor should set himself are to present a convincing
prospect of recovery, a sustainable profile for the public finances and, if
possible, an attractive vision of fiscal reform. So dreadful is the state of
the economy and so dire the state of the public finances that this must seem
almost impossible. But it is not, or at least not altogether. This is the
first Budget of the new parliament; it is the first of two Budgets this
year; and it is also the first post-ERM Budget. All these give the
chancellor important opportunities.
Assume the worst
First, however, Mr Lamont should assume the worst, not only on prospects for
the economy, but also on those for the Budget and the balance of payments.
There are three reasons for advising a bias towards gloom in the preparation
of this Budget: first, the worst - dismally slow growth and fiscal deficits
of well over 10 per cent of gross domestic product stretching into the
distant future - could quite easily happen; second, if this were to be how
things turn out, the government could find itself without politically
tolerable means for tackling the ensuing disaster and no time within which
to do so either; third, should things turn out better than feared, it would
always be possible to make more politically popular adjustments later, as
the next election approaches.
What might advice to be bold, but also to assume the worst, mean in
practice?
The chancellor's starting point must be with the way in which monetary and
fiscal policy became disastrously unbalanced within the ERM: a public sector
debt repayment of 3 per cent of gross domestic product in 1988-89 will, says
the Institute for Fiscal Studies in its Green Budget, turn into a public
sector borrowing requirement (less privatisation receipts) of 9 1/2 per cent
of GDP only five years later, while the ratio of net public debt to GDP will
rise by 50 per cent between 1990 and 1994 alone. Meanwhile, the growth rate
of broad money (M4) has fallen from an average of 16 per cent a year between
1985 and 1990 to a dismal 3.7 per cent in the year to December 1992.
Gradual approach
The government has begun to put things right. Monetary policy has been
loosened, although real short-term rates of interest remain quite high. Base
rate of interest may have to be pushed down still more before the vicious
cycle of debt deflation is put into reverse. But if the chancellor is to
dare loosen monetary policy further, he must offer a sustainable fiscal
prospect. That he cannot now do.
The only question is when Mr Lamont should act on the public finances. The
answer, given the fragility of the economic position, on the one hand, and
the rapid build-up of public debt, on the other, is sooner rather than
later, but not at once. Mr Lamont should announce a large fiscal adjustment,
including higher taxes on spending, in the March Budget, but the bulk of
that adjustment should be postponed to the financial year 1994-95. Mr Lamont
should also announce further fiscal adjustments that could be put into
effect depending on circumstances at the time of this year's second Budget.
The great advantages of this approach are that it would bring spending
forward, hastening the faltering recovery; it would make the fiscal outlook
tolerable, rendering lower rates of interest on long-term bonds more likely;
and it would make still lower short-term interest rates appear part of an
overall strategy, not just another sign of panic.
On March 16 Mr Lamont should be daring. This may be his last chance to
rescue both the economy and his own battered reputation.
This is the first of a series of leaders on the March Budget.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Tensions of the French connection: France's policy of
stabilising the franc against the D-Mark is facing its sternest test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The Germans will respect us only if we have a strong currency.'
 - Adviser to Mr Pierre Beregovoy, French finance minister, 1985
As the weaker currencies melt one by one in the furnace of the European
exchange rate mechanism (ERM), France's policy of stabilising the franc
against the D-Mark is facing its sternest test.
Governments of both left and right under President Francois Mitterrand have
backed the franc fort with impressive continuity since Mr Mitterrand's
first, ill-fated dash for reflation ended in 1983. But, underlined by the
squalls forcing the weekend devaluation of the Irish punt, France has not
yet earned sufficient credibility and strength for financial markets to
believe that the policy will never be abandoned.
In contrast to Britain, France has avoided negative growth during the
European economic slowdown, while its prowess on weak export markets is
illustrated by a FFr30bn (Pounds 3.68bn) trade surplus last year. Yet, with
unemployment now nearly 3m, the economy is rapidly sliding into recession
under the dual burden of high German interest rates and the devaluations by
many of France's European trading rivals since last autumn.
France is trying to remain aloof from the monetary flare-up surrounding the
punt. The French franc was trading comfortably within its ERM margins on
Friday - but this relative calm has been bought at a high, and rising,
price.
French monetary tensions were illustrated by the rise of one-month French
money market rates on Friday to 13.5 per cent. Short-term French interest
rates thus carry a 'risk premium' of nearly 5 percentage points above
equivalent German rates. This is despite a fall in the French inflation rate
last year to a 36-year-low of 2 per cent, half the current German rate of
4.4 per cent, pushed up by Germany's unification strains as well as an
increase in value added tax.
The burden of high French interest rates has been kept within limits. Under
government orders, French banks have held base lending rates to 10 per cent.
None the less, the chairman of a leading French investment bank laments
that, since inflation in the industrial sector is zero or even negative, the
10 per cent base rate represents not just a nominal but also a real interest
rate. He complains that the economy is falling foul to a 'war of ideology'
over the exchange rate - caused, he says, by France's 'fixation with
Germany'.
The link with Germany is all-encompassing. The overriding political
rationale for a firm franc was strengthened by the upheaval of German
unification in 1989-90, when France reacted to the spectre of a larger,
potentially dominant Germany by intensifying its drive for European union.
The turbulent economic outcome of unification - soaring German fiscal
deficits, a Bundesbank monetary squeeze, and recession - is now undermining
French policy aimed at containing its eastern neighbour. Maintaining a
strong exchange rate, which has contributed to France's improved inflation
and foreign trade performance, is the centrepiece of economic strategy. It
has also become the touchstone of foreign policy - backed both by the
Socialist administration of Mr Beregovoy, prime minister since last year,
and by the new right-wing administration likely to take over after the
national assembly elections next month.
The franc fort represents the mechanism with which France, under the
Maastricht treaty, can eventually achieve European economic and monetary
union. Emu would represent the emasculation of German monetary power - the
accommodation of a larger Germany in a united Europe through the replacement
of the D-Mark by a single European currency.
During the campaign before the Maastricht referendum in September, Mr
Beregovoy reminded his compatriots that setting up a single currency would
allow France to recover control over its monetary affairs largely ceded to
the Bundesbank. Breaking the D-Mark/franc link in 1993 would not
automatically block the path to Emu. Under Maastricht, this would take place
in 1997 at the earliest. Yet, at a time when Britain and Denmark still have
not ratified the treaty, and most European countries (including Germany) are
failing to meet the Maastricht economic performance targets, a franc
devaluation could eliminate the already-weakened political will behind Emu.
If France followed the line taken by Britain and Italy in September of
leaving the ERM, rather than simply devaluing within it, the mechanism would
be reduced to nothing more than the EC's 'snake' stabilisation scheme of the
1970s.
A French exit from the ERM - similar to the two French departures from the
'snake' in 1974 and 1976 - would spare Gallic pride. It would allow French
ministers to claim (as British ones have been doing since September) that
they had decided simply to 'float' rather than to 'devalue'. More
importantly, by leaving the ERM, as opposed to devaluing within it, France
could open the optimistic option of cutting interest rates and eventually
floating upwards against a weakening D-Mark.
Up to now, France's policy of maintaining its D-Mark parity has been given
solid support from Bonn and Frankfurt. The longer-term objective of the
franc fort policy - the replacement of the D-Mark by a single European
currency - is regarded with suspicion by the Bundesbank and German public
opinion. But the Bundesbank well recognises the political stakes involved as
well as the importance for Germany's exporters of maintaining stable
exchange rates with its senior foreign trade partner.
Amid a display of Franco-German monetary co-operation envied by governments
in Britain and smaller ERM members, France weathered the crisis accompanying
the September ERM exit of sterling and the lira. The Bundesbank has however
stopped well short of volunteering unlimited support for the franc. And Mr
Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, last week quashed speculation
of an accelerated Franco-German drive to Emu.
Ostensibly, leading right-wing politicians likely to form the new Paris
government are backing the present government's franc policy. Mr Edmond
Alphandery, the centre-right UDF deputy tipped by many as the next finance
minister, said last week: 'To maintain confidence, we must absolutely avoid
decoupling the franc from the D-Mark.'
As far as industry is concerned, the French government maintains that
devaluations by Britain, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Scandinavian countries and
now Ireland are not a problem, because France has built up competitive gains
by squeezing unit costs since the end of the 1980s. But precisely because
devaluation elsewhere has increased the temptation for France to do
likewise, right-wing parties are split on the wisdom of the present
strategy. And the right's natural allies in industry are broadcasting rising
concern.
Mr Francois Perigot, the president of the Patronat employers' federation,
has loyally defended the Socialist government's franc fort policy in public.
But he said last week: 'We cannot eternally stand the interest rates
practised by the Germans, and the exchange rates practised by the British.'
The Patronat is hoping for a relaxation in German monetary policy. If the
Bundesbank during the next few weeks moves to cut its discount and Lombard
rates, currently 8.25 per cent and 9.5 per cent, the pressure on the franc
could ease.
A strong body of opinion in the Bundesbank policy-making council favours a
gesture to preserve Franco-German bonds. However, a more influential
faction, led by Mr Schlesinger, believes a convincing path to the
Bundesbank's 2 per cent inflation target is not yet in sight. These
officials argue that premature easing, before definite signs emerge of
reduced wage and fiscal pressures, would be damaging for Germany's long-term
outlook.
During the next few weeks, the level of Franco-German anxiety seems likely
to grow. The show of strong nerves by the French government will probably go
on; but the performance which determines the future of the franc will take
place not in Paris, but in Frankfurt.

Legend already has it that while Bill Clinton was out driving with his wife
before the inauguration, he pulled into a busy filling station for fuel.
Hillary, thinking herself less likely to draw unwelcome attention, got out
and filled up then went to one of the paybooths where, to her husband's
annoyance, she spent a long time chatting familiarly to the man at the till.
'What a coincidence,' she said on returning. 'We were at college together -
in fact, I dated him until I met you.'
'So if I hadn't come along, you'd now be married to a gas station
attendant,' said her husband. 'No,' she replied, 'I'd be married to the
president of the US.'

Who could dispute that one quality needed in every army officer is backbone?
So full marks to whoever thought of stressing the point in the latest
advertisement for recruits to the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst.
Seeking to boost the entry in May, which is always smaller than its
counterparts in January and September, the ad pictures a human spine with
the catch-phrase: '150 jobs. One basic qualification.'
Then again, though, there are backbones and backbones. And Observer is
pained to report, on medical advice, that the one portrayed looks to be
female.
Surprised, Grant Duncan who handles the army account at advertising agency
Collett Dickenson Pearce admits that a male spine was intended. Moreover, he
says, the picture was checked with a Harley Street specialist.
The army remains unshaken. The response was proving quite good, it says, and
anyway, 'it just shows our dedication to equal opportunities . . .'

Even though the Habsburgs long since lost their empire and throne, the
imperial family can still get itself into a right twitter when one of its
own marries a commoner.
Take yesterday's wedding of Austrian crown prince Karl Habsburg-Lothringen
to German steel heiress Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza. The Thyssens own the
world's second-largest private art collection and are worth upwards of
Dollars 1.5bn. But they're still commoners, and a prince is supposed to
marry a fellow royal.
When attempts to block the match failed, most Habsburgs snubbed the
reception and now threaten to deny Karl recognition as head of the family
when his father Otto, the 80-year-old MEP, passes on.
Courtiers are especially upset about the Swiss-born Francesca's wild past
which has caught the fancy of gossip columnists. Meanwhile Karl, the 32-year
old grandson of the last emperor, has started work as a game show host on
Austrian TV, and seems more interested in his ratings than his imaginary
throne.
'We used to have subjects, now we have an audience,' said one Habsburg,
snootily spurning the wedding in a small Styrian pilgrims' town.

Just as headlines announcing 'England's collapse' are apt to alarm overseas
visitors not acquainted with cricket, news of 'a plague of ruddy ducks' will
probably set UK cricket fans fearing still worse developments at the Test in
India.
But the plague in question is striking a different sort of game, perhaps
irrecoverably, and much nearer home - in Spain. For 15 years
conservationists there have been working to counter the extinction of the
white-headed duck. Although the species is also found in North Africa and
western Asia, by 1977 the number in Spain had fallen to a mere 22.
Alas, just as things were waddling along nicely with numbers up to 790, in
came the ruddy ducks, which aren't even native Europeans. They originate in
America, and the only reason they are multiplying eastwards is that some
imported specimens escaped from wildlife centres four decades ago.
That hasn't stopped them from mating like Don Juans with the white-headed
Spanish. And the cross-breeding is now undoing the conservationists' good
work to the extent that they've taken to shooting the ruddy interlopers.
Naturally, Britain's environment department cannot stand idly by in such
circumstances. So it has formed a Ruddy Duck Working Group to study the
problem, funding research at centres including the Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands trust
 -which happens to be where the blasted things escaped from in the first
place.

<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Few trends could so thoroughly undermine the very foundations of our free
society as the acceptance by corporate officials of social responsibility
other than to make as much money for their shareholders as possible.'
This assertion of Milton Friedman's - like so many - combines provocative
exaggeration with an important kernel of truth.
The exaggeration is in the phrase 'make as much money as possible'. Friedman
is not advocating the shooting of business competitors or other Mafia
tactics. He is perfectly aware that the profit maximising game, if it is to
be in the general interest, requires a complex background of property
rights, law, and above all mutual trust. Every medieval fair had its own
body of accepted practice and tribunals for settling disputes.
Friedman probably regarded these aspects as too obvious to discuss when he
wrote these words in Capitalism and Freedom 30 years ago. If so, he was
wrong. The difficulties of the ex-communist countries in setting up market
economies show that the background of institutions is as important as the
removal of the constraints of the old regime. Moreover, cases further west,
such as the court award against British Airways for harassing Virgin, show
that observance of accepted business norms cannot be taken for granted
anywhere.
What Friedman was really getting at, however, was the doctrine that business
has to contribute to good causes, such as urban renewal, support of the
arts, or the out of hours welfare of its own employees, let alone sacrifice
profits to wrong headed causes such as Buy American or Buy British
campaigns.
The point is not that these activities (except for the last) are undesirable
but that it is up to individual citizens to decide how much to contribute.
Insofar as they favour collective action, such action should be through duly
constituted political processes and not through managers setting up as
taxing authorities over the funds of shareholders.
These reflections arise from an attitude survey, Business Ethics in the UK,
carried out for the Co-operative Bank by the University of Westminster. The
sample response of managers of 16 per cent was reasonable given the paper
which floods through business in-trays.
Participants were scored for 'ethical sensitivity' in their responses to 33
statements. The result, in the author's words, is that businessmen 'have
strong ethical beliefs about honesty and truthfulness in business dealings,
but there is also evidence of a tough freely competitive attitude'.
The statements offered for approval or disapproval, and the scoring system,
are more revealing than the answers. For instance, those who agreed that 'a
company has a duty to pay its workers a decent living wage, rather than as
little as they can' scored highly. Not only is the statement
question-begging, but the attitudes behind it encourage employers to sack
workers rather than trim pay - which is the reverse of ethical.
Unfortunately the majority answered the 'politically correct' way.
Other statements were systematically misleading, eg: 'There is nothing wrong
with selling low-quality goods, if that is what the public wants.' Taken
literally, the correct attitude should be the low-scoring 'strongly
against'; but there is a subtext hinting at deception or sharp practice. No
wonder that responses were evenly spread. One statement is economically
illiterate, namely: 'Products which use scarce resources should be banned.'
In that case nothing would be produced, for all resources are scarce and the
task of the price mechanism is to see they are not wasted.
The study is valuable despite the absurdities. It contains a worthwhile
discussion of why objectives other than short-term profit maximising emerge
from the Darwinian struggle of firms for survival. But before giving
executives ethical sensitivity ratings, future studies should reflect on
which attitudes really are and which are not helpful in the true ethical
sense of promoting the general welfare.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Letter: Working group set to resolve problems of safety for
shipping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From E E MITROPOULOS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The article on the shipping problems in the Strait of Malacca (January
26) highlighted a big problem quite accurately. But the headline,
'Malaysia's disaster warnings go unheeded in Strait of Malacca', was
inaccurate.
The International Maritime Organisation is so concerned about the situation
that at the end of last year the secretary-general, Mr W A O'Neil, formed a
special working group to consider, within the context of measures to prevent
and suppress piracy and armed robbery against ships, measures aimed at
enhancing navigational safety, environmental protection and other related
problems which exist in the region.
The working group consists of experts from a number of countries including
representatives of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. The group has already
held its first meeting at IMO headquarters and will fly to Kuala Lumpur on
February 27 for a 10-day visit to all three countries which will enable the
problems to be examined in detail.
Following the visit, a report will be prepared which will be presented to
IMO's senior technical body, the Maritime Safety Committee, which meets from
May 24-28. Since the committee consists of all 136 IMO member states, it is
expected that it will be able to take decision that will be of benefit to
shipping security, safety and environmental protection in south-east Asia.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Still standing after all these years: The City Corporation
survives because of its medieval flummery serves a practical purpose
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once again the City of London is in the dock. It is being forced to defend
one of the most bizarre yet integral of its institutions: the City
Corporation.
The corporation - the local authority for the 'square mile' - fears that the
home secretary's plans to amalgamate Britain's small police forces could
spell doom for its constabulary, the smallest in the country. Such alarm has
always been misplaced in the past, but it is resisting tenaciously all the
same.
The City Corporation is a remarkable relic of a bygone age. It lives on
because its medieval flummery serves a practical purpose - selling the
nation and City; and because its instinct for survival, and enlightened use
of its wealth, has kept it one step ahead of its pursuers.
'Looking at the three great medieval institutions left in England,' says Mr
Tony Travers, director of the Greater London Unit at the London School of
Economics, 'I would stake money on the City Corporation outliving the
monarchy and House of Lords. It's amazingly resilient in its own defence.'
If the corporation did not exist, no one would think of creating it. In
Dickens's day, more than 100,000 lived cheek-by-jowl in the stinking City
lanes and alleys he immortalised. Nowadays, the square mile has only 5,000
residents, largely yuppies and executives with pieds-a-terre in the Barbican
complex. No other inner London borough has fewer than 135,000 residents; and
neighbouring Westminster has to service at least as many commuters as the
City.
To govern its 5,000, the corporation has 132 common councilmen and 25
aldermen (the latter elected until retiring age), a ratio which if applied
to Birmingham would yield 31,000 councillors (it has 117). A number of
antiquated franchises give non-resident businessmen votes, and even allow
members of the City's 100 livery companies - successors of 11th-century
religious and social fraternities - a voice in the selection of the Lord
Mayor.
All of which makes the corporation an easy object of ridicule. But, says Mr
Travers, 'as a provider of local services, it is a model to which other
councils ought to aspire; and it has to be seen as a national, as much as a
local, institution.'
In its local authority capacity, the City runs a primary school. It has an
excellent library service, including a dedicated business library. Its
800-strong constabulary is the ultimate in community policing, and is widely
acknowledged to have a first-rate fraud squad. If its planning committee is
not short of critics, royal and common, controversies such as that over
Paternoster Square are not unusual for councils regulating development in
sensitive historical areas where people still have to work.
But even with the City's health service and the Old Bailey, both of which it
manages, the corporation's responsibilities hardly justify a separate local
authority. Most of its claim to existence depends upon its wider role in
London and the state.
Its assets are tradition and wealth. The ancient ceremony, complete with
tricorn hats, costumes, even swords and axes, which adorn every mayoral
function at Guildhall and Mansion House - the latter currently undergoing a
Pounds 20m restoration - are an established part of British state pageantry.
The Lord Mayor spends his year in office entertaining and being entertained.
'That, more than anything, exemplifies the uniqueness of the City; we
arrange it all closely with the Palace and the Foreign Office,' says Mr
Adrian Barnes, the Corporation's Remembrancer, a kind of master of
ceremonies.
With tradition comes influence of sorts. Abroad, the Lord Mayor is often
mistaken for 'Mr London'. Since no one else but the environment secretary
can claim that title, it gives no offence. Last year's Lord Mayor, Sir Brian
Jenkins, spoke out for Maastricht's proposed European Central Bank to be
located in London, taking the City's case to Brussels and across the
continent. The corporation is more cautious about projecting itself at home.
It kept its head down in the 1980s, anxious to avoid the political
cross-fire over the abolition of the Greater London Council. However, under
the leadership of Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of its important policy and
resources committee since last year, the corporation has taken a higher
profile. Its latest initiative is a 'one-stop shop' for potential overseas
investors in the capital, an idea it is pioneering with Westminster and the
Docklands Development Corporation.
As to wealth, the corporation owns more than a quarter of all the property
in the square mile, and has a large portfolio beyond (about 900 properties
in all). With a private income of Pounds 33m this year, it has ample scope
to play the benevolent patron. Furthermore, relative to the size of its
resident population, its local tax income - which is separate from its
private income - is far larger than that of other authorities. For uniquely,
it is not obliged to put all its income from non-domestic rates into the
national pool, a privilege worth Pounds 32m last year.
The corporation distributes its largesse to causes accumulated over a
century and more. The oldest are its three food markets - Spitalfields for
fruit and vegetables, Smithfield for meat, Billingsgate for fish - for which
the City has been responsible since the Middle Ages. It met a large part of
the bill for moving Spitalfields to Leyton, and Billingsgate to Docklands,
and is spending Pounds 40m on upgrading Smithfield to meet EC hygiene
standards.
Of more recent origin are the City's various schools. The corporation owns
and manages three public schools, including the City of London Schools for
Boys and Girls, for both of which it has built new premises in the past 20
years. It is also owner-governor of the internationally renowned Guildhall
School of Music and Drama, which takes 700 students from 40 countries.
Then there are 9,000 acres of forests, commons and open spaces in and around
London. Epping Forest, Burnham Beaches, Highgate Wood, Queen's Park, West
Ham Park and various commons in Kent and Surrey all sport the City logo.
They are mostly acquisitions of the 1870s and 1880s, when the corporation,
anticipating the Green Belt movement, acted to safeguard open spaces on the
fringes of the capital, securing an Act of Parliament giving it power to
acquire land within 25 miles of the City for the 'recreation and enjoyment'
of the public.
Hampstead Heath's 700 acres are the latest addition, a share of the former
GLC's spoils. It was a shrewd move by the City: in its first year it footed
Pounds 1.5m of the Pounds 2.4m bill for the heath's upkeep, which other
boroughs could have ill afforded.
The jewel in the City's Crown is the Barbican Centre. Opened 20 years ago,
its assemblage of theatres, art galleries, cinemas, concert halls, bars and
restaurants is London's largest art forum. The corporation funds the
Barbican to the tune of Pounds 11m a year, plus repayments of nearly twice
that on capital. It also subsidises the centre's two resident companies -
the London Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Shakespeare Company - by about
Pounds 2.5m this year on top of their state funding.
Like all patrons, the corporation's relationship with its proteges is often
tense. Relations with the RSC have been particularly frosty: Baroness Detta
O'Cathain, the Barbican Centre's director since 1990, spent much of her
first year in a war of words with Mr Terry Hands, the RSC's then artistic
director.
But the baroness, used to fraught negotiations from her previous job
managing the Milk Marketing Board, lauds the corporation as patron. 'They
are not obsessed with continuously packed houses,' she says. 'We can afford
to be both Classic FM and Radio Three.' Last month, the entire centre was
devoted to a festival of Scandinavian arts - an artistic and box office
success, but requiring large subsidies, including a Pounds 300,000 grant
from the City Corporation.
The Barbican, too, is undergoing refurbishment at the corporation's expense.
One of the baroness's main concerns is to give the centre a proper entrance.
The most complex maze in London, it currently has 123 ways in and out but no
identifiable entrance or intelligible signposts.
Much the same could be said of the corporation itself. With wealth,
tradition, and a myriad of functions and activities, it is more than the sum
of its heterogeneous parts, and has friends in most corners of the
Establishment. Says Mr Travers: 'If it survived the 1980s, the corporation
should have no problem with the next seven centuries' - with or without a
police force.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Letter: Rate cut beyond expectations needed to jump start
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof DEEPAK LAL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The British Treasury seems to be repeating the errors of the US Federal
Reserve which cost George Bush the US election. Gradual interest rate cuts
based on lagged ex-post indicators of continuing economic sluggishness will
not jump start the economy as they will be perceived as doing too little too
late. For the debt deflation common to both the US and UK requires a
Wicksellian response - with the market rate being pushed well below the
'natural' rate of interest - resulting in an immediate boost to
interest-sensitive spending as the public expects future interest rates to
rise rather than fall.
As no one knows the current natural rate of interest - though a figure of a
2 to 3 per cent real rate would not be historically implausible - the only
sensible short run course is to cut the market rate below the level anyone
expects it to fall (say 3 to 4 per cent). This would leave little doubt that
future interest rates are likely to rise rather than fall - boosting current
spending. As soon as signs of overheating appeared, interest rates would
obviously have to be raised. However, because of 'White September' the
exchange rate need no longer enter into the calculations]

FT  01 FEB 93 / Letter: Privatisation supporters slow to back plans for
British Rail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTIN SHENFIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It will be interesting to see whether, as a consequence of your leader
on rail privatisation ('Privatising British Rail', January 26), others will
be encouraged to come forward to join the 'few faint voices of support' for
the government's proposals. Certainly, it is most strange that none of the
plethora of eminent merchant bankers and management consultants who have
been proudly 'privatising the world' has shown any strong inclination to
lend their support. Possibly, they are all too busy advising the Department
of Transport, British Rail, prospective bidders et al. Alternatively,
previous experience of providing advice overseas on rail privatisation may
have proved a chastening experience, particularly to those who have accepted
work on a success fee basis.
My own consultancy experience ranges from Serpell to the High Speed link, as
well as foreign privatisation plans. Such a track record reflects a
well-worn advisory path from the lack of political will to address BR's
problems by internal re-organisation in the early 1980s, to the eventual
failure of the much-heralded public/private sector Eurorail joint venture in
the face of the government's unwillingness to provide a subsidy. This
despite the private sector's ability to provide significant capital
investment funding.
Given the government's current willingness to provide subsidies to
prospective operators without seeking any commitment to new investment, are
we about to see the spectacle of the High Speed link saga entering a new
phase? With the ever-changing policies to British Rail, it may well be that
the reticent government supporters are just too giddy to put pen to paper.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Discreet force in fear of blue murder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A consignment of blank certificates of deposit was stolen in 1990 while
being delivered to a branch of the Banco di Spirito in Rome.
Later this year, 20 people will be tried in Italy for their alleged parts in
the theft and attempted fraudulent use of the 294 certificates which - had
the crime succeeded - could have cost banks more than Pounds 200m.
Between the theft and the arrests, detectives from the UK's smallest police
force - the City of London - played a central role in bringing the 20 to
trial. The accused are unlikely to learn the full story. Tracking down
stolen negotiable securities and preventing fraud, as opposed to
investigating it after it has taken place, involves police work of the most
discreet nature.
The 800-strong City force covers only the square mile and, while it has its
share of routine duties, differs considerably from the rest of the police
service. During 1991 it did not have a single murder, manslaughter or rape
to investigate. By contrast, it handled nearly 600 fraud cases.
One of the advantages for the City in having what amounts to a private
police force is the ability it gives senior officers to allocate extensive
resources to investigating and preventing financial irregularity. Members of
the City Corporation see this as an important contribution to maintaining
worldwide confidence in London as a financial centre, and fear it would be
diluted in an amalgamation with the Metropolitan police force.
Fraud, theft of securities and other attacks on the banking system occupy
officers from the central detective unit and the company fraud department -
which seconds staff to work with the Serious Fraud Office on the most
complex cases. Because of London's size as a financial centre, securities
stolen overseas are often presented in the City, drawing its police into a
growing amount of international activity.
Long fraud investigations are expensive as well as complicated. 'It is far
more cost-effective if we can, as with the Italian case, recover stolen
paper before fraudulent use is made of it, and catch people in the act,'
says Detective Superintendent Daniel McCarthy, deputy head of the City CID.
The Italian case took City detectives to Italy, Switzerland, Luxembourg,
France and Belgium. It brought them into contact with a group of
international criminals in the south of France specialising in financial
crime in Switzerland - in the age of electronic communication, criminals
need not set foot in the country where their crime is committed,
complicating investigations and prosecutions. The case led to the discovery
that money raised from the sale of the stolen certificates of deposit would
probably have been used to finance a drugs operation.
The official response to cross-border liaison includes international
conferences and co-ordination through Interpol and other agencies. In
practice, City detectives rely on contacts with trusted colleagues in other
European forces in order to act swiftly and jointly.
Growth in electronic trading will reduce the potential for theft of
negotiable paper. But Det Super McCarthy believes it will mean a
corresponding increase in computer fraud allied to the corruption of
individuals within financial institutions.
In 1991, the City force handled 105 new serious fraud cases which -
excluding some exceptional investigations such as Maxwell and BCCI -
involved attempts to obtain Pounds 946m. Of this, Pounds 936m was recovered
or saved from attempted fraud. At a time when the government is pressing for
value-for-money policing, these figures might seem likely to make the force
the toast of the Home Office.
But it is not so simple. Banks are reluctant to admit to the theft of
documents, or accept that procedures for cancelling them are not fully
effective, for fear that they might look less secure than competitors. This
 -allied to the unavoidably undercover nature of the detectives' work -
makes it difficult for them to boast of successes and compete for resources.
And, if opinion polls are to be believed, the public would in any case
sooner see resources devoted to reducing car radio thefts than thefts of
certificates of deposit.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Letter: Jumbo problem at airports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr G J I DOUGHERTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I wonder if the advent of the 'super jumbo' carrying up to 800
passengers ('Boeing and Airbus partners agree to super jumbo study', January
22) will mean even earlier check-in requirements and disembarkation delays
for long-haul travellers.
Is it too much to ask for a few of the several billions of dollars which
will be spent on the super jumbo to be diverted to help streamline airport
procedures, which already can mean upwards of two hours at each end of
long-haul flights, if my own experience of seven big international airports
recently is anything to go by?

FT  01 FEB 93 / Letter: Unrealistic base for banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From E C CADE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Geoffrey Gardiner goes too far in his letter (January 25) in
suggesting that a bank's equity base should be 'represented by realisable
assets'. The implication is that all unrealisable assets should be matched
with non-equity liabilities such as deposits, or that there are no such
assets (which is an unrealistic expectation).
Since equity capital is risk capital, it is fair that a portion of it should
be represented by the infrastructural investments of the business, which
will be to some degree 'unrealisable'.
A proportion of equity should admittedly be free of such encumbrance, and it
is another deficiency of the Basel approach that it jettisoned the 'free
equity ratio' that had traditionally been part of the prudential armoury.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Arts: Give more, get more - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme, designed to encourage new
sponsors for the arts through government-financed matching grants, is to be
revamped. From April 1 an arts organisation will be able to receive up to
Pounds 50,000 a year (as against the current Pounds 25,000) in BSIS top-ups,
and the maximum amount of matching cash for each individual first-time
sponsorship has been raised from Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 35,000.
The government is funding the BSIS in 1993-94 with Pounds 4.5m (no increase
on the current year), and the scheme continues to be administered by the
Association for Business Sponsorship. In nine years it has generated Pounds
59m in 'new money' for the arts. The change will help organisations such as
the Royal Academy, which is very dependent on sponsors and finds them easier
to attract if their contribution can unlock extra money from the government.
In future an arts organisation will be able to receive four BSIS awards a
year rather than two. This makes things easier for small sponsors which were
sometimes turned away by larger arts organisations concerned to secure two
big BSIS awards.
Applications for BSIS money provide a good indicator of enthusiasm among
companies towards sponsorship of the arts. There has been an increase in
BSIS awards in 1992-93 - but for smaller sums, confirming that it is small
and medium-sized companies that are making good the shortfall in sponsorship
caused by the withdrawal of some big corporations. Even so, there is still
money left in this year's kitty, which should encourage a flow of last
minute applications.
Raising the size of the individual grants, while keeping the overall budget
frozen, suggests that the government, and ABSA, does not expect a great rise
in new arts sponsorships in 1993-94.
BT is consolidating its position as the leading corporate sponsor of the
arts in the UK. This year it will spend Pounds 1.7m of its charity and
community budget on the arts, and last month it announced two new
initiatives.
Over the next three years it will invest Pounds 200,000 in 'Making More of
Music', a partnership with the National Federation of Music Societies which
will inject professional help, through workshops, training, and public
performances, into the activities of the 1,300 amateur music societies that
are members of the NFMS.
BT already helps amateur dramatic societies through the BT Biennial, which
creates a new play by a leading writer for performance in the amateur
theatre. This grass roots work is in line with the new thinking. Even the
Arts Council is starting to encourage popular participation in the arts.
The other initiative is the BT curriculum hotline, a Pounds 20,000 venture
with the English Shakespeare Company. With Shakespeare now written into the
national curriculum some schools need help in understanding the Bard. A call
to the hotline brings advice, and, in 250 cases, the arrival at the school
of actors to devise a workshop. Obviously BT regards its arts sponsorship as
enabling money as opposed to the concept of a company 'buying' an arts
organisation or event for PR or hospitality purposes.
BMW is another sponsor that is not cutting back. It has doubled its
commitment for 1993, putting a six figure sum behind the Rouault exhibition
which opens next month at the Royal Academy. It likes the fact that the
pictures are displayed in the smartly modern Sackler Gallery.
The late arrival of BMW has cheered up the RA, which a few months ago was
short of sponsors for many of its 1993 shows. Harpers &amp; Queens is also
coming in, contributing a barrage of coverage of the Rouault exhibition.
Like many sponsors these days BMW is linking its support to a brand - the
BMW 8 Series - rather than to the corporate name. This has one notable
financial advantage: the brand can be designated a first-time sponsor and
qualify for a full Pounds 25,000 top-up under the BSIS.
Unfortunately the RA had already been helped with Pounds 15,000 this year
from other sponsors through the BSIS, which meant that it could only receive
another Pounds 10,000 before it reached its limit. Cleverly the RA has been
able to receive the full Pounds 25,000 of BMW-linked money by directing the
cash towards the RA Schools, which is designated as a separate arts
organisation. Wise sponsors know how to work the scheme.
For years arts organisations had been trying to interest Hanson, one of the
UK's most profitable companies, in sponsorship, invariably with no success.
So it was a shock when the National Youth Theatre announced that it was to
receive Pounds 1m from the company, albeit spread over five years. There was
no surprise how the NYT got the money: through the personal contact between
its president, Bryan Forbes, and James Hanson. That is still the way that
most arts sponsorships are sealed.
What was surprising was that Hanson said its money must go towards operating
costs rather than into productions. There was a veiled threat that the money
was dependent on the NYT getting matching sponsorship support to underwrite
its productions.
It has made a good start. British Gas has promised Pounds 75,000 over three
years to finance auditions and workshops, and impresario Cameron Mackintosh
has given Pounds 25,000 towards a musical production. Price Waterhouse is
sponsoring the London production at the Greenwich Theatre with Pounds
15,000, and smaller sums have come from Coca-Cola, the Woolwich and Reed
International. However, the main event of the NYT's summer season, a rare
performance of the Bernstein Mass, still needs more financial help before it
can be confirmed.
Foster's Lager is another first-time arts sponsor qualifying for Pounds
25,000 from the BSIS. Its initiation happened last night at an Australia Day
Gala concert with Jose Carreras at the Royal Opera House. The evening cost
it Pounds 100,000 but Foster's lager flowed for the first time at Covent
Garden.
Manchester Airport is proving a stalwart backer of the arts. It is putting
Pounds 300,000 behind 'Manchester, City of Drama'. This Arts Council backed
event does not happen until 1994 but the airport is announcing its
commitment early pour encourager les autres.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Arts: Small, beautiful and endangered - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It should never be forgotten that 'Small is beautiful'. In the world of
architectural conservation there are, at the moment, a large number of small
but important buildings that are in considerable danger. As Lloyd's losses
continue to mount, what is to be the future of the smaller manor houses, the
more modest stately homes that many estate agents assure me are due to come
on the market in the next year? The natural instinct of owners of good
houses is to hang on until the last possible moment - even with the bailiffs
at the door, selling up is the last resort.
A great part of England's beauty comes from small scale things, and it is
these that are the most fragile. The larger houses and the obvious
masterpieces, while not easy to save, do attract attention; and merit
usually brings protection. The sad dispersal of the contents of Pitchford
Hall, in Shropshire, and the failure of the Department of National Heritage
to act with other national bodies to save the house, ought to provide a
lesson for the future. But what about the glorious Heveningham Hall (not
small but a masterpiece) in Suffolk, which is still empty and on the market?
The situation at Heveningham is entirely the responsibility of Michael
Heseltine, now trade and industry secretary, who sold the house to a private
owner in 1981 after it had been bought by the nation for just over Pounds
300,000 in 1970. Today the receivers are hoping for some Pounds 4m;
meanwhile the house is empty, the park neglected and there seems to be
little interest in its future.
There seems to be a lack of will to tackle heritage problems in any logical
way. In fact the leaky-umbrella government organisations such as English
Heritage seem to make a point of not having a policy, and frequently react
to situations only at the last minute. If there are serious problems when it
comes to the protection of national monuments like Heveningham Hall, what
can be the future for those subtle, small and delicate places that are the
real fabric of England?
Take Groombridge Place and Groombridge village in Kent - a house and
settlement that still embody many of the best qualities of relatively modest
architecture and landscape. Groombridge Place is a wonderfully unaltered
mid-17th century house that leapt to unexpected fame as the setting for
Peter Greenaway's film The Draughtsman's Contract. House and village were,
until recently, one unified place. This feudal continuity was rudely
interrupted and broken in 1991 when the house, farms and cottages were put
on the market: because of the recession they took a long time to sell and
were eventually divided between several owners. A local builder acquired 54
acres and some barns - presumably not to let the fields lie fallow. One
property company owns a slice of the village, the pub and the green. Yet
another owns Groombridge Place itself and the park and other lands.
It is the planning application from Andrew de Candole and his company
Blenheim Asset Management that has caused more than a flutter in the local
dovecotes. The company has applied for permission to build an access road
and car park for some 200 cars, and a coach park, on an important part of
the Grade II* listed grounds. Permission is also being sought to convert
some listed barns into a visitor's centre with shop and restaurant. The
owners plan to open the restored gardens and the visitor's centre to the
public on a regular basis, encouraging picnics and walks in areas that have
enjoyed peace and privacy until now.
English Heritage has objected to the siting of the car park beside the river
in the important gap between the old and newer parts of the village. As its
letter to the planners at Tunbridge Wells says: 'we would therefore oppose
this site for the car park and, given the sensitivity of the whole of this
site, are hard-pushed to suggest another one.' The site proposed also
appears worrying on the grounds of road safety.
It is not just the details of the Groombridge applications that are
disturbing. It is the fact that this sort of proposal could undermine the
rare qualities of the place. Private ownership of this sort of house and
estate used to bring with it a sense of public responsibility. In the past
this responsibility included leaving things alone and undisturbed. Small,
beautiful places should not be commercially exploited to this extent. The
outcome of the Groombridge application is uncertain at the moment and it
could well go to appeal and out of the hands of the local authorities.
It is a sad, unnecessary situation and will provoke a lot of opposition
because it is in a part of the country where articulate neighbours will go a
long way to see that their locality is preserved. The equally sad thing is
that there are dozens of other houses and gardens that are empty and for
sale throughout the country. The future for the small, beautiful place is
looking daily more uncertain. Are vigilance and patience enough to secure
their future without any official intervention?

This is a particularly meaty Monday night for documentaries, but for plenty
of viewers the pick of the bunch may be World in Action's Don't Bank on Us
(ITV, 8.30), an investigation into the abrupt decline in reputation
experienced by Britain's banks. The programme, postponed from last week,
examines allegations of over-charging.
Looking beyond such parochial concerns, there is the first of a two-part
Panorama, The Bitter-Enders (BBC 1, 9.30), in which David Dimbleby looks
deep into the heart of South Africa's tragic and seemingly unstoppable
violence. 'Bitter-enders', it appears, were the Afrikaners who turned their
backs on peace at the close of the Boer War.
Horizon; No Ordinary Genius (BBC 2, 8.00) concludes its portrait of the
prodigiously talented physicist, Richard Feynman.
Earlier, a well-made and enthralling series returns to the screen, A Secret
World of Sex (BBC 2, 7.30). Tonight's episode is a reminder of a time, not
long ago, when for a woman to have a child out of wedlock could be
interpreted as deviation bordering on lunacy.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Arts: Choirs at St John's - Concerts in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the phenomena of the 1980s was the rise of small classical music
groups, which took their affairs into their own hands. To see the potential
rewards, one has only to look at the Tallis Scholars, a group which has
aggressively promoted its activities through setting up its own record label
and which has won an enormous following both in Britain and overseas - an
example which other choirs are starting to emulate.
At St John's, Smith Square last week a pair of choral evenings gave the hall
two well-filled houses. The Tallis Scholars' new recordings regularly
feature in the best-sellers lists of the smaller record companies and a good
audience must almost be assured when they appear, but we should not take
their popularity for granted. Twenty years ago it would have been
unthinkable to draw so many people to a programme of composers as obscure as
Morales, Lupi and Verdelot.
Under the direction of Peter Phillips, the choir has specialised in the
unaccompanied sacred music of the Renaissance. There is no other comparable
group that can match the focus of these voices, not a hint of vibrato, their
sound searingly clear. In Morales's Missa Mille regretz there may have been
more opportunity to vary the tone colour than they took; but Lassus's
Magnificat (no 100) was a well-nigh unsurpassable example of small choir
singing, crisp, alert, unanimous in rhythm and spirit.
Anybody who missed Wednesday's concert, which also included a beautifully
serene Ave Maria by Ludwig Senfl, still has the opportunity to catch the
Tallis Scholars in the second of their St John's appearances next week.
Unfortunately, it is another year to wait for the return of the
Birmingham-based chamber choir, Ex Cathedra.
On Saturday it presented a programme entitled 'Music for the Kings of
France'. There is every sign that this is an ambitious group. Like The
Tallis Scholars, it has founded its own record label, on which its first CD,
of the Vivaldi Vespers, has now appeared. But in this case the choir does
not intend to lift its profile through specialisation: Dvorak and Stravinsky
also feature in its current season.
At about 30 members, it is the right size for the music of the composers of
Louis XIV's reign. Both Lalande's Jubilate and Du Mont's Magnificat employ a
'petit choeur', here taken by fresh young solo voices from within Ex
Cathedra. Lalande's Concert de trompettes also allowed the Ex Cathedra
Baroque Orchestra, softer-grained than other original-instrument bands that
I have heard at St John's, to show its very professional paces.
The main work was Charpentier's Te Deum Laudamus, receiving its first London
performance in a new edition by Lionel Sawkins. Under Jeffrey Skidmore's
direction, this was music-making of enormous eclat, the choral singing
zestful, the trumpets ringing out with brazen vigour: Ex Cathedra will be
welcome at St John's more often.
Tallis Scholars' second pro- gramme is on February 10 (Box Office 071-222

FT  01 FEB 93 / Arts: Mozart &amp; Walton - Concerts in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For its regular London visits the Chamber Orchestra of Europe is careful to
ring the changes with conductors. Inevitably the founder of the orchestra,
Claudio Abbado, appears less regularly nowadays, and the range of guests
continues to widen. But the COE's concerts with Nikolaus Harnoncourt have
retained a special cachet, an unfailing sense of anticipation.
Harnoncourt manages to bring to every performance an element of invention
and discovery. His approach may be founded upon the most impeccable of
stylistic considerations, but working with an orchestra of such refinement
and intelligence he sets aside period-instrument point-making and
concentrates upon making invigorating music. On Friday he conducted the COE
in Mozart, coupling the Haffner Serenade K250 with the D Major Haffner
Symphony K385. All were joyously inventive, full of rhythmic life and airy,
sparkling textures.
The symphony carries its own charge, but it was an enormous achievement of
both conductor and the orchestra to give the Serenade a similar vitality.
Prefaced by the March K249, as at the premiere in 1776, the performance
lasted an hour but Harnoncourt found fascinating detail and allusion in
every movement, setting its public display of extrovert good humour against
the flashes of darker, deeper feelings. In the three-movement violin
concerto that lies at the heart of the serenade the soloist was the leader
of the COE, Marieke Blankestijn. In keeping with the corporate solidarity of
the orchestra her playing was not at all spotlit or assertive but carefully
dovetailed into its surroundings, which is not to deny the musicality or the
technical assurance with which she invested every line.
* A violin concerto of very different temper was the centrepiece of the
Royal Philharmonic Orchestra's Walton programme on Saturday, conducted by
Vladimir Ashkenazy. It was Joshua Bell's first attempt at the work, and an
enviably convincing one. Bell brought to the solo part a wonderful easy
lyricism without the self-regarding brilliance of, say, the famous Heifetz
recording or the sweet-toothed sentimentality that has characterised more
indulgent performances.
Bell's tone is relatively lean, never overblown, and beautifully inflected.
He made the opening movement intimate without becoming maudlin, and
dispatched the virtuosity of the remainder with relaxed ease. There is a
naturalness about his playing that belies his scrupulous preparation and
sets him apart from most of his contemporaries; by any standard this was a
remarkably convincing performance.
Ashkenazy was always at pains to buoy up the violin line with careful
instrumental support, but there was no further evidence that he conducts
Walton with instinctive flair and understanding. Both the Scapino overture
and the First Symphony had great technical brilliance; the brass especially
was on excellent form. But any spark of humour was lacking from the
overture, while the symphony had a machine-like inevitability.

FT  01 FEB 93 / People: More shrinking at John Foster
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The board at specialist textile group John Foster &amp; Son has shrunk further
with the departure of David Allen, 43, previously managing director, and
sales and marketing director Keith Halliday. Halliday, however, remains as a
consultant.
Peter Giles, a company doctor who was brought in to mastermind a
restructuring towards the end of last year, says that Halliday, who has been
with the company for 20 years, will continue to advise on Japan; that market
accounts, indirectly, for up to 60 per cent of sales, particularly
mohair-spun cloth for men's suits. Allen had been running John Foster before
Giles' arrival. 'There clearly was not a role for both of us,' the new boss
explains.
At the end of last year, Graham Creswick, the former finance director,
resigned, having served in a non-executive capacity for three months while
Giles was appointed. The company now has no finance director but Carol
Watkinson, who was made company secretary last September on the resignation
of Nicholas Butler, is also chief financial officer.
The company lost Pounds 1.8m in the half year to the end of August 1992, and
losses will continue into the second half, it predicts. Giles is putting in
place a programme of staff reductions, and pulling out of certain lines of
business to concentrate primarily on mohair.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Construction Contracts: Stockton-on-Tees scheme
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGGS &amp; HILL DEVEL OPMENTS has been appointed by Stockton-on-Tees City
Challenge Board to undertake a Pounds 30m town centre development (pictured
above).
The project will be undertaken as a partnership between Stockton-on-Tees
Borough Council, Stockton's City Challenge and Higgs &amp; Hill. Higgs &amp; Hill
Developments will be responsible for submitting detailed planning proposals
and arranging funding. Construction will be undertaken by Higgs &amp; Hill
Northern.
The development will transform the town centre, creating shopping malls, a
bus station and parking for over 1,000 cars. It will be carried out in two
phases with a target completion date of spring 1997. Phase 1 will provide a
multi-storey car park, bus station, a 35,000 sq ft food store, shops, a
pedestrianised mall and a town square.
The second phase will create a second pedestrianised mall with glazed
canopies, retail stores and 20 shop units. A total of 100,000 sq ft of
retail space will be developed.
Substantial preparatory work, including diverting the town's inner relief
road to eliminate busy road crossings for shoppers will be carried out with
City Challenge funds.
Negotiations on property acquisition will begin immediately and some
buildings have already been jointly bought.

FT  01 FEB 93 / People: HSBC's Smith moves to take on Midland's
international interests
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The integration of Midland Bank's international business with those of HSBC
Holdings after last year's takeover has taken a further step forward with
the appointment of Michael Smith, an experienced HSBC manager, as managing
director of Midland's international interests.
Although Midland's businesses in the Far East and America will be integrated
with local HSBC operations, Midland's new owner wants European businesses to
remain under the British bank. Midland owns banks worth Pounds 11bn in asset
size in countries including Germany and France.
'Midland still has quite a strong name in Europe. It has not suffered as
badly as from publicity in Britain over the past few years,' says Smith, who
was moved to Midland as planning director before the takeover. Midland and
HSBC were exchanging managers as part of their overtures.
In his role as planning director, he was responsible for planning the
reshaping of Midland's branch network. Smith, who has been with HSBC since
1978, says there is 'an awful lot of development to do' on Midland's
European network. He wants to introduce the 'discipline and common
direction' of HSBC.
Before coming to Midland, Smith followed the career path of high flyers in
HSBC, helping to manage businesses in Hong Kong, Australia, Oman and Japan
among others. The switch to Midland's European operation will mark a change
from retail operations to largely corporate and investment banking.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Management: Executives forced to buy slice of pie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is an acknowledged truth that managers with large parts of their personal
wealth tied up in a business will tend to be more concerned about its
performance than those without.
This simple fact lies behind a new trend in US executive pay policy which
could eventually spread to Europe: some companies have begun to insist that
their senior managers acquire a specific and sizeable amount of the
business's shares.
Last week Union Carbide announced that its senior managers would be required
to own shares in the chemicals company in proportion to their salaries.
Kodak, the photographic equipment manufacturer, did likewise last month.
Xerox, the copier company, introduced a similar scheme a year ago.
Other companies have started actively 'encouraging' managers to hold
specific amounts of stock. For example CSX, the transport group, organised a
successful scheme last year which offered over 160 of its executives loans
to buy shares at market prices.
So far the movement is limited to a handful of companies, but many experts
believe this is just the beginning. Howard Sherman of Washington-based
Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), which advises large investors on
corporate governance, says it is the start of a 'major trend over the next
few years'.
Schemes to align managers' financial interests with those of shareholders
are hardly new. Many companies have always encouraged executives to buy an
unspecified number of shares in the business.
And the past 10-15 years has seen a boom in two particular kinds of carrot
supposed to enhance executive performance. These are annual bonuses pegged
to a company's financial performance; and share option schemes which allow
executives to buy stock at today's price at some point in the future.
However, there is growing evidence in the US that share option schemes are
not binding managers to the long-term interests of the company as strongly
as they might. Far from holding on to the shares received when they exercise
options, managers tend to cash in quickly.
Brian Dunn, who specialises in executive compensation at New York
consultants Towers Perrin, suggests that managers tend to hold over the
long-term less than 25 per cent of the shares they acquire under option
schemes.
And it is mainly to counter this 'take the options money and run' attitude
that companies are now starting to demand specific levels of shareholding.
This is partly enlightened self-interest, partly a response to shareholder
pressures. ISS, for example, has recommended for the past two years that
stock option plans be written in ways which limit managers' ability to sell
their shares.
Companies implementing schemes range from those that tend to be at the
cutting edge of management issues, such as Xerox, to those facing pressure
from shareholders for a big improvement in performance, such as Kodak.
Kodak's scheme requires each of the company's top 40 executives to invest
certain multiples of their pay in the company over the next five years. Kay
Whitmore, the chairman, will have to acquire stock amounting to four times
his base annual salary (which in 1991 was nearly Dollars 1m), while the more
junior end of the range will have to invest the equivalent of one annual
salary.
'Five years from now, no senior manager of this company will own less than
the equivalent of one-year's base pay,' says Whitmore. 'The result: all our
senior managers will act and behave like owners of this company, because
they will be substantial owners.'
Union Carbide's scheme sets similar targets and the same time-frame. Xerox
required its top 50 managers to hold only one year's base salary, but to
reach this level over a mere 18 months.
The idea is one whose time has come, but some top US executives have qualms.
Mr Dunn says a number of clients have told him they feel their company has
'no right to intrude into people's personal financial circumstances'.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Management: Second thoughts about moving in - Christopher
Lorenz reports on how ICI rushed to open shop for the single market but beat
a quick retreat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MUST rank as one of the most rapid corporate rethinks ever. Amid a
fanfare of proclamations by its senior managers about the need to 'reshape
for the single market challenge', the world's fourth largest chemicals
multinational creates a new regional organisation, based in Brussels. Then,
barely 16 months later, it decides quietly - although amid internal
controversy - to shut it down.
On the face of it, this volte-face by ICI, Britain's largest manufacturer in
any industry, looks like an embarrassment of the first order.
But behind the scenes the U-turn over ICI Europe, as the 60-person unit in
leafy countryside near Brussels airport was called, reflects the company's
new-found willingness to adjust to changing circumstances far more rapidly
than in the past.
By reversing its decision, ICI has done two things. First, it has recognised
that it had overrated the potential demand from multinational customers -
ranging from BMW to several household appliance makers - for cross-border
European sales co-ordination across its various businesses. Instead, it now
feels that any pan-European sales 'synergies' can be handled within
individual businesses.
Second, the turnaround represents the final triumph within ICI of a movement
which, as in many multinationals today, was already on the rise inside the
chemical company before the Brussels decision was taken: the need to speed
decision-making and cut costs by streamlining the complex 'matrix'
structures through which they had managed since the 1960s.
Under these, control had been shared for decades between international or
global product divisions (what ICI calls 'businesses'), and geographic
units. The latter were either regional, as in the case of ICI Europe, or
national, as with the 15 ICI country organisations whose responsibilities it
was supposed largely to subsume.
In September 1990, when ICI celebrated the opening of ICI Europe, a clear
shift of influence towards the global businesses, away from its existing
regional organisations and national companies, had already been under way
since the 1970s.
So, although the reasons for the creation of ICI Europe seemed powerful to
those directly involved and to the outside world, it was seen elsewhere in
ICI 'as being out of kilter with its time', says Bill Madden, chief
executive of the group's global materials business and now ICI's top person
in Brussels.
The story is taken up by Trevor Gazard, who as planning manager of ICI
Europe says he was 'the man who finally turned the lights out on it' last
June. In line with the 'primacy' of the global businesses within ICI's power
structure, he has since taken on a similar role within ICI Materials, under
Madden.
With hindsight, Gazard says ICI Europe 'was really a project, not a
permanent organisation'. This is because its most trumpeted purpose, the
creation of 'corporate coherence' towards customers in continental Europe,
proved 'a bit ahead of its time', says Gazard. He says car companies, for
instance, still prefer not to purchase through a single point, even if four
ICI businesses supply them separately with paint, polyurethane for bumpers,
advanced materials for engines, and fibres for seats.
ICI is by no means the only large multinational which, in its
Euro-enthusiasm, misread its customers' purchasing intentions in this way.
But that is no excuse for its readiness to swallow the now mainly
discredited 'supermarket' theory of business-to-business purchasing.
The result was that ICI Europe's main tasks from the start actually turned
out to be transitional:
To establish an orderly transfer of sales activities and staff from the 15
national companies to ICI's global businesses, splitting sales staff into
European sub-regions such as Benelux, Nordic and what ICI calls 'mid-Europe'
(Germany, Austria and Switzerland).
To support the businesses across Europe by creating half a dozen
sub-regional centres for shared 'support services', such as information
technology, finance, health and safety, public affairs and personnel.
To streamline the old way of maintaining a 'corporate presence' in each
country.
By the time the chairman of ICI Europe came back to London in the summer of
1991 to report on progress, several things had happened:
* Most of the first two tasks were well in hand or complete.
* The business climate had changed for the worse, and ICI's profits had
slumped. The Hanson group had taken a threatening stake in the company, and
a desperate hunt was under way within ICI to simplify structures and cut
costs.
* From the beginning of 1991 the group's 14 businesses had been agglomerated
into eight larger units, all with revenues of more than Pounds 1bn. 'If
regional co-ordination in Europe was needed, it could be done at that
level,' says Trevor Harrison, ICI's head of planning.
* The role of ICI Europe 'was causing some distress to the businesses',
continues Harrison. For one thing, they claimed its upkeep was affecting
their European selling costs. They also 'felt that they didn't have enough
control over their entire business process, from the customer right back to
the factory,' explains Harrison: 'Brussels was getting in the middle.'
The response from ICI's top management was to set up a study group. It
decided that ICI Europe had, in effect, fulfilled much of its remit. It
should be shut down, and its remaining activities split up.
The provision of shared services would be transferred to the strongest
business in each country or sub-region. At the same time a senior manager in
each business within a country or sub-region would be selected to act as a
part-time 'Mr ICI' there. The first to take on such a representative role,
for the whole Nordic area, was the head of ICI Pharmaceuticals.
Both these moves follow the growing tendency within other multinationals of
streamlining their bureaucracies by dispersing such geographic 'head office'
responsibilities among senior divisional managers on a part-time basis.
But the conformity of the decision with international practice did not make
it unanimous. One ICI line manager says there were complaints that 'it was
handed down from HQ without adequate discussion'. The substance of the
decision was opposed by the main ICI board member responsible for Europe, by
the chairman of ICI Europe, and by one of the business heads.
One worry was that ICI might lose continental perspective; another, that it
would lose the ability to develop international managers capable of moving
across businesses. Like other cross-frontier tasks within ICI today, this
has become informally 'networked'.
The costs saved by shutting ICI Europe are hard to estimate, since about 20
of its 60 staff have been transferred, either to the UK head office or to
the businesses.
More significant, Gazard says, is that its efforts cut the cost of ICI's
continental support services by a fifth between 1990 and 1992. There is
still at least as much again to be saved, he estimates, through streamlining
within the businesses.
Paradoxically, ICI's costs in mainland Europe may soon be increased slightly
by a much more striking rethink than the closure of ICI Europe: the demerger
of the entire group into two companies, the Zeneca bio-pharmaceutical side
and the remaining five ICI businesses.
Both companies will maintain the new principles of dispersing shared support
services and national representation. But each company will need its own
string of support centres and national ambassadors, so overheads will rise
somewhat.
That should be a small price to pay if it helps achieve the demerger's
promised benefits. But this further rethink does underline the speed with
which ICI's European structure is continuing to change. It is unlikely to be
the last upheaval.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Economics: Focus turns to German pay talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE focus turns to Germany this week where a run of important economic
figures are expected and the third round of public sector wage talks begins.
The Bundesbank will only be prepared to ease monetary conditions if the
outcome of the pay round is 'moderate' and according to Ms Alison Cottrell,
economist at Midland Global Markets, substantial progress has already been
made in the west. However, negotiations are not going so smoothly in the
east, where planned wage convergence is still posing a threat to economic
and social stab-ility.
German industrial production figures are forecast to show another
month-on-month fall which would translate into a quarter on quarter decline
of around 3 per cent. 'There appears to be no slowdown in the rate of
decline for the first quarter given the ever weakening state of demand,'
says Mr Michael Lewis, economist at Morgan Grenfell, the investment house.
Further signs of recession are likely to be reflected in the unemployment
figures. Unadjusted unemployment passed the two million mark in December,
and a number of economists are expecting the seasonally adjusted total to go
the same way in January.
In the US, attention will turn to the non-farm pay roll figures on Friday
for further evidence of robust economic growth. They rose by 64,000 in
December and are forecast to have grown by 100,000 in January.
The following are some of the other economic highlights and events of the
week. Figures in brackets are the consensus of economists' forecasts from
MMS International, a financial information company.

FT  01 FEB 93 / The Week Ahead: Results Due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FYFFES, the Irish-based fruit and vegetable distributor, is heading for a
modest increase in pre-tax profits tomorrow, having weathered recession in
Europe and ERM currency upheavals during its year to end October 1992.
Profits of IPounds 28.5m are expected against IPounds 27.1m last year, with
the dividend likely to rise to 0.8939p (0.8126p) after the interim was upped
to 0.3549p (0.3226p). Earnings per share, diluted by issues in 1992, are
likely to fall to 5.7p from 6.73p.
The group's expansion into continental Europe has come at a difficult time,
given lower prices and the currency turmoil.
Its year-end coincided with sterling's 15 per cent decline in value against
the Irish currency, something of a blow because 50 per cent of its turnover
is from UK operations.
However, Fyffes will benefit longer-term from the new banana regime in the
EC, which slapped a 2m tonne a year quota on Latin American banana exporters
in December, with a 170 per cent tariff on exports above that level.
Bullough, the office products and refrigeration group, is expected to
produce results today in line with its December profit warning of a slump
from Pounds 20.8m to Pounds 8.5m pre-tax profits in the year to October 31.
Earnings per share are likely to be between 4.5p and 4.6p (11.55p). The
dividend is to be held at 6.05p. The group has had to absorb Pounds 3.3m in
redundancy costs However, profits this year could rise to Pounds 12m,
confirming the group's position as a potential recovery stock.
Northumbrian Fine Foods, the biscuit, confectionery and health food maker,
has seen its profitability slide in spite recent expansion of its expansion
in the past two years.
Interim results on Wednesday will show whether the group has reaped the
benefits of improving market conditions. The USM-quoted company reported
pre-tax profits of Pounds 155,000 (Pounds 264,000) on turnover of Pounds
15.9m (Pounds 7.89m) in the year to March 31 1992, but passed its final
dividend after a 0.75p interim payout.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Factory activity 'still in decline'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVITY in manufacturing industry continued to decline in January for the
seventh month in succession, the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply reported yesterday.
The institute's purchasing manager's index, which is based on a weighted
average of the movements of several variables including new orders, output
and employment, remained almost unchanged last month at 49.3 per cent.
However, the institute said that a reading of below 50 per cent always
tended to imply that activity was continuing to decline. It also found that,
for the fourth successive month, the price of raw materials used by
manufacturing industry showed a big increase in January thanks almost wholly
to the devaluation of sterling. Consumer credit demand in the UK rose in
December 1992 and may continue to increase this year according to Infolink,
the independent credit information group.
It said yesterday that demand for credit in the new-car loans sector was the
strongest of all, growing in December by 6.9 per cent year-on-year. UK
unemployment will increase by 380,000 this year and peak at 3.35m by the end
of the year, according to Mr David Kern, chief economist at National
Westminster Bank.

RASTAFARIANS do not constitute a separate ethnic group for the purposes of
the Race Relations Act, the Court of Appeal has ruled.
In a test case backed by the Commission for Racial Equality, the court ruled
that a Rastafarian who was refused a van driver's job because he would not
cut off his dreadlocks had not been discriminated against under the Race
Relations Act. The CRE is considering an appeal to the House of Lords.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Industrialists back Maastricht, says poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A POLL indicates that 75 per cent of British industry and local authorities
would vote in favour of the Maastricht treaty if the UK held a referendum,
Gary Mead writes.
But it also shows that 37 per cent believe they receive unfair treatment
from Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, and his
office.
The poll was conducted by the UK-based political consultancy Decision Makers
among the UK's top 1,000 companies and 500 local authorities as well as the
top 1,000 companies elsewhere in the EC and in the Efta group of nations.
Among all types of the UK respondents, 59 per cent said they favoured
staying outside the European exchange rate mechanism until a closer and more
stable alignment of currencies was achieved. The survey indicated that only
26 per cent of UK industry believes it receives fair treatment from Brussels
Attitudes of UK Local Authorities and the top 2,000 EC companies. Decision

FT  01 FEB 93 / Small companies 'more confident'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S independent companies are increasingly confident about business
prospects in the UK, according to a survey of 1,000 companies by 3i, the
investment capital group.
The survey, conducted earlier this month, reports the highest level of
confidence among small and medium-sized independent companies since autumn
1988.
They were, however, less optimistic about their own immediate sales
prospects. Forecasts for turnover during the next three months in the south
have deteriorated slightly, though the picture is more hopeful among
companies in the north.
Even so, companies in all regions say that they expect their profitability
to rise over the next three months. In the October survey, 37 per cent of
respondents expected profitability to fall but the figure has now dropped to
25 per cent.
Mr Ewen Macpherson, chief executive of 3i, said the survey suggested that
companies had their cost bases under control and were managing to maintain
margins in the competitive environment.
He added: 'This is a pointer to really healthy growth as the economy picks
up. The danger at the end of a recession is that businesses have been so
weakened financially that they simply cannot seize market opportunities.'
The survey also shows that companies are preparing to at least maintain, or
raise, investment. The number of businesses planning to cut their investment
had fallen from more than a third since the October survey to 17 per cent.
More than a fifth expected to increase employment this year. The expected
increase in numbers employed was 4.5 per cent.
Most of the businesses surveyed said they expected the devaluation of the
pound to have a detrimental effect on the cost of materials, and 8 per cent
expected it to have a strong effect on wage demands.
Among exporters, a third said the devaluation of sterling had influenced
their plans for growth, although more than half believed it would make
little difference to strategy. Just over 10 per cent felt that devaluation
would be bad for the growth of their companies.
Half the companies said that the government's increases in public
expenditure and infrastructure investment would help their business.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Secondary school class sizes increase sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLASS sizes have increased sharply in secondary schools in England's cities
despite government claims to have improved the pupil-teacher ratio, research
by Oxford Brookes University has found.
The research by the university (formerly Oxford Polytechnic) based on recent
Department for Education figures, shows that in 48 metropolitan local
education authorities (LEAs) the pupil-to-teacher ratio at secondary level
worsened by 0.5 or more pupils per teacher between January 1989 and January
1992.
In only seven metropolitan LEAs has the ratio remained steady. In not one
has it improved by more than 0.5.
In some inner-city areas, the deterioration in the three years completely
wiped out the gains of the previous 15 years. In Knowsley, Merseyside, the
pupil-teacher ratio in secondary schools rose from 13.7 pupils per teacher
in 1989 to 16.4 in 1992, almost back to the 1978 figure of 16.7.
Other areas that have seen sharp increases include Newham, London, where the
ratio is up from 13.6 to 16.1 in the three years; South Tyneside, up from 14
to 16.1; North Tyneside, up from 13.8 to 15.5; Rochdale, up from 14 to 15.5;
and Walsall, West Midlands, up from 13.6 to 15.2.
Last week the education department highlighted findings in the annual Social
Trends survey of reduced class sizes as evidence of 'significant
improvements in education'. But this was based on national figures to 1991,
which showed a drop in the ratio from 17.8 to 15 since the 1970s.
Mr John Howson, deputy director of Oxford Brookes's school of education,
said: 'Restrictions on local authority spending seem to be the main cause of
the sharp deterioration.
'The local management of schools policy, under which budgets are devolved
from councils to head teachers, cannot put more teachers in the classroom if
grants do not keep pace with education inflation.'
It had been expected that local management would direct more education
resources into classroom teaching, but Mr Howson believes it may be
diverting resources into repairs, equipment and non-teaching posts such as
bursars.
The research shows a slower rate of deterioration in county district class
sizes. In the three years to 1992 the secondary-level pupils-to-teacher
ratio worsened by more than 0.5 in 14 county LEAs - the biggest rise being
1.2 in Derbyshire, a county with acute financial problems. In None saw an
improvement of more than 0.5.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Warning on export insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN could become the only European country without government cover for
export risk unless ministers rethink their plans, Mr Robin Cook, shadow
trade and industry secretary, warned yesterday, Alison Smith writes.
In a letter to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, Mr
Cook emphasised the difficulties experienced by the commercial insurance
market since the Export Credits Guarantee Department was partly privatised.
There was, he said, 'broad agreement that there is not the capacity to
provide export reinsurance, particularly for political risk'.
His warning follows last week's figures showing the trade deficit had
reached its highest monthly level for 2 1/2 years, and Mr John Major's
appeal to exporters to play a leading role in bringing about economic
recovery.
Government reinsurance for political risk is due to be discontinued in 1994.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Call to extend Budget timetable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE IS mounting on the government to reduce loopholes in tax
legislation by extending the period for consultation before finance acts are
drafted and debated.
Tax practitioners want each year's finance bill to be published early in
January and not passed until mid summer. They say that has been made
possible by the decision of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to move the
Budget to December.
Their strategy would reduce the need for late-night parliamentary debates to
correct anomalies in the finance bill identified at the last minute. It
would also reduce errors caused because parliamentary draftsmen failed to
capture the intention of ministerial debate in the bills.
The finance bill is now published shortly after the Budget in March and
given royal assent during the summer.
Tax experts argue that this three-month gap should be extended to six
months. They also say that draft parts of the finance bill should be
circulated after the Budget in December to give them the Christmas period to
examine the legislation.
The move follows the response to a joint submission last September to Mr
Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, by a group including
the Institute of Taxation. Mr Dorrell said there were no plans to extend the
consultation period.
The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants has called for changes to
the tax structure which would divide taxpayers into business and
private-income earners.
The institute said that the present structure forced businesses to choose
between incorporation or non-incorporation on tax grounds and that ending
the distinction would ease the integration of UK businesses into the
European regime.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Service sector 'new industrial dinosaur'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS, insurance companies, defence contractors and government departments
are taking over from textiles, shipbuilding, steel and coal as Britain's
industrial dinosaurs, says BWD Rensburg, the Huddersfield-based stockbroking
group, in its quarterly review of northern companies, published today.
Rising unemployment in southern England is the first sign of labour shakeout
and cost-cutting in the service sector similar to that which has devastated
smokestack industries in northern England during the last 15 years.
This has made old regional boundaries irrelevant when analysing unemployment
trends, says Mr John Dyson, BWD's corporate services director. Every region
now has successful areas and blackspots, he says.
Jobs in the north are less concentrated in single sectors and areas, and
there are now many more small businesses in the region and a wider spread of
companies. This, according to the review, is a result of the region having
to restructure after the old industries were run down in the early 1980s,
and has helped the north withstand the recession.
'The mass service-industry employers are the new potential dinosaurs of the
next century,' Mr Dyson says.
The analysis - based on last October's jobless figures - found a cluster of
areas, mainly in a coastal belt running from Suffolk to Devon, where
unemployment had risen by 2.2 percentage points or more year-on-year. The
analysis attributes this to the concentration of service-sector industries
in those areas.
By contrast, 13 travel-to-work areas with an unemployment rate of less than
5.3 per cent are mainly clustered in a belt running across northern England
from the Lake District to North Yorkshire. The seasonally adjusted jobless
rate was 10.1 per cent last October.
The analysis also shows two similar areas of low unemployment in Wales, two
in Scotland, and another cluster of three, based on east Cheshire and the
Derbyshire peak district.
Because the areas are where people with good incomes live or spend their
leisure time, Mr Dyson calls the large cluster of low unemployment the
northern playground and the coastal belt of rising joblessness the southern
playground.
'The north-south playing field is now much more even, with no clearly
winning regions emerging,' he says.

FT  01 FEB 93 / TUC urges Pounds 4bn crisis cash for jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government should implement a Pounds 4bn emergency work package to
create 200,000 new jobs and 500,000 training and work experience places, the
Trades Union Congress urges.
Its Budget submission, published today, says job insecurity and unemployment
are the most important barriers to a recovery in consumer confidence.
The TUC hints at a trade-off between pay restraint and job creation - a
controversial signal in view of the TUC's commitment to free collective
bargaining. It says that the government's limit of 1.5 per cent pay rises in
the public sector will not prevent substantial job losses. 'Instead the
government should engage the public-sector employers and unions in
discussions to sustain quality services while stabilising living standards
and employment,' the submission says.
Workfare - people being forced to work for unemployment benefit - is
rejected by the TUC but it wants reform of the benefit system to help people
back into jobs.
It proposes abolishing the 21-hour rule under which unemployed people are
refused benefit if they enter a training or education course that takes more
than 21 hours a week. Employees' National Insurance Contributions should be
increased by about 50p per week to finance temporary work programmes for the
long-term unemployed, says Full Employment UK, the independent policy
consultancy.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Gould raps Labour on economic policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR was urged yesterday by Mr Bryan Gould to adopt a more radical
economic policy and to stop echoing the government's analysis.
The former shadow cabinet member said in a scathing attack on the Labour
leadership that while its paper setting out Budget measures was excellent,
it was 'sinking without trace - as virtually all Labour's economic policies
sink without trace'. That was because no one believed they could be
implemented.
Speaking on BBC Television's On the Record, Mr Gould, who stood against Mr
John Smith for the party leadership and later resigned from the shadow
cabinet over European policy, also criticised the party for being too
cautious.
'It is time the Labour party showed the way and led the way by breaking free
from that last hangover of an imperial economy,' he said.
Mr Gould's words will fuel the argument in the party about its future
direction. His belief that Labour should have full employment as a core aim
of economic policy strikes a chord with some Labour spokesmen. He also
called for an increase in public spending, especially for infrastructure
investment.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Bottomley acts over health funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Health is preparing guidance to managers and doctors to
try to ensure that the contract-based system of financing health care runs
more smoothly next year.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, has asked top officials to act
following evidence that many hospitals have fulfilled their annual contracts
in the first three quarters of the financial year and are now having to
reduce non-emergency activities.
The National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts says in a survey
published today that over-performance by hospitals has been the most serious
financial issue facing the new system of National Health Service funding in
1992-93.
Mr Bill Darling, association chairman, said the survey showed that the NHS
had spent more money, treated more patients and reduced waiting times in the
current financial year. 'But with many hospitals completing their contracts
early the key challenge for the NHS is to match throughout to resources more
effectively,' he said.
The survey shows that health authorities were most likely to reduce
non-emergency activity when faced with hospitals completing their contracted
activity early. Some intended to maintain services by transferring money
from capital to revenue budgets.
A survey carried out for BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning
reinforces the association's evidence. It indicates that 59.5 per cent of
acute (medical) hospital trusts will have to cancel operations, close wards,
make staff redundant or take other cost-cutting measures before the end of
the financial year. Only 17 per cent of the trusts said contracts were
running smoothly, while managers at 46 per cent believed they would face
worse problems next year.
Mrs Bottomley has asked Sir Duncan Nichol, NHS chief executive, and Dr
Kenneth Calman, chief medical officer, to meet doctors' leaders and ensure
that 'everyone understands how the system should be working'.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Benefit curb soon for big home loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CEILING is to be put on the level of mortgage interest payments that will
be met through the social security system after a householder has lost his
or her job.
Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, has begun detailed
discussions with the Treasury about the new limit. He is expected to make an
announcement about its introduction before the end of this month.
His initiative follows severe ministerial embarrassment over two cases which
caused a political furore in December as social security mortgage payments
of about Pounds 1,800 a week to a householder with a mortgage of more than
Pounds 800,000 were highlighted.
At present there is no limit on the level of mortgage payments that can be
met from income support provided certain criteria are satisfied.
Claimants must have only very limited savings, must be looking for cheaper
accommodation and must convince a social security adjudication officer that
they could afford the mortgage when buying the property. Claimants can
receive full interest payments for up to a year if they are trying to sell
their properties.
There were signs when the row erupted that ministers would be keen to end
large weekly mortgage payments, but initial suggestions were that any
reforms might concentrate on making people repay some or all of the money
they had received once the property had been sold.
The new approach will be to impose a ceiling so that benefit will not be
paid if the mortgage is above a certain level, which will probably be fixed
between Pounds 100,000 and Pounds 200,000. The limit will not apply
retrospectively.
The Treasury is believed to be pressing for a figure at the lower end of the
range in order to maximise savings.

EMPLOYEES' National Insurance Contributions should be increased by about 50p
per week to finance large-scale temporary work programmes for the long-term
unemployed, says Full Employment UK, the independent policy consultancy.
The government is considering new initiatives for the unemployed, including
the long-term jobless being required to undertake some form of temporary
work in return for higher benefit.
Full Employment UK, which estimates the cost of such a new programme at more
than Pounds 600m a year, says increased National Insurance contributions
should become the centrepiece of a new long-term insurance policy for
everyone in work. The consultancy says this would acknowledge the reality
that employers can find themselves forced to lay off some of their most
skilled employees.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Trident Dock Contest: Tense campaign waged with ferocity and
scare tactics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHATEVER THE outcome in the battle between Devonport and Rosyth, the
protests will be loud.
Rosyth royal dockyard is the biggest single industrial site in Scotland, and
Devonport the biggest in south-west England. Both areas suffer from high
unemployment and failure to win the nuclear contract, which would guarantee
jobs well into the next century, will shatter local morale.
Hence the ferocity of the political campaign that has been raging between
the dockyards for nearly two years. It is likely to be seen as a classic
political lobbying campaign, involving national defence, the future of the
Royal Navy, judgments on value for money and political expediency.
Scare tactics have also been used: Rosyth's management has dropped hints
about nuclear safety risks at Devonport; a study commissioned by Devonport
questioned the strategic and political wisdom of concentrating all nuclear
work in Scotland. In addition, a senior defence ministry civil servant has
faced allegations of bias; and both sides have complained that the goalposts
for tendering have been moved to their disadvantage.
A director of Devonport Management said: 'It is like being at war for the
last two years. It has dominated all our waking hours and involved all our
families.' The sentiment could equally have come from Rosyth. The yard there
has been building a special dock, known as RD57, since 1987 and was
initially the natural choice for a reduced submarine programme.
But Devonport Management realised that its future would be bleak, or
non-existent, without the nuclear contract. The question was how to go about
getting it, with Rosyth apparently home and dry. A series of brainstorming
sessions was held to decide how Devonport could do the work more cheaply.
The answer was to upgrade the docks at Devonport rather than build new ones.
Devonport sent its unsolicited proposal to the MoD and, crucially, to the
Treasury in April 1991. Both liked the proposals in principle, and a more
detailed analysis was completed by the following November.
The plan was for a Pounds 170m development over 10 years aimed at
undercutting the cost to the government of going ahead with Rosyth's Pounds
400m RD57 project. In addition to the two docks in Devonport's present
submarine complex, it planned to adapt three big dry docks designed before
the first world war to accommodate battleships.
Devonport said its scheme would save Pounds 250m on construction costs and
as much again in ship maintenance through economies of scale in refitting
over the rest of the decade.
It was a masterstroke that received the backing of the Navy, threw Rosyth
off balance, and immediately put Devonport in with a chance of victory on
cost grounds. The original MoD strategy of placing the contract with Rosyth
was dropped in favour of an open competition between the two yards. This was
when 'the great nuclear race' really started.
Rosyth recognised that if the MoD decided to cut the number of dockyards
from two to one, the survivor would almost certainly be Devonport. It
therefore had to persuade the MoD it should stick to a dual site plan for
refitting Trident and all other submarines at Rosyth and preserve Devonport
for surface ships. Its campaign had two strands.
First, to demonstrate to the MoD that a Trident operation at Rosyth would be
the most cost-effective. Second, to ensure that ministers and MPs realised
that if Rosyth did not win the Trident contract the yard would eventually
close, creating an economic catastrophe for Scotland and a political
disaster for the Conservative party, which has only 11 out of 72 Scottish
MPs.
Meanwhile Devonport, having scored with its technical campaign, launched a
parallel political campaign to gain wider support for winning the nuclear
contract. It was decided that outside help was needed, and a year ago the
Rowland Group, a Saatchi public relations company, was commissioned to lobby
the media and promote Devonport's case at Westminster and in Whitehall.
Similarly, Rosyth hired the Westminster consultants GJW to help put its
case, and made use of the fact that in Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary,
Scotland had a voice in cabinet and a force of civil servants in the
Scottish Office who could be relied on to support its case on regional
economic grounds.
Devonport has been well aware of its relative lack of political clout
nationally but it has been supported vigorously by the Labour-led Plymouth
City Council, local unions, and the Conservative-led Devon and Cornwall
county councils.
Rosyth argues that the dice have been loaded consistently against its bid.
It maintains that Devonport was 'invited out of the blue' to submit its
initial bid for the Trident contract, while the MoD was urging Rosyth to
concentrate on improving the RD57 scheme instead of considering a cheaper
upgrade option.
In response to Devonport's Pounds 170m upgraded scheme, Rosyth last June cut
the cost of RD57 from Pounds 400m to Pounds 267m by abandoning the plan to
put the whole facility under cover.
Then in December, when the cost of Devonport's project had been pared to
Pounds 130m, Rosyth submitted yet another plan. It would be prepared to drop
its new-build scheme and, like Devonport, convert existing docks to take
Trident at a cost of Pounds 147m. It was told on January 14 that the scheme
had been rejected.
It was then that Rosyth decided to make a last bid to save the contract. Mr
Allan Smith, Rosyth managing director, contacted Mr Lang and Mr Malcolm
Rifkind, defence secretary, and met the Scottish media. The protests worked,
and on January 18 Downing Street announced that the period of consultation
would be extended.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Trident Dock Contest: Closure threatens thousands of jobs -
Gillian Tett assesses the mood among businesses in two communities waiting
for the long-feared bombshell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF Rosyth or Devonport closes, the thousands of dockworkers will not be the
only people to lose their jobs. Almost 30,000 jobs in the Devon and Cornwall
area depend directly or indirectly on the Devonport complex, with up to 600
local companies drawing business from the yard, says Mr Paul Bishop, a
lecturer at Plymouth University.
The picture is similar at at Rosyth, where a recent study by Fife Regional
Council claims that at least 800 businesses in Scotland have dealings with
the yard. Few doubt that the closure of either yard would trigger knock-on
job losses across each region's economy.
Mr Malcolm Haggart, managing director of a Plymouth marine engineering
company, said: 'If Devonport loses, it would be like dropping an atomic bomb
on the shopping centre. It would devastate Plymouth.'
Uncertainty about the yards' future has prompted many local suppliers to
diversify in recent years. Although the larger defence suppliers have been
hit by wider defence cuts, most insist that their businesses will not be
affected by the eventual location of the sole refitting yard.
Most of Devonport's specialist defence suppliers, for example, are already
located far outside the region.
Nevertheless, the businesses now at risk are the hordes of tiny enterprises
scattered around Rosyth and Plymouth which have grown around the rich
pickings of the yard. In Plymouth alone, for example, the Devonport complex
is estimated to generate some Pounds 521m of income for the region. And Mr
James Brodie, chief executive of Fife Chamber of Commerce, said: 'It could
have a devastating effect on the retail sector.'
Mr Bill Taylor, director of economic planning at Fife Regional Council,
said: 'The issue is not just about the direct suppliers but a chain of
suppliers.'
ROSYTH
Clark Retail
Newsagent
8 employees
Turnover Pounds 400,000Hundreds of local shops depend on the dockyard for
custom. 'If Rosyth goes it would put paid to a lot of our jobs,' says Mrs
Marilyn Sallnow, temporary manager of the Rosyth branch of Clark Retail, a
newsagent chain. It estimates that around 40 per cent of its business would
be lost. 'Rosyth would be like a ghost town,' adds Mrs Sallnow, whose
husband, father and brother-in-law all work at the yard.
Norman Davidson
Self-employed taxi driver
Rosyth's isolated location, several miles from the nearest big town, has
provided jobs for hundreds of taxi drivers.  'If the yard goes, it would
kill the taxi trade,' says Mr Norman Davidson, who believes that '20 per
cent of taxi drivers would go to the wall'.
Systems Reliability, Fife
44 employees
Turnover Pounds 4m
If Rosyth closes, local observers fear that it could lead to a drainage of
high-tech skills from the area. Small businesses such as Systems
Reliability, a local computer hardware and installation company, have grown
up around the yard and its suppliers. 'Our success is in local hands,' says
Mr Robert Rob, sales director.
Arco East Scotland, Linlithgow
85 employees
Turnover Pounds 10m
Arco East Scotland supplies protective clothing and safety equipment for the
yard workers - in the last three months it sold more than Pounds 60,000
worth of jackets alone to the dockyard.  'If Rosyth goes we would have to
set about laying people off, no question,' says Mr Ron Dow, divisional
director. Although Arco also supplies a wide range of other industrial
outlets, many of these are also linked to the yard. 'We supply so many of
the subcontractors - electrical shops, ship blasters, even bus companies.'
Wilkie Hook, Bowness
400-500 employees
Turnover Pounds 1m
The family business employs 150 men on contract ship-blasting at Rosyth. If
the ship and submarine refitting business disappears, it will have to lay
off almost all these workers. 'Many of those men won't be prepared to travel
to other parts of Scotland for work,' says Mr Archie Wilkie, director.
G and D Scaffolding Services,
Dunfermline
20 employees
Turnover Pounds 750,000
Although most suppliers have tried to diversify, many remain vulnerable
because of their small size. The privately owned G and D Scaffolding draws
25 per cent of its business from the yard.  'That means that we are not
totally dependent,' says Mr Gordon Hendry, G and D's owner. 'But you only
need to have a few other clients going down and the ratio changes.'
MacTaggart Scott, Edinburgh
350 employees
Turnover Pounds 12m
Although a number of specialised defence companies are located in Scotland,
many say their business could follow the refitting programme to Plymouth if
necessary. MacTaggart Scott, which produces hydraulic equipment for ships
and submarines, supplies both Rosyth and Devonport. 'I think both should be
kept open,' says Mr Patrick Prenter, managing director. Although only Pounds
500,00 of its business is directly linked to Rosyth, he admits that the
closure would mean 'the loss of jobs, albeit a limited number'.
Scottish Power, Glasgow
Turnover Pounds 635m
Fife Regional Council, Rosyth provides Pounds 24m of business for the energy
sector each year, supporting an estimated 310 jobs in electricity and gas.
Scottish Power, which supplies Rosyth, denies that losing the yard would
affect its overall financial performance.
GEC-Marconi simulation plant
400 employees in Fife
Turnover Pounds 50m
(7,000 to 8,000 employees throughout Scotland
Turnover Pounds 400m)
GEC-Marconi, which has indicated it would be interested in bidding for
Rosyth or Devonport, produces specialised defence supplies for both yards
from factories across Britain. Its plant in Fife has provided simulation
equipment for Trident submarines.  Like other specialised defence suppliers
it insists the decision will not affect jobs.
DEVONPORT
Ron Dewdney
Cornish pasty business
32 employees
Turnover Pounds 700,000
Many local caterers and food shops depend on Devonport for their business.
The catering company Ron Dewdney, for example, sells about 2,000 Cornish
pasties daily - a quarter of its production - directly to ships and yard
workers, with several thousand more sold to the yard's suppliers. If the
yard closed Mr Alan Meatyard, manager, would make at least five employees
redundant. 'It's the knock-on effect that's the real problem,' he says. 'A
lot of the people I supply with pasties supply the yard.'
Osmond Guest House
Turnover Pounds 24,000
More than 150 family-run guest houses depend on the yard for their
livelihood. Mr Mike Richards, owner of the guest house, explains: 'During
the week we get contract workers from firms like Marconi staying here. At
the weekend we get sailors.'
Avondale Arms
Pub
5 employees
Pubs fear the loss of spending power resulting from Devonport closing would
hit them particularly hard. Mr Arthur Squire, who has run the Avondale Arms
next to the yard for the past 43 years, says: 'My trade is the yard. If that
goes, I go.'
Owens Uniforms
30 employees
Turnover Pounds 500,000
Mr Clive Owens, managing director, has been making uniforms for the Royal
Navy for 50 years. Eighty per cent of his orders come from the Ministry of
Defence, with 100 uniforms going directly to Devonport each year. Although
Mr Owens believes that the jobs at his company will be safe even if
Devonport loses the bid, the impact of such an outcome would be
'devastating' for the area. 'It's the uncertainty that is the worst,' he
says.
Fox and Haggart
Marine engineers
18 employees
Turnover Pounds 250,000
A huge network of tiny businesses, often family-run, has grown up to supply
Devonport. Fox and Haggart has depended on the yard over three generations.
Mr Malcolm Haggart hopes to hand the business on to his young sons. But if
Devonport loses the contract he will have to 'seriously consider' closing
down. 'Some of the people working here have been here for 40 years,' he
says. 'It's all they know. How can you expect them to retrain or get another
job?'
Bee-Clear
Industrial ship cleaners
94 employees
If the yard were to close it would not just be the yard's suppliers that
would be hit, but the suppliers' suppliers too, says Mr Keith Rickard,
managing director of Bee-Clear. The company itself would cut 60 jobs.
South West Crane Hire, Exeter
44 employees
Turnover Pounds 2m
The Devonport yard provides business for construction companies across the
south-west. But if Devonport loses the bid South West Crane Hire would shed
a third of its workforce. 'I've got no alternative,' says Mr Michael
Jeffery, managing director.
South West Water, Exeter
Water suppliers
About 2,000 employees
Turnover Pounds 96.7m
Devonport's contract with South West Water represents one of its most
significant local contracts in financial terms, according to Mr Paul Bishop
of Plymouth University. South West Water denies that losing Devonport would
lead to redundancies. Yet Mr Bill Frazer, South West Water's managing
director, has added his voice to the political lobbying. In a recent letter
to Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, he declared that 'DML is one of
our largest customers, and makes an important contribution to the costs of
our huge Pounds 4m per week investment in improving treatment works, water
mains and sew-ers'.
British Aerospace
1,000 employees
British Aerospace, a supplier to Devonport, relocated to Plymouth to be near
the naval docks. Like most specialist defence suppliers the company insists
that if the naval work moved its business would follow it. 'But it would
make the task of distribution to our customers much more difficult and
expensive,' says Mr Chris Tear, head of public affairs.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Trident Dock Contest: Work for non-MoD organisations to
account for 40 per cent of activity in 1992-93 at Rosyth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE Rosyth yard, work for organisations other than the Ministry of
Defence will account for nearly 40 per cent of activity in 1992-93 and 20
per cent of its expected turnover of Pounds 165m, Richard Evans and James
Buxton write. The gap is due to the high-value nature of much of the MoD
work. Some 800 of the yard's 4,100 employees are permanently engaged in
non-MoD activities.
Diversification began soon after Babcock Thorn took over. Mr Allan
Macpherson, now director of manufacturing, wanted to market the high level
of skills in the dockyard and initially exploited the craftsmanship of the
cabinetmakers whose main job had been fitting out cabins on warships. That
led to the creation of a furniture and joinery business which now supplies
furniture for the retail and the timeshare markets.
At Devonport dockyard, 23 per cent of turnover last year came from contracts
won through competitive tender, half of that on work unrelated to defence.
It included yacht building and refitting, and engine servicing for British
Rail. A contract has just been won to build specialist trailers to transport
Russian nuclear warheads for dismantling.
The main targets being sought in the Plymouth area are high-tech and light
engineering groups. Companies that have moved to the area in recent years
are Toshiba, the television manufacturer; Murata, the Japanese-owned
producer of ceramic capacitators; and Wrigley, the US-owned chewing gum
producer.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Trident Dock Contest: Rifkind in firing line of nuclear
dockyard battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT intends to delay a final decision on the future of the naval
dockyards at Rosyth, Fife, and Devonport, Plymouth, in an effort to avoid a
repeat of the fiasco over coal pit closures.
The initial announcement by Mr Malcom Rifkind, the defence secretary, is
expected to set out the government's 'preferred' course of action for the
yards, including the choice of which should become the sole site for
refitting the Royal Navy's nuclear-powered submarines. Whitehall officials
say this will be followed by three months of formal consultations.
A decision on where to concentrate submarine refitting had been expected
last month, after being postponed from December. It is not now expected
before mid-February.
Both yards, which have been under separate private-sector management since
1987, regard the submarine work as vital for their survival in the business
of servicing a reduced fleet.
They have been trying to undercut each other's proposals to win
government-financed facilities big enough for the Trident submarines which
are to replace Polaris. A refit facility for Trident needs to be completed
by about 1998.
Rosyth has so far handled Britain's four Polaris missile submarines and has
shared work on other submarines with Devonport.
Devonport Management, a private-sector consortium, proposed a scheme
involving the conversion of old battleship dockyards as an alternative to a
revised plan by Rosyth for completing the new docks.
Rosyth, operated by Babcock Thorn, countered in December with its own
dock-conversion proposal, estimated at Pounds 147m. Devonport said this was
a more limited scheme than its own and it could provide equivalent docks for
Pounds 131m. Rosyth in turn claims that the cheaper Devonport scheme would
lack essential emergency docking facilities.
Apart from the capital costs, Devonport has argued that the submarine work
would enable it to achieve economies of scale and save the MoD hundreds of
millions of pounds over the next decade in refitting frigates and other
surface ships. Defence officials believe the greatest long-term savings
would have been made by closing one of the royal dockyards and making the
survivor compete with private shipbuilding yards for work on surface ships.
But this is now recognised as being politically unacceptable.
If Devonport wins the contest, Rosyth will be allocated a guaranteed
workload on surface ships, possibly for 10 years. This would be designed to
prevent the larger yard from cornering virtually all the navy's Pounds
400m-a-year refit programme.
Both yards have up to now relied on a 'core' programme of allocated work,
competing for other naval and commercial contracts.
Once a choice is made, the government must decide whether, after expiry of
the current contracts, it will press ahead with full privatisation of the
yards. The 1987 contracts were originally to be resubmitted to competition
after seven years but are due to be extended to 1995.
Last August the MoD invited potential bidders to register interest in buying
one or both yards, which have remained under MoD ownership. About 12
companies are understood to have replied, including the two incumbent
groups. Others are thought to include British Aerospace, General Electric
Company, Rolls-Royce and VSEL, the submarine-builder. VSEL is also anxious
to compete for refitting of frigates in order to sustain activity at its
Barrow-in-Furness yard.
The MoD could not go ahead with inviting tenders before making clear which
of the yards would have the new submarine-refitting facilities. The MoD
would be expected to retain a 'golden share' in these facilities.
However, the privatisation plan could now be called into question if, as
expected, the government decides to allocate work to the losing yard in
order to minimise job losses, instead of leaving surface ship work to open
competition.
Some officials argue that the MoD would be better able to exert competitive
pressures through a fixed-term leasing contract, as at present.

FT  01 FEB 93 / The limits to promoting high-technology industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOMINANT position of the US in 'high-technology' industry in the postwar
era is eroding, largely in favour of Japan. Does this matter and can
anything be done about it? What makes these questions both timely and
important is that leading figures in the Clinton administration think that
the US government can and, indeed, should do something about it.
The signal was the controversial appointment of Laura D'Andrea Tyson as
President Clinton's chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors. Her
starting point is a belief that comparative advantage in the industries she
labels as high technology - chemicals, pharmaceuticals, military equipment,
advanced engineering, computers, telecommunications, electronics, aerospace
and scientific instruments - 'can be created by government action.'
The reason for concern is evident. In the early 1970s the US accounted for
almost 30 per cent of world high-technology exports. By the late 1980s, this
share was down to 21 per cent (see chart). Meanwhile, the great successes
have been Japan, whose share rose from 7 to 16 per cent and Hong Kong, South
Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, whose combined share rose from just over 1 to
almost 9 per cent.
'Revealed comparative advantage' is another way of looking at the process
(see chart). A country has a high (low) revealed comparative advantage in a
product group if its share in world exports of the product group is higher
(lower) than its share in total world exports of manufactures. The revealed
comparative advantage of the US in high-technology industry has, indeed,
declined a little since the early 1970s, while it has soared in the cases of
Japan and the east Asian NICs.
What might this mean for policy?
One question is whether the US government should respond to this decline by
focusing its efforts on supporting particular high-technology industries.
Certainly, Prof Tyson does not prove that countries thrive economically
because of their success in particular high-technology industries, rather
than succeed in high-technology as a result of their general economic
success.
A prior question, however, is whether these trends can be reversed by
policy. In a recent article, Richard Nelson and Gavin Wright conclude that
postwar American technological leadership has been eroded because
fundamental US advantages - notably, market size and superior higher
education - have diminished.(2)
'Over the postwar era,' they argue, 'commodity and resource trade, business
and finance, and technological communities, have all become increasingly
transnational rather than national.' Their conclusion is that
'techno-nationalism,' policies aimed at giving national companies an edge in
an area of technology, does 'not work very well any more.'
Internationalisation is an important limit on the effectiveness of policy.
Yet there is another one. A country's comparative advantage may, indeed, not
be determined by natural resources, but governments can still not make it
whatever they would like it to be. As Prof Tyson recognises, for example,
the causes of high-technology trade include what must be deep-seated
'national differences in educational systems and technological
capabilities.'
The point should be pushed further. Japanese success in high-technology
industry is to be explained by high rates of savings, attitudes to
education, relationships inside and among companies, the goals and structure
of government and relationships between companies and governments. Nothing
an American administration can do will make the US like Japan in these
respects. Nor will Japan become like the US. But a huge amount of effort and
international goodwill can be wasted in trying.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Mieno finally gives in to the political pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR YASUSHI MIENO, the Bank of Japan's governor, popularly known as
'stonehead' for his determination and discipline, seems to have finally
succumbed.
After months of pressure, which rose to a crescendo last week, the BoJ is
expected to deliver within days its sixth cut in the official discount rate
since September 1991.
The rate, which has stood at 3.25 per cent for the past six months is likely
to be cut to either 2.75 per cent or 2.5 per cent, the low it reached during
the height of the bubble economy of the late 1980s.
The fiercely independent Mr Mieno (left), promoted to governor with a
mandate to burst the speculative bubble, has become increasingly troublesome
to his political masters who desparately want a cure for the ailing economy.
The economic case for a further rate cut has become overwhelming. Consumer
confidence remains depressed, while corporate investment is still falling
sharply. Inflation is likely to fall to close to 1 per cent this year.
As the economy has declined so the political pressure on Mr Mieno has
mounted. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is concerned that the 1993
budget may be delayed in the parliament. That could set back plans for
another spending package later in the year.
So an interest rate cut has become vital to maintain the momentum of
expansionary policy to lift the economy away from recession. The bank's lack
of independence from its political masters in the LDP was spelt out early
last week, when Mr Yoshiro Mori, industry minister and vocal advocate for a
more expansionary policy, indicated a rate cut was on the way.
A European central banker familiar with the Bank of Japan remarked: 'At the
end of the day the ministry of finance can get the Bank to do what it
wants.' But it has also become clear that Mr Mieno has acquired some
powerful enemies who have been prepared to go to considerable lengths to
discredit him.
The speculation flowed from an unprecedented article two weeks ago in a
weekly magazine, which alleged that influential former finance ministry
officials now in senior positions in banking and politics were plotting to
replace Mr Mieno with a less independent governor. The conspiracy theories
were fuelled last week by more strange goings on involving the BoJ.
On Tuesday Mr Tsuneo Wakai, president of the Federation of Bankers'
Associations, head of the powerful Mitsubishi Bank and the figurehead of the
Japanese financial establishment, threw his weight behind calls for a more
expansionary policy.
The following day, a national newspaper published details of a highly
confidential Bank of Japan report on Mitsubishi Bank's corporate strategy,
which named banks Mitsubishi was keen to take over.
That day Mr Mieno cancelled a press conference blaming a cold, but there was
little trace of this when he gave evidence to parliament the day after.
For the past few months Mr Mieno has been playing pass the parcel with the
LDP. The BoJ has insisted it will not cut rates until public spending
shoulders more of the burden for stimulating the economy.
A cut may give the politicians enough breathing space to enable them to
finalise plans for a emergency spending package later in the year. But the
lull could be shortlived, for the spotlight will swing inexorably onto the
LDP's plans for tax cuts and public spending increases to save the economy
from outright recession.
The politicians will then be the ones on the spot.

<TEXT>
JAPANESE official interest rates are expected to be cut within the next few
days after mounting pressure over the past few weeks on the Bank of Japan to
stimulate the flagging economy.
The Bank is expected to cut its official discount rate from 3.25 per cent to
either 2.75 or 2.5 per cent within days.
Financial analysts believe the Bank decided on Friday to cut the official
discount rate interest rate, despite official denials over the weekend.
The likely cut follows a period of intense political and business pressure
upon Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of Japan, to relax monetary
policy.
The last cut, a 0.5 per cent reduction to 3.25 per cent, was six months ago.
Since then the economy has fallen to the verge of outright recession, with
consumer spending deeply depressed.
Over the last month the Bank has publicly acknowledged the economy's
deterioration, tacitly accepting the case for a further cut.
A cut, which would be the sixth since September 1991, would take the
Japanese official discount rate to around the lows it reached during 1987
and 1988, the height of the speculative bubble economy.
It is thought that the Bank will resist pushing the official discount rate
below 2.5 per cent for fear that such a move would signal a return to the
cheap credit policies of the bubble era.
A further cut may have a limited impact upon the fragile Tokyo stock market
because it has been predicted for so long many analysts have already
discounted it.
However, it will help to reduce funding costs for Japan's banks which are
struggling against a rising tide of bad debts created by the bubble's
collapse.
Some analysts believe a cut may prompt a surge in retail consumer spending
because consumers have been delaying making big purchases until a the long
expected cut in borrowing costs was delivered. However Japanese households
as a whole are net recipients of interest income as a result of their
prodigious savings. So for elderly people in particular an interest rate cut
may reduce disposable income.
The cut will help the ruling Liberal Democratic Party respond to pressure
from Japan's trading partners, who are calling for a more expansionary
policy to help reduce Japan's trade surplus.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Manufacturers' profits 'spurred by cheap finance'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST of the restructuring undertaken by Japanese manufacturers in the 1980s,
widely admired by their US and European competitors, failed to improve
Japanese companies' profitability, according to a report published by the
Bank of Japan.
Much of the apparent improvement in Japanese companies' financial
performance in the last decade was a reflection of cheap finance rather than
improved efficiency, it says.
The report casts doubt on one of the central tenets of manufacturing
strategy in the 1980s widely adopted in the US and Europe, that Japanese
industrial competitiveness was mainly a reflection of the flexibility and
efficiency of Japanese factories.
It says that Japanese companies must radically restructure to markedly
improve the earning capacity of their core businesses. Japanese companies
are not only facing a sharp downturn in their domestic market but also a
steep rise in the cost of capital which could severely impair their
financial performance.
The Japanese approach to lean manufacturing has been widely followed by
western manufacturers. It involves the rapid introduction of new models with
a growing stress upon their design and technical sophistication to add
value. Japanese electronics and automobile plants are designed with the
flexibility to produce a wide range of models tailored to specific segments
of the market.
The Japanese shift to lean-manufacturing was widely thought to be the
foundation for Japanese industrial competitiveness. But, according to the
report: 'In the economic expansion phase from 1987, improved financial
balances shrouded an ongoing decline in the earning capacities of core
divisions. However, financial divisions are not likely to contribute to
profit to any great extent and thus it is crucial that enterprises again
revamp their earning capacity.'
It says the improvement in Japanese companies' pre-tax profits to sales
ratio in the last decade was mainly due to a fall in financial expenses
reflecting the extremely low cost of capital during the late 1980s.
The gradual fall in operating profit margins suggests that management
efforts to rationalise production, add more value to products and move to
small lot production of a greater diversity of production, has not improved
enterprises' core earnings capacity. The report says companies will have to
cut costs and revise their medium-term business plans to cope with higher
financial costs.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has nominated Mr John Rollwagen, chairman and chief
executive of Cray Research, to be deputy secretary of commerce.
The nomination fulfils widespread expectations among US high-technology
industry executives, who backed Mr Clinton in the election campaign, that
one of their number would join the administration.
Mr Rollwagen, 52, has headed Cray, the world's largest maker of
supercomputers, since 1977. He is a founding member of the Computer Systems
Policy Project (CSPP), a group of computer industry chief executives who
worked closely with the Clinton election campaign on formulating
high-technology policies aimed at improving the competitiveness of US
industries.
In particular CSPP advocates the construction of a 'national information
infrastructure,' a high-speed data communications network linking schools,
businesses, research laboratories and, ultimately, homes throughout the US.
Mr Clinton said Mr Rollwagen would work to help restore 'the competitiveness
of American business'.
Mr Brown said Mr Rollwagen would play a central role in the Commerce
Department's efforts to promote high-tech industries and create job
opportunities in the areas of high technology and telecommunications.
Cray's board of directors has elected Mr John Carlson, the company's
president and chief operating officer, to replace Mr Rollwagen.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Clash heightens confusion over Brazil economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE conflicting signals emerging from the Brazilian government on economic
policy intensified over the weekend with a showdown between President Itamar
Franco and his economics team over interest rates.
The confusion started on Friday night when the Central Bank announced a 0.5
percentage-point rise in interest rates to keep up with inflation, which is
running at around 30 per cent a month, its highest rate for three years.
A furious Mr Franco countered with an official note reversing the decision,
and adding: 'High interest rates generate recession and unemployment and are
ineffective in containing inflation.'
Since taking office in December, Mr Franco has made low interest rates to
spur growth his main policy plank. In the absence of fiscal reform, however,
real interest rates remain the government's only weapon against inflation
and they have been rising steadily this month. Economic uncertainty has
pushed overnight market rates to 42.5 per cent a month and last week the
market refused to accept 28-day Treasury paper for the first time in two
years.
Mr Paulo Haddad, the economy minister, and his team spent Saturday arguing
the case for high real interest rates to Mr Franco. After this, in the
second official communique within 24 hours, Mr Franco agreed to short-term
'technical adjustments'. However, he reaffirmed his objection to a prolonged
high interest rates.
Mr Haddad yesterday confirmed that the government was working on a
stabilisation programme, but discounted the possibility of a shock plan.
However, the public battle over interest rates has added to the uncertainty
about economic policy in Brazil, and Mr Haddad's future now seems in doubt.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ZAMBIA plans to abolish exchange controls inherited at independence nearly
30 years ago, Mr Emmanuel Kasonde, the finance minister, announced on Friday
in the course of an innovative budget warmly welcomed by western donors.
In a move thought to be without precedent in Africa, Mr Kasonde said the
central bank would be given the authority to prevent government ministries
from spending more than the amounts voted by parliament.
Despite drought, falling GDP, and an 80 per cent rise in public spending, Mr
Kasonde presented a balanced 'cash limits' budget, warning that the country
could no longer afford to live beyond its means.
Government would stop borrowing from the central bank, monetary growth would
slow, and private sector investment would no longer be crowded out, the
minister told the national assembly.
Mr Kasonde said the government no longer played any role in setting the
exchange rate for the Zambian kwacha.
It had liberalised interest rates and was funding government debt by a
treasury bill auction system. Legislation to abolish exchange control would
be introduced later this year, he said.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Clinton warned on limiting pension rises: Plan to cut cost
of living increases will be a 'landmine' says finance committee chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton was given early warning yesterday that any proposal
to limit the automatic cost of living increases in social security pensions
would face fierce Democratic opposition in Congress.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, chairman of the finance
committee, through which any such proposal must pass, described the idea as
'a landmine' and 'a death wish'. He added: 'Let's get it out of the way
right now.'
Retirement benefits, he insisted, were not an entitlement, but the fruits of
fully paid-up insurance and were disbursed out of a trust fund that was in
comfortable surplus.
However, Senator Moynihan said he was prepared to talk about increasing
income taxes on pension benefits, another option known to be under
consideration by the Clinton cabinet, which finished a weekend of
deliberations on deficit reduction and economic stimulation at the Camp
David retreat yesterday afternoon.
A temporary freeze on pension cost of living adjustments has been proposed
by Mr Leon Panetta, Mr Clinton's budget director, apparently with the
support of some influential Democratic members of Congress such as Mr
Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader.
Retirement benefits account for about one quarter of the federal budget and
a one-year freeze on indexed increases could save as much as Dollars 15bn
(Pounds 9.9bn) in the first year. Sen Moynihan, however, disputed these
calculations.
Governor Roy Romer of Colorado, the Democratic chairman of the national
governor's conference, which is holding its winter meeting here, also said
yesterday that changes in social security as part of the deficit reduction
plan had to be 'on the table'.
The only semi-authoritative comment from the administration came from Mr
Roger Altman, the deputy treasury secretary, who said, neutrally, in a
television interview recorded before the Camp David discussions began that
he did not know which way the decision on indexation would fall. But he
added; 'There are some people who are strongly opposed.'
Mr Altman did confirm that the stimulus package under consideration was
'roughly Dollars 20bn' - made of about Dollars 15bn in additional spending
and Dollars 5bn-Dollars 7bn 'on the tax side'.
Changes in social security payments invariably provoke intense controversy
and Mr Clinton has had enough of this in his first 10 days in office. But Mr
Robert Dole, Republican leader in the Senate, warned yesterday not to read
too much into early reverses for the president.
Two weekend polls suggested that Mr Clinton's popularity is still holding up
quite well. Weekend newspapers were also filled with much introspection over
whether the media were being too hard on the new president and were possibly
out of touch with the nation at large.
The essence, but not all the details, of Mr Clinton's proposals is to be
contained in his first state of the union message on February 17, to be
followed by his first budget about a month later.
The Clinton administration plans an initiative to remove constraints on bank
lending and help ease the credit crunch, Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger
Altman said yesterday, sending the strongest signal yet on bank policy,
Reuter reports.
'We are going to make a major effort to try to alleviate those supply side
constraints on lending,' he said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COSSACK leaders agreed at the weekend to create a Cossack State Service from
March 1, bringing together the claimed 4m Cossacks who have formed militias
throughout Russia and in Russian communities in other former Soviet
republics.
The Cossacks, descended from frontier settlers under the Tsars, are
concentrated in south Russia around the River Don. They have become
increasingly involved in protecting the Russian population in regional
conflicts in the Caucasus and made the announcement at the close of their
convention in Russia.
Two other hardline groups held conventions in Russia over the weekend.
The once-banned National Salvation Front, a largely nationalist grouping,
claimed that it had sent 18 volunteers from a recently created Russian
National Legion to fight in Serbia. Mr Nikolai Lysenko, leader of the
National Republican Party, told the RIA news agency that the Legion had
enrolled an army of 300.
Mr Mikhail Asatfiev, leader of the Constitutional Democrats, called for a
boycott of the referendum on the constitution called for April 11, and
demanded elections.
The meetings were held as the official Itar Tass news agency claimed an army
major had been arrested on Saturday for plotting the assassination of Mr
Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, as a 'contribution to the cause of
socialism'.
Major Ivan Kislov, who had deserted from his base in the Far East on
December 25, was arrested in the main government complex last Wednesday,
where he was hiding in an attic room. Itar Tass quoted Major Kislov as
saying he planned to disguise himself as a snow sweeper and assassinate Mr
Yeltsin with a knife.
In St Petersburg, a conference of hardline communist groups protested
against the 'anti-popular' policies of the Russian government and called for
the unity of all communist and nationalist forces.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Republicans told to shift on abortion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Haley Barbour, the new Republican national chairman, said at the weekend
the party needed 'its head examined' if it continued to make opposition to
abortion the cornerstone of its political platform.
Mr Barbour, a Washington lawyer-lobbyist from Mississippi who served in the
Reagan White House, was elected to the position on the third ballot of the
party meeting in St Louis on Friday night. In an acceptance speech on
Saturday, he repeated warnings to the religious right wing of the Republican
party delivered by the outgoing chairman, Mr Rich Bond.
But, in an implicit criticism of the Bush administration, he said the party
should not be dominated by the Washington elite and must rebuild its 'bottom
up' grassroots strength.
The power of the right wing is rooted at the local level and it was very
much in evidence in St Louis, even though Mr Barbour, his personal
opposition to abortion notwithstanding, was not its first choice as
chairman.
Mr Bond's speech was virulently condemned by hardline conservatives, who
noted, pointedly, that he had presided over last August's nominating
convention, which had focused so much on traditional family values.

<TEXT>
FOREIGNERS began leaving Zaire over the weekend as relative calm appeared to
have been restored after mutinous soldiers went on a two-day rampage of
shooting and looting in the capital which left 65 people dead.
The exodus of the expatriate community, already severely diminished as a
result of frequent outbreaks of violence during the past 18 months, will
further damage the collapsed economy of black Africa's second largest
country.
The latest outbreak of violence will also exacerbate the country's
instability and deepen an 18-month-old political crisis as a divided
pro-democracy opposition continues to try to wrestle power from President
Mobutu Sese Seko.
France began evacuating 160 expatriates from Kinshasa yesterday, ferrying
them by boat under military escort across the Zaire river to Brazzaville,
the capital of neighbouring Congo. About 300 foreigners, mostly Belgians and
Germans, escaped the city on Saturday aboard President Mobutu's luxury
riverboat.
There are about 7,000 Europeans resident in Zaire and a much larger
community of African expatriates. Many of them had their houses and
businesses gutted during the two days of violence by soldiers angry about
the introduction of worthless Zaire 5m banknotes.
Elite troops from Mr Mobutu's Special Presidential Division appeared to have
re-asserted control by Saturday.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Bosnia negotiators count considerable achievements: Robert
Mauthner talks to Lord Owen about the peace process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance, the ring-masters of the international
conference on Bosnia-Hercegovina, have lost a battle, but they are convinced
that they have not yet lost the peace.
After five months of some of the most intensive negotiations in recent
diplomatic history, they have been obliged to send back their proposed peace
package to the United Nations Security Council in the hope that its
endorsement by the world body will finally bring the warring parties in
Bosnia to their senses.
Though clearly disappointed that they were not able to wrap up an overall
agreement in Geneva, the mediators have nothing to be ashamed of. They
managed, almost miraculously, to persuade the bitter Bosnian adversaries to
sit round the same negotiating table for four weeks and reach at least a
partial accord on a constitutional framework.
The pace of the negotiations has been relentless. During the short intervals
between sessions, Mr Vance and Lord Owen have travelled ceaselessly between
Geneva, Belgrade, Zagreb and Sarajevo, to lay the groundwork for an
agreement.
'I think I have never worked so hard,' Lord Owen said in an interview. 'The
foreign secretary is a tough job and so is being a junior hospital doctor
(Lord Owen has been both at some stage in his life). But we have worked
incredible hours and travelled a long way. It's cost me one slipped disc,'
he said wryly.
Many people have been surprised by the close partnership between these two
men of different generations and with such dissimilar temperaments. But Lord
Owen has a simple explanation. 'We have been very close friends ever since
we were foreign ministers together (in the late 1970s). I think I can fairly
say it was one of the closest British-American relationships in foreign
affairs that there has ever been.
'The whole Anglo-American Rhodesian plan, which laid the foundations for
Zimbabwe's independence, was done between us. We used to travel and give
press conferences together in Africa. So the act that you see here actually
has a past history.'
Even so, how were clashes avoided between the often abrasive and irritable
David Owen and the outwardly gentle, but inwardly tough Cyrus Vance? 'I
think most people are amazed by the chemistry,' says Lord Owen. 'I don't
know why the chemistry works, but I can only say that, from my part, it's
just deep, profound respect.'
Indeed, David Owen clearly regards 'Cy' as the senior partner, which doesn't
prevent him from sometimes upstaging him in public. It was Mr Vance who
first proposed Lord Owen as the European Community's representative in the
mediation partnership, after it became clear that Lord Carrington was
anxious to give up the job. And it was Mr Vance who has been the
conference's chief disciplinarian.
'In August last year we agreed that we would give it six months,' Lord Owen
says. 'It was Cy's concept that you had to come to Geneva, that you had to
stay here and live, breathe, dream and eat the problem, and that people had
to be flowing in and out of your office all hours of the day and night. And
that you had to be near enough to go in and out of Yugoslavia and that we
had to be in continuous session.'
It was also Mr Vance, according to Lord Owen, who insisted that President
Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia should be closely associated with the
negotiations, a move which brought quick results when Mr Milosevic put
pressure on Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, to accept the
mediators' constitutional principles for Bosnia-Hercegovina.
'Having negotiated the ceasefire (of January 1992) in Croatia with
Milosevic, Cy Vance has always been clear that we must never ostracise him,'
Lord Owen says. 'We never did. Cy's relationship with him is a very
important one. There is trust there, at a level of man for man.'
Lord Owen, too, has considerable respect for Mr Milosevic's capacities,
though clearly not for his past policies. 'Extremely well-informed,' 'a
politician to his finger tips,' 'able to grasp every single nuance' of a
problem, are among the phrases he uses to describe the Serbian leader.
However, it was not until Mr Milosevic won the recent Serbian presidential
election that he was prepared to put his weight behind a Bosnian settlement.
'He now has a real power base,' Lord Owen says. 'He is now prepared to take
on the hard right, he is prepared to deal with the issue (Bosnia) and he is
heading towards leading Serbia back into the European family. I have no
doubt of that.'
'He has made grievous mistakes and I think he has understood that, like a
lot of the intelligentsia who went down the nationalist, greater-Serbian
route.
'They won't change their philosophy that the Serb people must be protected
wherever they are. But they have understood the fact that they cannot do
this by force of arms. Serbia and Montenegro have also understood, I think,
that they have the capacity to be very powerful players in this part of
Europe and that, as the pariahs of Europe, they have no chance of achieving
this.'
Though clearly worried about the adverse effect that an escalation of the
fighting between Croats and Serbs in Krajina may have on the peace process,
Lord Owen continues to look on the bright side of things. 'The fighting has
had a double effect. I think the fact that the Security Council passed a
resolution critical of Croatia has actually helped to give the Serbians
confidence that the Security Council is not packed completely against them,
as they had previously thought.'
Lord Owen still believes that, if the right sort of pressure is exerted by
the Security Council, the warring Bosnian factions can be persuaded to reach
an agreement in New York. But he is sharply critical of any suggestions, on
the lines of those mooted by some members of US President Bill Clinton's
entourage, that the embargo on arms exports to the Bosnian Moslems should be
lifted.
Pointing out that the arms embargo applies to all the warring factions of
the former Yugoslavia, Lord Owen says that, if you lift it for one side, you
would also be lifting it for everybody else, 'pouring fuel on the flames'.
'I personally think that, if we were to lift the arms embargo, people
wouldn't stay involved in the UN humanitarian effort.'
His credo as a mediator is unambiguous. 'I haven't ceased for one moment my
indignation and anger about ethnic cleansing. But it's no use getting onto
your high horse and saying you won't talk to this or that person because
they are branded as war criminals. You have to be objective and fair-minded
and genuinely seek a negotiated settlement and leave the moral judgments to
others.
'But in your own mind, there must be a determination that what has happened
in the former Yugoslavia must be reversed, an absolute belief that we are
not going to have the Moslems treated like the Jews once were in Europe and
that we must acknowledge that this is a wrong that has got to be righted.'

</HEADLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMID plenty of soul-searching, the European Community will today open its
doors to television cameras and allow portions of an EC foreign ministers'
meeting to be broadcast live to Europe and the US.
The exercise is part of the EC's effort to make the Community's business
more relevant to the European citizen, but it has caused traditionalists to
wonder whether Brussels risks turning into Broadway.
'It's a bit of a circus,' said one senior diplomat shaking his head at the
prospect of foreign ministers abandoning behind-closed-doors diplomacy and
playing to the gallery back home, at the expense of pressing subjects such
as the conflict in Yugoslavia.
The Danish presidency of the EC is the driving force behind today's modest
experiment in glasnost, the first time television cameras have been allowed
to film a meeting of the Council of Ministers in the 35-year history of the
Community.
The democratically minded Danes argue that too much EC business is wrapped
in secrecy, couched in unfathomable bureaucratic language, and too remote
from the ordinary EC citizen. By opening up parts of the two-day foreign
ministers' session in Brussels, the Danes hope to set a precedent for other
ministerial meetings during their six-month presidency.
But critics - mainly among such EC founder-members as France, Belgium and
Italy - counter that the man on the Clapham omnibus or the woman on the
Munich tram will be left no wiser at the end of today's television
extravaganza.
EC citizens will see (it is hoped) five-minute speeches on the EC's
programme delivered by each of the 12 foreign ministers, as well as a
set-piece by Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president. Also on
camera is the ceremonial opening of EC enlargement negotiations with
Austria, Finland, and Sweden, as well as the signature of a trade agreement
with Romania.
None of this is expected to match the intensity of a live congressional
interrogation in the US or a raucous House of Commons session; but as a
first step toward more transparency in EC business it has attracted the
interest of Euronews, DR, the Danish TV network, ARD in Germany, and CNN,
the US network, all of which will be present today.
Journalists, normally confined to the smoke-ridden ground floor of the
Charlemagne building, will be allowed to watch the live segments on
closed-circuit television. But once the cameras are ushered out, it will be
back to business as usual, well away from the prying eyes of the EC public.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Devaluation of the Punt: UK interest rate plans prove final
straw - Talk has revived of a 'fast track' to Emu, with a few currencies
creating monetary union ahead of schedule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Irish government fought valiantly for five months to stave off
devaluation of the punt, but late last week Dublin finally threw in the
towel.
The UK government's decision last Tuesday to cut interest rates by 1
percentage point to 6 per cent was a blow; but more damaging were reports
that British ministers were contemplating further rate reductions to stoke
economic recovery.
According to European monetary officials, the prospect of even lower UK
interest rate cuts - plus the likely further weakening of sterling -
persuaded the Irish they could no longer hold on. Reluctantly they requested
a meeting of the EC's monetary committee in Brussels on Saturday to propose
a 10 per cent devaluation of the Irish punt against all the currencies
inside the exchange rate mechanism (ERM).
The meeting on Saturday lasted just under four hours. Irish officials who
earlier had been dropping hints about leaving the ERM temporarily, like the
British and Italians in the wake of last September's currency crisis, were
bruised but satisfied. A 10 per cent devaluation should help restore the
loss in competitiveness caused by sterling's decline.
Because one third of Ireland's trade is with Britain, some EC officials are
tempted to view the punt as a special case. They argue that its problems are
largely unrelated to the crisis inside the ERM, whose grid of fixed but
adjustable exchange rate parities is intended to serve as the vehicle for
European monetary union set down in the Maastricht treaty.
In fact, says one official, the punt was under attack well before sterling
began to slide last year. Central banks, operating under ERM rules,
intervened heavily on the punt's behalf; the Belgian central bank bought
Dollars 1bn-worth of punts in three hours one Friday morning last year. The
Irish government did its best, raising interest rates sky-high to deter
speculators; but the punt was never viewed as a fully paid-up member of the
premier currency league, headed by Germany, France, the Benelux countries,
and possibly Denmark.
Thus it is possible to argue that the punt's devaluation - following the
floating of the lira and sterling and the devaluation of the Spanish peseta
and Portuguese escudo - completes a general realignment of weaker ERM
currencies which should have happened before black September.
But the Irish can still argue that the system has let them down.
Only two weeks ago EC finance ministers issued a statement welcoming the new
Dublin government's determination to defend the punt's existing party inside
the ERM as 'entirely justified'. Elsewhere, senior German officials have
regularly appeared on Irish television or issued statements praising the
government's anti-inflation credentials and dismissing a punt devaluation as
unwarranted.
These statements were made at Dublin's request. That they failed in the end
to count is unnerving - which may explain why some observers in Brussels are
convinced that fresh speculative attacks inside the ERM are inevitable, the
obvious target being the franc.
This threat has revived talk of a 'fast track' to Emu, whereby a nucleus of
hard-core currencies would create some form of monetary union ahead of
schedule. 'The possibility of devaluation of the franc is too big, it's too
destabilising,' said a diplomat who described a putative Franco-German
initiative as 'not the first option' but one designed to 'save the ERM and
Emu'.
According to several officials in Brussels, Germany and France are
considering how to take further steps toward monetary co-operation to
restore credibility to Emu. These moves would not necessarily amount to a
full union; but they would aim to impress markets that the two allies were
serious about Emu, perhaps by narrowing the margin of fluctuation between
the franc and D-Mark or even declaring the intention to swap observers on
the boards of the Bundesbank and a future independent Bank of France.
Paris and Bonn deny concrete proposals are in the offing, but last week Mr
Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, took the talk of an accelerated
Emu seriously enough to set his formidable presence against it, on the
grounds that it was not compatible with Maastricht.
And the venue he chose to deliver his speech was where the talk is loudest:
Brussels.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH government officials yesterday said they did not expect the
devaluation of the Irish punt to have a knock-on effect on the franc.
'This is a purely Irish move, linked to the close connections between the
Irish and the UK economies. It does not suggest that speculative attacks
will recommence on other European currencies,' a Finance Ministry official
said. 'The markets can be irrational, but this is not a decision which
concerns the franc.'
Some economic analysts suggested over the weekend that the punt's
devaluation now left the franc alone in the front-line against speculators.
The French currency came under attack last week, but ended well above its
ERM floor on Friday evening.
France's internal debate on monetary policy was given a fresh twist over the
weekend when Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the former Bundesbank president, was
reported in the French press as telling the world economic forum in Davos
that the franc could appreciate against the D-Mark if it was allowed to
float, as the French economy was stronger than the German one.
The French government opposed floating the franc for political, not
economic, reasons, he said. A break in the link between the franc and D-Mark
would be the end of the EMS, he added.
Mr Pohl's remarks are likely both to cheer and worry the French government.
While a compliment to France's economic performance, it also offers
ammunition to critics of the government's monetary policy, such as Mr Alain
Madelin, the conservative former industry minister.
He has suggested that the franc should be allowed to float upwards against
the D-Mark, to pave the way for a fall in interest rates to stimulate the
sluggish economy.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Devaluation of the Punt: Government awaits the political
counterpunch

IRISH industry and farm leaders at the weekend expressed relief at the
government's defeat in its battle to defend the punt. But the reversal is
likely to lead to some tough political battles ahead.
Mr Michael Noonan, finance spokesman for the opposition Fine Gael party,
described the decision to devalue as 'an ignominious climbdown and a most
dismal defeat for the government. They failed to put domestic policies in
place that would convince the international community that we were serious
about the defence of the currency and they also failed to convince our
colleagues in Europe that they should come to our aid.'
The resolve of Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, was finally broken by
the loss of political and business consensus at home and the threat of a
sharp increase next week in mortgage and bank lending rates. He said
yesterday: 'I could not put my hand on my heart and recommend to the
government that Irish mortgage holders and business should pay another 3, 4
or 5 per cent (on interest rates) for the sake of trying to win a battle for
a European system where I was not getting even equal support that the French
were getting.'
Since the last of Ireland's exchange controls were lifted at the beginning
of the year, interest rate management has been the government's main weapon
to defend the punt. This has forced up commercial lending rates to record
levels. Several key manufacturing associations, particularly in the
textiles, food processing and engineering sectors, warned last week that
thousands of job losses were in the pipeline, and urged the government to
devalue. Farm leaders have been recommending a devaluation for months.
Although the immediate threat of big job losses and more interest rate rises
has been averted by the devaluation, it is thought unlikely that commercial
lending rates will fall from their current levels for some time yet. As a
result of staying within the narrow band of the ERM, downward movements in
Irish rates will still have to await cuts in German rates if further attacks
on the punt are to be avoided.
There is also lingering concern about whether the markets will see a 10 per
cent devaluation as sufficient, especially if the UK pursues an aggressive
interest rate policy.
Mr John Beggs, chief economist at Allied Irish Banks, said: 'In the short
term I would expect some improvement on the interest rate front. Looking
beyond that, I think we have hitched our wagon to sterling and whether you
agree with the devaluation policy or not, that is a problem we face.'
Mr Ahern defended his no-devaluation stance. 'If we had given in last
September we could well be here today on the third or fourth devaluation.'
He said there would be no further devaluations. 'We have built into the
figures competitive advantage for future turbulence and we have done that to
convince the markets that that is the end of speculation.'
The country's priority now was to diversify further its exports away from
the UK market.
The immediate cost to the government of the devaluation has been to increase
the foreign debt by IPounds 1bn and its servicing charge by IPounds 80m per
year. The new Fianna Fail-Labour coalition has committed itself to a job
creation and public sector investment programme, which will entail a public
sector deficit in the region of 3.2 per cent of GDP this year, and there is
still some IPounds 300m in commitments whose financing has not yet been
resolved.
Mr Ahern promised yesterday that next month's budget would be a tough one,
as any softening on that front would again encourage the speculators. This
is likely to produce tensions within the ruling coalition, as Labour views
job creation as a priority and will resist cuts in its favoured investment
programmes.
The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which supported the no-devaluation
policy, also hinted yesterday that its policy of negotiated pay restraint
over the past six years might now be reviewed.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Devaluation of the Punt: Germany to hold steady course

<TEXT>
THERE may be more exchange rate tensions ahead, but the Bundesbank will
stick to its prime tasks of maintaining D-Mark stability and holding the
core of the European monetary system intact, German economists agreed
yesterday.
'There is no chance of a sudden change of tactics or position,' said Mr
Peter Pietsch, an economist at Commerzbank. This view was tacitly supported
by Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, who said the prime cause of the
punt's devaluation was Ireland's close economic relationship with Britain.
It was important now that Ireland, where the economic fundamentals were
'good', should continue with its stability-oriented policies so as not to
endanger its progress toward economic convergence, he added.
The Bundesbank offered no comments on complaints from Mr Bertie Ahern, the
Irish finance minister, that it had not supported the punt with the same
resolve as it had the French franc. 'The aim of our activities is to support
(the monetary system) and therefore all member currencies, including the
punt,' a spokesman said.
However, the devaluation cast doubts on the German central bank's persistent
claims, repeated last Thursday by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank
president, that the exchange rate mechanism 'has regained stability'.
According to Mr Pietsch there will be 'more unrest as long as German
short-term interest rates remain high'.
The Bundesbank's staunch support for the franc is based partly on economic
realities and partly on the need to avoid drawing the blame if the ERM
breaks down.
Its interest rates policy - hardened by a 4.4 per cent rise in the west
Germany consumer prices index in January - is founded on the need to protect
its credibility as guardian of a stable D-Mark.
According to Mr Adolf Rosenstock, senior economist at the Industrial Bank of
Japan in Frankfurt, last month's increase in value added tax accounted for
only 0.5 percentage points of January's 1.1 per cent month-on-month rise in
prices. The rest was due to unabated increases in rents and the cost of
services.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Ministries blamed over red tape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INCREASING burden of red tape on British business is partly caused by
the ambivalence of the Department of Trade and Industry and the Treasury
towards deregulation, according to a paper published today by the Social
Market Foundation.
The paper is written by Mr David Willetts, Conservative MP for Havant, who
was formerly a Downing Street policy adviser and director of the Centre for
Policy Studies, the think tank founded by Lady Thatcher and Lord Joseph. It
is published a day before a seminar called by Mr John Major at which
ministers and senior civil servants will be expected to explain their plans
for deregulation.
Mr Willetts says red tape has increased steadily since the mid-1980s and now
represents a serious obstacle to the creation of a flexible, dynamic
economy. An important reason for the growth in regulation is the ambivalence
of the two main ministries involved, he suggests.
The DTI was concerned mainly with large companies, which often regarded
regulation as a useful barrier to new competition. The Treasury saw
regulation as a way of attaining objectives without public spending.
Mr Willetts targets 10 areas of government legislation for urgent action,
including the Companies Act requirement that small firms carry out an audit,
the quality management standard BS5750, food safety legislation and the
Children Act, governing child care facilities.
Regulation is allowed to proliferate because departments aim for the highest
standards without questioning the cost; because central government wrongly
blames Europe or local authorities for the problem; and because in areas
such as safety, regulation appeals to our emotions.
The government needs to look at a stronger lay involvement in working groups
drafting legislation so that acceptable basic standards are adopted, Mr
Willetts said. Business should be disciplined by the prospect of legal
liability rather than be forced to comply with a mass of regulation designed
to prevent mishaps.
Areas of action should include:
Removing the statutory audit for small firms. This can cost up to 4 per cent
of turnover and it prevents companies using low-cost book-keepers. The EC
directive harmonising company law does not require an independent audit but
the UK insists on one.
The Food Safety Act. This was introduced after food poisoning scares and
imposes tight controls on retailers. Yet there is evidence that, in many
instances, problems arise further down the food chain.
Rail and Tube safety. Recent accidents have prompted a huge programme of
safety spending, pushing up fares. Yet rail remains one of the safest forms
of transport. Accident inquiries often produce uncosted and overlapping
proposals for reform.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Realignment may renew pressure on franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN finance officials expressed hope yesterday that calm would return
to the exchange rate mechanism after the punt was devalued by 10 per cent
against the other currencies in the system.
However, some foreign exchange dealers warned last night that the
realignment, agreed by officials of the European Community's Monetary
Committee on Saturday, could trigger another round of speculative selling of
the Danish krone and French franc.
The view of dealers about the Irish currency's realignment - the largest
single devaluation in the history of the ERM - was not shared by monetary
officials.
'We have had one big realignment of the system that has taken five months,'
said one EC monetary official in Brussels, suggesting that the core
currencies in the system - including the French franc and Danish krone -
would not come under any more attacks from speculators.
Officials in some EC countries were nonetheless concerned that the
Bundesbank had not reduced its short-term interest rates - currently about
8.6 per cent - to levels which would reduce the premium received by
investors who sell European currencies for D-Marks.
Mr Bertie Ahern, Ireland's finance minister, said yesterday that a reduction
in Irish interest rates - which have been at record levels to defend the
punt in the past five months - might still depend on a cut in interest rates
by the Bundesbank.
The Portuguese finance ministry also called for greater co-ordination on the
setting of European interest rates, in what may have been a carefully coded
criticism of Bundesbank policy.
'The recent turbulence in the markets and the response in terms of exchange
rate policy . . . show clearly the need to strengthen co-ordination of
monetary and exchange rate policy between member states,' the ministry said.
The devaluation came at the end of a ferocious battle by the Irish
authorities to preserve their current ERM parities against the D-Mark bloc
of currencies.
The move is expected to ease rates in the Dublin interbank money market,
where the overnight lending rate has occasionally touched 100 per cent in
recent months. However, the broader consequences of the devaluation for the
ERM were unclear last night.
EC officials in Brussels claimed the devaluation had been necessary because
of factors unrelated to the crisis inside the ERM.
They argued that, because a third of Ireland's trade was with Britain, the
currency needed to be devalued to restore the competitiveness lost by the
decline of sterling in recent months.
Foreign exchange analysts were concerned that the devaluation was not
warranted by Ireland's fundamental economic position.
'Once again, a devaluation signals the death knell for the ERM,' said Mr
Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS Phillips and Drew in
London. 'The devaluation of the Irish punt only took place because the
Bundesbank did not promise action at its council meeting later this week.'
Miss Ruth Lea, chief economist at Mitsubishi International in London, said
there was a big risk of downward pressure against the French franc. She
described the devaluation as 'another chip against the ERM edifice'.
Some economists said any further UK base rate cuts would weaken sterling
against the punt, triggering more speculation against the Irish currency.

FT  01 FEB 93 / Ireland hits out at Bundesbank and UK on punt: Finance
minister criticises failure to come to aid of smaller nations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE IRISH government hit out yesterday at the Bundesbank, Britain and the
management of the European exchange rate mechanism, after the punt's 10 per
cent devaluation on Saturday.
Mr Bertie Ahern, finance minister, said on Irish state radio: 'We fought a
ferocious battle with the markets.
'We hoped for a change in a number of policy directions. We had hoped for a
realignment of the currencies under attack, mainly the French and the Danes.
We had hoped that the multilateral aid that we were requesting from the
Community and particularly from the Bundesbank . . . would happen. Instead
(there was) bilateral aid for the French which worked against us.'
The devaluation followed three days of heavy selling of the punt on the
foreign exchange markets, triggered by the 1 percentage point cut in UK base
rates on Tuesday and the subsequent weakening of sterling.
Mr Ruari Quinn, employment and enterprise minister, criticised Britain over
the effects of its exchange-rate policy: 'We are not here because the Irish
economy has suddenly nosedived. We are here because of a series of political
decisions . . . some reflect Britain's basic antipathy towards European
union.'
Mr Ahern was particularly bitter about the failure of the ERM to rescue
smaller members of the system. 'One of the great difficulties with the ERM
is that not only is there not equal help for all members but the larger
members seem to be able to negotiate side agreements. So, a small country
with a small currency is expected to take on a bigger burden in the fight
against the markets, even though its economic fundamentals are correct,
while a country like France can get a separate deal.'
These factors, together with a threatened rise in domestic mortgage and
commercial lending rates and a collapse of the domestic political consensus
to defend the currency, persuaded the government to devalue, he said.
The Bundesbank refused to comment directly on Mr Ahern's complaints. 'The
aim of our activities is to support (the monetary system) and therefore, all
member currencies, including the punt,' an official said.
The UK government played down Mr Quinn's criticism. However, some officials
said the punt's devaluation was a further example of the 'fault lines'
identified by the UK when sterling left the ERM in September.
Downing Street took the rare step yesterday of denying a Sunday Times report
that Mr John Major was seeking further interest rate cuts - of up to 2
points - and had taken control of economic policy away from Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor.
The decision to deny the story came after consultation between Mr Major and
Mr Lamont, and with the Bank of England.
'There was total agreement between the Treasury, the Bank of England and
Number 10 that the move to 6 per cent interest rates was justified by the
various monetary and other indicators.'
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, seized on the statement, saying the
government had no clear economic strategy. Whether it was the prime minister
or the chancellor in charge 'the British economy is paying a terrible price
for a cabinet which has lost its way'.

FT  01 FEB 93 / ICI plans 14.5% rises for flexible working
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries' 20,000 manual workers look likely to receive
pay rises of at least 14.5 per cent during their current 12-month wage round
ending in June.
This compares with private-sector increases averaging just over 3 per cent.
The government wants to impose a 1.5 per cent pay limit in the public
sector.
ICI insists that the increases being negotiated at local level are
self-financing and the price is worth paying because it involves sweeping
changes in working practices.
So far 3,000 workers at the company's sites at Grangemouth, Huddersfield and
Yalding in Kent have received 6 per cent wage increases as a result of
workplace reforms that involve greater worker flexibility and
'multi-skilling'.
These rises are in addition to 5.1 per cent which ICI manual workers
received last June through the company's normal annual pay negotiations and
3.5 per cent awarded the following month from the company's employee profit
scheme.
Shift and other allowances as well as call-out payments are also being
increased by 6 per cent under the local deals.
As a result, the annual salaries of ICI manual workers will now range
between Pounds 10,734 and Pounds 16,011.
Two further increases of 4 per cent each will be awarded on the first and
second anniversaries of the deals.
The company said it expected the rest of its manual workforce to agree
workplace changes at local level over the next few months. All will receive
the same pay increases as a result.
ICI says the local pay deals derive from a 1991 agreement signed with the
five unions recognised by the company, which radically reformed work
organisation across the company's 13 plants. It has taken more than 18
months of intensive local negotiation for the workplace changes to be
agreed.

FT  01 FEB 93 / ICI to offer 14.5% rise for flexible working agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries' 20,000 manual workers look set to receive pay
rises of at least 14.5 per cent during their current 12-month wage round
ending in June.
This compares with private-sector increases averaging just over 3 per cent.
The government is seeking to impose a 1.5 per cent pay limit in the public
sector.
ICI insists that the increases being negotiated at local level are
self-financing and the price is worth paying because it involves sweeping
changes in working practices.
So far 3,000 workers at the company's sites at Grangemouth, Huddersfield and
Yalding in Kent have received 6 per cent wage increases as a result of
workplace reforms that involve greater worker flexibility and
'multi-skilling'.
They will receive two further rises of 4 per cent each on the first and
second anniversaries of the deals.
Shift and other allowances as well as call-out payments are also being
increased by 6 per cent under the local deals.
As a result, the annual salaries of ICI manual workers will now range from
between Pounds 10,734 and Pounds 16,011.
The company said it expected the rest of its manual workforce to agree
workplace changes at local level over the next few months. All will receive
the same pay increases as a result.
The 6 per cent rises are in addition to 5.1 per cent which ICI manual
workers received last June through the company's normal annual pay
negotiations and 3.5 per cent awarded in the following month from the
company's employee profit scheme.
ICI says the local pay deals derive from a 1991 agreement signed with the
five unions recognised by the company, which radically reformed work
organisation across the company's 13 plants. It has taken more than 18
months of intensive local negotiation for the workplace changes to be
agreed.
The ICI deal looks much more generous to the workforce than similar
agreements reached more recently in industry.
Last year's Japanese-style working practices package accepted by the Rover
Group, for example, awarded no extra pay but improved job security and
introduced common conditions for all workers.

FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Debenham Tewson in Pounds 11m merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEBENHAM TEWSON &amp; Chinnocks, the quoted property adviser, yesterday
announced a merger with Bernard Thorpe, a firm of chartered surveyors, in a
deal worth Pounds 10.9m.
It also announced a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 727,000 to Pounds
936,000 for the six months to the end of October. Its share price rose 6p to
71p.
This deal is the latest of a series of mergers within the chartered
surveying industry in the past year, as the severe downturn in the property
industry has forced firms to cut costs and seek stronger partners.
DTC said the purpose of the deal was to expand its regional network.
The merger will result in cost savings of about Pounds 2m a year, as a
result of reductions in staff numbers and accomodation costs.
The combined group would have had a turnover of Pounds 55m in the last
financial year. In the year ended April 1992, Bernard Thorpe incurred a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 274,000 and had net assets of Pounds 1.8m.
Mr Richard Lay, chairman of DTC will be the chairman of the merged group,
which will be called DTZ Debenham Thorpe. Mr David Buck, the chief executive
of Bernard Thorpe will become vice-chairman. Mr Anthony Turnbull, DTC's
chief executive will become chief executive of the enlarged group.
Debenham will issue 9.79m new shares, representing 23.6 per cent of the
enlarged share capital, and up to a further 750,000 new shares on June 1
1994. Bernard Thorpe's partners have agreed not to dispose of the shares
before April 1996.
Mr Lay said that DTC expected a 'a satisfactory outcome' for the full year,
with a significant contribution from Bernard Thorpe in the second half. In
the year to October 1992, DTC's turnover rose from Pounds 16.6m to Pounds
17.53m. Earnings per share rose from 1.22p to 1.81p. An interim dividend of
1.2p (1p) was declared.

FT  30 JAN 93 / International Company News: Nippon Steel expands electronics
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIPPON STEEL, the leading Japanese steel maker, is to expand its electronics
business by paying about Y35.5bn (Dollars 286m) for a majority stake in the
lossmaking NMB Semiconductor (NMBS), which has run out of investment funds.
The ailing NMBS is a subsidiary of Minebea, the Japanese bearings maker,
which has agreed to sell its 56 per cent stake for Y5.5bn, while Nippon
Steel will also take on Y30bn of the chip maker's outstanding debt.
NMBS was founded by Minebea in 1984, but has been unable to keep pace in the
increasingly expensive semiconductor race.
For Nippon Steel, the acquisition, due to be completed by the end of March,
provides an opportunity to expand its electronics business, but the purchase
will expose the company to the cut-throat competition of the international
chip market.
The past two years have been particularly difficult for NMBS, which reported
a loss of Y12.4bn in the year ended September, leaving the company without
the resources to take advantage of a recent upturn in sales for its main
product, memory chips.
Minebea has also been burdened by NMBS, having reported a consolidated loss
of Y13.6bn last year. Mr Iwao Ishizuka, Minebea's chairman, said the sale
would allow his company to concentrate on its core business, as NMBS has
been losing at least Y1bn a month.
However, his company will be forced to write-off Y44bn in outstanding loans
to NMBS, and now expects a net loss of about Y50bn in the first half, ending
in March, compared with a previously forecast profit of Y1.8bn.
When the acquisition is complete, NMBS will be renamed Nippon Steel
Semiconductor, and the steel maker expects that turning the company around
will take about three years.
Mr Takashi Imai, Nippon Steel vice-president, said agreement had been
reached after a month of negotiation, and that the change of ownership would
not affect an existing NMBS partnership with Intel, the US electronics
company.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pep fee waived
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE END OF the tax year often leads to special offers from financial groups.
Scottish Equitable* is offering to waive its fixed administration fee
(Pounds 45 plus VAT) for those who buy its Premium personal equity plan
between February 1 and April 30.
The Premium Pep is linked to six unit trusts. There is no initial charge on
these, which means investors buy units at the 'creation' price, which is
well below the offer price. There is still a bid-offer spread of around 1
per cent, but this reflects Scottish Equitable's costs in buying and selling
the shares the trusts own.
Scottish Equitable does, however, impose an annual Pep charge of 0.875 per
cent (plus VAT) on top of the normal yearly unit trust management charge of
1 per cent or so. And those who want to sell their Pep holdings will face
exit charges within the first five years.
Martin Currie, the Edinburgh-based fund management group, is also offering a
2 per cent discount on Pep investments into its range of nine unit trusts
for those who apply by March 26.
*On p19 of the Quarterly Review, published today, I attribute this plan
incorrectly to Scottish Amicable. My apologies for this error.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Reinvestment warning on trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN REECE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KLEINWORT Benson and Fleming have written to shareholders in two investment
trusts warning that they stand to lose everything if they continue to
re-invest dividends from the trusts' high-income ordinary shares.
Nearly 3,000 ordinary shareholders in the Kleinwort High Income trust and
250 in the Fleming International High Income trust were sent letters before
Christmas.
Kleinwort Benson said the practice of re-investing dividends from
high-income ordinary shares would bear fruit only in a rapidly rising
market, because the ordinary shares were paid out after the trust's zero
dividend preference shares.
In a weak stock market, the high-income shareholders may not receive their
capital back, a danger compounded if investors re-invest their dividends.
Ben Siddons, director of Kleinwort Benson Investment Management, said
investors were offered alternatives to the Kleinwort High Income trust if
they wanted to continue to re-invest dividends.
Siddons added: 'The last thing we want is this black hole when trusts are
wound up with people finding they haven't achieved the hurdle rates
necessary and all the money goes to zero dividend preference shareholders.
It could damage the reputation of the industry and the integrity of the
product.'
Fleming said that if the stock market produced consistently high returns,
then reinvesting dividends for total return could pay off. But it was only
fair to warn investors about the potential risk of ending up with a zero
return when the trust was wound up.
The cases highlight the dangers of investing in split capital investment
trusts if investors fail to understand the nature of the shares they choose
and the assets which back them.
The Association of Investment Trust Companies (AITC) will try to persuade
investment managers of member companies to adopt a new code of practice when
launching split capital trusts, entailing more disclosure of the potential
risks.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS

<TEXT>
Colin Webster
commercial director National Power
'It is for government to decide by how much there should be a larger market
for British coal over and above the tonnages which have been involved in
discussions between the coal producers, the generators and the regional
electricity companies. We are both willing and able to use larger amounts of
UK-produced coal provided a market can be found for the electricity
generated from it and fair mechanisms can be agreed to meet the additional
costs.'
Generators' monopoly power is criticised in the report which calls for
tougher price controls
Neil Clarke
chairman British Coal
'The report supports our consistently stated view that only a radical
transformation of the market would change the prospects of many of our
collieries. I am pleased that this report points the way to a more stable
and secure future for our miners. It is a cool and rational assessment of
the benefit of maintaining a substantial indigenous coal mining business for
years to come.'
British Coal would get up to Pounds 500m in subsidies over five years to
become competitive with world prices
John Collier
chairman Nuclear Electric
'The recommendations open the way for a secure future for coal and nuclear
power in the UK. In particular the committee has taken full account of our
argument that there should be no sense in closing our nuclear stations early
to make room for coal. . . it's far cheaper to run our stations than to
close them. I'm happy with the suggestion that the fossil fuel levy and the
company's inherited liabilities should both be taken away from Nuclear
Electric.'
Nuclear Electric would lose some of its levy revenue, but also some clean-up
liabilities
John Harris
chairman East Midlands Electricity
'I disagree with the suggestion that franchise on the provision of
electricity supply should be extended from 1994 to 1998. This will increase
electricity prices. But I go along with the general thrust of the report
which is that there should be government subsidy to keep pits open. . . The
miners will have to ensure that in the next few years their pits will become
more competitive. However I would want to see that the subsidy is not
open-ended.'
Regional suppliers would have to buy electricity generated from UK coal or
risk losing licence
Tony Craven Walker
chief executive Monument Oil &amp; Gas
'In identifying the need to provide for non-domestic quality gas, the
committee has recognised the requirement to utilise Britain's energy
reserves to maximum efficiency. I welcome the recognition of the project to
develop four oil and gas fields in Liverpool Bay, north Wales, which has
been suspended pending the outcome of the energy review.'
Independent gas projects have been accused of stealing coal's market
Arthur Scargill
president NUM
'The report is unacceptable to the NUM and to mining communities. In spite
of overwhelming evidence, the committee has refused to address the problem
of the rigged market which led to the unlawful and irrational closure
decisions. We find it incredible and inexplicable. . . that the committee
has refused to recommend the phasing out of expensive nuclear power. . . and
has not recommended stopping the 'dash for gas'.'
Unions may win reprieve for thousands of jobs, but may lose out on
cost-cutting
Eamonn Butler
director Adam Smith Institute
'Any subsidy to coal will cost jobs elsewhere in the oil and gas industries.
It will also cost jobs among ordinary taxpayers. Businesses who are finding
it difficult at the moment will face higher tax bills and employ less people
for less time as a result.'
Committee claims the measures are ultimately aimed at fostering a better
energy market
Lord Melchett
executive director Greenpeace
'The committee appears will to have neglected the environment in favour of a
quick fix designed to address political expediencies. Instead of subsidising
just one declining and polluting industry, the nuclear industry, it is
proposing to prop up another, the coal industry, without addressing the
long-term future environmental and economic results of such a decision.'
Environmentalists may have to face the fact that while many measures would
promote clean-coal technology more coal would be burned

FT  30 JAN 93 / International Company News: Sanyo Electric falls to loss of
Y1.29bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SANYO Electric, the Japanese consumer electronics group, will press ahead
with a sweeping restructuring in an attempt to improve profitability after
reporting a net loss of Y1.29bn (Dollars 10.38m) for the year to the end of
last November.
Sanyo said it would introduce a decentralised management system focused on
distinct profit centres, from manufacturing to customer services. The
company added it would restructure its ailing audio visual products and
office automation businesses to cut costs and improve profitability.
The restructuring, which has included a shake-up of senior management, marks
a sharp shift in strategy.
In the late 1980s, Sanyo - in common with the rest of the Japanese
electronics industry - focused on expanding market share and sales volumes
through the rapid introduction of a widening array of products. But Japanese
companies are under increasing pressure to cut costs in order to improve
profitability after three successive years of falling profits.
Sanyo Electric's sales fell by 3.2 per cent to Y1,537bn, largely due to the
slowdown in Japan combined with falling exports to Europe and sluggish
growth in the US.
Operating income fell by 76.8 per cent to Y11.5bn, while pre-tax profits
were 98.6 per cent down at Y562m.
Canon, the camera and copier maker, yesterday announced a senior management
reshuffle, with the promotion of Mr Hajime Mitarai, the managing director,
to the company's presidency. He will succeed Mr Keizo Yamaji, who will
become chairman.

FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Penalty of playing for high stakes -
Lasmo's problems and poor share price performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE JOKE going around the oil sector runs as follows: what do you get if you
merge a Pounds 1bn company with a Pounds 1bn company? Answer: Lasmo, a
Pounds 1bn company.
Lasmo's 1991 takeover of rival Ultramar for Pounds 1.1bn made it one of the
largest UK independent oil and gas explorers, doubled its proven and
provable reserves and doubled production.
However, with debt and other problems mounting from the takeover, and the
depressed oil price, Lasmo has been one of the poorest performing FT-SE 100
shares. Despite a 10p rise to 165p yesterday, the shares have lost half
their value since the bid was launched, and Lasmo is still a Pounds 1bn
company.
On Thursday, the man largely responsible for Lasmo's rise took the blame for
its share price decline. Mr Chris Greentree, chief executive since 1982, was
replaced by his chief operating officer, Mr Joe Darby. The change seemed
designed to silence stock market criticism, and prepare for a cut in
dividends when Lasmo announces results in March.
Mr Greentree, a big Canadian, was a leading figure in the independent oil
industry and a dominant character within Lasmo. His mistake was to gamble
Lasmo's short-term cash position on the longer-term benefits of buying
Ultramar. Lasmo was generally thought to have bought the company cheaply.
But subsequent sales of Ultramar's downstream assets achieved disappointing
prices, suggesting asset values had already started to fall by the time of
the takeover.
Lasmo was left with high borrowings and rising capital expenditure. Despite
Dollars 1.53bn (Pounds 1bn) of disposals last year, net borrowings are
estimated to have hardly changed at over Pounds 1bn, with gearing above 90
per cent.
With oil prices depressed after the Gulf war, earnings have come under
pressure. According to NatWest Securities, net income is forecast to rise
from Pounds 17.9m to Pounds 29m for the year to end-September, including a
full contribution from Ultramar. But on a per share basis to reflect the
dilution effects of the takeover, cash flow and earnings will have both
fallen. With earnings of 3.1p expected, analysts point out that last year's
dividend of 8.5p will have to be cut more than half to be covered.
Mr Darby is spending the weekend reviewing Lasmo's strategy but is not
expected to introduce radical changes. A cautious man, who is described as
'quietish' by colleagues, he likes compiling lists of priorities and manages
methodically.
At the top of the stock market's list is for a decision on the dividend.
This will not happen until Lasmo releases results in March and will partly
depend on the sterling oil price.
Analysts agree, in the longer term, that Lasmo has great potential and holds
some excellent assets - especially in the North Sea and an Indonesian joint
venture inherited with Ultramar. But in the short term, they argue that
maintaining the dividend when borrowings are so high risks undermining the
business.
Hoare Govett, which said the shares were overvalued until the dividend
uncertainty was removed, argued that passing the final payment would save
about Pounds 60m. That would give Lasmo greater scope on disposals and not
force it into a fire sale of assets at undervalued prices. 'With operating
results deteriorating and with asset sales necessary to keep the balance
sheet under control, we believe Lasmo would be financially imprudent to pay
a held and uncovered dividend,' Hoare Govett said in a circular issued the
day before Mr Greentree's departure.
Institutional shareholders, however, may want Lasmo to focus on cash flow
rather than earnings cover when assessing the dividend, in line with US
practise. On this basis, a maintained dividend would be about 4 times
covered, well below rival Enterprise, but still sustainable.
Where both camps agree is that the ongoing programme of disposals and
rationalisation following the Ultramar bid must continue to bring down
borrowings and strengthen the balance sheet.
Most of Ultramar's downstream assets due for disposal have now been sold.
But Lasmo could raise a further Dollars 350m this year through disposals of
upstream assets. The sale of minority holdings in the North Sea could raise
Pounds 100m, according to analysts, although there would be concern if the
important Markham field was sold, as has been rumoured.
Partly because of the low oil price, and partly because of its own problems,
Lasmo had already indicated cuts in capital expenditure and development
spending from this year. Last month Mr Greentree said capital expenditure
would fall 15 per cent to Pounds 90m while development spending would fall
by nearly Pounds 100m to Pounds 240m.
Assuming these programmes continue, some observers argue Lasmo could recover
quickly, helped by rising production from Ultramar assets and reduced
gearing. 'The good news for Mr Darby,' according to Mr Simon Flowers at
NatWest, 'is that much of what he should do is already in train.'
The bad news for Mr Darby and his fellow directors is that the tricky
dividend decision remains at the top of their list.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Making the leap out of the lap of luxury: Under Helmut
Werner, its next boss, Mercedes-Benz is expanding its product range
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first glance Helmut Werner does not look like a revolutionary.
The urbane 56-year-old has worked himself up German industry's corporate
ladder with apparent ease, but little in his career has suggested that he
would be the man appointed to break the mould at Mercedes-Benz, one of the
world's most prestigious luxury car makers.
This week, however, Werner announced that Mercedes-Benz had decided to
embark 'on a very extensive realignment of its strategic product policy'.
The company would transform itself from 'a car manufacturer with a long
tradition in the luxury class' into 'an exclusive full-line manufacturer
offering high-quality vehicles in all segments of the market', said Werner.
Before the end of the decade there would be a Mercedes-Benz people carrier,
or multi-purpose vehicle a la Renault Espace or the Toyota Previa. There
would be a modern four-wheel-drive leisure utility vehicle for off-road
driving. And there would be a small Mercedes-Benz city car for urban
commuting. These would be in addition to the present three ranges of luxury
and executive cars.
Almost in passing Werner uttered what for a previous holder of his office
would have been heresy: Mercedes-Benz's present luxury cars were
'over-engineered' and, if the company persisted with its policy for
developing new models, it would be 'priced out' of world markets.
He made it clear that the only way Mercedes-Benz could maintain its
engineering and quality leadership was if it could also achieve leadership
on cost.
Gone are the days, apparently, when the charging of premium prices could
cover up for costs that were too high. 'No one in the world is prepared to
pay for German complacency on the cost front,' said Werner, in a message
guaranteed to chill the company's overmanned workforce.
Werner does not officially take over as chief executive of Mercedes-Benz,
the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial
corporation, until late May, but he hit the road running this week.
He needs to, in order to meet the challenges the company faces in the 1990s.
After more than a century during which its three-pointed star has been one
of the world's ultimate status symbols, Mercedes-Benz has been shaken by the
arrival in force of the Japanese car makers in the world luxury car mar-ket.
From a standing start in late 1989, Toyota, Japan's leading volume car
producer, has established a luxury car franchise in the US under the brand
name Lexus. Last year it sold 92,890 cars in the US, against 63,312 sold by
Mercedes-Benz.
The German group has also been stung into action by the strength of the
negative reaction to its new S-Class range of luxury saloons, launched with
much pomp two years ago in Geneva. The company had laboured for five and a
half years to develop a successor for its previous 11-year-old S-Class but,
by the time it arrived in the marketplace, its bulk made it appear out of
tune with an era that was already forsaking conspicuous consumption for
other values.
Another raw nerve was touched in Stuttgart, with the publication of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Dollars 5m, five-year study on the
future of the automobile, entitled The Machine That Changed The World. The
report exposed the gap in efficiency, costs and quality between the
so-called 'lean' car producers, chiefly although not exclusively the
Japanese, and the outdated mass producers, mainly the European and American
producers.
The MIT team had visited a Mercedes-Benz plant in Germany. 'At the end of
the assembly line was an enormous rework and rectification area, where
armies of technicians in white laboratory jackets laboured to bring the
finished vehicles up to the company's fabled quality standard.'
The team found that 'a third of the total effort involved in assembly
occurred in this area. In other words, the German plant was expending more
effort to fix the problems it had created than the Japanese plant required
to make a nearly perfect car the first time'.
Werner's cultural revolution is now set to address such shortcomings.
The first signals that significant reforms were planned had emerged over the
past year, as Mercedes-Benz had shaken up its top management team. Helmut
Werner himself is the replacement for Werner Niefer, the 64-year-old
Mercedes-Benz chairman.
Niefer, the pugnacious former Mercedes-Benz apprentice with an often
incomprehensible Swabian accent, had worked himself up from the shopfloor to
the top of the company. Werner, on the other hand, has the easy flair of an
international manager.
The executive was courted by Volkswagen while he was deputy chairman at
Continental, the German tyre maker. He chose instead to move to
Mercedes-Benz at Stuttgart, where he was immediately seen as one of the
heirs apparent.
Around him Werner is quickly gathering a new generation of managers who mark
a decisive break with the past. They include Dieter Zetsche, the 39-year-old
director for car research and development. Balding, with a walrus moustache
and a liking for brightly coloured ties, Zetsche has replaced the reserved
and conservative Wolfgang Peter, the creator of the S-Class, who left the
company last year.
However, Werner's brave new world will not be won without pain and
dislocation. He accepts that Mercedes-Benz still lags way behind its rivals
in costs and productivity.
Fixed costs are 'still appreciably too high', layers of management are to be
removed, there will be a 'rigorous pruning' of white-collar central staff.
The life-cycles of Mercedes products have to be reduced to about eight years
from 11 years, while the development time for new products has to be cut
from up to 57 months to less than 44. And the break-even volume for a
vehicle line must be reduced to 60,000 a year.
Now that he has unleashed his revolution, Werner must show that he can ride
it.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Russia to build new gas pipes for German market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GAZPROM, Russia's state gas production company, is building two new gas
pipelines to Germany in an effort to avoid disruption of gas supplies
running through Ukraine, Mr Rem Vyakhirev, the company's chairman, said.
There was an outcry in Germany in October when the pressure in the gas
pipeline, which supplies 31 per cent of German demand, dropped for days as
supplies through Ukraine were disrupted.
Mr Vyakhirev said the interruption in supplies in October was caused by a
technical problem that could 'easily be corrected'.
'Of course, consumers must be guaranteed a stable supply of gas, but we have
taken a lot of steps to avoid any repetition of the disruption.'
The pipeline is due to be finished within two to three years.
However, it is widely believed that the gas supply problem in October was
caused by Ukraine stealing gas from the export pipeline after its own
supplies were interrupted.
German diplomats are believed to have stressed the seriousness of the
situation to the governments of Ukraine and Russia.
Mr Vyakhirev said gas flowing through the existing pipeline had a time lag
of five to seven days, so it could take a week to sort out any problems. The
new pipelines will have a three-day time lag so disruptions could be
corrected much quickly, he said. He would not disclose the cost of the
pipelines, but it is believed to represent an investment of Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 600m).
Construction of the new pipelines has already begun in Russia with
completion of the first pipeline to Germany due in 1997. The company is
expected to run one line through the Baltic states and Poland, entering
Germany at Frankfurt an der Oder.
Mr Vyakhirev said a final decision on the pipelines' routes will be taken
later this year.
Gazprom is expecting to sell around 8bn cubic metres a year to Poland en
route, which will leave an additional 32bn cubic metres a year for Germany.
Mr Vyakhirev would not disclose the cost of the lines.
Gazprom has agreed a Dollars 50m contract with Compressor Controls, the US
gas supplies company, for the supply of control equipment that will improve
the efficiency of the company's pipelines and gas processing stations.
The contract runs over seven years and the company estimates it will save
10bn to 15bn cubic metres of gas a year that would have been lost by
inefficient processing.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Fixed-rate Tessas - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO building societies are offering fixed-rate Tessas. Britannia's new Tessa
guarantees 8 per cent gross. However, Pounds 8,300 is required in a feeder
account, which also pays a fixed but taxable 8 per cent gross. The maximum
will be transferred into the Tessa each year. Britannia will not allow
transfers into the fixed-rate Tessa from existing Tessa-holders.
National &amp; Provincial building society's guaranteed Tessa will pay 7.5 per
cent gross but allows a minimum investment of Pounds 100. Those who can
afford Pounds 8,400 up front can put this in a feeder account, also fixed at
7.5 per cent gross for annual transfers.
Abbey National has replaced its Tessa with a second edition, paying tiered
rates of interest. If your total capital was for the maximum - Pounds 6,600
 -you will see no difference in the 7.5 per cent being paid on this tier.
Those with with balances of up to Pounds 3,000 will only get 7.1 per cent.
Interest on Pounds 3,000-Pounds 4,799 is 7.3 per cent and from Pounds
4,800-Pounds 6,599, 7.4 per cent. The first edition has been withdrawn but
existing Abbey Tessa-holders do not have to switch.

STANDARD LIFE, the UK's biggest supplier of endowments, has announced cuts
in the bonuses it pays on with-profits contracts. The changes mean that
Standard loses its position at the top of the 25-year pay-out league tables
to GA Life, but it remains near the top of the table.
Both reversionary bonuses, which are awarded each year and once announced
cannot be taken away, and terminal bonuses, awarded only when the contract
matures, have been cut. Reversionary bonuses have been reduced to reflect
the company's prediction of lower investment returns in future, while the
cut in terminal bonus follows a below-average return in 1992.
Using the standard industry assumptions that policies were started by a 29
years-old man paying Pounds 30 per month in premiums, 10-year pay-outs have
been reduced 10.8 per cent from Pounds 7,672 to Pounds 6,839. This is one of
the steepest cuts announced so far, while the highest pay-outs came from two
much smaller offices - Pounds 7,705 from Royal National Pension Fund for
Nurses and Pounds 7,291 from Tunbridge Wells Equitable.
The 25-year pay-out drops by four per cent to Pounds 63,394 from Pounds
66,087. The top pay-out so far is GA Life's Pounds 65,464.
*****
New unit trust launches continue, in spite of the widespread opinion that
there are already too many trusts available. NM Financial Management is
launching four new 'funds of funds' next week. They are meant as the
centrepiece of the company's revamped unit trust 'managed portfolio
service'.
NM is making the move to lessen capital gains tax problems for its clients -
CGT is not payable within a unit trust, including a fund of funds, so
investors are only liable for CGT on the unit trust as a whole. Portfolios
for growth and for growth and income are on offer, in both cases with a
choice between a fund investing only in NM unit trusts and a fund investing
in trusts from other management groups.
For the NM-only funds, initial charges are 5.75 per cent, with an annual
management fee of 0.75 per cent and a Pounds 10,000 minimum investment. For
the open funds, the management charge is increased to 1.25 per cent, and
minimum investment is Pounds 20,000. NM is offering flexible regular
withdrawals and regular investment updates in a file provided by the company
to encourage private clients.
It is hoping to use the funds to encourage savers away from falling returns
in building society accounts.
*****
Save &amp; Prosper has launched a second issue of its guaranteed stockmarket
bond. This offers 98 per cent of the rise in the FT-SE 100 index over the
next five years (99 per cent for those who invest before March 5), or your
money back. As a measure against a last-minute fall in the index, the final
payout will be based on the average level of the Footsie in the six months
before encashment. There is an extra facility which allows you to lock in
every 10 per cent rise in the FT-SE; the cost is that you only receive 90
per cent of the index's rise (so if the market goes up 10 per cent, you get
nine per cent).
Like many others of these bonds, it does not take account of the dividend
yield in the index; there is no guarantee if you withdraw within five years;
and, while returns are net of basic rate tax, higher-rate taxpayers will
probably face an extra charge. The minimum investment is Pounds 2,500.
Meanwhile, Bristol &amp; West has launched an international guaranteed equity
bond. This offers the rise in the FT-SE 100 index over five years, or your
money back. It also offers to lock in the gain if Footsie rises by either 25
or 50 per cent. Returns are paid gross but are taxable; so basic-rate payers
will only be receiving 75 per cent of Footsie's rise, and top-rate payers 60
per cent. Thus the product is best suited to non-taxpayers.
Funds cannot be withdrawn (except on death) during the five-year period and
receive no benefit from the Footsie's yield. The minimum investment is
Pounds 5,000.
The FT-SE 100 index rose 66.2 per cent over the five years to January

FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pep fee waived
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE END OF the tax year often leads to special offers from financial groups.
Scottish Equitable* is offering to waive its fixed administration fee
(Pounds 45 plus VAT) for those who buy its Premium personal equity plan
between February 1 and April 30.
The Premium Pep is linked to six unit trusts. There is no initial charge on
these, which means investors buy units at the 'creation' price, which is
well below the offer price. There is still a bid-offer spread of around 1
per cent, but this reflects Scottish Equitable's costs in buying and selling
the shares the trusts own.
Scottish Equitable does, however, impose an annual Pep charge of 0.875 per
cent (plus VAT) on top of the normal yearly unit trust management charge of
1 per cent or so. And those who want to sell their Pep holdings will face
exit charges within the first five years.
Martin Currie, the Edinburgh-based fund management group, is also offering a
2 per cent discount on Pep investments into its range of nine unit trusts
for those who apply by March 26.
*On p19 of the Quarterly Review, published today, I attribute this plan
incorrectly to Scottish Amicable. My apologies for this error.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Grand restaurant with a past - Giles MacDonogh
traces the eventful history of Horchers, now in Madrid but once of Berlin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO THE unsuspecting diner, Horchers could be just about any grand Madrid
restaurant.
Closer examination, however, might give some indication of its long and
eventful past: the Meissen figurine on the table representing a Prussian
dragoon from Frederick the Great's time; some German prints on the walls;
and, better still, the menu with its smattering of dishes of Germanic
origin. There is lots of game, but game is game. What about matjes herrings
in cream with apples? Or wiener schnitzel? Or baumkuchen?
Horchers' story begins in 1905, not in Madrid but in the west end of Berlin.
The original premises were at 21 Luther (now Martin Luther) Strasse. At
first, Gustav Horcher's wine restaurant was overshadowed by the great hotels
and Borchardt in the Franzosische Strasse.
It was not until 1923 that it made its first appearance in the
English-language edition of Baedecker's famous guide. It failed to merit a
star.
All this had changed, though, by the time the next German edition appeared
in 1936. 'Belongs to the top category,' enthused Baedecker. 'Excellent.' And
a star was awarded.
Horchers also had a protector. Indeed, from the first years of the movement
in Berlin, Horchers might be said to have marched in step with the Nazi
party.
Four frustrating years after the failure of the Munich putsch in 1923,
Hermann Goering arrived in Berlin at the end of 1927. Money was short until
the former air ace was elected to the Reichstag in the spring of the
following year. When Hitler agreed to his candidature, it was to Horchers
that Goering went to celebrate.
By July 1934, Goering was already Prussian minister president and the second
most powerful man in Germany. That month, he held a second, and far more
sinister, celebration in the restaurant in the Luther Strasse.
It was there that he threw a dinner to thank his managers for their help in
the bloody Night of the Long Knives when a 100 or so political opponents
were butchered. Crab was the order of the day.
Goering's continued protection must have been valued highly by Gustav
Horcher and his son, Otto. Once the war had started, the Luftwaffe chief had
Horchers' staff exempted from military service and tripled the petrol
allowance for restaurant vehicles.
When Otto Horcher discovered a hoard of 70,000 bottles of port, Goering
ensured that the bulk of the wine was acquired for the Luftwaffe - but only
after creaming off 10,000 bottles for Horchers and a few cases for himself.
Horchers' rise under the Nazis was to have a European dimension, and one
which became linked closely to the subjugation of mainland Europe by the
soldiers of the Wehrmacht. As journalist Hans Georg von Studnitz wrote in
the autumn of 1943: 'As the favourite chef of Hermann Goering, Horcher has
risen to become the foremost restaurateur of the Third Reich . . .'
With Germany occupying half of Europe, Horcher's sphere of activity
broadened. He took over Die Drei Husaren in Vienna from Count Paly Palffy.
Then he moved to Maxim's in Paris and opened branches in Oslo and Belgrade.
Before the second world war, he held the concession for the German
restaurant in London's Mayfair.
The intimate, leather-hung restaurant in the Luther Strasse received its
share of famous guests. In 1937, Nazi chiefs Heinrich Himmler and Joachim
von Ribbentrop entertained the Duke of Windsor there. It was a regular
favourite of the chief of German military intelligence, Admiral Wilhelm
Canaris. But Horchers was never Nazi. Most of the anti-Nazi frondeurs ate
there and the Gestapo was not welcome. An English journalist, Ian Colvin,
who had known Horchers well from his days as a Berlin correspondent before
the war, noted: 'Horcher's food was excellent, brought in from Denmark, and
his French wines were bought with occupation francs at controlled prices.'
But as the danger from bombing became more acute, the Luther Strasse
premises were 'abandoned for a safer villa in Wannsee suburb standing among
trees on a sand ridge above the lake'.
The Nazi defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943 dealt a lethal blow to the
few remaining grand restaurants in Berlin. At Horchers, though, the manager
tried to make up for the occasional gap in the menu with his old-world
charm. This did not work on Josef Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda supremo, who
mentioned Horchers specifically when he announced new austerity measures to
accompany 'total war'.
Goering was not amused by the order to close a restaurant which had been
supplying him with food for years. In a 45-minute telephone conversation, he
told the gauleiter of Berlin: 'If you close Horchers today, I shall open it
tomorrow as a Luftwaffe club]'
Goebbels responded by staging a 'spontaneous demonstration' in which one of
the restaurant's big windows was smashed. When Goebbels' men returned the
next day, they found it guarded by Luftwaffe sentries.
With Goering's help, Horchers limped on in Berlin for a few more months. But
after the massive Allied raid on the city on November 23 1943, Otto Horcher
must have seen that there was little point in hanging on. Diners who turned
up at Horchers in January 1944 found it shut.
By that time, however, the restaurant had opened its doors in Madrid - on
November 11 1943. Gustav Horcher died three years later but Otto lived until
1977. The restaurant is now owned by another Gustav, Otto's son, who was
only three when he left Germany.
Horchers was one of several German restaurants in the Spanish capital, but
it was always the best. And visitors to Madrid after the war remember seeing
the SS daredevil Otto Skorzeny, holding court there. At that time, he
boasted he was in charge of the Odessa operation which helped SS men escape
the justice of the courts.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Reinvestment warning on trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN REECE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KLEINWORT Benson and Fleming have written to shareholders in two investment
trusts warning that they stand to lose everything if they continue to
re-invest dividends from the trusts' high-income ordinary shares.
Nearly 3,000 ordinary shareholders in the Kleinwort High Income trust and
250 in the Fleming International High Income trust were sent letters before
Christmas.
Kleinwort Benson said the practice of re-investing dividends from
high-income ordinary shares would bear fruit only in a rapidly rising
market, because the ordinary shares were paid out after the trust's zero
dividend preference shares.
In a weak stock market, the high-income shareholders may not receive their
capital back, a danger compounded if investors re-invest their dividends.
Ben Siddons, director of Kleinwort Benson Investment Management, said
investors were offered alternatives to the Kleinwort High Income trust if
they wanted to continue to re-invest dividends.
Siddons added: 'The last thing we want is this black hole when trusts are
wound up with people finding they haven't achieved the hurdle rates
necessary and all the money goes to zero dividend preference shareholders.
It could damage the reputation of the industry and the integrity of the
product.'
Fleming said that if the stock market produced consistently high returns,
then reinvesting dividends for total return could pay off. But it was only
fair to warn investors about the potential risk of ending up with a zero
return when the trust was wound up.
The cases highlight the dangers of investing in split capital investment
trusts if investors fail to understand the nature of the shares they choose
and the assets which back them.
The Association of Investment Trust Companies (AITC) will try to persuade
investment managers of member companies to adopt a new code of practice when
launching split capital trusts, entailing more disclosure of the potential
risks.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Row over T-shirt design set for High Court hearing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE rows over copyright in the fashion industry are common, disputes are
usually settled out of court. But changes to the legal aid system may make
it harder for small designers to fight their corner in the manner of Antoni
&amp; Alison, the London fashion house.
Antoni &amp; Alison was supported by legal aid at a preliminary hearing this
week in the High Court. It is claiming copyright infringement over a T-shirt
produced by Giorgio Armani, the Italian fashion house.
Armani has withdrawn the disputed design in the UK and ceased using it in
advertising, but Antoni &amp; Alison is seeking a High Court ruling to prevent
it being sold or used overseas. The High Court agreed to hear Antoni &amp;
Alison's allegation that Armani has infringed its copyright. The case will
probably be heard in September.
Lawyers estimate that the case will cost each side about Pounds 50,000.
Armani's global annual turnover is thought to exceed Pounds 300m while
Antoni &amp; Alison's sales were less than Pounds 250,000 last year.
Armani has declined to comment on any aspect of the case.
Mr Achilleas Constantinou, head of the Fashion Designers Protection
Association, says he sees about 100 cases of alleged copyright infringement
every year. However, he says 99.9 per cent of cases are settled out of court
'because in a genuine case of copyright infringement one side is lying. What
happens is that the bigger party often uses expensive legal muscle to
frighten the potential plaintiff into dropping the action.'
Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, has proposed that the level of disposable
income at which an applicant is entitled to free legal aid be reduced from
Pounds 3,060 per annum to Pounds 2,213 per annum from April. The Law
Society, the solicitors' governing body in England and Wales, says this
would remove 7m people from eligibility.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Chess in Britain is suffering from a decline in business
sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEONARD BARDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE Nigel Short (above left) will be on the brink of becoming Britain's
first chess millionaire today, the game in Britain is suffering from a big
decline in business sponsorship, Leonard Barden writes. Short needs only one
draw from his remaining two games against Jan Timman (right), the Dutch
master, to win the right to challenge world champion Gary Kasparov and share
a possible Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.6m) prize fund. Yet City institutions such
as Grieveson Grant, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, and Kleinwort Benson, the merchant
bank, have stopped sponsoring chess since their mergers into bigger groups.
There is still City sponsorship - from Lloyds Bank, Leigh Interests, and
Duncan Lawrie, the private bank - and from the East Sussex town of Hastings
which holds an annual tournament. But declining sponsorship has left
grandmasters and other leading players struggling for a living. Mr Peter
Wells, head of the British Chess Academy which represents young
professionals, says: 'There are too many players chasing too little money,
and in European opens we now have to contend with a huge influx of
ex-Soviets.'

FT  30 JAN 93 / Republicans get new chairman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LAWYER and lobbyist Mr Haley Barbour was yesterday elected Republican
national committee chairman as the outgoing party leader, Mr Rich Bond, went
out with a blast at party anti-abortion 'zealotry.'
Mr Barbour, 45, has a law office in Yazoo City, Mississippi and in
Washington where he is a lobbyist-consultant. He was political director in
the White House during the Ronald Reagan administration.
He was elected on the third ballot, getting 90 of the 165 votes needed among
the party leaders attending the meeting. Mr Barbour, who has served on the
national committee since 1984, beat four rivals.
It was the first contested election for Republican chairman since 1977, the
last time Democrats moved into the White House for a four-year stay.
In an outspoken farewell, Mr Bond said the anti-abortion stand that has
divided Republicans for years should be scuttled so the party attracts
people who believe in the woman's right to choose.

The Polish team will be led by Mr Krzysztof Krowacki, the new chief debt
negotiator who last week stunned western banks with an announcement that
servicing of a Dollars 1.1bn trade facility extended in 1983 would be cut to
20 per cent of the interest due this year.
The Vienna meeting will cover this loan as well as commercial debts worth
Dollars 8.3bn which have not been serviced since autumn 1989 and the Dollars
2.7bn-worth of interest on the loans which has gone unpaid since then.

FT  30 JAN 93 / International Company News: Kugelfischer to cut workforce
40%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FAG Kugelfischer, the large German ball-bearings manufacturer, yesterday
announced a major restructuring plan in the face of serious liquidity
difficulties and large losses.
The company is planning to cut its workforce by more than 40 per cent, from
31,000 to 18,000. It aims to do this by selling off non-core businesses with
turnover of DM800m (Dollars 506.3m) and by cutting 6,500 jobs from the
remaining businesses.
The company disclosed that it made a loss of DM330m last year on turnover of
DM3.6bn, down from DM3.9bn. It blamed 'the most intense and prolonged
worldwide economic downturn since the (second world) war,' exacerbated by
weakness in demand for investment goods, the collapse in demand from the
former Soviet Union, and the problems of the German car industry.
A special factor was the catastrophic acquisition of an east German
ball-bearing business from the Treuhand privatisation agency in late 1990.
Kugelfischer disclosed that Chemnitz-based DKFL Deutsche Kugellagerfabriken
lost DM142m in 1991 on turnover of DM113m, and last year made similar losses
on scarcely increased sales.
Kugelfischer is more than 100 years old and is still controlled by the
Schafer family. It came to the stock market in 1985, after which it pursued
an aggressive acquisitions programme. It now plans to reverse this strategy
and concentrate on the core roller-bearings, textile and extraction
technologies.
Mr Kajo Neukirchen, the former chief executive of Hoesch, is to be appointed
as supervisory board chairman to oversee the restructuring. He has been
acting as 'company doctor' for some months and has led negotiations with the
company's banking creditors, believed to be owed hundreds of millions of
D-Marks.
Mr Neukirchen said that banks had agreed to provide liquidity support. He
predicted the level of operating losses would be cut substantially by the
end of the current year and that the group would again be making an
operating profit.

manufacturer of cellular telephones, and McCaw Cellular, the biggest US
operator of a cellular telephone service. Both companies insist the phones
are safe.
The drop accelerated yesterday as Motorola's shares lost Dollars 4 7/8 to
close at Dollars 51, down 9 per cent on the day and 17 per cent on the week.
McCaw closed at Dollars 32 1/2 , down Dollars 3 3/8 for a loss of 9 per cent
on the day and 11 per cent on the week.
Whether the alleged health threats are real or not, the public anxiety
sweeping the US could slow the industry's remarkably rapid growth, which in
recent years has been averaging 30 to 40 per cent a year. There are now some
10m cellular customers in the US.
The scare began late last week on the popular television phone-in programme
Larry King Live.
Mr David Reynard, a resident of Florida, claimed on the programme that his
wife had been killed by her heavy use of a cellular phone.
He said a cancerous brain tumour had developed near the point where the
telephone's antenna would have been positioned when the instrument was used.
Mr Reynard is suing NEC, the Japanese electronics group which made the
telephone, and a subsidiary of GTE, the telecommunications group which
provided the local service.
Public anxiety was intensified by the coincidental fact that Mr Reynard's
announcement came just days after two leading US business chairmen, Mr
Michael Walsh of Tenneco and the late Mr Reginald Lewis of TLC Beatrice,
were revealed to have brain cancer. It was not clear, however, that either
man was a particularly heavy user of cellular telephones.
As health worries escalated this week, the cellular industry tried
strenuously, but with limited success, to dispel fears of the
electro-magnetic radio waves emitted by the phones.
Motorola insisted the safety of its phone was 'rooted in scientific fact',
and produced several papers on the effects of radio waves on human and
animal.
But critics were quick to point out that the evidence advanced by Motorola
included only one study - and that incomplete - of the effects on human
cells in the radio frequency spectrum specifically used for cellular
communications.
By the end of the week, the consensus on Wall Street was that while there is
no firm evidence that cellular phones cause brain cancer, nor has the
industry yet been able to produce conclusive evidence that they do not. In
the absence of that reassurance, public anxieties could persist for months.
This explains why Mr Thomas Wheeler, president of the Cellular
Communications Industry Association, announced yesterday afternoon that it
would fund research to 're-validate the findings of existing studies, which
have found that the radio waves from cellular phones are safe.' The
association asked the federal government to appoint a blue-ribbon panel to
review the methodology of this research.
' We cannot permit this revolution in productivity, personal convenience and
economic growth to be derailed by an unfounded scare, triggered by a
lawsuit,' he declared.
Nevertheless, phone dealers across the US yesterday reported orders which
had been stalled or cancelled because of the scare. Even hard-headed Wall
Street analysts were thinking twice about relying quite so heavily on this
symbol of yuppiedom.

FT  30 JAN 93 / International Company News: Japanese paper groups in Y630bn
merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OJI PAPER, Japan's biggest paper company, yesterday announced it was
combining with Kanzaki Paper, the fifth largest, in one of Japan's largest
industrial mergers. The merged group, linking the country's two most
profitable paper companies, will have a market capitalisation of about
Y630bn (Dollars 5.07bn).
The move follows the decision by Jujo Paper and Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp to merge
this April, creating Japan Paper Industries, the market leader.
Oji said its merger with Kanzaki would create the industry's second largest
group in terms of overall sales. However, the group would be the largest
paper manufacturer with an annual output of 3.5m tonnes. The combined
company would also be more profitable than Japan Paper Industries. Kanzaki
is the country's largest coated paper manufacturer, a high-margin product.
The terms of the merger are five Oji shares for six Kanzaki shares. On the
Tokyo stock exchange, Kanzaki was trading up Y11 at Y615 and Oji down Y4 at
Y871 before being suspended ahead of the official announcement.
The paper industry has been particularly exposed to the economic slump, as
it expanded capacity rapidly during the late 1980s, causing a severe glut
amid the current fall in demand.
Oji Paper said the industry faced the worst recession since the second world
war. Demand was flat during 1992 and could decline this year. Japanese paper
companies are struggling with high costs of wood and labour, and are also
facing increasing environmental costs.
The industry's plight has been exacerbated by increasing overseas pressure
for an open Japanese domestic market. Last April, the Japanese government
signed an agreement with the US to import more paper into its Dollars 27bn
domestic paper and paperboard market. US companies presently have only 1.7
per cent of the market.
'These mergers are a fantastic device for closing down excess capacity,
which is presently between 10 and 15 per cent above demand,' said Mr Thomas
Clephane, partner at Morgan Stanley in New York.
However, although the new company would rationalise some production
facilities, Oji said it would not cut any staff. The difficulty in
rationalisation through reducing personnel has made mergers among Japanese
companies slow in producing positive results.

FT  30 JAN 93 / International Company News: Tokyo banks close to accord on
loans group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING Japanese banks are close to agreement with the Ministry of Finance
and the Bank of Japan on a bail-out for Nippon Housing Loan, a housing
finance company with an estimated Y1,300bn (Dollars 10.46bn) in
non-performing loans.
Nippon Housing, founded by nine commercial banks in 1971, had been a leading
lender to new home buyers, but became more adventurous during the late
1980s, leaving it with a large exposure to troubled property developers.
The restructuring of Nippon Housing is made sensitive by its large
borrowings from farm-related institutions, which pumped money into Nippon
Housing as other commercial banks were increasingly reluctant to lend
because of its high-risk exposure to developers.
One Japanese banker said yesterday that nine banks - including Sanwa and
Sakura, which have the largest exposure among commercial banks - will lower
the interest rates on loans to Nippon Housing to 1.5 per cent or less.
Other institutions, including those linked to agricultural co-operatives,
are expected to cut their rates to around 3.25 per cent, the same as the
official discount rate (ODR).
In return, the commercial banks are expecting assistance from the Bank of
Japan, which is likely to channel funds to them, directly or indirectly, at
the ODR, enabling them to profit from the difference in market rates.
While the interest rates will be reduced sharply, the banks' exposures to
Nippon Housing Loan will not be counted in their non-performing loan
amounts, which only include loans on which there has been no repayment for
six months.
However, the rapidly rising amount of loans with reduced rates is becoming
as large a burden for the banks as their bad loans. These reductions have
been given to a range of corporate clients and affiliated institutions
weakened by falls in stock and property prices.
The final rescue package for Nippon Housing, likely to be decided next week,
will be a model for the restructuring of other housing loan companies, which
have similar problems.

FT  30 JAN 93 / International Company News: Charges drive Xerox to Dollars
1bn shortfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
XEROX yesterday announced strong fourth-quarter growth in its core document
processing business while also reporting a Dollars 1bn net loss for 1992
after taking previously announced special charges.
The company announced earlier this month that it was selling off its
troubled financial services operations and taking a fourth-quarter after-tax
charge of Dollars 778m to cover this.
Xerox reported a fourth-quarter loss after charges of Dollars 736m, or
Dollars 7.80 a share, compared with net income of Dollars 91m, or 73 cents a
share, in the same period of last year.
For the full year, the company reported a loss of Dollars 1.02bn, or Dollars
11.29 a share, after taking other charges, including a large non-cash charge
for an accounting change. In 1991 it had net income of Dollars 454m, or
Dollars 3.91 a share.
The company estimated that, excluding all its special charges, 1992 earnings
were Dollars 628m, or Dollars 5.65 a share, compared with Dollars 555m, or
Dollars 4.97 a share in 1991.
In the fourth quarter, earnings from the document processing business were
Dollars 226m, or Dollars 2.12 a share, compared with Dollars 188m, or
Dollars 1.76 a share, a year earlier.
Mr Paul Allaire, chairman, said that growth in document processing, achieved
in spite of a weak economy, had been due to strong customer acceptance of
Xerox's new digital products.
'Sales of the Xerox DocuTech Publishing series and our state-of-the-art
full-colour copiers have exceeded our expectations and sales of new
electronic laser printers are accelerating,' he said. The company's market
share had been increasing.
Document processing revenues rose 10 per cent in the fourth quarter to
Dollars 4.2bn, from Dollars 3.8bn, and for the full year were up 6 per cent
at Dollars 14.7bn. Excluding the effect of foreign currencies, revenues grew
7 per cent in the latest quarter and 5 per cent in the full year.
Revenue and income in the US grew at a faster pace in the fourth quarter
than in the first half of the year, but revenues and income from Japanese
and certain European operating companies remained adversely affected by weak
economic conditions.
Mr Allaire said the company expected to see further benefits from its new
range in 1993 as it continued to introduce new products.

FT  30 JAN 93 / International Company News: Nippon Steel expands electronics
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIPPON STEEL, the leading Japanese steel maker, is to expand its electronics
business by paying about Y35.5bn (Dollars 286m) for a majority stake in the
lossmaking NMB Semiconductor (NMBS), which has run out of investment funds.
The ailing NMBS is a subsidiary of Minebea, the Japanese bearings maker,
which has agreed to sell its 56 per cent stake for Y5.5bn, while Nippon
Steel will also take on Y30bn of the chip maker's outstanding debt.
NMBS was founded by Minebea in 1984, but has been unable to keep pace in the
increasingly expensive semiconductor race.
For Nippon Steel, the acquisition, due to be completed by the end of March,
provides an opportunity to expand its electronics business, but the purchase
will expose the company to the cut-throat competition of the international
chip market.
The past two years have been particularly difficult for NMBS, which reported
a loss of Y12.4bn in the year ended September, leaving the company without
the resources to take advantage of a recent upturn in sales for its main
product, memory chips.
Minebea has also been burdened by NMBS, having reported a consolidated loss
of Y13.6bn last year. Mr Iwao Ishizuka, Minebea's chairman, said the sale
would allow his company to concentrate on its core business, as NMBS has
been losing at least Y1bn a month.
However, his company will be forced to write-off Y44bn in outstanding loans
to NMBS, and now expects a net loss of about Y50bn in the first half, ending
in March, compared with a previously forecast profit of Y1.8bn.
When the acquisition is complete, NMBS will be renamed Nippon Steel
Semiconductor, and the steel maker expects that turning the company around
will take about three years.
Mr Takashi Imai, Nippon Steel vice-president, said agreement had been
reached after a month of negotiation, and that the change of ownership would
not affect an existing NMBS partnership with Intel, the US electronics
company.

FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Arms sales emerge from desert mirage -
British officials optimistic that other orders will follow BAe's pounds 4bn
agreement to supply bombers to Saudi Arabia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS like a mirage in the desert. The arms purchases foreseen in the
second stage of the UK-Saudi Arabian Al-Yamamah agreement in 1988 were
trumpeted as Britain's biggest export deal. Until this week they proved
alluring but unseizable.
Immediately after the 1988 agreement Saudi Arabia gave approval for three
minehunters to be built at Vosper Thornycroft's yard at Southampton. Then,
for more than four years, Saudi Arabia continued to earmark part of its oil
production for British defence supplies, but no more equipment orders
emerged to boost the sagging fortunes of UK arms manufacturers. These were
headed by British Aerospace, prime contractor for the programme and its
principal beneficiary.
Imminent deals were forecast so often that the company's employees and
investors began to doubt whether the sales would materialise.
The order for 48 Tornado bombers, announced by Mr John Major in Riyadh on
Thursday, was the top item in the list. They will complete a Saudi fleet of
120 of the Anglo-German-Italian aircraft, including 24 air-defence versions.
With weapons, spares and training, they account for only about half the
estimated Pounds 4bn-Pounds 5bn value of the latest deal.
Traditional Saudi secrecy surrounds the rest, but it is believed to include
extensive ground facilities for the aircraft and improvements to the
country's air-defence radar and command and control systems.
British officials are optimistic that other orders will now follow.
Westland, due to supply up to 88 Black Hawk helicopters which it would make
under licence from Sikorsky of the US, greeted the Tornado sale as 'very
good news'.
Westland said that since the 1991 Gulf war the Tornados had clearly been the
Saudis' top requirement. 'Until that was resolved it was always difficult to
focus on other contracts,' the company said.
Vosper Thornycroft, scheduled to launch the third of its Saudi minehunters
next month, is awaiting confirmation of a further three. It is making naval
vessels for Oman and Qatar, but is left with no other work in its
specialised niche - building ships out of glass-reinforced plastic.
BAe hopes to sell a further 60 Hawk trainer aircraft to the Saudis, in
addition to 30 already delivered. It is relying increasingly on exporting
Hawks, both as trainers and as light fighters.
Apart from Saudi Arabia, the Tornado has found no clients outside the three
manufacturing countries. Jordan, Oman and Malaysia all backed out of planned
Tornado purchases.
The Saudis are understood to have raised the volume of oil set aside for
British defence purchases by 20 per cent to 600,000 barrels a day -
equivalent at current prices to about Pounds 2.5bn a year.
Revenue from selling this oil goes into an account run by the UK government
and is passed on to BAe, which in turn pays other companies as
sub-contractors.
More than Pounds 10bn has already been paid through this channel. But the
arrangement has proved problematic because oil prices have fallen far short
of the expectations which underpinned the original calculations.
BAe has 4,000 expatriates working in Saudi Arabia on a large programme of
support work and services under the first part of Al-Yamamah, for which the
funding system has not provided a big enough 'kitty'.
This week's deal was a well-kept secret. Doubts about the Tornado sales had
revived since the autumn, when the US agreed to sell 72 advanced versions of
the McDonnell Douglas F-15 to the Saudis for Dollars 5bn.
These include 48 aircraft equipped for ground attack, like the Tornados.
BAe always maintained that the Saudis were still interested in having
Tornados as well, but they were clearly tempted to play their US and UK
suppliers off against each other.
Their negotiations with the new US administration on the exact
specifications of the F-15s - stripped of some of their capabilities in
response to Israeli concerns - are still incomplete. However, the Saudis
seem to have concluded they would not obtain a long-range strike capability
to match that of the Tornado.
The deal comes at the end of a month in which RAF Tornado bombers have twice
played a successful part in bombing raids from Saudi Arabia's Dhahran air
base against military installations in southern Iraq.

FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Rolls-Royce among big winners from Tornado
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Tornado order is a relief for British Aerospace's 450 sub-contractors
which have shed thousands of jobs between them because of recession and the
collapse in defence spending.
One of the biggest beneficiaries is Rolls-Royce, the aero-engine group,
which will supply two RB-199 jet engines for each of the 48 strike aircraft.
The engines and spares, worth about Pounds 500m, will be made by an
international consortium comprising Rolls-Royce, FiatAvio, the Italian motor
group's aerospace subsidiary, and Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the
Daimler-Benz subsidiary.
The UK group's share of the work is about Pounds 250m. Components will be
made throughout Britain, but all the engines will be assembled at
Rolls-Royce's Bristol plant, which employs 6,000 - fewer than 600 working
directly on the RB-199.
GEC-Marconi is responsible for about 30 per cent of the value of each
aircraft, providing electronic navigation, radar and engine management
systems. The order ensures employment for about 6,000 people across six
sites - in Edinburgh, Basildon, Portsmouth, Stanmore in Middlesex, Rochester
in Kent and Pitchfield in Hampshire.
The company was waiting to hear detailed specifications, which could
considerably increase the value of the order. A possible add-on it has
developed for the Royal Air Force is a thermal imaging and laser-designator
pod, which guides bombs to their targets.
Smiths Industries, the avionics group, will supply electronics worth an
estimated Pounds 200,000 per aircraft, including a head-up display and a
weapon-aiming computer. All the work will be done at Smiths' largest
factory, in Cheltenham, which employs 2,000 people - 1,000 fewer than two
years ago.
Smiths is also keen to see whether orders will materialise from Saudi Arabia
for Hawk jet trainers, since dual-control avionics make them almost as
valuable for the group as the Tornados.
Lucas Industries, the Birmingham-based motor and aerospace components group,
will supply nearly Pounds 50m worth of engine and flight-control systems,
windscreens and switches. The order will be spread across seven sites -
Wolverhampton, Coventry, Bradford, Hemel Hempstead, Luton and two in the
Birmingham area,
Lucas said the order would help secure jobs, although only 2,000 would be
directly involved in the Tornado order. Since the group started
restructuring in October it has shed 400 aerospace jobs from a total of more
than 8,000.
Mr Frank Turner, head of Lucas's aerospace division, said: 'This is
excellent news at a time of difficult trading in the aerospace industry.'
TI Group, the specialist engineering company, estimates it has won work
worth Pounds 25m - mainly through Dowty, the aerospace engineer which it
took over last year. Dowty will supply landing gear and associated
hydraulics from its plants in Cheltenham and fuel-control systems from
Wolverhampton. TI will also make engine rings from a plant in Birmingham.
The factories involved employ a total of 2,500 people.
Many smaller suppliers will benefit. MBM Technology, part of Morgan
Crucible, employs 200 people in Brighton and makes the weapon-release
systems. It said it had not yet heard from BAe, so could not estimate the
value of the work.

THE LONDON Metal Exchange zinc market was roused from its torpor on Thursday
when Pasminco, the Australian natural resources group, announced plans for
substantial production cuts.
It said market conditions were forcing it to restructure its loss-making
lead and zinc operations at Broken Hill - immediately closing the
inefficient northern operations, which had been scheduled for closure in
1995, and raising production at the southern operations. Analysts calculated
that the net result would be falls of 25,000 tonnes a year in zinc output
and 32,600 tonnes a year in lead output.
The announcement brought an immediate Dollars 52-a-tonne rise in the LME's
three months zinc price and three months lead gained Pounds 6.25 a tonne on
the day. Zinc's rise continued in early trading yesterday, when it gained
another Dollars 10.50 to an eight-week high of Dollars 1,137 a tonne. But
profit-taking then emerged and by the close the price had been trimmed to
Dollars 1,118 a tonne, up Dollars 41.75 on the week. The lead price eased
back 75p yesterday to Pounds 294.75 a tonne, up Pounds 6 on the week. But
the rise illusory - in terms of the US currency, against which sterling was
very weak, the price was down about Dollars 6.50.
Some analysts were surprised at the violence of the two markets' initial
responses to the Pasminco cuts, which they said looked pretty modest when
set against stock levels of 1m tonnes for zinc and 640,000 tonnes for lead.
Mr William Adams of London trader Rudolf Wolff doubted that the higher price
levels would be maintained 'unless there are more cuts'.
Mr Nick Moore of Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group, pointed
out, however, that the Pasminco move had increased this year's prospective
zinc supply deficit from 50,000 to 75,000 tonnes and wiped out the expected
lead surplus 'at one stroke'. Furthermore he expected other producers who
were finding present price levels hard to live with to follow Pasminco's
lead.
Copper prices also appeared firm, with the LME's cash position gaining
Pounds 46 to Pounds 1,497.50 on the week. But the rise was entirely
attributable to sterling's weakness. A sharpish dip on Monday was reversed
the following day as Chinese buying reappeared and dealers covered against a
threatened strike at Enami of Chile's Ventanas smelter. The Enami fears were
softened later in the week, however, when El Teniente, also of Chile, said
it would be able to process concentrates from Enami if the strike took
place.
Oil prices staged a substantial rally this week: first on signs that
determination was growing among members of the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to take positive action at the February 13 ministerial
meeting to shore up their depressed market; and then on news that a US
senator was proposing the imposition of a Dollars 25-a-barrel price floor on
the US's oil imports. The London International Petroleum Exchange's April
crude oil contract was quoted at Dollars 18.50 a barrel in late trading
yesterday, down 19 cents from Thursday's close but Dollars 1.04 up from the
end of last week.
Talks held this week by Mr Alirio Parra of Venezuela, the Opec president,
with Middle Eastern oil ministers are reported to have revealed a much more
constructive attitude on the need for effective control of production than
was evident previously. In particular the market was encouraged by
indications from the Kuwaiti minister, Mr Ali al-Baghli, that his country
would be prepared to cut output as part of a concerted effort to reduce the
cartel's daily production by about 1m barrels to 24m barrels.
The market's reaction to the proposal by Democratic Senator Bennett Johnston
of Louisiana for the imposition of a variable fee on US oil imports at under
Dollars 25 a barrel was, at first sight, paradoxical. Although they did not
believe the legislation would ever reach the statute books they regarded its
proposal as distinctly bullish.
'When the biggest consumer and importer of oil says it wants to push the
price up to Dollars 25 a barrel the natural reaction of the exporters may be
to say 'let's do it for them',' explained Mr Mehdi Varzi, oil analyst at
Kleinwort Benson.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange the robusta coffee market began
with a continuation of last week's sharp price fall, but then staged a quite
spirited rally. The initial fall took the March futures position, which last
week fell Dollars 71 to Dollars 904 a tonne down to Dollars 801 a tonne at
one stage. Dealers blamed pessimism about the International Coffee Agreement
talks being held in London and chart-based selling in New York.
While the price was still falling, however, dealers were warning that the
market had become heavily oversold . 'This market is not trading on
fundamentals, but is being moved by the weight of money wielded by the
(investment) funds,' commented Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with London
Futures broker GNI.
The bounce, when it came was equally technical and almost equally sharp. An
Dollars 18 rise yesterday took the March position to Dollars 895 a tonne,
down just Dollars 9 on the week.
Cocoa prices also came under pressure from selling by investment funds in
New York, but the sterling-denominated London market was cushioned by the
pound's slide. The May futures price closed yesterday at Pounds 716 a tonne,
down Pounds 23 on the week, but had it not been for the currency factor the
fall would have been nearly Pounds 50.

FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Debenham Tewson in Pounds 11m merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEBENHAM TEWSON &amp; Chinnocks, the quoted property adviser, yesterday
announced a merger with Bernard Thorpe, a firm of chartered surveyors, in a
deal worth Pounds 10.9m.
It also announced a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 727,000 to Pounds
936,000 for the six months to the end of October. Its share price rose 6p to
71p.
This deal is the latest of a series of mergers within the chartered
surveying industry in the past year, as the severe downturn in the property
industry has forced firms to cut costs and seek stronger partners.
DTC said the purpose of the deal was to expand its regional network.
The merger will result in cost savings of about Pounds 2m a year, as a
result of reductions in staff numbers and accomodation costs.
The combined group would have had a turnover of Pounds 55m in the last
financial year. In the year ended April 1992, Bernard Thorpe incurred a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 274,000 and had net assets of Pounds 1.8m.
Mr Richard Lay, chairman of DTC will be the chairman of the merged group,
which will be called DTZ Debenham Thorpe. Mr David Buck, the chief executive
of Bernard Thorpe will become vice-chairman. Mr Anthony Turnbull, DTC's
chief executive will become chief executive of the enlarged group.
Debenham will issue 9.79m new shares, representing 23.6 per cent of the
enlarged share capital, and up to a further 750,000 new shares on June 1
1994. Bernard Thorpe's partners have agreed not to dispose of the shares
before April 1996.
Mr Lay said that DTC expected a 'a satisfactory outcome' for the full year,
with a significant contribution from Bernard Thorpe in the second half. In
the year to October 1992, DTC's turnover rose from Pounds 16.6m to Pounds
17.53m. Earnings per share rose from 1.22p to 1.81p. An interim dividend of
1.2p (1p) was declared.

FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Coleridge to step up role at Sturge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID COLERIDGE, the former chairman of Lloyd's of London, is set to play
a more active role at Sturge Holdings, the Lloyd's agency which he chairs,
following yesterday's surprise resignation of Mr Peter Davis, the group's
deputy chairman and finance director.
It had been expected that Mr Coleridge, who is 60, would have only a
part-time involvement at Sturge, following an arduous two year stint at
Lloyd's.
Instead, he is expected to be much more involved as Sturge prepares to
confront a severe skrinkage in its business.
Full details will emerge at the group's annual meeting next Thursday but it
is expected that capacity of the 22 syndicates under management will fall
from its Pounds 1.05bn in 1992 by at least 20 per cent in 1993.
Mr Davis joined Sturge in 1988 to help guide the group's expansion outside
Lloyd's.
However, in the wake of the market's recent trading problems Sturge has
suffered a contraction in its business and has reduced the size of its
management team accordingly.
Resignations of other senior figures are expected this year, as well as
further redundancies among the group's 1,300 staff. Since October 1991 175
staff have left.
The decline of two 'flagship' syndicates - 206 and 210 - is a particular
concern. During Sturge's rapid expansion in the mid-1980s each syndicate -
which underwrites a broad spread of insurance business - increased its
capacity to over Pounds 200m.
More recently both have suffered sharp falls. Syndicate 206 may be left with
less than Pounds 50m capacity in 1993, while syndicate 210's capacity could
also decline by 50 per cent.
Mr Johnston Brown, group company secretary, said that many Names -
individual traders whose capital supports Lloyd's - had been hard hit by
recent losses and were being forced to reduce the amount of insurance traded
on their behalf.
Sturge could leave the most recent years of account of syndicates 206 and
210 open, because of the sharp contraction in the syndicates' size.

FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Royal begins break-up of reinsurance side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL Insurance is to begin dismantling its reinsurance subsidiary, Royal
Re, in line with a strategy of focusing on core direct insurance business.
Some parts of Royal Re's portfolio - which generated more than Pounds 150m
in premium income in 1992 - will be transferred to its industrial risks
subsidiary, Royal Global. The rest of the company's UK-based reinsurance
business will be run-off.
While Royal Re's US arm, American Royal Re, will continue to trade for the
moment, it is understood that the group will seek to sell the operation,
which accounted for under 20 per cent of premium income last year.
'The market has seen a deterioration in results due to inherent problems and
an unprecedented number of natural catastrophe losses', explained Mr Richard
Gamble, group chief executive.
'Against this background, together with Royal Re's relatively small
worldwide market share', it was in 'shareholders' best interests to reduce
its involvement in the market', added Mr Gamble.
In order to facilitate an 'orderly withdrawal' from the market Royal said it
had acquired the 20 per cent minority stake in Royal Re previously held by
Aachen Re.
Yesterday's announcement follows a number of unsuccessful attempts to sell
Royal Re. Last year the group said reinsurance was identified as a 'non-core
business in the longer-term'.
Other insurance companies have also reduced their involvement in reinsurance
in recent years. Last year Prudential announced it was reducing its
involvement in general reinsurance business in order to focus on life
reinsurance.
Legal &amp; General sold its reinsurance subsidiary, Victory Re, to ING, the
Dutch banking and insurance group, in July 1990.

FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: IDV lifts Buton stake to 85% in Pounds 39m
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Distillers &amp; Vintners, the drinks arm of Grand Metropolitan,
is to acquire Buton, the Italian spirits and wines company in which it
bought a minority stake two months ago.
Through its Italian subsidiary, Cinzano, IDV has agreed to buy BIF, a family
holding company which owns 50.1 per cent of Buton, for Pounds 38.6m
(L85.7bn) cash.
The deal, subject to the approval of the Italian anti-trust authorities,
will give IDV control over 85 per cent of Buton's shares. A public offer
will be made for the rest.
IDV bought 33.8 per cent of Buton - which makes Italy's leading spirits
brand, Vecchia Romagna brandy - for Pounds 19.7m from a group of minority
holders last November. It has since acquired another 1.1 per cent from that
source.
The UK company originally intended to establish a worldwide trading
partnership with Buton on the lines of those recently developed with
Gonzalez Byass in Spain, and Jose Cuervo in Mexico.
When acquiring the initial minority stake it arranged to sell back the
shares to the vendors if an alliance proved impossible, but discussions with
the majority holders quickly led to an agreed acquisition.

FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Wholesale Fittings dips to Pounds 934,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERIM pre-tax profits at Wholesale Fittings, the distributor of electrical
goods, declined from Pounds 1.21m to Pounds 934,000 on turnover up by Pounds
300,000 at Pounds 30.3m.
Mr Leonard Rose, joint managing director, said that margins had 'held up
reasonably well', but redundancies and the cost of the company's new
integrated computer system helped knock operating profits back from Pounds
1.05m to Pounds 797,000.
Interest receivable slipped to Pounds 137,000 (Pounds 156,000).
The workforce was reduced by 50 people, or 7 per cent, and the branch at
Telford - the smallest - was closed in December 1992. Trading conditions
continued to be 'extremely difficult and highly competitive'.
The interim dividend is held at 3.23p, payable from reduced earnings of 4.4p
(5.6p).

<TEXT>
McKay Securities, the property group, remained profitable in the half year
ended September 30 1992, but is omitting the interim dividend in the light
of discussions with its banks.
Its unsecured banking agreements contain a standard covenant relating to the
ratio between net asset value and the level of secured borrowings, which has
restricted the ability to draw down fully its committed secured facilities.
Discussions are going on to amend the covenant and to securing adequate
medium-term funding. All banking facilities are expected to be put on a
secured basis.
In the half year pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 2m to Pounds 877,000 after
increased interest charges. No development outgoings or interest costs were
capitalised, compared with Pounds 564,000. Earnings per share were 2.9p,
against 6p on which an interim dividend of 3.2p was paid.
Gross rents came to Pounds 4.47m (Pounds 4.68m).

FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Wiggins losses down to Pounds 359,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WIGGINS GROUP, the property developer, made inroads into its losses in the
six months ended September 30 1992, cutting them from Pounds 1.76m to Pounds
359,000.
Turnover was down to Pounds 1.25m (Pounds 5.22m). Net interest payable was
more than halved at Pounds 369,000 and this time there were no exceptionals,
against Pounds 752,000.
Below the line there was an extraordinary Pounds 453,000 charge relating to
the non-consolidation of Allison Group placed in receivership last June.
Losses per share fell to 2.3p (11.1p).
Since the half year negotiations have been concluded for the sale of the
South Western House Building subsidiary, which will lead to a decrease in
the deficiency of net assets of some Pounds 3m.

FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Final Brown Shipley sale likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE TWO remaining businesses of Brown Shipley Holdings
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
stockbroking and investment management - seem set to be acquired by
Kredietbank Luxembourgeoise only seven months after it rescued Brown Shipley
&amp; Co, the banking arm.
KBL, a sister organisation to one of Belgium's biggest banking groups, is
likely to offer 30p a share for the 70.2 per cent of Brown Shipley Holdings
it does not already own, valuing it at Pounds 4.8m. When KBL bought its
initial 20 per cent stake in 1986 it paid 750p a share and a total of Pounds
23m.
Brown Shipley's share price slid from 51p to 35p after yesterday's
announcement about the potential deal - and about the problem that had
sparked it off.
This dates back to KBL's Pounds 1 purchase of Brown Shipley &amp; Co last June.
Leasing losses, bad debt provisions and a property write-down had undermined
the bank's capital base and it could no longer be sustained by the holding
company.
However, one of the liabilities passed on with Brown Shipley &amp; Co has
rebounded in the form of potential claims totalling Pounds 2.4m against BSH.
The claims relate to Lease Management Services, which was sold last June for
Pounds 5.9m to Woodchester Investments, the Dublin-based leasing and banking
group in which Credit Lyonnais of France has a near 50 per cent stake.
Although BSH has denied liability, if the claims were successful they would
reduce its net assets to less than half the Pounds 16m called up capital,
necessitating an extraordinary general meeting to discuss what to do.
Mr William Dacombe, chairman and chief executive, said fighting the claims
would not only be expensive, but also destabilising and bad for morale.
'Independence has its attractions, but the financial strength of KBL also
has its attractions.'
If the offer goes ahead and is accepted - and the odds are on that outcome -
it will round off the break-up of Brown Shipley. That started last May with
the Pounds 33m sale of its insurance broking operations to Holmwoods Group
and the Pounds 10m disposal of its offshore operations to Standard Bank
Investment Corporation of South Africa.

FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Arthur Shaw rebels reveal debt reduction
strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT and PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REBEL shareholders at Arthur Shaw, the loss-making West Midlands building
materials group have proposed a debt reduction strategy designed to win
support for its campaign to unseat the board.
The rebels, who claim the support of shareholders controlling 49 per cent of
the equity, aim to reduce borrowing through asset disposals and the sale of
Jackdaw, the engineering tools subsidiary.
In a letter to shareholders, the dissident group said the company should
focus on its core window hardware business and strengthen sales overseas.
Led by Mr Ian Tickler, Mr Pearson's predecessor, the rebels claim their
campaign has been strengthened by a sharp division on the board. The split
emerged after Mr Alan Bearman, a non-executive director, issued a statement
disassociating himself from a letter sent to shareholders by Mr Pearson.
Mr Pearson suggested that all members of the board intended to recommend
that shareholders vote against the resolutions. Mr Bearman disagreed.

FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Goodhead shares fall as profits dive 58%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Goodhead fell 6p to 27p yesterday as the printing, paper
publishing and marketing services group announced a 58 per cent plunge in
pre-tax profits after exceptional charges of Pounds 133,000.
In the half-year to November 30 1992, profits stood at Pounds 181,000
against Pounds 429,000, on lower turnover of Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 22.2m).
The interim dividend is again passed; there was a final of 0.5p last time.
Mr Colin Rosser, chief executive, said consistent results from the print and
paper division, and its publishing side, were offset by a sharp decline at
the marketing services business which struggled to break even.
Interest charges fell to Pounds 611,000 (Pounds 706,000) on largely
unchanged borrowings of about Pounds 10m.
Below the line the group absorbed extraordinary provisions of Pounds 3.73m
associated with the sale of its loss-making Review Group subsidiary and
related properties. That left a loss attributable to shareholders of Pounds
3.64m (profit Pounds 220,000). Losses per share were 0.2p compared with
earnings of 0.6p.
Mr Rosser said the group was committed to concentrating on its core printing
and publishing businesses and pulling out of marketing services, which might
be accomplished by the year-end.
It was evaluating the future of its profitable Canadian publishing
operation.

FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Rebel blamed for sharp downturn at
Etonbrook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ETONBROOK, the property developer, has blamed a sharp fall in pre-tax
profits on the costs incurred fighting a rebel bid for a 30 per cent stake
in the company.
After exceptional charges of Pounds 120,000, the former BES company
announced a profit of Pounds 74,000 in the six months to the end of
September 1992, compared with Pounds 300,000 in 1991.
Profits were further undermined by rental income lost on an east London
warehouse which the company sold. Rental income fell from Pounds 317,000 to
Pounds 191,000.
Mr Keith Moss, managing director, said the results would have been healthier
if the company had not faced attempts by rebel shareholder Mr Andrew Perloff
to increase his 19.13 per cent stake.
Mr Perloff blamed the decline on poor management and questioned a Pounds
6,000 increase in administrative expenses to Pounds 103,000.
The company has consistently urged shareholders to reject Mr Perloff's
overtures, which include a 13.4 per cent tender offer and calls for board
changes. He failed to win a seat on the board at an extraordinary meeting
last August, but was successful in thwarting plans to repay Pounds 1.19m in
preference shares.
'The costs of the EGM and fighting Mr Perloff has meant everyone has lost
out and shareholders will not get a dividend,' Mr Moss said.
The share price fell 3p yesterday to close at 73p.

FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: ISA extends its European network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A move to extend further its European distribution of branded consumables
for information processing equipment, ISA International is to acquire CTS
Svenska, which distributes in Sweden, for up to Pounds 6m.
An initial Pounds 2.5m in shares is payable on completion. A further Pounds
3.5m in cash may be payable after an audit by ISA.
Mr Andrew Heap, deputy chairman, said he wanted ISA to become truly
pan-European - it would have 'greater purchasing muscle' and would not have
to rely on the economy of any one country.
At the same time, in its first fund-raising since coming to the market in
1987, ISA is conditionally placing, with clawback, 6.47m ordinary shares
with institutional investors at 85p per share. The proceeds will be Pounds
5.5m, before expenses of Pounds 600,000.
Mr Heap said the placing and offer would serve three functions. It would pay
the deferred consideration; increase the working capital for the enlarged
group; and improve the marketability of the shares. ISA's combined board
holding will be diluted from about 25 per cent to 19 per cent.
Since flotation, turnover has grown from Pounds 17m to an estimated Pounds
120m in 1992. The group is forecasting profits this year of 'not less than
Pounds 3m', up 41 per cent on 1991.

FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Palmerston drops Pounds 5.8m into the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Palmerston Holdings fell from 25p to 13p yesterday after the
property group reported a Pounds 5.78m pre-tax loss in the six months to
September 30. That compared with profits last time of Pounds 476,137.
The result was after an exceptional provision of Pounds 3.85m for associated
company guarantees and Pounds 1m for associated company doubtful debt.
Mr Philip Rose, chairman, said the values of the group's properties had
declined since the last balance sheet date, which together with the
continuing support needed by associates, had resulted in a breach of the
group's covenants with its bankers.
Accordingly, the group was in discussion with its bankers regarding the
continued availability of facilities.
Losses per share were 26.99p (earnings 2.12p).

FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Markheath hit by provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROVISIONS OF Pounds 3.87m for declining property values led to sharply
increased losses at Markheath in the six months to September 30. The pre-tax
deficit was stretched from Pounds 459,000 to Pounds 4.71m and there is no
interim dividend, against 0.5p last time when the final was also passed.
Mr Michael Rendle, chairman, said that in November the company breached its
banking facilities - specifically two covenants - as its properties failed
to generate sufficient income to cover all the interest costs.
He added that discussions with its banks were 'progressing in a constructive
manner' to try to renegotiate the facilities. The company said that the
interim figures had been drawn up on a going concern basis, which assumes
the continued support of the banks.
Mr Ian Creber, finance director, said that borrowings, having fallen from
Pounds 95.4m to Pounds 72.9m in the year to March 1992, had risen over the
half to Pounds 78m, but that since September 30 had been reduced to Pounds
67.4m via the sale of the stake in Frogmore Estates for Pounds 13.1m. That
sale should also result in a Pounds 3m tax rebate in 1993. In January a
property sale for Pounds 1m was completed.
The pre-tax figure was struck after charging Pounds 2.4m to the profit and
loss account - the capitalisation of interest and attributable overheads to
the carrying value of properties stopped in August.
The sale of properties in the half totalled Pounds 3.17m (Pounds 3.8m). Mr
Creber said the company had not been tempted to 'dump' properties, 'just to
pay interest'. Operating losses grew to Pounds 3.23m (Pounds 2.49m), while
income from properties brought in Pounds 1.57m (Pounds 1.29m).
Losses per share were 4.03p (0.19p).

FT  30 JAN 93 / Hat trick for British Aerospace: Europe's largest defence
contractor hopes it has restored credibility with a Pounds 5bn Saudi order
for Tornado aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, was in high spirits yesterday
afternoon.
'I feel above all a sense of relief,' he said, slouched in a chair in the
company's offices near London's Charing Cross Station. 'I've consistently
been in a minority of one, telling the world we would do this deal,' he
added. He was referring to the Pounds 5bn defence contract for 48 more
Tornado combat aircraft and other equipment signed with Saudi Arabia on
Thursday by Mr John Major, the prime minister.
With the big Saudi order, BAe has managed to clear in the space of two
months the three biggest uncertainties which had been clouding its future as
Europe's largest defence contractor and one of its principal commercial
aircraft manufacturers.
The three 'home runs' as BAe calls them - the compromise with Germany in
December enabling the European Fighter Aircraft programme to continue; the
partnership signed last week with Taiwan in the regional jet business; and
the Saudi Arabian order for Tornado aircraft - have now dramatically changed
the investment community's sentiment about the company.
BAe's share price has more than doubled in the past six months from a low of
100p to 253p at yesterday's close. But although the company appears to have
confounded its many doubters, it is not yet entirely out of the woods.
Mr Evans underlined the point when he said: 'I don't want anybody in the
company to run away and think that we can now sit back and lean on our
shovels.'
All its main activities, from defence to commercial aircraft, from cars to
property, are still in depressed markets with few signs of imminent
recovery. It is also still a long way from restoring its profitability,
badly dented by its diversification and takeover binge of the late 1980s
following its privatisation.
But Mr Evans said BAe had now at least been given some stability. 'We can
now begin the process of regaining some credibility,' he added, emphasising
that the priorities were 'to keep the business under tight control and
weather out the recession while we continue developing alliances to give
greater robustness to the group'.
He candidly admitted that BAe had gone through a rough time. 'No doubt about
it, management last year faced up to a hell of a jolt and we've had a
particularly difficult 18 months.
'What brought BAe down to its knees in the first place was that five- to
six-year period when it suffered massive cash outflows because of what was
clearly an unsustainable investment rate,' said Mr Keith Hodgkinson,
aerospace analyst at the investment house of Shearson Lehman.
While having to face the difficulties of an extremely tough business
climate, it has also had to confront the internal traumas of a highly
publicised top management shake-up following the boardroom coup to force out
Professor Sir Roland Smith as chairman 16 months ago.
The appointment last May of Mr John Cahill, the former chief executive of
BTR, the UK industrial conglomerate, as chairman did little at first to
retore morale and confidence inside Britain's biggest exporter of
manufactured goods. As if the company did not have enough troubles of its
own, in June Germany dealt BAe a body blow by threatening to pull out of the
four nation EFA project.
Even after the new chairman announced a recovery programme, involving the
restructuring of the company's loss-making commercial aircraft activities,
the closure of its historic Hatfield aircraft manufacturing plant near
London, and more job cuts (the company lost 13,400 people in 1991 and has
announced an additional 8,000 job cuts last year), the City of London and
BAe's shareholders remained unimpressed.
Mr Evans said at that time BAe had to address the three critical issues of
the future of EFA, securing a new Saudi order, and resolving the problems of
the regional jet business, to set in motion the recovery strategy aimed at
cutting losses and refocusing BAe on its core defence, aerospace and
car-making ties.
The compromise with Germany over EFA, now rechristened Eurofighter, and the
long-awaited Saudi contract have underpinned the future of BAe's profitable
military aircraft business. 'If we had not received the Saudi order we would
have had to shut down completely the Tornado line in a couple of months'
time,' explained Mr Evans. 'We can now also plan sensibly our medium-term
production before EFA production comes on stream,' he added.
The partnership with Taiwan Aerospace has also ensured, for the time being
at least, the future of BAe's presence in the regional jet market. It will
also enable the company to address the next stage of its commercial aircraft
restructuring.
BAe will now be able to release some of the Pounds 750m restructuring
provisions it made in its accounts last year largely to cover a possible
total shutdown of regional jet activities for the restructuring of its
turbopropeller commuter aircraft business. The company is already
considering an alliance with other partners and contacts are believed to
have already begun with the Franco-Italian ATR turboprop commuter aircraft
group.
Mr Evans remains confident of the longer-term prospects of Airbus, the
European commercial aircraft maker in which BAe has a 20 per cent stake.
'The trouble with the civil aircraft business is that it follows sod's law:
we know the market will turn around but we don't know when, and when it
happens the industry will not be able to keep up with the demand,' he said.
Also at Rover, Mr Evans is waiting for the car market to recover. 'When it
does, I think Rover will turn the corner,' he said. Rover continues to be
heavily dependent on the depressed UK car market and its challenge will be
to improve its penetration of the continental European market. The company
is now pinning big hopes on the launch in April of the new Rover 600, a
medium-sized family saloon which will complete the new Rover car range.
'April will be enormously important for Rover, and with the 600 we will be
taking on the BMW3 series head to head,' Mr Evans added.
BAe is also continuing to review possible disposals of assets which do not
fit its refocused strategy. Some parts of its property business could be
hived off, although Mr Evans said the company was in no hurry and would not
sell at any price.
The same applies to the space division and to the corporate jet division.
Both were put up for sale last year, but BAe has now decided to hold on to
these activities because it failed to receive any sufficiently attractive
offers.
Restoring credibility in the group has become all the more important as BAe
continues to explore new alliances and partnerships at a time of growing
consolidation in the defence and aerospace industries.
Having already established close links with the German and US aerospace
industries in military aircraft programmes, BAe is anxious to build up
strong relations with the French industry now in the throes of
restructuring. 'It was a tragedy France did not come in on a European
military aircraft programme and our company has to have a better working
relationship with both Aerospatiale and Dassault of France,' Mr Evans said.
The triple breakthrough on the Saudi, EFA and Taiwan fronts may now also
reduce the prospect of a takeover. At the time of BAe's management crisis in
1991, the General Electric Company was widely tipped as a likely bidder.
With the share price recovering and the company showing renewed confidence,
some analysts suggest GEC may have now missed its opportunity and become 'a
victim of its own over-cautiousness', in the words of one.
Others, however, believe GEC is still waiting in the wings to strike and was
not prepared to move until BAe clinched the new Saudi deal.
Mr Evans did not seem very concerned. 'We and GEC need each other. In some
small cases we compete but much of the time we are complementary,' he
explained. As for the possible intentions of Lord Weinstock, GEC's managing
director, on BAe, Mr Evans simply said: 'My guess is that Arnold Weinstock
is delighted to see we have turned the corner and got to grips with some of
our problems.'

FT  30 JAN 93 / Letter: Interest cuts overlooked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From I R FERGUSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The soundings you take from the Treasury's advisory panel on the wisdom
of further interest rate cuts (January 22) and the wider discussion of the
issue, perhaps overlook one significant point.
Many mortgage holders have policies on which interest payments are adjusted
annually. Only now are the 1992 interest rate cuts working through. The
resulting substantial changes in monthly outgoings can be expected to give a
big boost to consumer confidence and spending. Combined with the need to
eschew additional inflationary pressure from sterling depreciation, this
would seem to justify a cautious approach to further rate cuts.

Sir, I hope you will allow me to set the record straight about the British

regional boards. The BTA may appear to have its grant-in-aid maintained, but
devaluation of sterling has substantially reduced our ability to promote
Britain around the world.
I also want to make it clear that it was entirely my decision to give up the

FT  30 JAN 93 / All ears tuned to revolutionary research: New figures on
who's listening to what on British radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Television may be the dominant broadcasting medium in Britain, but millions
of pairs of ears still regularly tune in to radio.
The first joint radio research covering both the BBC and the commercial
stations shows that more than 41.5m adults - 89 per cent of the country's
total - listen to radio at least once a week.
The research by Radio Joint Audience Research (Rajar), based on 56,000
listeners keeping detailed diaries over a three-month period, gives Classic
FM, Britain's first national commercial radio, a weekly audience of 4.25m or
9 per cent of the total. Rather more surprisingly, Atlantic 252, a long-wave
interloper broadcasting pop music from Ireland, had 3.8m adult listeners in
its official survey area, which covers about 70 per cent of the UK.
In the battle between the BBC and the commercial stations the corporation is
still ahead with the help of its big guns: the five national channels from
Radio 1 to Radio 5. Altogether the BBC has 69 per cent of UK adults
listening at least once a week and accounts for 58.4 per cent of total radio
listening. Fifty three per cent of the adult population now listens to some
form of commercial radio each week and the sector has a 37.8 per cent share
of all listening.
But more important than these revealing figures is the fact that the Rajar
research exists at all. For years the BBC and the commercial sector have
produced separate listening figures using different methods; and then they
have squabbled about the results. They wanted to end the confusion so set
Rajar up last year.
Now, a benchmark has been set for advertisers buying airtime and for those
wondering whether BBC Radio provides value for money.
On Wednesday, the Association of Independent Radio Companies had a tricky
decision to take at its annual meeting. Should the companies agree that the
Rajar findings should be published, even though the news for some may not be
good and there may be 'glitches' in the first of what will be quarterly
reports?
The decision to publish immediately was virtually unanimous, even though the
disclosures might involve rough justice for a number of stations whose
listening figures appeared to be surprisingly low.
'I think that shows great maturity and robustness of confidence in the
medium,' Mr Jimmy Gordon, managing director of the successful Radio Clyde
group, said yesterday.
The results, particularly for local stations, appear to be lower than
previous figures compiled separately. Mr Richard Eyre, managing director of
Capital Radio, agrees that the industry should be given credit for having
the courage to publish, but added: 'It is surprising that the result should
deliver a blow that is greater to ILR (independent local radio) than it is
to the BBC.'
The arrival of the first common currency for radio ratings in the UK comes
at a turning point for the radio industry.
The BBC, under its new director-general, Mr John Birt, is in the middle of
redefining what its role in radio should be as the debate gets under way
with the government on the renewal of corporation's royal charter. It runs
out at the end of 1996.
For the commercial companies offering a total of 140 radio services on both
AM and FM the challenge is different and larger. The task is to break away
from the reputation of commercial radio as a bit of an also-ran in the media
stakes, doomed to be a 2 per cent medium - taking a share of about 2 per
cent of all UK advertising revenue and reliant on the growth of overall
spending on advertising for their own growth, rather than increasing their
share.
Radio revenues from advertising last year are expected to be between Pounds
130m and Pounds 140m with opinion divided on future prospects. Some in the
industry believe a 'quantum leap' in advertising revenue is possible with
the arrival of new national commercial stations, but others believe the
growth will be more gradual.
On the face of it the numbers look pessimistic. Since 1979 the number of
hours of commercial radio has grown by more than 55 per cent, yet its share
of advertising revenue has remained static.
Mr Douglas McArthur, chief executive of the new, independent Radio
Advertising Bureau, believes this can be changed and has set himself a
target of doubling radio's share of national advertising by 1996.
Mr McArthur, who has put together a team of radio research and planning
specialists, Sound Planning, to work with companies which have not been
regular users of radio advertising, had a small piece of good news for his
colleagues this week.
After two weeks of working with the Unilever brand, Batchelors Cup-a Soup,
on Wednesday morning Unilever decided to buy airtime.
'By the end of this year, Sound Planning will have delivered at least Pounds
2m to stations and I aim it to reach a rate of Pounds 5m per year,' Mr
McArthur said.
The Advertising Association is forecasting 8 per cent real growth in radio
advertising revenues this year followed by 5 per cent in 1994. Zenith, the
large media buyer, is more pessimistic and foresees little real growth.
With Classic FM successfully launched the industry hopes that the launch of
the second national commercial station (INR 2) in April - Virgin Radio,
devoted to popular music - will further stimulate advertisers and listeners'
interest. The third scheduled national commercial station, which will be
speech-based, has been delayed until 1995 because of the recession.
In the meantime, Mr Eyre of Capital has decided to launch 'INR 4'. This is a
proposal to market the existing ILR stations as a network so that an
advertiser can buy into all of them at a particular time of day or into a
particular type of programme. 'I'm cautiously optimistic,' says Mr Eyre, who
believes it is possible to double radio's share of national advertising by
1996.
While the commercial stations are preoccupied with attracting advertising,
the BBC has set itself a different task. It aims to develop 'recognisably
distinctive and innovative services'. For Radio 1, for example, the emphasis
will be on range and diversity of music rather than just playing what is
most popular. A 24-news and current affairs network is planned for next
year.
An example of how the BBC plans to differentiate itself from its commercial
rivals came this week in London. GLR, the regional station for London,
increased the proportion of news and current affairs during its peak
listening hours.
As commercial broadcasters were speaking yesterday of the rather unpalatable
survey results, it was clear that it will be some time before an accurate
trend is established and all the glitches removed from the new survey.
Over at the BBC it was Mr David Hatch's last day as managing director of BBC
Network Radio before becoming special adviser to Mr Birt. 'It is remarkable
and a credit to our producers, writers, musicians, actors and broadcasters
that over 60 per cent of the British public listen to one or more of the
five BBC networks each week,' Mr Hatch said.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Letter: Education needs government to adopt 'hands off'
policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL ROSS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Joe Rogaly's praise of the government's persistence with its 'sensible'
education reforms ('Less than the sum of its parts', January 26) suggests he
has been taken in by the gloss rather than the reality of the reforms.
Will employers see it as sensible next year when grades C, D and E, which
are the grades obtained by the majority of 16-year-olds, are squeezed into
national curriculum levels 6 and 7, involving the abolition of the useful
C/D boundary?
Do parents think it is sensible that the last age cohort which has not been
following the national curriculum in English in secondary schools will be
the first examined on it next year? Or that the reports for 14-year-olds
this year will contain some 69 grades for every pupil? Some may even
question the legality of testing 14-year-olds at levels 3-6 on Shakespeare
when the statutory orders clearly specify level 7 as the first level at
which this can be applied.
The well-established examination boards have strict moderation procedures
for speaking and listening, give schools 24 months' notice of examination
texts, and maintain strict security over examination papers. Will they think
it sensible that they are criticised by a government whose own examination
body, SEAC, has no inter-school moderation procedures for speaking and
listening, gives schools six or eight months' notice of examination texts,
and seems to have been planning to use its pre-test papers as the actual
exam? The procedures of the established boards are light years ahead of the
government's own procedures as reflected by SEAC.
The truth is that this government has alienated the profession to an
unprecedented degree. The legacy of years of not listening to the profession
is an administrative shambles. The sensible policy for the government to
adopt would be a 'hands off' approach, and re-establishment of the GCSE in
its pre-national curriculum form.
Only in this way could the genuine rise in standards, reflected in
consistent improvements in 'A' level results, be maintained and flourish.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Letter: No conspiracy by independent financial advisers on
competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER L TANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I enjoyed reading Barry Riley's 'Long View' (January 23) because it put
the independent financial adviser in a new light, which is always
refreshing. I agree with his point that it would be a shame if IFAs a were
'eliminated', thereby reducing consumer choice and removing yet another
distinctive British tradition.
However, on other points I disagree. IFAs were and are a much less organised
and cohesive group than he suggests. As a manager of a network of over 1,000
of them, I can attest to their disparate natures; about the only thing they
have in common is their pride and belief in independence. .
Barry Riley would have us believe that IFAs were not only vocal but
successfully conspiratorial in their bid to introduce polarisation into the
legislation as a means of restricting banks and building societies from
retailing investment products. As a group, IFAs just did not have the
necessary institutional arrangements in place to effect such a plot.
IFAs ought now to feel threatened by those banks and building societies
which are getting into ownership and distribution of their own brand of life
and investment products. And surely their only way is to respond exactly in
line with what Barry Riley implies has been going on, ie they must get ideas
'above their station' if they are to differentiate themselves from the mass
consumer marketing which threatens to overwhelm them.
My observation is that IFAs see both the threat and the opportunity. Some
will inevitably leave the arena, but new entrants are coming in, often from
the ranks of tied agents. These people are now required to pass an
examination before putting up their brass plate. Many IFAs are responding by
joining networks, the ultimate test of which will be their ability to help
members meet their own aspirations and the needs of clients. The other test
will be how well they cope with the increasingly tight regulatory
environment presaged by the debate on the future of the Personal Investment
Authority.
If they can cope with all, then the threat of extinction, as implied by
Barry Riley, will have been avoided. Peter L Tann,

FT  30 JAN 93 / Leading Article: A hint of nostalgia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER TUESDAY'S surprise cuts in bank base rates from 7 to 6 per cent,
Britain is enjoying the lowest nominal short term interest rates for 15
years. The comparison is evocative. In 1977 the country was perceived to
have an appalling balance of payments problem, a huge burden of public
sector debt and a banking system that was struggling under the impact of a
property market crash. Plus ca change. Yet with hindsight the gloom was
hopelessly overdone.
The balance of payments was necessarily in deficit in the 1970s, as
investment built up in the development of North Sea oil. Despite all the
talk of strikes by investors in the gilt market, the Bank of England
demonstrated an unexpected flair for marketing 57 varieties of government
IOU. In the event, the late 1970s turned out to be that rare thing, a period
of successful export-led growth, which came just as the world was about to
make the transition from inflation to disinflation. Could the early 1990s
also turn out to be better than they felt at the time?
The case is easier to make than a spate of gloomy recent economic statistics
might suggest. As in the late '70s, the high current account deficit is in
part a reflection of high business investment. Instead of North Sea oil,
Britain now has inward Japanese investment, especially in the motor
industry, which is only beginning to build up export impetus. And it is
possible to detect a silver lining even in Thursday's dismal trade figures,
since the buoyancy of imports owes much to the investment-related inflow of
intermediate and capital goods, which are up 15 per cent and 10 per cent
respectively on the year.
Poor response
As for the government's funding position, it is clearly uncomfortable, even
in a world now largely devoid of exchange controls. Estimates for the public
sector borrowing requirement in 1993-94 range upwards from Pounds 50bn,
while total annual institutional cash flow, most of which normally goes into
equities, is a little under Pounds 50bn. The poor response to the
government's gilt-edged auction this week carried a notable echo of the
1970s. Yet if the government confronts an investors' strike, its wounds are
partly self-inflicted: it persists in applying the so-called full funding
rule, whereby the PSBR has to be financed entirely from outside the banking
sector.
A safe prediction for 1993 is that this funding rule will prove no more
durable than the government's commitment to the Exchange Rate Mechanism. And
it would make sense to be rid of it sooner rather than later. The threat of
inflation, on which the rationale for the rule rests, is greatly overstated
in the government's rhetoric when its own figures show that the broad M4
definition of money actually shrank in December and dropped out of its 4-8
per cent monitoring range.
Strict proviso
In an economy that has suffered two years of shrinking output, the need for
further cuts in interest rates is blindingly obvious. Even after the recent
weakness of sterling, the exchange rate is still less competitive than in
the second half of the 1970s. And by offering a steeper yield curve, whereby
short gilt rates are substantially below long rates, the government would be
offering the banks a means of recapitalising themselves by making low risk
profits, just as the US banks have done.
Encouraging banks to buy gilts would not only stop the shrinkage in broad
money, since reduced sales of gilts to the non-bank institutions would lead
to more deposits in the banking system; it would also give a fillip to bonds
and equities, thereby reducing the cost of capital to industry and commerce.
There is, however, one vital respect in which this rosy scenario remains
strictly conditional. In the 1970s the International Monetary Fund was there
to impose a tight fiscal embrace on the Labour government. Today, although
the PSBR is heading for comparable magnitudes as a percentage of GNP, the
IMF is absent. This matters, because if export-led growth is not to run into
a balance of payments constraint and, ultimately, a renewed upsurge in
inflation, the government has to rebalance policy to ensure that aggressive
monetary relaxation is matched by a courageous fiscal policy designed to
address the structural element of the budget deficit. Nothing, alas, in the
recent record suggests that the government is up to the task.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Leading Article: The committee and the colliers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GIVEN THAT it only had 90 days to complete its work, the select committee's
report on the coal industry is a thorough enough analysis of a tortuous
subject. Possibly more important, it strives to be free of political bias,
which means that Mr Michael Heseltine will be obliged to take it seriously
as he formulates his own proposals for next month's White Paper.
That is a pity, because the package of subsidies and other regulatory
measures which the MPs propose is greatly in excess of what is required to
bring sense to the UK energy scene. If fully implemented they would add to
the thick layers of aid and protection which have been granted over the
years. Who can believe yet another promise that one last heave will get a
state-owned British Coal up on its commercial feet?
A simple example illustrates this: the report not only recommends a
five-year subsidy programme costing up to Pounds 500m to enable
British-mined coal to compete with imports. It also suggests that
electricity distribution companies be obliged to buy power generated from
domestic coal on pain of losing their licence. If the proposed level of
subsidy is sufficient to make British coal competitive, why this second
measure? Answer: because no-one really believes the figures.
Other adjustments
The report's 39 recommendations reveal unwillingness to face the facts that
stared the government in the face when it proposed to cut coal last autumn.
Tinkering with one part of the energy market merely creates a need for
compensating adjustments all down the line. There is also a worrisome
proposal that the electricity industry regulator should have the power 'to
consider the legitimate long-term interests of indigenous fuel producers' -
another open invitation to allow producers to inflict higher than necessary
costs upon UK industry and consumers.
All this suggests that while the overt subsidy may amount to Pounds 500m (a
relatively small figure compared with many that have been mentioned), the
hidden costs in perpetuating the present arrangements will be much higher.
It is disingenuous of the committee to claim that the cost can be borne by
redirecting the proceeds of the levy which subsidises the nuclear industry.
This device would only throw nuclear's costs on to the Treasury and thus the
taxpayer.
Since, however, the political realities make subsidy inevitable there is
some comfort to be drawn from the committee's desire at least to limit
financial support for British Coal in size as well as time. The continuation
of subsidies would be linked to progress in cost-cutting - though the report
does not spell out how this would work, nor what would happen if British
Coal fell behind its targets.
Sense of realism
The committee has also wisely resisted the temptation to cut back the
natural gas industry, having failed to discover decisive evidence in the
arguments of the coal lobby that gas is much costlier than coal. In
addition, it has left the capacity of the nuclear power industry untouched,
believing that the nuclear review which the government has already promised
should be allowed to run its course, albeit next year rather than in 1994.
There is also realism in the committee's refusal to recommend barriers
against imports, though it does nurse hopes that government can do something
to reverse the flow of electricity from France through the Channel link.
This sits ill with the leading role that Britain is playing in trying to
open up and liberalise the EC's single market in energy.
The political importance of the report is that it tells Mr Heseltine the
number of jobs and pits the House of Commons expects him to save. He should
counter this offer with a proposal for wholly transparent subsidies, a
tighter timetable, and as few as possible ancillary controls.
He should also pick up the committee's anxieties about the duopolistic
tendencies of PowerGen and National Power, which resulted from a flawed
privatisation and which will in the end need to be countered either by
firmer regulation or break-up. But above all, Mr Heseltine should announce
that British Coal will join the private sector and be subsidy-free by the
next election in 1996-97.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Life gets tougher at the top: The exodus of bosses signals a
crisis in big companies and a new willingness by owners to act
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN

<TEXT>
Here's the bad news: big, old-established companies everywhere face a slow,
long-drawn out crisis, from which many will not recover. Here's the good
news: in English-speaking countries, at least, those companies' owners are
now refusing to take the crisis lying down.
Together, these facts lie behind the abrupt departures this week of bosses
at IBM and Westinghouse in the US, Lasmo in Britain, and Canada's
PetroCanada, and a string of recent resignations in big companies, ranging
from the UK's British Petroleum to Australia's Westpac, General Motors in
the US, and Canada's Royal Trust.
The crisis of the large corporation creates an urgent need for change at the
top; a revolutionary change in the attitudes of investors - and of the
non-executive directors who represent them - is what makes the change
possible.
Big companies are in crisis for a host of reasons. One is, simply, age: most
developed-country economies are still dominated by the companies that first
achieved national leadership in their markets a century ago. They are
managed on a model which dates back to Alfred Sloan's General Motors.
A corporate culture with its roots in the 19th century is thus, in many
companies, combined with a management structure that dates back to the
1920s. Not surprisingly, many such businesses cannot cope with a wave of
pressing problems:
Global competition is now a reality in many sectors, spelling an end to
protected domestic markets and safe, reliable profits.
The lean production system, pioneered by Japanese car makers, requires a
complete transformation of manufacturing and distribution techniques - and
may in time pose a similar challenge to service-sector companies as well.
The microprocessor wipes out the competitive advantages of companies relying
on (or selling) older generations of computing equipment. More generally,
today's vast, cheap information flows make the traditional management
hierarchies of large companies obsolete.
Economies of scale, the solid foundation on which big companies have based
their dominance for decades, may no longer be an overwhelming advantage.
Changes in information technology, in the financial system, in flexible
production techniques, in the growth of companies offering all-comers the
distribution and support systems which previously only the largest companies
could afford - all these are nibbling away at the advantages of economies of
scale. The diseconomies of scale - communications overheads, inflexibility,
the not-invented-here syndrome  - are becoming increasingly clear.
In the long run, these problems may prove more than many old-line companies
can cope with. Their owners are increasingly unwilling to accept that as
inevitable, however. In the English-speaking business world, their
unhappiness is starting to have a clear impact on the executive suite.
This week, for example, John Akers stepped down as chief executive of IBM;
James Robinson left the same job at American Express; Paul Lego went as
chief executive of Westinghouse; Chris Greentree resigned as chief executive
of Britain's Lasmo; and PetroCanada's chief executive, Wilbert Hopper, was
'relieved of responsibilities'.
In the UK alone, the past year has seen some 25 British senior executives
leaving their companies unexpectedly, usually under the pressure of poor
corporate performance. In the US, where the cult of the 'imperial' chief
executive had left many bosses in impregnable positions, the number of
departures has speeded up recently.
The pattern was set, last year, by the resignation of Robert Stempel as
chairman and chief executive of General Motors, perhaps the most ossified of
America's industrial dinosaurs. Others are departing in his footsteps.
What has brought about this new lack of tolerance for poor performance, on
the part of investors and corporate boards?
From the investors' point of view, the past few years have produced growing
dissatisfaction with the traditional remedies for poor corporate
performance. Takeovers once provided a possible exit, but they have largely
dried up. Market forces are not the only cause for this: in the US, legal
changes have slightly tilted the balance of advantage towards a defending
company. In any case investors feel a lingering regret over some of the
takeovers they have allowed.
Simply selling the shares, the other traditional remedy, is also seen as
less attractive. A growing recognition, on the part of many shareholders,
that they are locked into holding a stake in the biggest companies has made
them more interested in obtaining the best performance from those companies.
Although in principle investors have more freedom of choice over shares in
medium-sized or small companies, in practice they feel just as trapped, said
one UK institutional fund manager this week, by the lack of liquidity in
such stocks. Selling out a significant stake becomes unthinkable, because to
try to do so would move the price too far against you.
That has led investors to try harder to influence the companies of which
they are shareholders. Just as important, corporate boards are starting to
respond.
The mechanisms are different on the two sides of the Atlantic. In the UK,
the intimate, clubby nature of the City has always allowed investing
institutions to keep in touch with each other informally. They have
traditionally preferred to exercise influence in the same way, over lunch or
drinks with directors. Now, though, there is a growing tendency to act
through letters or meetings with the company.
Institutions still prefer to act individually, rather than as members of a
group, but the cumulative effect of a series of such meetings can be
powerful. And power is closely concentrated: a survey of top corporate
pension funds by the 100 Group of finance directors showed that six external
money managers and five internal managers handle 55 per cent of their funds.
Because the typical British company has a non-executive chairman, there is
an obvious point of contact for investors wishing to complain about the
performance of the chief executive. In the US, where a big company's
chairman is usually also its chief executive, it has been harder for
investors to find an independent but influential figure to complain to.
There have traditionally been other disincentives for action in the US. The
legal structure was for a long time tilted against shareholder action, both
because managers were allowed wide freedom of action under corporate law and
because large shareholders were legally discouraged from circulating
material to each other about a company. A much less concentrated money
management industry than in the UK, geographically scattered and divided
between incompatible private-sector and public-sector camps, was also unable
to bring influence to bear successfully.
Many of these factors seem to be changing. First, says Martin Lipton, of
Wachtell, Lipton, the US corporate law firm, institutions have shifted their
attention from the mechanics of corporate governance towards basic
performance. This has given them much greater impact, because whereas the
previous area of debate - about whether companies should be allowed to erect
takeover barriers, for example - allowed plenty of scope for honest
disagreement, the new one is much less ambiguous. It is hard to disagree,
for example, with complaints about the management of a company which loses
nearly Dollars 5bn, as IBM did last year.
Money management is becoming more concentrated, and some of the biggest
funds, such as Calpers, the California state employees' pension funds, are
starting to take a more intimate interest in the companies in which they
invest. The legal framework has also shifted, in part to respond to
complaints that unfettered company bosses are paying themselves too much
money. The Securities and Exchange Commission has allowed shareholders to
communicate more freely, and the judiciary in Delaware, where most big
American companies are registered, has been emphasising the duty of the
board to keep management under review. Directors are starting to worry that
they may face shareholder class-action suits if they fail in this duty.
As a result, non-executive directors have been fumbling towards a mechanism
that allows them to respond to complaints from shareholders. The typical
pattern is for a leading non-executive member of the board - perhaps a
retired chief executive from another big company - to take the lead, perhaps
by obtaining the chairmanship of a committee specially set up to watch over
incumbent management. He or she may orchestrate the departure of the chief
executive, and will then head the search for a replacement, perhaps standing
in as chairman for an interim period.
At one stage, the UK's Cadbury committee on corporate governance seemed
about to institutionalise such a role at those British companies where the
chief executive is also the chairman. In its final report last year, it
stepped back from this suggestion, but continued to emphasise the
desirability of a non-executive chairman. Institutions now seem inclined to
demand this of every company where there is a problem with earnings.
US chief executives have the choice of two possible responses to the wave of
executive departures, says Professor Jay Lorsch of Harvard Business School.
The better ones will welcome greater accountability, restructuring their
boards to accommodate it. Others will try to control their boards more
tightly.
In the short run, that may help them keep their jobs. But in the long run,
there is probably no alternative to embracing the new era, and facing up to
the crisis of the corporation. It can be done: one of the oldest-established
companies of them all, General Electric of the US, has reinvented itself
over the past decade. Its chairman, Jack Welch, has transformed everything
from its mix of businesses to its day-to-day operating procedures.
But GE is in many ways an exception, and the stock market knows it. Shares
in the 10 largest US manufacturing companies, measured by sales, have
underperformed the rest of corporate America by 22 per cent in the past
decade. As long as this pattern continues, the crisis of the corporation
will be a boardroom crisis, too.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Small business doubts over banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and Our Regional Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OWNERS OF small businesses appear confident that banks will pass on in full
Tuesday's reduction in base rates of 1 percentage point. Yet they remain
concerned about the willingness of banks to provide finance for an economic
upturn.
The accounts of the two thirds of business customers who borrow at rates
tied to the base rate were adjusted with immediate effect, the main banks
said, though customers will not see the impact until they receive their
statements. The 1 per cent reduction was being passed on in full.
Mr Clifford Blake, chairman and managing director of Metal Spinners Group, a
Newcastle upon Tyne manufacturer of metal components, said he believed the
banks would pass on the cut in full.
The company, which has turnover of Pounds 8m and 110 employees, said its
bank had been applying tougher lending criteria.
Some businesses say they are suffering from banks' refusal to lend to
certain sectors. Eagletrans, a Middlesbrough-based transport company with
Pounds 1m turnover, has had to manage without a bank overdraft. It has grown
by using finance houses to fund the purchase of vehicles, making repayments
from retained profits. 'As far as the banks are concerned we've got
leprosy,' said Mr Gordon Mitchell, managing director. 'I don't think unless
I signed my life away they'd be interested in giving me an overdraft.'
At Caldene Autoland car showrooms in Tipton, West Midlands, general sales
manager Mr Anthony Randall has sold 55 new cars this month, 23 more than his
January target. 'We are the victims of our own success,' he said. Tight
control of overdrafts made it difficult to obtain extra cash to restock.
Accountants confirmed that their clients had problems raising finance. Mr
Charles Hatton, a partner in Moore Stephens at Southport, Merseyside, with
more than 100 small corporate clients, said: 'The only companies the banks
will lend to nowadays are those which don't need it. Those which do are
still finding it very difficult indeed.'
Banks will typically lend only 50 per cent of fixed asset values and 30 per
cent of money owed by customers, said Mr Charles Burton of the Bradford
office of Haines Watts. This compared with 70 per cent and 50 per cent
respectively before the recession began.
Declining property values have meant the actual money available is even less
than first appears when compared with 1989 benchmarks.

FT  30 JAN 93 / MPs give Soley bill on press second reading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIVATE member's bill introduced by Labour MP Mr Clive Soley which seeks
to establish an independent press authority for newspapers and periodicals
was given a second reading by 119 votes to 15 in the Commons yesterday.
The bill, which aims to secure 'due accuracy', has only a remote chance of
reaching the statute book because of the number and scope of amendments that
have to be considered during the line-by-line committee stage.
In response to questions at a press conference Mr Soley, MP for Hammersmith,
warned newspaper editors that unless they co-operated in getting 'something
like my bill' on the statute book they risked legislation on privacy without
any counter-balancing measure on press freedom.
Mr Soley also underlined his willingness to accept amendments supporting
press freedom.
The bill was described as 'premature and misconceived' by Mr Robert Key, the
junior heritage minister.
He nevertheless reaffirmed the government's dissatisfaction with the
existing Press Complaints Commission. Mr Key made clear that ministerial
reluctance to establish a statutory regulatory body, as recommended by Sir
David Calcutt in his recent report, did not mean that it had been ruled out.
The government will take into account press response to Sir David's
criticisms and the views expressed in the debate on the bill and in the
forthcoming report by the Commons heritage committee on privacy and media
intrusion before reaching conclusions about a statutory regulatory body.
Earlier Mr John Major, the prime minister, said his decision to issue writs
for libel against two magazines concerning reports about his private life
had not affected his decision not to support the bill.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Pounds 100m relocation approved for MoD purchasing unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the biggest job relocations in the UK has been approved by the
Ministry of Defence which is building to the north of Bristol a new
headquarters for its military equipment purchasing arm.
The Defence Procurement Executive is responsible for spending more than
Pounds 9bn a year for the three armed services and operates from 'dozens of
offices' in southern England.
The ministry said it will be more efficient to house the operations in a
single development. The new headquarters will house 5,500 staff, of whom
about 1,000 are expected to be recruited locally. The headquarters of 10
buildings is expected to cost more than Pounds 100m to build.
Mr Jonathan Aiken, minister for defence procurement, said: 'This ambitious
project will provide not only a considerable stimulus to the local economy
but also for the hard pressed construction industry which will be competing
for the work.' The Bristol region, which has strong aerospace industry
links, has seen unemployment rise sharply as demand from civil aviation and
defence industries has fallen. Unemployment in the region was close to 10
per cent at the end of last year. Mr Richard Workman, development control
officer for Northavon District Council, where the new headquarters will be
situated, said: 'The two largest employers in the area are British Aerospace
and Rolls-Royce. We are delighted to have been given this opportunity to
create new jobs to replace those which have been lost.'
A further 1,500 jobs are likely to be created during construction, which is
expected to start this spring and be completed by autumn 1995.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Major backs 'merchant venturers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR has found a fresh theme this week: the importance of
exporting.
Returning to London yesterday after a six-day trip to India and the Middle
East, the prime minister was looking a little pleased with himself.
Accompanied by a team of businessmen, he had spoken repeatedly of the need
to boost overseas sales and had been rewarded with a defence sales agreement
with Saudi Arabia worth between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 5bn and several
smaller deals in India and Oman.
Mr Major told industrialists that Britain's economic prosperity hung on
their future export successes. The government and industry, he said, must
ensure Britain takes advantage of sterling's devaluation - and not, as so
often in the past, blow its chance of building economic growth on export
sales. 'We need merchant venturers, not merchants of gloom,' he said last
night in Glasgow.
The businessmen travelling with Mr Major were impressed. He spent much of
his time discussing their individual clashes with Indian regulations and won
praise for his efforts to open doors in government.
The emphasis on exports marks a shift in Whitehall. In the past both the
Treasury and Mr Major have emphasised the need for a revival in consumer
confidence. In Delhi, however, Mr Major said: 'Export growth will lead our
recovery.'
At first it appeared a throwaway comment. But it seemed by the end of the
week that Mr Major was moving towards believing recovery has to be built on
investment and export growth.
The genesis of the remark was the Downing Street Policy Unit's new year
summit on domestic issues. By the year 2000, Mr Major argues, Britain will
have to broaden its manufacturing base and increase competitiveness in
middle and leading-edge technologies. 'Soft' markets such as India are
becoming manufacturers in their own right.
Mr Major says there has to be a 'new language' between industry and the
government and an end to prejudice against manufacturing and engineering.
The change is more about mood than prescription. Mr Major will take a
delegation to Japan later this year; he will listen to the Confederation of
British Industry more; he will mount another Whitehall offensive against
unnecessary regulation and he has promised a further review of
state-supported export credit insurance, even though the Treasury's
provision was increased in the Autumn Statement.
Back in Westminster, however, Mr Major could find the debates on coal,
Maastricht and the costs of 3m unemployed pushing the detailed concerns of
exporters from his immediate priorities.
Industry will be looking for much more than public relations-driven export
promotion. The CBI wants more favourable Export Credit Guarantee Department
premiums. It says UK companies should not, for instance, be paying more than
French counterparts.
Conservative MPs will want the right economic levers pulled to end recession
as early as possible. Tax rises would be politically difficult. Overseas
sales may be important but it was, after all, to boost consumer and investor
confidence that interest rates were cut this week.
And it would be churlish of a prime minister to complain that growth, when
it resumes, was the wrong sort of recovery.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Growing appetite for imports worries economists: Concern
over the trade gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK'S news that imports rose to record levels in December has prompted
the usual hand-wringing among economists.
How can it be, they ask, that after more than two years of recession the UK
has been unable to curtail its appetite for imported goods.
They argue that the answer apparently lies in deep-rooted structural
problems afflicting the economy. Sterling's devaluation may give a boost to
exports in the short term, but is not enough to cure the country's addiction
to imports in the long run.
'The UK has a chronic problem that isn't going to be solved by devaluation,'
says Mr Kevin Gardiner, an economist at SG Warburg. 'If we don't produce
motorbikes, vacuum cleaners and fridges in the first place, simply chopping
15 per cent off the exchange rate is not going to solve the problem.'
The latest figures bear this out. In December the visible trade gap widened
to Pounds 1.74bn, its highest level for 2 1/2 years. Last year the UK
imported Pounds 120.55bn of foreign goods, but exported goods worth only
Pounds 106.77bn. The shortfall was only partially alleviated by a surplus of
Pounds 1.95bn on invisible items such as financial services, advertising,
dividends and tourism, supposedly the strong point of UK exports.
The volume of exports is expected to increase in the next few months as UK
goods benefit from the devaluation, but the consensus among economists is
that the deficit on the current account will deteriorate further this year.
Historically recessions have depressed the inflow of imports as demand for
foreign goods has slackened. In previous economic downturns the decline in
manufacturing output has been more or less mirrored by a decline in
manufacturing imports.
In the third quarter of 1975, for example, manufacturing output fell by 11.1
per cent on the previous year, while manufacturing imports excluding oil and
erratic items fell by 12.2 per cent. In the first quarter of 1981 output
fell by 13.2 per cent and imports by 15.7 per cent.
This time imports have risen even before output has stopped falling. In the
first quarter of last year manufacturing output fell by 2 per cent, but
manufacturing imports rose by 5 per cent. In the fourth quarter the volume
of manufacturing imports rose by 9.5 per cent year-on-year while
manufacturing output is estimated to have been roughly flat.
Mr Gardiner believes the UK's inability to close the trade deficit is rooted
in gaps in the manufactured product range of the home market. The fact that
imports are rising as a percentage of GDP could reflect an 'acceleration in
the rate at which UK manufacturers yield market share to foreign supply'.
According to Mr Douglas McWilliams, chief executive of the Centre for
Economics and Business Research, the balance of payments prospects will
continue to be affected by lack of manufacturing capacity.
A study carried out by the centre shows that the UK's manufacturing capacity
grew by 19 per cent between 1970 and 1990, compared with growth of 43 per
cent in the other three larger European economies - Germany, France and
Italy - 86 per cent in the US and 129 per cent in Japan.
He said: 'Although there is substantial evidence that the quality of UK
manufacturing is much improved, the small size of the base means that rates
of GDP growth in the mid-1990s much above 2.5 per cent would land the UK
back in serious balance of payments difficulties.'
Perhaps the most worrying aspect of the penchant for foreign goods is that
rises in imports have occurred in almost every industrial sector.
Import volumes of iron and steel, for example, have risen by about 50 per
cent since 1985, while imports of electrical goods have doubled. Clothing
and footwear imports have also doubled since 1985.
It may be that the government is edging towards an 'industrial strategy'
that could eventually improve the UK's trade performance. This week's trade
figures coincided with a trip by Mr John Major, the prime minister, to India
and the Middle East, which he used to drum up business. In the Autumn
Statement the government increased export credit for potentially fast
growing markets.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Fall forecast in public investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLIC SECTOR investment is set to fall in real terms in the 1993-94
financial year in spite of government pledges to protect capital spending,
figures released by the Treasury showed yesterday.
According to the Treasury's statistical supplement to last November's Autumn
Statement, asset creation in the public sector - the broadest measure of
public-sector investment - will fall by an inflation-adjusted 2.32 per cent
in the coming financial year compared with 1992-93. In cash terms,
public-asset creation is due to rise to Pounds 30.4bn this year from Pounds
30.31bn.
The fall in real terms largely reflects a sharp increase of Pounds 898m in
projected investment by the government this year compared with earlier plans
following the announcement in the Autumn Statement of its Pounds 750m
programme to buy houses.
However, the figures brought a sharp response from Labour. Ms Harriet
Harman, shadow chief secretary, said they showed that Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, had not kept promises made in the autumn statement to protect
public investment.
The supplement revised upwards slightly the government forecast of the
1992-93 public-expenditure planning total to Pounds 226.5bn from Pounds
226.1bn in the Autumn Statement.
It also showed that Britons living in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales
gain more from government spending than those in England in spite of a
narrowing of regional differences in economic activity and unemployment
since the start of the recession.
The government spent Pounds 4,191 per head of population in Northern Ireland
in 1991-92 against Pounds 3,506 in Scotland and Pounds 3,268 in Wales.
Expenditure per head in England was below the Pounds 3,060 national average
at Pounds 2,963.
England accounted for 81 per cent of identifiable general government
expenditure, a reflection of its larger population and economic importance.
Scotland had 10 per cent against 5 per cent for Wales and Ulster's 4 per
cent.
Tentative figures for government spending in the English regions showed that
the north-west had the highest per head expenditure, followed by the north
and south-east. East Anglia obtained less in government spending per head
than other regions.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Drug companies warned of south-east skill shortage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURERS of pharmaceuticals in south-east England face skill shortages
in spite of the recession, says a report to be published next week.
It says some companies in Hertfordshire are finding it difficult to recruit
people with appropriate skills, training and experience, though the
companies insist there is no recruitment crisis.
The report from South East Economic Strategy, a research group, concentrates
on Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham, Merck and Roche, which plan to increase their
total staff in the county from 5,500 to 8,000 by the mid 1990s. Glaxo, which
is building a Pounds 500m research and development centre in Stevenage,
believes it may face difficulties in finding people with good A-levels and
post-doctoral qualifications in chemistry.
The study estimates that 10 per cent of senior managers and post-doctoral
scientists employed in the sector come from Hertfordshire. This compares
with half of the technicians and all the clerical and manual workers.
The shortage has been caused by declining numbers of young people and less
interest in science.
Only 12 per cent of pupils taking A-level and GCSE science examinations had
any interest in employment in the sector.
Glaxo executives say this is because local schools have tended to teach
engineering-orientated subjects rather than chemistry. Many pupils have been
potential recruits for the aerospace industry, a large local employer.
A decline in engineering companies in the county does not mean redundant
engineers can switch into the pharmaceuticals industry, warns the report.
The local workforce is highly skilled, but not necessarily in the right
areas.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Smoking report's research attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPRESENTATIVES of the advertising and tobacco industries yesterday
condemned as fallacious and inadequately researched a government report that
says tobacco advertising plays a significant role in encouraging people to
smoke, Gary Mead writes.
The criticism came from the Advertising Association and the Tobacco Advisory
Council, which represents the main tobacco manufacturers.
In its response to the report the association said it had used invalid
evidence and had ignored international research that contradicted the
report's conclusions. It said the report:
'Reviewed only a small fraction of the evidence on the subject of the effect
of tobacco advertising on tobacco consumption.'
'Ignores the extensive literature relating to the basic question of how
advertising actually works.'
'Arrives at sweeping and unjustified conclusions based on a limited and
incomplete review of the available evidence.'
The association quoted a 1984 World Health Organisation study of smoking
behaviour among schoolchildren in Norway and Finland, where tobacco
advertising was banned, and Austria and the UK, where it was not. It
concluded: 'A difference (in smoking habits) might have been expected. No
such systematic differences are found'.
The Tobacco Advisory Council suggested in its response that the generally
accepted view of researchers was that children who smoked became aware of
advertising, while children who did not smoke ignored it.
In the UK about Pounds 60m annually is spent on tobacco advertising in the
press and on posters.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Bill on independent press body wins second reading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PRIVATE member's bill seeking to establish an independent press authority
to secure 'due accuracy' by newspapers and periodicals was given a second
reading by 119 votes to 15 in the Commons yesterday.
The bill was described as 'premature and misconceived' by Mr Robert Key, the
junior heritage minister, and a procedural manoeuvre by some Conservative
backbenchers to block its progress was defeated by 129 votes to 11.
Mr Clive Soley, Labour MP for Hammersmith and chief sponsor of the bill,
underlined his willingness to accept amendments supporting press freedom
when appealing for co-operation from newspaper editors at a press conference
after the debate.
The bill has only a remote chance of reaching the statute book because of
the number and scope of amendments that have to be considered during the
line-by-line committee stage.
The government's dissatisfaction with the existing Press Complaints
Commission was reaffirmed by Mr Key, who made it clear that ministerial
reluctance to establish a statutory regulatory body, as recommended by Sir
David Calcutt in his recent report, did not mean it had been ruled out.
The government will take into account press response to Sir David's
criticisms and the views expressed in the debate on the bill and in the
forthcoming report by the Commons heritage committee on privacy and media
intrusion before reaching conclusions about a statutory regulatory body.
In response to questions at the press conference Mr Soley warned newspaper
editors that unless they co-operated in getting 'something like my bill' on
the statute book they risked legislation on privacy without any
counter-balancing measure on press freedom.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Short moves closer to millionaire status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEONARD BARDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIGEL SHORT will be on the brink of becoming Britain's first chess
millionaire today when he sits at the board for his 13th game against Jan
Timman, the Dutch champion.
Originally Kasparov had planned to defend his title in August in Los Angeles
with a Dollars 4m prize fund, but backers were not interested in a series
between two Europeans.
The International Chess Federation has re-opened bidding for the prize fund.
Chess organisers in Barcelona say that city will bid Dollars 4m, while
Jakarta may offer a still higher figure. Berlin and the Spanish university
town of Santiago de Compostela are also in contention. Bids must be
submitted to the federation by February 8.
In most cases the city authorities would be heavily involved in financing
the prize money, seeking private sponsorship to help fund the event and
regarding its spending as an investment in a higher international profile
and an increased number of visitors.
Statistical forecasts based on ratings say Kasparov would win, but Short
would collect the three eighths of the prize fund that goes to the loser. He
would add this to the Pounds 35,000 for beating Karpov and Pounds 80,000 for
eliminating Timman.
Business sponsorship of chess has declined. City institutions such as
Grieveson Grant; UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the London investment banking arm of
Union Bank of Switzerland; and Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, have
dropped out since their mergers into bigger groups. The Greater London
Council sponsored an international event in London in 1986, but was itself
abolished soon afterwards.
There is still City sponsorship - from Lloyds Bank, Leigh Interests, and
Duncan Lawrie, the private bank - as well as from the East Sussex town of
Hastings, which holds a tournament every year.
Declining sponsorship has left leading players struggling for a living. Mr
Peter Wells, 27, an Oxford economics graduate and head of the British Chess
Academy, which represents young professionals, says: 'There are too many
players chasing too little money and in European opens we now have to
contend with a huge influx of ex-Soviets.'
Players rely on coaching, writing books and European league games to
survive. Mr Wells adds: 'Our only real hope is that the economy will improve
and that there will be a spin-off from Nigel's match with Kasparov.'

quangos - rose last year, the Cabinet Office said yesterday.
The number of quangos outside the health service, such as the Universities
Funding Council and the London Docklands Development Corporation, was 1,412
in April 1992, a drop of 32. However the number of health-service bodies
rose from 351 to 510 as a result of the creation of NHS trusts. Including
Training and Enterprise Councils, and Local Enterprise Councils in Scotland,

FT  30 JAN 93 / Decline in moves from London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of companies moving out of central London fell by a third last
year because of the recession and oversupply in the office market, according
to a report on decentralisation by Jones Lang Wootton, chartered surveyors,
Vanessa Houlder writes.
The report found that:
Only 14 organisations plan to relocate from central London in the next four
years.
In 1992, 23 organisations and 10,938 jobs moved out of central London. That
compares with nearly 14,000 jobs and 30 companies in 1991.
Property cost savings remain the most important motive for moving out of
central London. However their importance is diminishing as a result of the
narrowing of rent differentials between central London and suburban office
markets.
Companies are moving longer distances to achieve greater cost savings. Only
35 per cent of moving companies stayed in the south-east in 1992, compared
with 79 per cent between 1983 and 1991.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Miners at odds with view of TUC: Unions attack report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE report was cautiously welcomed by the Trades Union Congress and heartily
denounced by all the miners' unions, indicating that the labour movement's
unified approach to the campaign against pit closures may come under strain.
Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, the
biggest mining union, said the report was 'unacceptable' and failed to deal
with the central issues.
Mr Neil Greatrex, leader of the smaller Union of Democratic Mineworkers
which is not affiliated to the TUC, also said he was 'bitterly
disappointed'. He added: 'Obviously there are parts of the report we like,
such as the fact that all pits should go through the review procedure, but
we believe that all 31 pits (initially marked for closure) should be saved.'
It was unfair to penalise pits where the UDM was the main union. Those pits
had less room for productivity improvements now because of greater
flexibility in the past few years.
The NUM will be backed in its opposition by the RMT, the main rail union.
The RMT has just been told that a further 2,000 rail jobs are to go before
March in addition to the 5,000 announced in November.
The TUC, and large unions such as the TGWU and GMB general unions, gave
their qualified support to the report. Mr Norman Willis, TUC general
secretary, said: 'The select committee are to be congratulated on providing
a helpful report which opens the way forward'.
BACM, the pit managers' union, also welcomed the report.
The Coalfield Communities Campaign, which involves community groups and
local authorities in the affected areas and opposes the closures described
as 'excellent' the suggestion that the nuclear levy should be paid into a
fund rather than to Nuclear Electric.
Mr Ian Powe, director of said the Gas Consumers Council, said: 'A subsidy is
good news for miners and gas consumers alike. A bigger market for coal will
slow down the depletion of precious UK gas reserves.
British Gas said: 'The report is extremely detailed and constructive and
will add greatly to the debate. We must however await the government
recommendations before responding in detail.'

FT  30 JAN 93 / A pit waits for release from months of misery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FATE of Westoe Colliery at South Shields, Tyne and Wear, and its 1,120
miners hung in suspense yesterday.
Powerloader Mr Jimmy Gallagher and his workmates wanted, above all, to know
whether their colliery has a future.
They have endured three months of uncertainty and oscillating morale since
their pit appeared on the October closure list.
As they drank mugs of tea in the canteen, waiting for the 2.30pm cage to
take them underground for their hour-long journey to the coal face - six
kilometres out under the North Sea - their prospects were as unclear as
before the release of the eagerly awaited select committee report.
Mr Gallagher, 35, who has worked at Westoe for 20 years, said: 'Men don't
know if they're coming or going.'
Mr Davy Graham, a 49-year-old powerloader with 33 years service at Westoe,
said: 'What we want to know is, when are they going to put us out of our
misery?'
Westoe's coal goes to Yorkshire region power stations, so transport costs
put it at a disadvantage against pits in that region.
It was ranked 20th economically out of the 21 threatened pits in last week's
John T. Boyd report. Westoe miners dispute the report's calculations,
arguing their pit has produced an operating surplus each year, except one,
since the mid-1980s and has 60m tonnes of known reserves.
The men were gloomy yesterday about Westoe's survival chances and about
their prospects of working again. South Tyneside is already joint first, at
19.7 per cent, in mainland Britain's unemployment league. Its male jobless
rate is 28.2 per cent and 40 per cent of its unemployed have been out of
work for more than a year.
In this context Westoe's miners are an elite - well-paid men, most of whom
have never been on the dole. Most laughed when asked about their chances of
finding another job.
There was confusion among them over whether the Commons trade and industry
committee's recommended subsidy was for 16m or 19m tonnes. The former figure
would probably damn Westoe. The latter figure offers a meagre shred of hope.
Political lobbying will be crucial.

FT  30 JAN 93 / The coal spectre Thatcher failed to banish: Benefit of wider
market 'outweighs costs'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COAL is an industry that has haunted the Conservatives for more than two
decades. Baroness Thatcher thought she had banished the spectre after her
crushing victory over the miners in 1985. Mr John Major discovered to his
cost last autumn that she had not. Now his government is preparing to pay
the price.
The precise response of the cabinet to yesterday's report from the Commons
trade and industry committee will not be determined until next week. Mr
Major will read the report before chairing a meeting on Monday of the
cabinet committee charged with drafting the white paper.
Senior ministers say there are still battles to be fought over what has
become for some in the cabinet a fight for the government's soul: between
the free market ideology of the 1980s and the lame duck interventionism
which preceded it.
But, fierce though it is, the debate will affect only at the margin the
outcome of the review. The committee, a cross-party group of backbench MPs,
said the market for coal should be expanded by 16m tonnes a year until 1998,
financed by a diminishing state subsidy.
If it is not to be defeated at Westminster, the government must now come up
with a plan which will persuade the Conservative members of the committee -
and the 30 or so more militant Tory opponents of pit closures - that it has
responded in good faith.
The right in the cabinet - among them Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary
to the Treasury, and Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary  - have staked
out a position which would limit the enlargement of the market to a maximum
of 12m tonnes. The subsidy would run for 3 rather than 5 years. It would be
slightly less per tonne than that suggested by Mr Michael Heseltine, the
trade and industry secretary.
For his part Mr Heseltine wants a formula that can be seen both to make some
economic sense and to be fairly certain of convincing the Tory back benches.
His starting point is that the ideologists have chosen the wrong
battleground.
The present arrangements for the electricity market already provide in
effect for a subsidy of Pounds 1bn a year. If the government did nothing,
that would fall to about Pounds 350m next year. So the issue is not whether
the industry should be propped up next year but how much more the government
should spend above the Pounds 350m already committed.
Mr Heseltine is aware also that the only rational argument that can be made
for an additional subsidy is that it would provide a breathing space in
which British Coal could become competitive. The case would be undercut
decisively by too small a subsidy for too short a period.
Mr Major's focus is on a Tory majority of 21 and on the risk that a further
row over coal could again sour the political mood and sap confidence in
economic recovery. The judgment that will be crucial for him will be that of
Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip. It will be Mr Ryder's job to tell Mr Major
what is necessary to reduce the number of Tory rebels to comfortably below
10 and to take coal off the political agenda until after the next election.
The 30-strong Tory group opposed to the original closure plan has told Mr
Ryder that the price of its support is the rescue of at least half the
threatened 31 pits. That suggests the government will be obliged to come up
with something comparable to the committee's recommendations even if it
disagrees with some of the report's technical analysis. The U-turn that
started in the autumn will then be complete.
Undoubtedly Mr Major will be branded by some as a Heathite. But there is an
interesting historical footnote. There are those on the right of the Tory
party who are blaming not Mr Major but Lady Thatcher for the present
predicament. During the miners' strike she considered coal privatisation.
The news leaked and she was cowed by the ensuing political row into dropping
the plans. There will be nothing new in Mr Major's retreat.

FT  30 JAN 93 / MPs criticise Treasury and electricity watchdog: Subsidy
urged for generators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BENEFITS of expanding the market for coal far outweigh the costs, Mr
Richard Caborn, chairman of the Commons trade and industry committee, said
yesterday.
The report is harshly critical of the Treasury and Professor Stephen
Littlechild, the electricity regulator, and includes recommendations which,
if implemented by the government, would significantly affect the nuclear,
gas, coal and electricity industries in the UK and overseas.
The MPs' main conclusions are in the following areas:
Coal: a subsidy should be provided to the electricity generators to burn up
to 16m tonnes of extra coal a year for the next five years on top of
existing contracts. It would be equal to the difference between the price of
overseas and British coal.
In addition, the government should consider financial assistance for 3m
tonnes to be sold elsewhere and require the generators to buy 4m tonnes for
one year only in 1984-85.
There would also be subsidies for clean-coal technology. The committee
believes the total subsidy needed over five years would be less than Pounds
500m. The money should come either from the fossil fuel levy 'which raises
more money than is needed for its main purpose' or from the taxpayer, but
not from the electricity consumer.
More worrying for British Coal is the committee's suggestion that opencast
output be reduced gradually through stricter planning guidelines from its
present 18m tonnes a year to about 10m.
The corporation welcomes the committee's suggestion that a high priority be
placed on reforming working practices, particularly the reform of working
hours.
The unions will welcome the committee's proposal that any colliery proposed
for closure should be put into the Modified Colliery Review Procedure, a
move opening the possibility that no pits be closed within the next nine
months.
Nuclear power: Nuclear Electric will be relieved the committee rejects calls
from some environmentalists for early closure of the Magnox stations and
against commissioning Sizewell B next year. It also welcomes a committee
proposal, unlikely to be adopted by the government, that Nuclear Electric
ceases to receive income from the fossil fuel levy and ceases to be
responsible for discharging inherited nuclear liabilities. The report
suggests diverting Pounds 380m a year of the levy towards coal.
The committee recommends that the nuclear review scheduled for 1994 be
brought forward by a year.
Major energy users, who have since privatisation complained of high
electricity prices, are backed. The committee says major users should not be
disadvantaged by high electricity prices relative to overseas competitors.
It suggests a cross-subsidy from small consumers by tapering the fossil fuel
levy so large users pay a small percentage.
Electricity: Perhaps the most significant means of increasing the market for
coal would be achieved through the committee's recommendation that the
liberalisation of the electricity market be delayed by four years from 1994.
Under its proposal, the boundary non-franchise market - where there is
competition between regional electricity companies - would remain at 1MW.
Some regional companies have suggested this would enable them collectively
to buy 15m tonnes more a year of coal-fired electricity because they would
be certain they could sell it to customers.
The committee of MPs says retention of the existing franchise boundary would
be conditional on the regional companies agreeing to larger coal contracts.
It also says the prices of the generators and regional companies would have
to be tightly regulated.
Under present licences the generators are not directly regulated and some
regional companies say this enables them to hold on to some of the money
resulting from falling coal prices.
The committee also advises the government to require the generators to hold
total stocks of not less than 20m tonnes of coal a year.
The committee wants Prof Littlechild to review regional companies'
distribution charges immediately so he can introduce tighter controls on
charges and pass the benefits of privatisation on to consumers.
The MPs are dissatisfied with the way Prof Littlechild has discharged his
duties. They criticise him for 'over-reliance' on competition and an
apparent lack of urgency in resolving problems.
The report says his duties should be amended to make protection of consumers
one of his primary duties. He should be required to consider long-term
interest of indigenous fuel producers.
The Department of Trade and Industry is asked to review the power of energy
regulators, with the aim of acquiring more parliamentary and govern-ment
control over their work.
Operation of the pool wholesale market for electricity is strongly
challenged because of the way the bidding system appears to disadvantage
coal. A review is suggested.
The report suggests controversially that electricity supplied from France be
subject to the nuclear levy and that Electricite de France's ability to
negotiate long-term contracts to supply power be made conditional on UK
generators having access to the French system. The committee believes this
would create room for 6.5m tonnes of coal.
Gas: Rapid expansion in the market share of combined-cycle turbine gas
generators are accepted as inevitable - the committee estimates 30m tonnes
of coal-equivalent in 1997 against 1m this year.
The committee says the independent power projects involving CCGT have a
protected market through long-term contracts and 'we do not necessarily rule
out draconian ways of reducing their impact on the market for coal'. The
report asks the government to look at the possibility of some CCGTs being
used as mid-merit or peak instead of baseload capacity.
Environment: Oil plants which burn orimulsion, the South American fuel which
is an emulsion of bitumen and water, should fit flue gas desulphurisation
units, which the committee believes would make them prohibitively expensive.
The committee says the government should resist the introduction of a carbon
tax unless it is essential to achieve commitments on carbon dioxide
emissions and is more cost-effective than other measures.
Government: The Treasury is criticised for its role in the pit closures
programme. The MPs say: 'We find it disappointing that the Treasury
apparently failed to conduct any comparison between the costs of closing the
31 pits and the costs of a temporary subsidy to enable British Coal to
enlarge its markets.'
The report says this could have suggested phased closures at least. 'We also
consider it reprehensible both that negotiations with the Treasury over the
redundancies were so protracted and that the Treasury then required all the
redundancies to take effect within the remainder of the financial year.'

FT  30 JAN 93 / De Klerk warns of war if talks fail

<TEXT>
MR F W de Klerk, the South African president, warned yesterday that South
Africa faced a 'devastating war' if talks on a post-apartheid constitution
do not succeed.
Speaking at the opening of parliament, which excludes blacks, Mr de Klerk
said he was confident that a transitional multi-party administration,
charged with leading the country to its first one person, one vote election,
could be in place by mid-year. He called for a bill of rights to be
introduced during this transition period.
However his ministerial colleagues, speaking before the opening of
parliament, illustrated divisions among government negotiators which could
well delay the talks, and force changes in Mr de Klerk's timetable.
Mr Hernus Kriel, minister of law and order and a member of Pretoria's
negotiating team, insisted the government would not agree to a new
constitution unless it ordained permanent, compulsory power-sharing between
blacks and whites, while other members of the government negotiating team
say this demand has now been dropped.
Mr Kriel said differences also remained between the African National
Congress and the government over re-incorporation of the nominally
independent black homelands, devolution of powers to regional governments
and the future of political armies. Other members of the negotiating team
insisted there were no further fundamental differences on these issues.
However, Mr Pallo Jordan, ANC spokesman, said Mr de Klerk's speech was
'extremely disappointing . . . The country has been terribly let down.'
'Instead of measured steps to involve his negotiating partners more deeply
in the process of transformation he has chosen to cast himself and his
government as managers of the process,' he said.
Mr Pik Botha, the Foreign Minister, briefing reporters before the president
spoke, warned of 'grotesque and awesome' consequences if political leaders
did not reach agreement, drawing a parallel with Yugoslavia. 'Unless through
the process of give and take, realistic agreement is reached . . . then
devastation would follow,' he said.
Mr de Klerk said 1992, when multi-party talks collapsed in acrimony, was
particularly bad. But he said a new spirit was abroad now. Much work had to
be done before binding agreements were reached on the transition to
democracy, but he said multi-party negotiations could resume in March,
resulting in a transitional executive council in June and a transitional
constitution by September.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday pledged to go ahead with a
controversial deal to sell missile technology to India despite protests from
the US.
Mr Yeltsin, who has been accused by nationalists at home of kow-towing to
Washington, used the occasion of a three-day visit to India to state his
determination to pursue an independent foreign policy.
Mr Yeltsin said Russia would not 'backtrack' on the agreement which became
public last year to supply India with cryogenic engines for rockets. He
suggested that the US, which has punished India for the deal by banning
space technology co-operation, should react to the agreement with
'commonsense'.
Mr Yeltsin said his visit to India, following trips to Seoul and to Beijing,
showed that Russia intended to pursue a balanced foreign policy with equal
regard for both the west and for Asia. He said that immediately after
gaining power, he had paid more attention to the west, because of the need
to deal with the US on issues such as nuclear disarmament.
But now Russia had to 'maintain a balance in relations with the west and the
east,' said Mr Yeltsin.
During his visit to India, Mr Yeltsin and Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian
prime minister, signed a friendship treaty and various economic and military
co-operation agreements.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Anarchy in Zaire threatens to destabilise region: Hopes for
a respite from chaos are fading as President Mobutu ruthlessly clings to
power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE portents of a fragile African nation heading inexorably towards chaos
and civil war are unmistakable. Black Africa's second largest country which
sits at the heart of Africa is descending into a state of anarchy which
could easily parallel the crisis in Somalia.
The collapse of Zaire, a country four times the size of France with 37m
people, would be serious enough. But it has potentially destabilising
consequences for the nine states surrounding the former Congo, including
Angola and Zambia.
A ruthless dictator unwilling to reform, an irreconcilable 18-month
political crisis, the complete loss of control over law and order and the
growth of tribal animosities and secessionist sentiments are breaking the
country apart.
The immediate cause of the fresh spree of violence is once again the
economy. Mutinous soldiers are protesting against worthless new Zaire 5m
banknotes printed by the pro-Mobutu central bank in December to settle the
two months' payroll of the military and civil service.
The notes, worth less than Dollars 2 (Pounds 1.30) have become central to
the on-going power struggle between the authoritarian president and the
opposition which nominally heads a toothless interim government.
Mr Etienne Tshisekedi, the reformist prime minister, fearing a rapid
escalation of hyper-inflation, declared the notes illegal tender.
Petrol stations, shops, market women and commercial banks refused to accept
the banknotes.
On Wednesday the central bank announced draconian measures to force
businesses to use the notes, threatening to suspend central bank operations
with commercial banks, to sack managers of state-run enterprises and close
down petrol stations and airlines if they failed to do so.
Behind the controversy of the new bank notes lies an economic catastrophe,
made worse by political instability and rampant corruption which remains
endemic throughout the government and civil service. France, Belgium and the
US said last week they would restore aid suspended in 1991 if Mr Mobutu
forfeits control of the treasury to the government and accepts transition to
democracy.
The foreign aid is desperately needed to repair economic infrastructure
destroyed during the last major army spree of violence and stabilise an
economy which has vast mineral resources of diamonds, copper and cobalt.
Restoring monetary control would be a vital first step to economic recovery.
The central bank is injecting massive liquidity into the enfeebled financial
system without any accountability to the government. The Economic Research
Institute at the University of Kinshasa estimates that inflation soared in
1992 to 6,183 per cent for goods purchased in stores and 4,179 per cent for
traditional market-based consumption compared to an annual rate of 3,525 per
cent in 1991.
The Zaire's value against the dollar has plunged in the past 18 months of
turmoil from 7,500 in August 1991 to 2,695,441 earlier this week. Real GDP
is estimated to have fallen by 8 per cent in 1992 having contracted by 7.3
per cent in 1991. Both copper and cobalt production have slumped to new
lows.
The country is unable to service its Dollars 10bn external debt and has
accumulated hefty arrears to the IMF and World Bank.
The one chance for any recovery remains a credible government with full
control over policy making. However, the economic crisis and the ability of
the government to tackle the problems has been compounded by a protracted
political tussle between Mr Mobutu and the country's fragmented and
increasingly tarnished opposition.
Mr Mobutu, who spends most of his time incommunicado steaming up and down
the Zaire River on a Belgian colonial riverboat, has consistently refused to
bow to demands for multi-party democracy and to hand over significant
executive power to the opposition.
Although he has appointed a prime minister from the opposition, Mr Mobutu
continues to sabotage the government and undermine its credibility.
The opposition has sought to remove him from power by waging a civil
disobedience campaign while at the same time seeking to impeach the
President through the interim parliament. Ultimately Mr Mobutu's survival
depends on whether he can maintain the loyalty of the army although a
successful disobedience campaign could lead to the country becoming
ungovernable.
In the political vacuum violent ethnic passions among Zaire's 200 tribes
have been on the intensifying, particularly in remote areas which have been
effectively cut off from central authority for months.
The brewing ethnic conflict is most acute in the mineral-rich province of
Shaba, formerly Katanga, where the Katangese people fought for secession in
the 1960s and 1970s. Ten of thousands of migrant labourers from neigh
bouring Kasai region working in the state-owned mining giant Gecamine and in
the informal business sector have been forced to flee Shaba.
The tensions could quickly lead to a revival of the secessionist movement in
Shaba.
With Mr Mobutu determined to ruthlessly cling onto power there appears
little hope of respite from further chaos.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Bank of Japan is pressed for interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, is under mounting pressure
to cut official interest rates to help prevent the Japanese economy slipping
into outright recession.
Mr Mieno yesterday acknowledged the weight of the pressure from bankers,
industrialists and politicians to cut the official discount rate which has
stood at 3.25 per cent since last July.
He said the crescendo of calls for a rate cut reflected the severity of the
downturn which has hit the economy, particularly over the last six months.
His remarks were seen as a signal to the business community that the Bank
recognises the extent of the slowdown and will cut interest rates soon.
The prospects for a cut were strengthened yesterday by figures showing
Tokyo's annual inflation rate was just 1 per cent in January. Economists
expect the national inflation rate, which was 1.2 per cent in December, will
fall to 0.5 per cent in comingmonths.
Only 5 per cent of companies polled by the Ministry of Finance said they had
felt any benefits from the Y10,700bn (Pounds 56.9bn) emergency spending
package announced last August.
Mr Mieno earned a reputation as a financial disciplinarian after he raised
interest rates more than two years ago to prick the speculative bubble
economy of the late 1980s. However in recent months he has faced mounting
calls to adopt a more relaxed policy.
Mr Mieno's critics' case has been strengthened by the Bank's research which
has recently adopted a more pessimistic tone about the outlook for consumer
spending and economic recovery.
Bank officials argue its room for further cuts is limited because it is
unwilling to reduce the official discount rate below the historic low of 2.5
per cent it reached during the late 1980s.
As a result the next interest rate cut is widely expected to be the last for
sometime. It is thought the Bank has wanted to delay a cut for as long as
possible to make sure that more emphasis is placed upon increases in public
spending to stimulate the economy.
Financial analysts believe the Bank may be holding back an interest rate cut
as an emergency measure to bolster confidence in the event of another sharp
fall in the fragile Tokyo stock market.
Mr Mieno made clear the Bank would support any major financial institution
which faced a crisis through a build up of bad loans. He stressed there was
no reason to expect such a crisis.
Housing starts, one of the few bright spots in the Japanese economy, rose
5.4 per cent in December, according to figures published yesterday.

FT  30 JAN 93 / French jobless approaches 3m: Government relieved that rate
of increase has slowed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT in France reached a record 2,978,400 last month, 10.5 per cent
of the workforce.
However, the rate of increase slowed, with a rise of 7,400 in December, up
0.2 per cent over the previous month. The figures gave some respite to the
government, which had feared yesterday would see unemployment crossing the
3m mark.
When he took office last April, Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy pledged to
keep unemployment below 3m and to remove rapidly from the unemployment rolls
some 900,000 people who had been out of work for more than a year. But the
subsequent economic slowdown, caused by high interest rates to support the
franc's parity against the D-Mark, has made these promises nearly impossible
to keep.
Unemployment and related issues, such as France's high payroll taxes and
foreign disinvestment, have become a focal point of the campaign for the
March parliamentary election. Socialist ministers, with some support from
the conservative opposition, have blamed employers for seeking to reduce
their costs primarily by laying off their workers.
The employers, for their part, say the rise in redundancies is an inevitable
result of companies being squeezed by high interest rates at home and
currency depreciations abroad.
Mr Francois Perigot, president of the Patronat employers federation, warned
this week that 'the French economy cannot tolerate indefinitely real
interest rates which are so much higher than in Germany, and such a
difference in the exchange rate with Britain'.
Mr Perigot said 'everyone claps' at France's trade surplus, which amounted
to FFr30bn (Pounds 3.7bn) last year.
'But if French companies are present everywhere on world markets, it is
because they are more competitive, and if they are more competitive, it is
because they have cut costs, and among such costs are their workforce.'

FT  30 JAN 93 / Clinton urged to call summit: World Economic Forum at Davos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DAVOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BOLD plan for global economic recovery, including a 20 per cent
revaluation of the yen against the dollar and speedy conclusion of the
stalled Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks was proposed yesterday by
Mr Fred Bergsten, a prominent US economist and former American official.
Mr Bergsten, addressing business leaders, ministers, officials and academics
at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, called on President Bill
Clinton to take the initiative by summoning a special summit meeting of the
Group of Seven leading industrial countries to tackle the world's economic
problems.
Such a meeting might, he suggested, be held after President Clinton had
unveiled his domestic economic programme in late March or April, but
certainly before the annual G7 summit, scheduled for July in Tokyo.
'The G7 is dead,' Mr Bergsten said. 'The world economy is entering its third
year of virtual stagnation. All industrial countries are suffering from each
other's weaknesses.'
His proposed 'global growth strategy' included:
A substantial extra Japanese fiscal stimulus.
Managed appreciation of the yen by 20 per cent along the lines of the 1985
Plaza accord, in order to counteract the rapidly growing Japanese trade
surplus.
Fiscal tightening in Germany and interest rate cuts in all principal
countries.
Mr Bergsten's call met a dusty response, however, from senior western
officials at the forum. Mr Horst Koehler, state secretary at the German
Finance Ministry, agreed the need for joint economic action was strong, but
emphasised that 'macroeconomic policy co-ordination can only be successful
over time if each country solves its own problems'.
On trade, Mr Bergsten and many others stressed the need for a quick
resolution of the Uruguay Round, reinforced by this week's anti-dumping
actions by the US against foreign steel makers.
However, Mr Arthur Dunkel, secretary general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, gave a gloomy prognosis as to the chances of completing
the package by the beginning of March, when the US administration must
formally notify Congress of its intent to conclude an agreement. 'There is
still a hell of a technical job to be done, not just by the US and EC but by
all the others. What we need is a decision to conclude.'
Mr Bergsten said that if a full Uruguay Round agreement could not be
concluded before the expiry of US fast track authorisation on June 1, a mini
package entrenching the agricultural pact and other significant agreements
already reached should be signed.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Clinton acts on gays in military
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday announced a compromise approach to the
controversial issue of ending the 50-year ban on homosexuals serving in the
US military.
He announced that the military would immediately stop screening recruits for
sexual orientation. He directed Mr Les Aspin, secretary of defence, to
prepare by July 15 an executive order ending the proscription on homosexual
service but including a strict new code of conduct covering sexual
behaviour. Meanwhile, all legal actions seeking the discharge of gays from
the armed services are to be suspended.
Also in the interim, Congress will hold its own hearings on the issue.
Senator Sam Nunn from Georgia, Democratic chairman of the armed service
committee and the most potent congressional critic of Mr Clinton's
initiative, said that he was satisfied with this approach, the essence of
which was hammered out by the president and himself, along with Senator
George Mitchell, the Democratic leader, in the White House on Thursday
night.
Mr Clinton's hand had been temporarily strengthened on Thursday when a
federal judge in California declared the ban unconstitutional. However his
ruling only applied to the parts of the state in his jurisdiction.
Making the announcement in person at the White House, the president
emphasised again that he was standing on principle. 'I believe that American
citizens who want to serve their country should be able to do so unless
their conduct disqualifies them from doing so,' he said.
But he conceded that 'military life is fundamentally different' and might
well impose 'necessary restrictions on behaviour, many of which would be
intolerable in civilian society.'
This is a clear invitation to Mr Nunn and the chiefs of staff under General
Colin Powell to revise the military code of conduct so as to meet some, if
not all, of their fundamental objections to admitting homosexuals. These
have centred on the implied threats to morale, efficiency and privacy.
'I agree with the joint chiefs that the highest standards of conduct must be
required,' Mr Clinton said. 'This cannot be accomplished overnight.'
Some Republicans continued yesterday to threaten to frustrate the
president's initiative, the fulfilment of a campaign promise as well as a
question of principle. But Sen Mitchell was confident he had the votes to
stop any legislative trickery and Mr Clinton urged the opposition not to
'play politics' by tagging amendments on to the family leave bill.
Mr Clinton said he hoped the agreed approach would now leave his new
administration free to concentrate on his promised economic reforms.

<TEXT>
THE European Monetary System had to work more flexibly, with more timely and
more frequent realignments, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank
of England, said in Davos yesterday.
Describing the lessons learnt from September's currency turmoil, Mr
Leigh-Pemberton said monetary integration had to follow, not lead, economic
convergence.
In addition to the economic strains which contributed to September's
upheaval, there had also been a strong element of political pride, and a
reluctance to face the need for a realignment.
Looking ahead, he said the official timetable for monetary union under the
Maastricht treaty might no longer be realistic. But it would be a mistake to
sacrifice convergence objectives in order to meet the Maastricht deadlines.
A Europe moving at different speeds might be inevitable, he said. It would
'not be a big deal'. But it would be a mistake for any one country to rush
into a currency union before Europe was ready.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton said he took a highly pragmatic view of the future, and
had not lost sight of the monetary union objective, which he believed Europe
would achieve 'at some time'. Such a regime would be free from the
distortions of political influence - and would be built on the basis of
independent central banks.

BRITAIN is sending a team of engineers to Croatia to help save a dam from
bursting and flooding 20,000 villagers.
The Overseas Development Administration said the three-man team would leave
for Croatia today to advise local experts on how to repair the Peruca
hydroelectric dam which was damaged in fighting between Croatians and
retreating Serbs on Thursday.
'The humanitarian consequences of the collapse of the dam could be horrific.
We have the capacity to help and I am pleased that we have been able to
respond so quickly,' said overseas aid minister Baroness Lynda Chalker.
A collapse could flood more than 20 communities in a long fertile valley
stretching south-west towards Split, Croatia's largest Adriatic port.
Croatian engineers were preparing a controlled drainage of the 12-mile-long
reservoir to relieve pressure on the damaged dam wall, Mr Tonci Caracic, a
Croatian scientist, said yesterday.
UN officials said the dam was not in immediate danger of collapsing.
Engineers warned that the entire reservoir, 500m cubic metres of water,
might have to be drained to avert the danger of flooding 20 villages
downstream from the dam.
The dam was seized on Thursday night when Croat forces on the seventh day of
their offensive broke through a year-old United Nations ceasefire line.
Croats and Serbs yesterday traded accusations about who caused the three
gaping holes in the 63-metre-high dam.
On an emergency visit to Peruca, Mr Hrvoje Sarinic, the Croatian prime
minister, accused Serb fighters of trying to blow up the dam to make sure it
would be out of operation before they were forced to pull back.
Witnesses said the sluice gates had been blasted away and the control room
was a 'twisted hunk of metal'. But Serb leaders in Knin, the nearby centre
of self-proclaimed state of Krajina, lashed out at Croatia for 'attempting
to cause an ecological catastrophe'.
'Croatia is trying to make it seem as if the wild Serbs tried to explode the
dam. But they have jeopardised thousands of people's lives in their botched
attempt to mine the dam,' said Mr Boro Martinovic, a minister in the
self-styled government.
Serb fighters seized Peruca during the seven-month Serbo-Croat war in 1991
and mined the dam, which provides electricity for much of central and
southern Dalmatia.
Yugoslav customs athorities detained outgoing Yugoslav Prime Minister Milan
Panic at the Horgos border crossing between Yugoslavia and Hungary,
Independent Serbian television NTV reported yesterday. He was returning
after several weeks of absence.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Canada imposes steel duties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CANADA yesterday imposed duties on imports from six countries it says have
dumped steel, including the US, in a move that raises the stakes in a
growing world trade dispute over steel, Reuter reports from Ottawa.
Canada imposed the duties on steel exports from the US, Germany, France,
Italy, New Zealand and Britain just two days after the US imposed duties on
steel imports from Canada and several other countries.
Canada said the six countries were dumping hot-rolled carbon steel sheet
products into Canada. The largest user of the steel products is the motor
industry.
Analysts say a downturn in demand for steel and a restructuring of the
global industry have caused greater competitive pressures and greater
industry pressure on governments to protect them.
Canada has pushed for a trade pact with the US to allow for greater
integration of the two markets, but US officials have said they would prefer
a multilateral approach.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Paris wants EC probe into Hoover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE is to ask the European Commission to investigate whether Hoover may
be breaking European Community law in apparently using pension fund money to
invest in a Scottish plant which is drawing jobs away from France.
The domestic appliance group denies breaking any EC rules.
Hoover's announcement this week that it was closing its vacuum cleaner
factory in the Dijon region, and switching production to Cambuslang near
Glasgow has caused a political storm in France, where the Socialist
government faces record unemployment two months away from a general
election.
Mrs Elisabeth Guigou, France's EC affairs minister, said yesterday a key
factor in Hoover's decision appeared to be the company's ability to put
pension fund money into the expansion of its Cambuslang plant. If this was
true, she said it would be contrary to a 1980 EC directive.
This directive, a French official said, is designed to protect workers in
the event of their companies going bankrupt. It includes provisions to
'prevent pension funds being taken hostage' by companies, he said. 'If one
day Hoover were to go bankrupt, then this pension fund money might
disappear.'
Hoover said last night that it had reached agreement with its British
workforce on the future of the company's UK pension fund. This is Pounds 28m
in surplus. Under the proposed deal with the workforce the surplus would be
reallocated.
Hoover said the pension fund agreement had not yet been approved by the
Inland Revenue but would involve dividing up the surplus. He said 53 per
cent would be returned to the workers in improved benefits, 19 per cent
would go to the Inland Revenue, and 28 per cent recovered by the company.
Reallocating company pension fund surpluses is lawful in Britain and Hoover
does not believe it breaches EC rules.
Concessions made by Scottish workers to woo the Hoover investment have
angered French trade unions. They accuse Britain, which refused to accept
the full social provisions of the Maastricht treaty, of allowing 'social
dumping'. This refers to undercutting labour standards to attract foreign
investment.
The French government has instructed its EC ambassador to ask the Commission
to inquire into possible 'distortion of competition' in the EC single
market, as a result of Scottish Office aid to Hoover.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Moskvich car plant closes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Moskvich car plant, one of the giants of Russian industry, has closed
because it lacks parts and funds.
The vehicle plant named after Lenin's Young Communist League and known as
AZKL, shut its car production line yesterday after supplies of engines from
the Ufa plant in the Russian republic of Bashkortostan dried up. The engine
plant is facing a deficit of Rbs14bn in the first quarter of this year, and
has written to Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, demanding a
subsidy to cover it.
The Ufa lines stopped on Tuesday when they ran out of raw materials and
parts. Mr Yuri Borodin, Moskvich's general director, yesterday blamed the
'complete absence of state regulation in this basic branch of engineering.'
Moskvich cars, whose most recent model is the Aleko five-door hatchback,
have for more than two decades been one of the principal vehicle exports of
Russia. The plant has been seeking foreign investors.
The main problem for Ufa is its dependence on the military, which takes
four-fifths of its engines.
Military spending was cut dramatically last year. However, the draft budget
before parliament includes a 32 per cent rise.
Another, smaller car plant in Izhevsk is also threatened with closure
because of the lack of engines.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Deadline set for Bosnia peace talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOSNIA'S three warring factions will be asked by mediators today for a final
decision on an internationally-brokered peace plan, in spite of the fact
that Bosnian Moslems oppose many of its provisions.
The co-chairmen of the Geneva peace conference, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord
Owen, have made clear that they are not prepared to extend the negotiations
indefinitely and that they will give the three Bosnian groups one more
chance to say 'yes' or 'no' at face-to-face talks today.
Failing a favourable reply to their proposals, which include a
constitutional framework, a map of the 10 provinces into which Bosnia will
be divided and ceasefire arrangements, the mediators have said they would
ask the UN Security Council to impose a settlement.
Lord Owen said yesterday he was confident 'at the end of the day' an
agreement would be reached. 'We may not reach it totally here (in Geneva),
but if not, we'll reach it in New York.'
Lord Owen said he and Mr Vance would report to the UN Security Council after
today's meeting and might press for sanctions against any side blocking the
accord.
Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian Moslem foreign minister, poured cold water
on hopes an overall agreement might be reached today, following progress
made towards agreement on transitional arrangements for the administration
of Bosnia between application of a ceasefire and implementation of a new
constitution.
Under the interim arrangements, a nine-member body composed of three
representatives from each ethnic group would take over from Bosnia's elected
presidency after a ceasefire.
Mr Silajdzic said his government could not accept either the Vance-Owen
package because the Moslems considered it would lead to the ethnic division
of the country and was tantamount to rewarding Serb aggression. 'We, as a
member of the UN will never accept the abolition of our constitution, our
legality, which is based on free and democratic elections,' he said.
Yesterday ambassador Muhamed Sacirbey of Bosnia wrote to the UN calling for
an emergency meeting of the Security Council to deal with 'gross
manifestations of renewed Serbian and Montenegrin aggression.'
The Bosnian Croats are the only ones who have so far accepted the Vance-Owen
package. It was not certain last night whether the Bosnian Moslems or Serbs
would bow to pressure by the mediators.

A Serbian ship, carrying oil, has again defied Romanian and Bulgarian
controls on the Danube and passed into Serbian waters breaking the UN
embargo, the Romanian Foreign Ministry said yesterday, writes Virginia Marsh
in Bucharest.
The Velebit was the third Serbian tugboat pushing barges of oil loaded in a
Ukrainian port of Reni, along the Danube, to break the embargo in the past
three days.
Romanian coastguards said Romanian and Bulgarian motor boats had circled the
Velebit for two hours yesterday but had backed off when the tug nearly
collided with one of their boats.
Two more tug boats, following not far behind, were last night also expected
to try to reach the Serbian port of Prahovo.
Despite continuing US pressure to stop the ships, Romania yesterday repeated
it was unwilling to take further action alone.
Romania was particularly concerned at the ecological consequences of any
conflict with the ships. The captain of one tugboat threatened to blow up or
discharge his cargo into the river, polluting the sole water supply of many
ports, rather than surrender.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Private funds likely for Pounds 300m second Forth toll
bridge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS FOR a Pounds 300m privately-financed road toll bridge crossing the
Firth of Forth near Edinburgh are expected to be announced by the government
next week.
The crossing, which will be adjacent to the existing toll bridge, will form
part of a package of public and private sector measures to ease traffic
congestion in the region and improve connections between the north and south
of Scotland.
The proposals are expected to include the construction of a dedicated bus
route between Edinburgh airport and the city centre involving private and
public money. It will be the first large investment in infrastructure to
take advantage of the easing of rules, announced in the Autumn Statement,
restricting the use of public subsidies to support commercial projects.
Companies and investors prepared to finance, build and operate a new bridge
across the Forth will be asked, as a first step, to register an interest
with the Scottish Office.
The crossing, together with approach roads costing an additional Pounds
100m, is likely to be funded entirely by the private sector. The total cost
of the bridge and roads, including finance charges, could rise as high as
Pounds 800m. In return, the private company would take over the Forth road
bridge at Queensferry, where cars at present are charged 40p to cross. This
would enable the operators to generate income while the new crossing was
being built.
The capacity of the existing bridge, built in 1964 to carry 14,000 vehicles
a day, is expected to be exhausted by the beginning of the next century.
More than 50,000 vehicles a day crossed it on more than 100 days last year.
The crossing, which is operated by Lothian and Fife regional councils, is
due to repay its capital debt next year although tolls had been expected to
continue on the bridge to pay for maintaining and strengthening it.
The scheme for a new bridge is the latest in a growing number of private
sector infrastructure projects promoted by the government. These have
attracted considerable interest from continental European toll road
operators and construction companies as well as British groups.
Privately-financed schemes completed or underway include a toll bridge
across the River Thames at Dartford, a bridge across the River Severn
between England and Wales, the Birmingham Northern Relief Road and a toll
bridge connecting the island of Skye with the mainland. All, apart from the
Dartford crossing, involve British companies in partnership with continental
European groups.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Burton in Pounds 163m cash call to pay for face-lift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURTON GROUP, the clothing retailer, yesterday became the sixth UK company
this week to launch a rights issue, with a call on shareholders for Pounds
163m.
The company wants the cash to reduce its Pounds 324.6m net debt and finance
a face-lift for most of its 1,800 stores.
The announcement brings the total sought from shareholders this week to
Pounds 714m, including a Pounds 347m issue from Asda, the supermarket chain,
and a Pounds 144m cash call from Wessex Water.
Burton's one-for-four rights issue at 60p is its second call on shareholders
in 19 months. The previous Pounds 161m share issue, one-for-one at 30p,
rescued the group after huge writedowns in its property portfolio.
Mr John Hoerner, chief executive, said yesterday: 'The last one was damage
repair. This one makes it possible for us to explore opportunities.' Mr
Hoerner was promoted a year ago from Burton's Debenhams department store
chain to lead the group's revival.
Mr Steve Oldfield, an analyst with Smith New Court, said the issue would
'provide the financial foundation to develop a store base which will provide
recovery. I think they have timed it very acutely.' Burton's shares, which
have risen from 30 1/2 p since September, yesterday slipped 2 1/2 p to close
at 72 1/2 p.
The proceeds are expected to enable Burton to finance a three-year
refurbishment programme for its shops - including Top Shop, Dorothy Perkins
and Principles.
Mr Hoerner said about two-thirds of the group's space was in need of a
face-lift. More than half of the stores had not been refurbished for at
least six years. The cost of the programme would be about Pounds 130m at
today's prices.
Mr Richard North, finance director, said the rights issue would leave the
company with a controllable debt, even after capital expenditure plans.
Analysts are forecasting that Burton will achieve about Pounds 30m pre-tax
profits for the year to August 29. Debt is estimated to be Pounds 240m by
the year-end.
About Pounds 150m would relate to the group's property portfolio. On those
forecasts, operating cash flow is expected to be roughly neutral. Burton
forecast an unchanged interim dividend of 1p. Members of Usdaw, the
shopworkers' union, have called off a strike planned for today at branches
of Burton Menswear and Top Man shops.
An agreement was reached between management and the union at the High Court
yesterday to hold talks next week at Acas, the arbitration service. The
dispute is over job losses and bargaining rights.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Clinton pushes for early US recovery plan to boost jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLINTON administration indicated yesterday that it wanted to press ahead
with an immediate recovery package because the economic turnround had failed
to feed through to the jobs market.
A White House spokeswoman said President Bill Clinton remained concerned
that this was 'a recovery without job growth'.
Fresh evidence of accelerating growth in the US emerged yesterday, with a
surge in new orders for US durable goods, up 9.1 per cent between November
and December, according to the Commerce Department.
The administration welcomed the figures but indicated that it intended to
press ahead with an early stimulus package.
Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, said he saw 'continuing weakness' in
the economy that would justify a short-term stimulus to create jobs 'between
now and the summer'.
'We do not want another double dip,' he said. President Clinton is at Camp
David this weekend to discuss strategy with cabinet officials and senior
advisers.
The administration seems likely to press for quick congressional approval of
a modest stimulus package based on increased public works spending and an
extension of unemployment benefits. The spending might be financed with
about Dollars 20bn in uncommitted funds for the current financial year.
A long-term deficit-cutting package and tax incentives to spur investment
may be postponed until mid-summer or later.
President Clinton has never laid out a precise timetable for his economic
strategy. But financial markets had expected him to enact a deficit-cutting
plan at the same time as he unveiled a short-term stimulus.
The surge in durable goods orders was one of the largest on record and well
above Wall Street projections of a rise of about 3 per cent. Durable goods
orders rose 4.1 per cent in 1992 as a whole and are now at their highest
level since the end of 1988.
Separate figures showed a 1 per cent increase in personal disposable incomes
between November and December. However, officials pointed out that this
partly reflected special factors including large bonuses in the securities
industry to avoid higher taxes under the new administration.
Excluding special factors, personal incomes rose about 0.3 per cent after a
0.5 per cent increase in November.
The surge in orders was led by an extraordinary 21 per cent increase in
orders for transport equipment and thus probably overstated the economy's
underlying strength. However, economists noted that the recovery of orders
was broadly-based with every industrial sector registering handsome gains.
Excluding transport, orders were up 5.5 per cent last month.

FT  30 JAN 93 / MPs seek bigger coal market to safeguard pits' future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT last night faced a delicate political balancing act after a
cross-party committee of MPs recommended measures to secure the future of
more than half the 31 threatened coal pits.
The trade and industry select committee's proposals would increase the
annual market for deep-mined British coal by 16m tonnes or more for five
years at a cost of about Pounds 500m.
This would be achieved mainly by postponing liberalisation of the domestic
electricity market until 1998 and subsidising the extra output so that it
could be sold at world prices.
Barring reform, domestic coal consumption by electricity generators is set
to fall to 40m tonnes in 1993-94 and 30m tonnes thereafter.
The report is certain to increase pressure on the government as it prepares
its own solution to the pit crisis, to be released as a white paper within
two weeks.
In effect, it leaves cabinet ministers - still smarting from October's
retreat - to decide how far below the committee's bottom-line figure the
government dare pitch its own proposals, without risking defeat in the
Commons. The precariousness of the government's position was underlined last
night when Mr Winston Churchill, Conservative MP for Davyhulme, indicated
that he and his 30 colleagues on the recently-formed coal group of Tory
backbenchers were looking for 'a clear majority' of the threatened pits to
be saved.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, would be taking 'a
serious personal risk' if he pitched the government's 'bid' significantly
lower than the committee's recommendations, Mr Churchill said.
As Labour celebrated what it described as his 'humiliation', Mr Heseltine
prepared the way for a climbdown by arguing the government would have been
'culpable' if it had not reviewed its original decision in the light of the
outcry it generated.
The government retained 'an open mind', he said, describing yesterday's
report as 'very long, very complicated and very interesting'.
A first indication of how the government might respond came in a speech from
Lord Wakeham, who chairs the cabinet committee on coal. 'If productivity
improvement can be implemented and cost reductions achieved, there is scope
for many pits to improve their performance costs significantly within three
to five years,' he said.
He emphasised that electricity privatisation had been planned on the basis
of an eight-year transition to full competition, designed with the interest
of the coal industry in mind.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, called for his opposite
number's resignation, saying: 'Nobody in business would keep their job after
such a monumental mistake and neither should Michael Heseltine.'
Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, said the report supported the
company's view that only 'a radical transformation of the market would
change the prospect of many of our collieries'.

FT  30 JAN 93 / France sends troops after Zaire army mutiny

MUTINOUS TROOPS rampaged through Kinshasa for the second day running
yesterday as French paratroops entered the Zairean capital from neighbouring
Congo to help evacuate up to 1,000 French nationals.
The streets of Kinshasa were strewn with corpses, with at least 45 reported
dead, after elite troops loyal to President Mobutu Sese Seko, using heavy
weapons and grenades, continued to hunt mutineers and civilian looters.
Mr Willy Claes, Belgian foreign minister, said the situation was
deteriorating and there appeared to be a 'confrontation in the heart of the
army' and growing signs of tribal warfare among civilians which had caused
widespread public panic.
The explosion of violence for a third time in 17 months in Zaire's capital
brought black Africa's second largest country closer to economic collapse
and a civil war.
Earlier yesterday Mr Pierre Joxe, the French foreign minister, accused
Zairean troops of deliberately killing the French ambassador, Mr Philippe
Barnard, 61, on Thursday evening. 'It was not a stray bullet as the first
agency reports said,' he added.
Diplomats said as many as 400 French civilians may have taken refuge in the
French Embassy residence, near the Congo River, which divides Zaire from
Congo. France said it had dispatched 150 marines to Brazzaville, the
Congolese capital, to help rescue an estimated 1,000 nationals, while
Belgium said it was sending 520 troops to evacuate its 3,000 nationals.
The Brussels office of the international medical charity Medecins sans
Frontieres said its workers in Kinshasa reported 'many deaths' and saw
streets in some areas 'scattered with bodies', most of them in uniform.
There was no official death toll from the worst rioting in Zaire since
September 1991 when at least 250 people were killed in an army mutiny.
However, MSF said it knew of 45 dead and 131 wounded in Kinshasa. Soldiers
firing automatic weapons randomly gutted shops and homes, plundered
supermarkets, hijacked cars and stole money from civilians at gunpoint. Some
civilians stayed at home while some wealthy Zaireans tried to flee the
country in private aircraft and across the Zaire River.
Troops loyal to President Mobutu, who has ruled Zaire since he seized power
in a CIA-backed military coup in 1965, fought fierce street battles with
grenades and armoured vehicles to put down the mutiny. The army's Kokolo
camp in Kinshasa, where the infantry-led mutiny began, was encircled by
loyal troops yesterday, as was the office of reformist prime minister
Etienne Tshisekedi. No word has been heard from Mr Tshisekedi since
Thursday.
Violence erupted among soldiers after 5m-zaire banknotes, which are almost
worthless, were issued to settle a two-month payroll for the military.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Warning over BES outlays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL new business expansion scheme companies were launched this week.
Meanwhile, Flexit, which is sponsored by Richard Ellis Venture Consultants,
sold out very quickly. But John Spiers of BESt Investment warns that people
who pay top-rate tax on only a small part of their incomes may be putting
too much into non-recourse schemes. Basic-rate taxpayers lose if they take
money after six months.
New schemes this week include:
The Shannon Companies
Sponsored by British Linen Bank, these will buy repossessed properties from
Bank of Ireland Home Mortgages. Non-recourse loans of 75p per Pounds 1
invested are available after six months, while the return after five years
is Pounds 1.07 per Pounds 1 invested originally.
Artesian Select
Not to be confused with 'guaranteed' schemes, this is the latest in a long
series of companies which buy properties, or building sites, in London and
aim to make a profit from rental yield and capital growth after five years.
There is no guarantee, but there is also no upper limit on the return.
House the Homeless of London (Spring 1993 Issue)
Sponsored by Downing Corporate Finance, this is the latest scheme to buy
properties for the Peabody Trust, which will pay Pounds 1.15 for every
Pounds 1 share at the end of five years.
There is no independent bank guarantee so the offer depends on Peabody,
which has properties with an open market vacant possession value of Pounds
825m.
Kerrington MaxiGrowth
Like Artesian, this is the latest in a series of non-guaranteed companies
which will aim to profit from high rental yields in London.
London and Home Counties Repossessions
Sponsored by Close Brothers, this aims to profit from cheap repossessed
properties. The sponsors hope to obtain rental guarantees from colleges and
housing associations.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Shares win in the long run - A look at
a BZW study of equities and gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE long run, there is no substitute for buying shares. That is the
conclusion of the latest edition of the BZW Equity-Gilt Study, which
analyses figures dating back to 1918.
Over that period, the average annual nominal return on equities has been
11.9 per cent, compared to 6.4 per cent from gilts and 5.5 per cent from
cash (Treasury bills). In real (after inflation) terms, shares gave returns
of 7.3 per cent a year, compared with 1.16 per cent from gilts and 1.04 per
cent from cash.
When compounded, the effects of this difference are staggering. Someone who
invested Pounds 100 in shares in December 1945 would have turned this into
Pounds 34,179 by the end of 1992; the same sum in gilts would have grown to
Pounds 1,432 and in cash to Pounds 2,549. In real terms, an investor in
gilts has actually lost money over the same period.
These returns are gross and ignore the effects of tax and the costs of
dealing. Nevertheless, BZW says that even allowing for these costs, shares
come out well on top.
If you allow for basic rate tax, the real yield on equities over the last 25
years has been 4.4 per cent; allowing for top rate tax, it has been 2.1 per
cent.
Michael Hughes, managing director of BZW economics and strategy, thinks that
shares will continue to outperform, although the gap will be narrower. He is
expecting gross real returns on equities to be around 6.5 per cent over the
next five years and on gilts to be 3.5 per cent.
Gilts will do better than previously because of lower inflation, thinks BZW,
and equities will not do quite as well as before because of lower real
dividend growth.
Nevertheless, Hughes says those real returns could mean that the FT-SE 100
index, currently around 2800, will reach 7000 by the end of the decade.
So what should investors do? BZW figures show that an investor who wants the
best long-term total return (and is oblivious to risk) should invest totally
in shares. Few people are oblivious to risk, however.
Michael Hughes suggested a strategy of investing in a portfolio of gilts and
using the income to invest in shares via a savings scheme approach. That
might be a rather cumbersome strategy.
Those who want income might also look askance at shares. But someone who
bought a portfolio of shares when Margaret Thatcher took office in 1979
would have seen his income nearly quadruple by 1992.
None of this proves that shares will do well in the short term. But for
those who can afford to invest for five years or more, the case for shares
looks compelling.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Endowment threat to mortgage
repayments - John Authers asks if policies will fail to cover loan
obligations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOSE who bought an endowment policy between 1987 and 1989 may find their
golden goose turns out to be an albatross. Most mortgages purchased during
those housing boom years were backed by an endowment. At the time, many were
eager to get into the housing market and did not stop to bother too much
about the policy which the lender added on top.
As the figures on prices and repossessions show, many also borrowed more
than they could afford and bought houses which lost value. Now, a new
element of misery could be added - the low-cost endowments taken out to
repay the loans may fail to do so.
Endowments come with a guaranteed 'sum assured', but this is not for the
size of the loan; an endowment which guaranteed this would be expensive.
Instead, it is fixed at a level lower than the total of premiums paid in.
The policy needs a certain investment return to pay off the mortgage.
This method is cheaper; hence, such endowments are known as 'low-cost.' But
the endowment could fail to pay off the mortgage if its investments do not
perform as well as expected.
As previous articles have made clear, those who took out endowment policies
in, or before, the early 1980s already have enjoyed good investment returns
and need not worry; the problem is confined to the late 1980s.
Lenders have to decide if endowments are acceptable security for the loan,
and the assumptions needed to determine this vary according to whether the
policy is with-profits or unit-linked. The latter assumes an annual
investment growth rate - in the case of Allied Dunbar, 7.5 per cent, after
charges, during the late 1980s. If this is achieved, the policy will be paid
off.
With-profits policies, where annual bonuses are added each year and a
terminal bonus can be added at the end, assume that annual bonuses will
continue at 80 per cent of their present rate, with no terminal bonus. They
ultimately depend on their investment growth.
Some lenders may have been too optimistic in their assumptions for endowment
growth rates. With-profits offices have cut their bonuses this year, and
returns have been harmed by poor performance in the property and equity
markets. Predictions are widespread that returns for the rest of this decade
will be low.
Several companies now admit that endowments sold at the peak of the boom
might not reach their target. The annual returns they require from now until
the maturity date have crept above 10 per cent, after paying expenses and
taxes. Such returns are not unrealistic; but with inflation and interest
rates at low levels, it is conceivable that the policies will miss their
target.
This might sound like a problem that will manifest itself only in 2013, when
endowments bought in 1988 mature, but those who can afford it might want to
take action now.
Insurers are adapting their systems so that they can ask customers to
increase their premiums if the policy seems to be falling short. But Tony
Shepherd, chairman of the Institute of Financial Planning, suggests this is
the last thing you should do.
Those nervous about their endowment should supplement it with tax-efficient
saving, such as a Pep, he says. A life office which asks for an increased
premium is, effectively, admitting it has failed, so it is hard to see why
borrowers should pay it more money.
Shepherd's advice to the many people considering stopping the premiums on
with-profits policies is, however, unequivocal: 'Once you've got it, you're
stuck with it.' None of the options is as worthwhile as continuing to
maturity, even if dire predictions for future returns are correct.
Unit-linked contracts offer a simpler deal, as values are determined by the
underlying performance of the units, while with-profits returns are at the
discretion of actuaries.
The options are: Surrender
This is almost certainly the worst choice. You stop paying premiums and take
the returns from the policy immediately. But all the expenses of setting it
up, meant to be spread over 25 years, will have to be taken out of the
premiums paid in already, making a bigger proportionate impact. Surrender
values need not take account of bonuses added on, as these are guaranteed
only if the policy continues to maturity.
It often takes 10 years before the surrender value is greater than the total
premiums paid in, so this is an act of desperation. With a unit-linked
policy, the costs are taken via a 'nil allocation period' at the start when
premiums do not buy any units. After this, the surrender value will equal
the total value of the units.
Making the policy paid-up
This involves stopping paying the premiums but only taking the proceeds at
the scheduled maturity date. The value will not be as good as you would get
by continuing to pay the premiums because the start-up costs will be spread
over a smaller sum. But by giving the investment longer in which to earn
compound returns, you should ultimately get more than if you surrender.
John Lister, of General Accident Life, says standard practice is to reduce
the sum assured by a proportionate amount and then add bonuses to this
reduced amount. The amount you receive eventually depends on future bonus
rates.
Most companies will not allow a policy to be made paid-up in its first year
or two. After this, the value improves the longer the policy has been in
force. Standard Life says a policy started 25 years ago, with annual
premiums of Pounds 360, and made paid-up 10 years ago, would have paid out
Pounds 44,045 on maturity. Had all premiums been paid, the maturity value
would have been Pounds 68,848 - compared with a surrender value at the time
of Pounds 10,048.
The returns on premiums paid make the trade-off clearer. The surrender value
gave a return of 7.4 per cent, the paid-up policy 11.7 and the maturity
value 13.5. The past 10 years have produced good returns, so this is a
flattering period over which to judge the policy. Those who can afford to
continue paying premiums are well-advised to do so.
Selling the policy
Dealers have established a market for second-hand endowments. Policyholders
in search of cash can ask for a quote from a marketmaker. This is usually
higher than the surrender value. But the marketmaker will then take a cut
and sell it on to someone else for a profit. The fact that this is possible
shows that a better return should be achievable by keeping the policy to
maturity.
There is no need to panic. Endowments are unlikely to miss their target by
much, and planning should make up any shortfall. But if they do fail to
repay loans, the final words will have been written in an unhappy episode
for the housing industry.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Lenders will not pass on full rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE HERDED sheep, banks and building societies were quick this week to
follow the 7.99 per cent mortgage rate set by Halifax, the largest lender.
The society said it had given 'special consideration' to its savers in
setting the new rate, which represents a cut of only 0.56 of a percentage
point compared with the base rate drop of 1 point. It applies immediately
for new borrowers and from March 1 for existing mortgage-holders.
Those with a Pounds 50,000 mortgage, and paying 8.55 per cent, will see
their monthly payments drop from Pounds 355.41 a month to Pounds 340.08 if
they have a repayment mortgage. A 29-year-old non-smoker with an endowment
mortgage will see his payments fall from Pounds 364.81. to Pounds 344.98.
The cut has had a noticeable impact on what can be afforded, according to
figures compiled by the FT. Assuming a mortgage rate of 7.99 per cent, then
a loan on an average-priced house (according to Halifax's index) now costs
17.8 per cent of average income - down from 19.11 per cent after the last
base rate cut in November. This is almost down to the level of 17.35 per
cent recorded in 1972.
The only institution so far to have passed on the full 1 point base rate cut
is UCB, the UK subsidiary of Compagnie Bancaire, a French financial services
group. But UCB previously was charging 8.99 per cent, well above the market
rate, and existing customers will have to wait until April 1 for the new
rate of 7.99.
Other banks and building societies to have announced a 7.99 rate are Abbey
National, Alliance &amp; Leicester, Barclays, Britannia, Chelsea, Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester, Coventry, Leeds Permanent, Lloyds Bank, Midland, National &amp;
Provincial, Nationwide, Northern Rock, Nottingham, Royal Bank of Scotland,
Staffordshire, Stroud &amp; Swindon, TSB and Woolwich.
The rates apply from March 1 for existing borrowers, with some exceptions.
Lloyds' new rate will apply to both new and existing borrowers from February
26. Chelsea, Northern Rock, National &amp; Provincial have not yet decided on a
date for existing customers.
There has been some variation in the rates. Household Mortgage Corporation,
a centralised lender, has announced that its new figure will be 7.69 per
cent from April 1 for new and existing borrowers. Its mortgage-holders now
are paying 9.95 per cent, which will be reduced to 8.45 per cent from March
1.
Firstdirect goes to 7.95 per cent, a drop of 0.54 of a point. Existing
borrowers benefit from March 1. Manchester building society has cut by 0.56
of a point to 7.89 per cent with immediate effect for new borrowers and from
March for existing customers.
Rates at National Home Loans, another centralised lender, continue to lag
behind. The new figure is 9.99 per cent from April 1; borrowers on the
present standard variable rate are paying 10.8.
There are some variations on the standard rate depending on the size and/or
the proportion of the house's value you borrow. The new rate for those
borrowing over Pounds 100,000 from Abbey National is 7.7 per cent, while
those borrowing less than 80 per cent of the value of the home at Woolwich
will pay 7.65 per cent.
First-time buyers are being courted actively while new fixed rates continue
to be launched. Many are tied to endowment or pension mortgages, restricting
the choice to those wanting a repayment mortgage.
Stroud &amp; Swindon has a two-year, 6.95 per cent fixed-rate mortgage available
in both repayment and endowment modes. The fee is Pounds 150 and the early
redemption penalty is three months.
Staffordshire also has a 6.49 fixed-rate offer until March 31 1995 for a fee
of Pounds 195, available on repayments and endowment mortgages. Neither
society requires customers to buy insurance-related products.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Markets: Investors develop a taste for revolution - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE corporate heads were rolling almost everywhere this week (often to the
accompaniment of shareholder applause), the chairman of American Express
earned an unexpected reprieve, and the company's stock paid the price.
In an extraordinary counter-coup, Amex's long-time, and much criticised,
chairman, James Robinson, won a battle against dissident board members and
not only retained his position at the helm of the company, but also assumed
new managerial powers over Amex's troubled brokerage subsidiary, Shearson
Lehman Brothers.
The news disappointed Wall Street. Disappointment, in fact, is too pale a
word to describe the market's reaction - despair would be better. One fund
manager told the Wall Street Journal: 'When you see politics win out over
shareholders, once again it makes you think that Mr Robinson is unique in
his disregard for shareholders and control over the company.'
Another member of the investment community was even more trenchant:
'Arrogance and self-absorption won out over the interests of shareholders ..
Mr Robinson is a big negative. Whatever the p/e ratio is, it's less with Jim
Robinson in the company. Period.'
Investors were equally uncompromising with Amex, selling the stock in large
numbers. After news of Robinson's victory broke, Amex shares dropped 13 per
cent to Dollars 22 3/8 in three days. The selling reflected several
sentiments: unhappiness with the outcome of the board battle; disappointment
at the failure of Amex to find a chairman from outside the company;
dissatisfaction with the fourth-quarter and full-year 1992 results, which
were well down on the previous year; and a lack of confidence in Robinson's
ability to tackle Amex's deep-rooted problems, especially those at Shearson
Lehman.
While Amex's chairman was granting himself a last minute reprieve, two other
chairmen of big US corporations were forced to walk the plank - John Akers
at International Business Machines, and Paul Lego at Westinghouse Electric.
Although the latter insisted that boardroom pressure had not forced him to
resign, Lego is leaving after only two and a half years at the helm of
Westinghouse. His departure also comes on the heels of heavy criticism of
the company's management by shareholder activists and industry analysts, all
of which suggests that Lego may have jumped before he was pushed.
As one big Westinghouse investor put it: 'I don't think Lego would have done
it without firm nudging from the board.' The news of Lego's departure was
generally received positively by the stock market, which bid Westinghouse
shares up Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 14 on the day he stepped down.
At IBM, the situation was much clearer. Having insisted recently that he
would remain as chairman for several more years, Akers' sudden resignation
on Tuesday, and the demotion / early retirement of two of his key
lieutenants, made it clear that the patience of board members and
shareholders had finally run out.
Last week's announcement of a record Dollars 4.97bn loss for 1992, which
forced IBM to slash its quarterly dividend for the first time in its
history, must have been the final straw. Again, the market welcomed the
management reforms, with heavy demand lifting IBM shares up from below
Dollars 48 to Dollars 51 1/4 by the week's end.
The rise in IBM shares, however, cannot be solely attributed to the changes
at the top of the company. The stock also benefited from the decision by
some investors this week to switch out of overheated small-company stocks
and into bigger cyclical industrials.
This switching may prove to be only a temporary phenomenon, but it was a
welcome development nonetheless for the beleaguered components of the Dow
Jones Industrial Average. For the first time in weeks, the Dow put in a
stronger performance than over-the-counter stock indices.
The turnaround was partly the result of a natural correction in the market -
investors took profits on their OTC holdings and moved some of that money
back into industrials - and partly a response to the news that economic
growth at the end of last year was surprisingly strong.
The Commerce department announced on Thursday that gross domestic product
grew at an annual rate of 3.8 per cent in the final quarter of 1992, the
healthiest growth in four years. The GDP report indicated that the economy
has decisively broken free from the 1990-1991 recession, and it immediately
encouraged investors to take a fresh look at cyclical stocks like IBM,
General Electric and International Paper, which tend to move in line with
the ups and downs of the economy.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Markets: Dealers cut up rough as rates fall - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOWEVER welcome to mortgagees, this week's cut in base rates, from 7 to 6
per cent, smacks of panic at the top.
The cut certainly took the equity market by surprise. There was an
expectation that interest rates would be reduced in the March budget and not
before. The FT-SE 100 index jumped 63.8 points on Tuesday when the cut was
announced, though much of that gain was lost over the rest of the week.
Indeed, since the highs of the beginning of the year, the market had
weakened as hopes of a cut had been deferred.
The cut was also clearly unexpected in the gilt-edged market. The timing
caused some annoyance to operators there who had been happily preparing for
Wednesday's Pounds 2.5bn auction of stock by taking short positions. Perhaps
it was a fit of the sulks from the gilt dealers that left the auction barely
covered.
Such is the self-importance of the stock market that it assumed the
inconvenience to them of the timing showed ineptness, and added to rumours
that the Bank of England was hardly consulted before the decision was taken.
Tuesday's move also appeared to take little account of what might happen to
the pound. Sterling held steady for a bit after the rate cut, but then
dipped again. As an aside, when interest rates were last this low 15 years
ago, a pound could buy four D-marks.
It all adds up to a feeling that there has been a shift in emphasis by the
government, away from controlling inflation towards getting the economy
moving at all costs. The previous week's unemployment figures, showing an
acceleration in the monthly increase, and the probability that the next
month's figure will take the jobless total to more than 3m, may have been
the final straw for the government.
Once one cut is made, the market starts looking for the next, and there are
now many who expect a fall to 5 per cent, perhaps at budget time. At the
same time the Government's backbenchers are pushing for an easy budget in
March, on the grounds that any green shoots must be protected, unlike the
crocuses now daringly pushing upwards and risking the frost.
Any over-generosity in March, the theory goes, can be reversed, if need be,
in December when the second budget of the year is coming. Where that leaves
the budget deficit meanwhile is a question proponents of this argument
prefer to ignore.
The market is divided between those who think that recovery is imminent  -
and that if anything the risk is that the government's efforts could be
overstoking the fire - and others who believe it takes much longer for lower
rates to work through to improved confidence, both consumer and corporate.
Both sides point to the US economy. One view is that low interest rates have
worked there and the economy is picking up. The other is that US rates have
been much lower for much longer than UK rates and it takes a long time for
cheap money to have the desired effect.
Either way, all economic statistics and company news over the next few weeks
will be closely studied. No doubt many official figures and chairmen's
statements will give contradictory indications.
This week's trade figures looked awful, the worst since June 1990. But they
can be explained by saying that devaluation just makes imports look bigger,
and the benefit of a lower pound has not come through to exporters yet. The
good old J curve, the dismal scientists' standby when things that ought to
be getting better actually get worse, was called in as an explanation.
Similarly, Lord Hanson's remarks at his company's annual meeting on Tuesday
could be taken to support either view. He said he could see signs of
recovery, but they would take a long time to feed through to profits because
of the amount of stock in the pipeline.
It is the speed of the recovery in corporate earnings that will decide the
progress of the equity market, since the market is already on a high
multiple. Here too there is a wide divergence of views, with forecasts for
earnings growth covering an unusually wide range.
At least there are some companies which believe they are on the recovery
path. Asda and Burton this week called for new capital from shareholders,
Asda taking Pounds 347m and Burton Pounds 163m. Both said that the money
would be used to revamp and revitalise their store chains. Indeed the two
companies' statements were so similar that Asda, which came first, might
almost have a breach of copyright claim against Burton.
These, Wessex Water's Pounds 144.5m fund-raising this week, plus a number of
smaller issues, are expected to be the start of a flood of rights. Asda said
it chose the date to get in first, though it does not actually need the cash
right now.
Institutions, which can see Pounds 50bn of gilt issues heading their way,
are likely to be fairly choosy about which companies they will support with
new capital. Both Asda and Burton had what amounted to rescue issues in 1991
 -a year when rights issues totalled around Pounds 11bn. Perhaps this year's
list will repeat many other names from 1991.
This week's total of equity fund raising topped Pounds 700m, and if that is
only the start, much of the institutions' cashflow must already be spoken
for.
In fact, with interest rates this low, companies could find debt capital
cheaper than equity. But like consumers with big mortgage and credit card
debt, the preference may be to repay debt before going out on a shopping
spree again.
Even so, Wessex Water wanted the money for the purchase of Pounds 113m of
NFC's waste division. Hopes for a revival in takeover activity may be
premature, though. Two hours after the base rate cut, Lord Hanson told
shareholders that not many bargains were around.

The value of funds under management in the unit trust industry and in unit

a whole, it was strong stock markets which pushed the total to Pounds
63.88bn; there were actually net redemptions in December. Unit trust Peps
have benefited from last year's Budget change which allowed the full Pounds
6,000 allowance to be placed in trusts. In the fourth quarter of 1992,
investors put an extra Pounds 340m in such Peps, and made redemptions of
only Pounds 52m.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Markets: Societies head for messy compromise - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BASE rate cut this week might have marked a turning point. Savers,
rather like the cast of the film Network, are starting to yell: 'I'm mad as
hell and I'm not going to take it any more.'
Building societies, which welcomed all previous cuts with enthusiasm, were
distinctly lukewarm about the fall to 6 per cent. Their concern is
understandable. In five of the 12 months of 1992, they had suffered an
outflow of savers' funds. More cuts will only worsen the trend.
Of course, part of the rationale behind the base rate cut is to encourage
people to stop saving and start spending their money on consumer goods,
thereby reviving the economy. That is all very well for those in employment.
But it is not an option for those (mostly retired) people who are living off
their savings. Since 1990, base rates have fallen from 15 to 6 per cent; for
many savers, this will have meant a cut in income of 60 per cent. To make
matters worse, although the rate of inflation has been falling, prices have
continued to rise.
What can societies do? They are entitled to a certain amount of sympathy.
The housing market is depressed and the bad debt problem remains horrendous.
If they fail to turn base rate cuts into lower mortgage rates, they will
attract the outrage of home-owners and the press.
It looks as if the societies are attempting a messy compromise. Mortgage
rates have come down by around half a percentage point, to 7.99 per cent,
with suspicious unanimity in a supposedly competitive market. Savings rates
details will emerge only next week (which means our Highest Rates table on
page IV is particularly subject to change). The societies will protect their
biggest savers - perhaps with only a half-point cut. But if you have a small
sum on instant access, you might find the return is now very low indeed.
The chances are that this compromise will satisfy neither savers nor
borrowers. Criticism may well focus on one particular point - why do
societies make a profit? They are mutual societies, after all, supposedly
run for their members' benefit. Surely, in such straitened times, they
should let their profits take the strain by squeezing their margins?
The flaw in this argument is that the societies' desire for profit has in
part been fuelled by the regulators. They have been quick to deliver any
small society which dips into loss into the hands of one of the top 10. Even
if the Treasury and the Building Society Commission made it clear that
profits were no longer the be-all and end-all, that might not help. The
money markets would react adversely to poor profit figures from a society -
and force up the cost of its borrowings. Even worse, depositors might take
fright and withdraw their savings.
So, what is the consumer to do? Borrowers should consider that mortgage
rates may well have fallen as far as they are likely to go; the next base
rate cut might see mortgage rates drop only a quarter of a percentage point.
That makes the argument for fixing rates at present levels compelling
(although you should watch out for onerous conditions).
Savers are faced with some difficult choices. They will need to keep on
their toes and not allow their money to rot in an uncompetitive account. Tax
efficiency is vital. Do both spouses use their full personal allowances, for
example?
Some people reject Tessas because they think that they lock up their money
for five years. But, provided the scheme has no penalties, all that happens
if you withdraw money early is that you pay tax; if you leave your money in
a society, you will do that, anyway. What is more, most Tessas pay higher
rates than other savings accounts.
Realism also is needed, according to David Harris, of Chantrey Vellacott;
savers simply cannot expect the returns they got 12 or 18 months ago. So,
beware of plans that offer a very high income, as they probably involve a
significant risk to capital. A rule of thumb is to look at yields on
long-dated gilts which are now between 8.5 and 9 per cent. Any product
yielding above that level must involve risk.
Gilts are worth considering, but care is needed. Many are trading above face
value; thus, you are locking in a long-term capital loss. You can also make
a loss in the short term if gilt prices fall. The best way of buying gilts,
therefore, is to think only of the yield and hold the bonds till maturity.
Harris says bond funds may now be better than holding gilts directly. There
are low-charging funds, such as Abtrust Gilt Income, which has no initial
charge and yields 9 per cent; or the Murray Global, which has an initial
charge of only 1 per cent and yields 7.4 per cent (although this has an
element of currency risk).
Finally, equities. As I argued last week, this is not the time to stake your
all in shares. But as the BZW study shows (see page IV), they are the best
long-run investment. Yields of 4.4 per cent are comparable with returns on
instant access accounts. A regular savings plan is a good way to get the
best out of shares while reducing the risk of plunging in at the top of the
market.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Markets: Hope for small companies? - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MUST be that time of year again. Followers of small companies are
beginning to mutter about recovery - much as they did at the beginning of
last year. This time, however, there may be better grounds for optimism.
Trading volumes at the lowest end of the market have been noticeably higher
in December and January. This contrasts with 1991 when prices shot up but
volume was absent.
'We have noticed the buzz,' says John Houlihan, of the small companies team
at Hoare Govett. 'Lots of people who haven't said 'good morning' for three
years are now coming over to my desk]' There is also evidence that the rate
of collapse of small companies - as measured by the Hoare Govett Small
Companies (HGSC) index - appears to have peaked. Just 43 companies became
valueless over the course of the year against a record 50 in 1991.
Professors Elroy Dimson and Paul Marsh, who prepare the index, suggest that
'surviving small companies are a stronger breed. They are now better able to
survive the recession.' Yet, the biggest reason for optimism must be the
recent cut in interest rates. The government's decision to quit the exchange
rate mechanism offered the one real boost to the depressed small companies'
sector last year.
'The difference between last year and this year is that this time we know
growth is going to happen,' says Richard Hickinbotham, small companies'
analyst at SG Warburg. 'If there is not enough evidence to sustain that
view, then rates will go lower.'
As rates decline, investors will be tempted increasingly away from saving
and into the equity market. Houlihan maintains that the small company sector
is sitting on the brink of a recovery. 'If only a small proportion of funds
on deposit even attempts to go to small companies, you have a quantum
change,' he says. Such change would be welcome to the sector, which has had
an unprecedented fourth year of underperformance compared with the FTA All
Share.
The statistics for 1992 make gloomy reading: earnings have declined and
dividends fallen for the third successive year in real terms. Small
companies offered a capital gain of just 3.9 per cent and a total return,
including reinvested dividends, of only 8.5 per cent. This compares with
14.8 and 20.5 per cent respectively for the FT-A All Share. The real
performers last year seem to have been medium-sized companies.
Despite the bad news, Dimson and Marsh have found some cause for
celebration. Small company investment trusts outperformed the HGSC as a
whole, with a return of 15 per cent. Yet, even this is subject to a caveat:
investment trusts tend to be weighted more heavily in the top end of the
small company sector - ie, the medium-sized stocks.
The long-term outperformance of smaller companies continues. Just Pounds 1
invested in the HGSC in 1955 would have returned Pounds 556 today -
including the reinvestment of dividends - against Pounds 151 for the All
Share.
Since 1955, Dimson and Marsh argue, the total return on the HGSC has been
more than 18 per cent - a 4 per cent premium relative to the All Share.
Dividend growth over 38 years continues to progress at a higher rate than on
the All Share. But the number of investors prepared to stick it out for 38
years are few. Recovery for small stocks may be overdue, but enthusiasm
should be tempered with realism.
Smaller companies are likely to depend more on the UK economy than their
larger colleagues. So, any market recovery must be tied to an upturn in the
economy. The chart above shows how closely the relative performance of the
HGSC follows swings in gross domestic product. On a five-year pattern, say
Dimson and Marsh, annualised rates of return from the HGSC are likely to lag
behind the All Share for several years.
Such warnings aside, the bulls remain insistent on an 18-month view. 'The
sector has taken costs out and is highly operationally geared,' says
Hickinbotham. Hoare Govett agrees: 'Investors are likely to be pleasantly
surprised by the recovery in earnings in 1993 and 1994.'

FT  30 JAN 93 / What a laugh] Now anarchy is respectable: Comedy has
replaced pop music as the stairway to the stars for the young and talented.
Antony Thorncroft reports on radical changes in a cut-throat world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS a rough Friday night Up the Creek and the comedians were taking
casualties. One young man, covering his whimsy inadequately with a guitar,
first reduced the audience to silence; then set it talking among itself;
and, finally, brought out the hecklers. Realising his cause was hopeless, he
quit the stage suddenly.
'Where's he gone?' said Malcolm Hardee, the bemused compere and owner of the
comedy club in Greenwich, south-east London. 'He was crap, wasn't he?' A few
minutes later in the pub next door, Hardee, a veteran of the comedy circuit,
was buying the young man a drink, building him up and sketching out his
career.
In the cut-throat world of 'alternative' comedy, there is no room for faint
hearts, sensitive nerves or delusions of grandeur. But there are plenty of
opportunities for making a great deal of money, very quickly. Comedy has
replaced pop music as the stairway to the stars for the young and the
talented.
It is very different comedy from the quick-fire gags of the old music hall
comedians, or northern comics. It is even further removed from the satire of
the first wave of graduate comedians. The performers rely more on charm than
vicious wit. In some clubs, you can pass a whole evening without hearing one
joke.
Instead, the comedians talk about the most intimate aspects of their lives,
expecting to strike chords with their audience. It is the humour of group
therapy, of shared embarrassment. A male comedian can build an entire act
around the ritual of undressing in front of a new girl friend; a female
comedian on how chocolates provide real joy while sex is just a wet patch in
the bed.
Take Harry Hill, who is halfway up the ladder. Hill trained as a doctor and
remains one when times get desperate. But, as a medical student, he found
that appearing in the end-of-year show was the best part of the course. So,
after qualifying, he mixed working in a hospital with working the clubs. 'It
was easy:  you could just turn up at an open spot and perform.' Most comedy
clubs have open spots on certain nights where you get five minutes to do
your stuff. If you are any good, you are spotted by the club manager or
other comedians, invited back - and paid.
Hill covered the country gaining experience, receiving the typical fee of
Pounds 30 for a 20-minute spot. Often, the deal would be a percentage of the
box office take (which, invariably, was nothing) or a free meal. often, he
was booed off. His mixture of mild jokes ('I was walking home last night and
a man said 'Give me your wallet.' I blame all these self-assertiveness
classes') and surreal word play delivered in a bemused, confiding style,
rather like the late Harry Worth, makes the audience work.
Hill was doing all the right things, though. He was writing lots of new
material; he was earning an extra Pounds 100 a week by sending jokes to the
Radio 4 programme Week Ending; and he was preparing his act for the
Edinburgh festival fringe, the annual showcase for new comedy where TV and
radio producers who cannot bother to trawl the London clubs look for talent.
Hill lost Pounds 1,000 appearing at the 1991 fringe but he was voted the
most promising newcomer last August by the Perrier pick-of-the-fringe
judges.
Suddenly, his career moved up two notches. Now, club bookers ring him. He
can make Pounds 100 or more for an appearance, and, if he had the energy,
like the music hall stars of old, he could dash around London doing three
gigs a night. Hill has appeared on television and this month he is recording
a pilot for Radio 4. He reckons he is earning as much as when he was a
full-time doctor. He also has Avalon, the leading management company riding
the comedy boom, to plot the development of his career.
In the three years that Hill has been in the business, it has changed out of
all recognition. Take the experience of Jack Dee. He is a contemporary of
Hill who worked in a restaurant by day and the clubs at night. In 1991, he
caught the eye of the Perrier judges, and the television producers, with his
cool, staccato delivery and made the break quickly from the club circuit to
the national stage. He has his own TV show and, by touring the land, can
earn more than Pounds 6,000 a night filling 2,000-seat theatres. There is
the Jack Dee video, the Jack Dee spots on North American television, the
Jack Dee beer commercials. All that remains is the Jack Dee movie.
What has transformed the comedy world has been the voracious appetite of
radio and television, stimulated in the past year by the new commercial
television contractors. There had always been a tradition of bright young
graduates becoming comedy stars - a tradition linking the Beyond the Fringe
quartet with the Monty Python team, with Rowan Atkinson and Not the Nine
O'Clock News. Then came Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders, Ben Elton, and
Rik Mayall, who got their start in the comedy clubs which first appeared in
the UK around 1980. But this graduate flow was always the anarchic
alternative to mainstream comedy: now, it is mainstream comedy.
The heads of light entertainment at the BBC and the commercial television
stations woke up suddenly to the fact that the day of the traditional comics
 -who tended to be northerners such as Ken Dodd, Russ Abbott and Cannon and
Ball - was over. For decades, the prime-time weekend TV spots were hogged by
variety shows and old-style funnymen. Overnight, the audience was no longer
laughing, leaving the way open to the 'alternatives.' The turnaround is
remarkable. Switch on Radio 4 early evening and late at night and you are
likely to hear one of the new breed, Nick Revell perhaps or Richard Herring.
Radio 5 commissions comedy. Even Radio 1 has a comedy spot, with club
stand-ups Mark Thomas and Kevin Day.
It was Radio 1 which first transmitted The Mary Whitehouse Experience, the
work of four young writer-performers, Baddiel and Newman and Punt and
Dennis, who previously had contributed jokes to Week Ending. The show moved
to television and became a youth cult. Now, the two duos tour the country
like old-fashioned rock acts, playing student unions and filling the
3,500-seat Hammersmith Apollo in London for four nights  - at a fee of
around Pounds 10,000 a night. And, unlike the rock acts with their expensive
'roadies' and lighting crews, the comedians travel light and are more
reliable. Richard Alan Turner of Avalon, who manages Baddiel and Newman, is
now talking with Columbia Pictures in Hollywood about a Dollars 5m movie for
the pair.
Jonathan James-Moore, head of BBC Radio light entertainment, has watched the
changes at first hand. 'We were interested in the new wave of comedians from
the start. I went down to the Comedy Store (London's oldest comedy club)
when it first opened in 1979 and recorded four hours of material. We edited
it down to 15 minutes and it was still too crude for the powers-that-be.'
Since then, attitudes have changed on both sides. The comedians have become
less aggressive while the BBC has become bolder. For James-Moore, the
greatest changes in the past few years have been in the style of comedy and
in the voracious appetite of television. Today's comedians develop story
lines rather than simply firing off a succession of jokes. As for
television, it has an insatiable appetite for comedians. James-Moore notes:
'The companies lurch above us like vultures picking our vital organs.'
Not all comedians are tempted by television. Hill's ambition is to have his
own show, but he is suspicious of making one-off appearances. 'You might get
Pounds 700 for a five-minute spot but you use up all your best material.' A
successful female comedian, Jo Brand, once heard her club audience repeat
the punch-lines of some of the material she had used on TV the previous
night.
Other club comedians make a virtue of refusing to appear on television (or
perhaps they are not asked). They are the remnants of the days when the
circuit was political - when you got an easy laugh by comparing the former
prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, unfavourably with King Herod. These days,
few political comedians remain: they have lost heart. Paul Blackman, of
Battersea Arts Centre in south London, thinks audiences and performers are
more at ease with themselves.' They are comfortable with being anti-sexist
and anti-racist and anything goes. You can tell mother-in-law jokes again
and get away with it.'
Already, though, old-timers are complaining that success has ruined comedy.
Audiences come to see their TV heroes and are tamer. Heckling is rare. Some
clubs are programming novelty acts, magicians and fire-eaters and moving
towards an old-fashioned vaudeville bill. Few these days will give an open
spot to a new face without an audition.
Management is taking over. Companies such as Avalon, which has increased its
turnover from Pounds 100,000 to more than Pounds 2m in four years, looks for
comedians with writing potential who can develop from creating one-liners to
writing plays and TV sit-coms. This path was pioneered by Elton and has been
travelled by Sean Hughes and Arthur Smith (whose West End hit, An Evening
with Gary Lineker, is being adapted to fit Australian football). Avalon
makes sure that its artists do not blow a club routine, which has kept them
living comfortably for three years, for the glory of a six-week TV series.
It knows that the big financial rewards lie in corporate entertainment,
voice-overs, and videos.
Avalon's main management rival, Off the Kerb, run by Addison Cresswell,
still backs the stand-ups. He describes the primrose path. 'It's the club
circuit; Edinburgh; a first TV series. Then comes the difficult one, the
second series. You call in writers and you are lost to the world of
sit-com.' Some of his stable of comedians, notably Julian Clary, have
managed the transition successfully but Cresswell is suspicious of writers.
'They become prima donnas. They all want to get into films.' Cresswell is
happy packaging programmes of stand-ups to tour the country, sponsored by
beer companies such as Holsten. The brewers have been quick to appreciate
the link between the uninhibited, anarchic atmosphere in a comedy club and
selling lots of drink.
While alternative comedy now is mainstream, it still looks to the clubs for
constant revitalisation. Little of the wealth has trickled down there; they
remain, in the words of Kim Kinney, 'the factory floor.' Kinney manages the
Comedy Store, an underground shoe box in Soho which crams in 240 people and,
until recently, was unwilling to expand. The Comedy Store gave a first
chance to Elton, Mayall, French and Saunders, Alexei Sayle, and more. Now,
perhaps jolted by the success of Jongleurs  - which, last month, opened
another outlet in a former rock club, Dingwalls, at north London's Camden
Lock - it is moving to larger premises nearby.
Jongleurs was spurred by events in the US, where new comedy is a big
business: two cable channels concentrate on comedy and Catch a Falling Star
has established 20 comedy clubs around the country. Like the Comedy Store,
Jongleurs was content for years to pack its club in Battersea with yuppies.
Now, it aspires to expand into the regions. As proof that new comedy is
supreme, it is keen to book the older generation of comedians - the Ronnie
Corbetts, the Dave Allens and the Billy Connollys - if they are prepared to
perform for a percentage of the door money. But the Comedy Store and
Jongleurs are not the only important venues in London: there is also the
East Dulwich Tavern which now also runs the 350-seat Civic, created from a
moribund community centre in Peckham.
Many are suspicious of the changes. To them, comedy is being used as an
opiate rather than as a weapon to speed the revolution, and as a way of
persuading people to laugh their way through the recession. What began as
anarchy and an anti-Establishment tirade - the riposte of radical youth to
the seeming inevitability of Thatcher's Britain - has been consumed by show
business. Some keep the faith, though. Marxist comedian Jeremy Hardy prefers
to perform at community arts centres: for him, the clubs have become a night
out for hen parties and celebratory young professionals.
Much of the humour is indeed escapist and whimsical. Here is comedian Hattie
Hayridge overcoming her fear of air travel: 'There is a one in a 100m chance
of being on a plane with a bomb on board. It's one in 400m against being on
a plane with two bombs on board. So, I always carry one with me to improve
the odds.' Even more of it is scatological: Arthur Smith has built a good
living on a celebrated routine which begins: 'Whatever happened to white dog
shit?' But the insatiable demand for new talent, for variety, still breaks
through.
Hill is likely to become a star because he is safe, charming and funny. In
the clubs, he will leave behind acts like Woody Bob Muddy, who recreates a
Roman circus by whipping up the audience to a frenzy as it shouts out which
old albums should go to 'Record Heaven' and which should be nailed to a
board and smashed to pieces by his silver hammer. As the hysterical crowd
saves Abba and dooms Buck's Fizz, you admire the skill with which
alternative comedy has enabled eccentrics to share their secret worlds and
the British to shake off their inhibitions.

<TEXT>
IT IS HIGH time to restructure your economic model or, better, to throw it
away. If you feed in the current economic data for the British economy your
screen is liable to flash up the message 'does not compute'.
Judging by the foreign trade data Britain must be booming, with the monthly
current account deficit for December jumping to Pounds 1.54bn and imports 7
1/2 per cent higher than a year earlier. We also know that industrial
production is down and unemployment is shooting up. Meanwhile it looks as
though the narrow version of the money supply, M0, is bursting through the 4
per cent ceiling of its official target growth range, while in complete
contrast the broad version, M4, is slowing down to a degree - growth of just
3.7 per cent year-on-year - which is beginning to alarm monetarists.
This week the traditional signs of British economic mismanagement were
strongly in evidence. A hasty and ill-prepared one-point cut in short-term
interest rates was ordered on Tuesday, but on Wednesday the Pounds 2.5bn
auction of 14-year gilt-edged almost flopped, which is especially disturbing
given that it is only the first of many such sales which the Bank of England
will have to organise this year.
Meanwhile share prices jumped for joy at the hints of further devaluation
and inflation to come, although rights issues from struggling retailers have
brought a reminder that in buoyant markets unselective demand tends to
encourage low quality supply.
With excellent timing, brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd produced on Tuesday
the latest edition of their Equity &amp; Gilt Study, the one which annually
spells out just how much of a swindle gilts have proved to be over the
years. During the entire 74 years of the study gilts have returned just 1.2
per cent pre-tax a year on average after inflation, which means that a
taxpayer would almost certainly have suffered a real loss. In contrast,
equities have returned an inflation-adjusted 7.3 per cent (income plus
capital growth).
The defrauding of gilt-edged investors has varied considerable in its
intensity, however. The worst period was in the 30 years or so after the
war, during which a gilt-edged portfolio lost three-quarters of its real
value even with gross income reinvested. But recently things have got much
better. Over the past ten years, with the Thatcher government getting a grip
on the economy and then with John Major taking the UK into the European
exchange rate mechanism, real returns on gilts have averaged a very
acceptable 6 per cent a year. Honest money was being restored. Indeed, in
1992, despite our exit from the ERM, the gross return on gilt-edged was 17
per cent while inflation was only 4 per cent.
But the reversal of policy now appears to be almost complete. Remember that
a year ago short-term interest rates were at 10 1/2 per cent and the
overwhelming policy objective was the reduction of inflation. Now, interest
rates are at 6 per cent and could easily be below 5 per cent soon. That is
one reason why the money supply numbers are going haywire. But the
government is being panicked by the unemployment figures. If the price of an
economic recovery is another dive in the sterling exchange rate, the
government now seems unlikely to resist it, and will simply ignore any
'temporary' overshooting of its 4 per cent tolerance limit for underlying
inflation: the falls in mortgage rates will, of course, ensure that the
headline rate for inflation will remain very low, at least until the early
part of 1994.
By a curious coincidence the German inflation rate hit 4.4 per cent this
week. But you can be sure that the Bundesbank will not relax its struggle,
whereas the Bank of England has to do the bidding of its masters at the
Treasury. I am surprised by just how cynical institutional investors in the
City of London have become about the prospects of being given a fair deal in
gilts as the government cranks up its huge borrowing spree.
Certainly, given the choice between ten-year gilts yielding 8.1 per cent and
French government bonds yielding 7.9 per cent it is easy to see why a lot of
British institutions prefer the Parisian paper. British pension funds now
have more money - twice as much, the latest figures suggest - in foreign
bonds than in gilts, and if these attitudes persist a funding crunch could
be closer than I have supposed.
In this context, a fascinating chapter of the BZW study is highly relevant.
Using an optimisation model the brokers suggest that on the basis of the
historical data a rational UK investor would not hold any gilts in a
long-term portfolio; he should either hold 100 per cent in equities, or a
proportion of short-term deposits if he wishes to reduce the volatility. The
implication is that in the past gilts have not yielded a big enough margin
over cash to reward the extra risk. Indeed, until four months ago long gilts
were yielding less than money market deposits.
In opening an increasing gap between short-term and long-term rates Norman
Lamont is beginning to address this problem. But he is also, of course,
sending out strong hints to the foreign exchange market that he is prepared
to allow sterling to slide.
What about the other method of steepening the yield curve, by pushing up the
yields on long gilts from 9 to 10 or 11 per cent? Such were the hair-raising
tactics used in the 1970s. But in those days British institutions were a
captive market because they could not invest overseas. Nowadays their
response to official desperation is likely to be an increasing determination
to seek refuge in better currencies.
As for the government, the economic computers may be on the blink and the
way ahead is obscure. But we have the historical statistics that tell us how
administrations like this one behave.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Japan penalises China's exports: Tokyo turns aggressor in
anti-dump action against 100 companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN, often the victim of anti-dumping actions, has become the aggressor
for the first time. It imposed penalties yesterday on more than 100 Chinese
companies for alleged predatory pricing of their exports.
Tokyo has been targeted so often in anti-dumping cases that it has led a
campaign to review the regulations. As a result, it was a touch defensive
yesterday in explaining the decision to impose duties, ranging from 4.5 to
27.2 per cent, on Chinese exports of ferrosilicon manganese, used in steel
production.
The sense of unease was heightened by Japan's own anger this week at being
on Washington's hit-list of countries whose steel producers are allegedly
dumping in the US. Government officials have variously described the US
decision as 'unfair' and 'outrageous'.
Last night it was China's turn to complain. A trade ministry official in
Beijing regretted the Japanese decision: 'Since the Japanese government did
not take into account factual materials, the relevant companies feel
wronged.'
The finding partly reflects changes in trading patterns. Japanese industries
are now pressed by lower-cost Asian producers. A decade ago, the US and
Europe were under similar pressure from Japan and resorted to anti-dumping
regulations.
Japanese officials insist the dumping investigation, begun in October 1991
after a complaint from local producers of ferrosilicon manganese, was
conducted honourably. The government concluded that unfair pricing led to a
leap in China's share of the Japanese market from 17 per cent in 1989 to 39
per cent last year.
Mr Yoshiro Mori, minister for international trade and industry, said the
decision was 'fair and transparent'. The government would 'remain careful
about abusing anti-dumping measures when pressed by protectionist industry
forces'.
The trade and finance ministries also investigated producers from South
Africa and Norway, but concluded they had not injured the Japanese industry.
About 103 Chinese companies, most of them state-owned, will be subject to
the duties from next Wednesday. Two others were given a reprieve after
promising to lift export prices. Japanese investigators had difficulty in
determining whether the companies independently set prices, as Beijing
claimed, or whether the 25 per cent fall in the Chinese price since 1989 had
received central approval.
The Japanese government had previously threatened to impose dumping duties
on South Korean knitwear exporters, but these companies reluctantly agreed
to 'voluntary restraints' on their exports before the duties were formally
imposed.
Last year, Japanese cotton spinners warned they would launch a dumping
action against Pakistani and Indonesian exporters. An executive at one
Japanese textile company said the industry was in 'a similar situation to US
carmakers'.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Major urges business to seize export opportunities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR renewed his appeal to British business last night to seize the
chance presented by the low levels of UK interest rates and inflation and
make the most of export opportunities.
The prime minister's call came after he returned to Britain from Saudi
Arabia where he had agreed with King Fahd the sale of 48 Tornado aircraft to
the Gulf state as part of a defence package estimated to be worth Pounds
4bn-Pounds 5bn to the UK.
The 1990s would be the most competitive decade business had ever seen, the
prime minister said, and industry would need to invest in technology and
training to succeed.
After a week in which his success in contributing to export orders for
British business in India and the Gulf had been hailed by industry, Mr Major
underlined the importance of a range of export markets and the opportunities
offered in the European single market.
In particular, he highlighted the Far East, and the expanding US market,
especially in the light of the UK's current exchange rate.
'We need merchant venturers, not merchants of gloom,' he told a Tory
fund-raising dinner in Glasgow. 'It is time to start selling Britain abroad,
and stop selling Britain short,' he said.
The UK's attractions to foreign investors were manifest, Mr Major said,
citing the recent decision by Hoover to relocate from Dijon in France to
Cambuslang in Scotland, creating 450 jobs.
Mr Major's remarks came against a background chorus of ministerial speeches
seeking to reap the benefit of his trade mission, which was slightly
overshadowed by his decision to take legal action for libel against two
magazines.
He promised that government would continue to listen to industry's requests.
His speech will have reinforced business hopes that the Budget will contain
measures to promote investment and help exporters.
In advance of the government's forthcoming policy paper on the relationship
of Scotland within the UK, Mr Major admitted that there was a widespread
feeling that government was too remote and did not properly recognise
Scotland's status.
While making it clear that the Union was 'non-negotiable', he emphasised the
scope for building on Scotland's existing political institutions.

FT  30 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: US economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to escape the conclusion that the US economy is on the mend. Even
allowing that durable goods orders are among the most volatile economic
indicators, yesterday's unusually strong data looks like the genuine
article. The recovery in orders was well spread throughout the economy. That
was enough to propel the dollar higher. The worry is that recent labour
market indicators have been ominously weak.
If the behaviour of money-market interest rates is anything to go by, the
market no longer seriously believes the Federal Reserve will raise interest
rates. Mr Alan Greenspan's testimony to Congress this week contained clear
overtures to the Clinton administration. Higher interest rates would put
that budding relationship at risk. Equally, the recent spate of strong
economic figures makes another cut less likely to the markets. Such a move
would, incidentally, undermine the main argument for buying the dollar: that
the interest rate differential between the US and Germany is set to narrow.
Yesterday's dollar rally owed much to relief that the bull case remains
dominant.
An economic recovery without higher employment, though, would be a pyrrhic
victory for President Clinton. A weak labour market might undermine the
improvement in consumer confidence required to sustain recovery. The market
may be getting ahead of itself in ruling out another cut in US rates. The
Fed could still make such a gesture in return for a deal on the budget
deficit and next week's employment figures could weigh heavily on the
dollar.

Given near-universal scepticism, Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive,
deserves some credit for sticking to his prediction that the company would
land an order for Tornado fighters from Saudi Arabia. Following the
resuscitation of the European Fighter Aircraft project, the Saudi deal goes
a long way to securing BAe's revenue line. And the joint venture in regional
jets with Taiwan has plugged the main hole leaking cash. After the shock of
last September's interim figures and the Pounds 1bn-worth of provisions, the
company has regained an even keel.
The market has responded to the new management's sense of purpose and an
increasing belief in the company's recovery. Enthusiasm may well pull the
shares higher still. Yet while some big issues have been settled,
improvements in profitability from now on will be steady rather than
spectacular. Costs will come out of the business, but margins on the Pounds
10bn turnover will remain thin for some years.
The share rating, while not expensive, reflects the recent good news. There
is also a lingering cloud over Airbus. With the market weak, more orders may
be cancelled. The consortium's progress to positive cash flow has been
slowed once more.
The board has delivered on its promises. While it would not do to be
churlish, that success must not distract the directors from tackling the
endemic inefficiencies which have dogged the company for years.

FT  30 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Burton
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders who stumped up 30p a share to rescue Burton in the 1991 rights
issue have done pretty nicely. Those who choose to take up their rights this
time will find it harder to double their money. From the company's point of
view the issue is clearly sensible: gearing at the year-end will be almost
halved to an acceptable 27 per cent. The management gains the flexibility it
badly needs to rejuvenate its store chains - some of which have not been
refurbished for 10 years. The recovery story, which the City badly wants to
believe, has been put on a sounder financial footing.
Yet high commercial risks remain. There is no guarantee that the money will
be spent effectively. Some chains, like Evans, are starting to test new
store formats, but the results are not yet quantifiable. Others, like Burton
menswear, require a total rethink. After the experiences of the 1980s, it
may be an advantage that the company is not dominated by a single retailing
visionary, but flair will be needed to capture the fickle fashion market. It
is not yet clear that Burton has the spark.
Then there is the question of all those different chains. An internal study
has concluded that the company does not have too much space. But the chains
need to be rationalised and the culture changed. Perhaps the difficulty in
placing shop leases is a deterrent to slimming down the group. Investors
will need strong nerves. It would strengthen resolve if the management were
seen to be hacking through the thicket of shops.

FT  30 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Inflated expectations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What a pity the government handled Tuesday's rate cut so badly. Lower
interest rates and a cheaper currency are probably both necessary if growth
is to be restored while the balance of payments remains in such large
deficit. It looks increasingly as though a steeper yield curve and a lower
pound are also needed to fund next year's PSBR. Only if the pound is seen to
have room to appreciate will foreigners be inclined to buy gilts in any
size. By springing the cut as a surprise in the middle of a gilts auction,
though, the government seemed to have taken fright over the short-term
course of the economy rather than to be implementing a carefully-planned
strategy.
This only adds to the sense that the end result will be inflation. Indeed,
the prospect of lower rates and currency depreciation have left
institutional investors feeling remarkably comfortable with equities. They
see little incentive to switch to gilts. No wonder a rush of rights issues
emerged this week. Presumably there are more to come. That may put a brake
on further equity market advance, but the government appears as stuck with
its funding dilemma as ever.
Whichever way one cuts the figures, there seems no way the 1993-94 PSBR can
be funded without a substantial inflow of foreign money and a much larger
shift into gilts than domestic investors have hitherto been prepared to
contemplate. A significantly weaker pound may be needed to produce the
former. Given the perceived inflationary implications, sharply lower gilt
prices may be needed to stimulate the latter. That could mean long yields
closer to 10 per cent than 9.

John Major's announcement on Thursday of the Pounds 4bn-Pounds 5bn Saudi

But apart from Saudi Arabia, the Tornado has found no clients outside the

FT  30 JAN 93 / Banks cut rates on savings more than mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND Bank and Firstdirect, its telephone banking arm, have cut their
savings rates by more than their mortgage rates following this week's
1-point base rate cut. Along with Lloyds Bank, both have also not passed on
the full base-rate reduction to mortgage holders.
The savings rate cuts are the first to be be announced by leading financial
institutions since Tuesday's base rate change. Building societies have not
yet announced new savings rates but have said they did not pass on the full
1-point cut to mortgage holders in order to protect savers.
The new base rate is 6 per cent. Midland and Lloyds have set a mortgage rate
of 7.99 per cent. This represents a drop of 0.56 of a point for Midland and
of 0.61 of a point for Lloyds. Firstdirect has cut its rate by 0.54 of a
point to 7.95 per cent.
'Our mortgage book was running at a loss when base rates were 15 per cent,'
said Mr Brendan Le Morvan of Midland. 'Since then we have tried to restore
the margins.' Its mortgage margin has widened from 0.4 point to 1.99 points.
Midland is reducing almost all gross savings rates by 1 point, with a
handful going down by 0.75 of a point and one by 1.25 points. At Lloyds,
savings rates are being cut between 0.5 of a point and 1 point.
Midland and Lloyds also announced a reduction in credit card and overdraft
rates. The annual percentage rate on Midland's credit cards will drop to
23.1 per cent from 25.3 per cent from March 2. From Monday, rates will fall
by 1.3 to 1.4 points for overdrafts.

FT  30 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Economic data fail to give
spur to Dow
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices moved in a narrow range yesterday as investors struggled to
find interest in stocks in spite of some further good economic data, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 3.78 at 3,31 .03. The
more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended 0.15 firmer at 438.81, while
the Amex composite finished 0.59 higher at 411.08, and the Nasdaq composite
closed up 1.67 at 696.34. Trading volume on the NYSE was 248m shares, and
rises outnumbered declines by 1000 to 805.
The day's economic news should have been positive for the market. New
factory orders for durable goods, a notoriously volatile and unreliable
indicator, surged 9.1 per cent in December, the largest monthly gain in more
than a year. Other data showed that personal income rose by 1.0 per cent and
personal spending climbed 0.5 per cent last month, both solid increases.
Although the figures were all stronger than analysts had expected, they were
not enough to encourage much buying of stocks. Investors, it seemed, had
decided to take their cue from the bond market, which fell during the
morning on the data. Although bond prices later recovered, investor
enthusiasm for stocks remained muted.
Among individual stocks, Xerox jumped Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 85 3/4 in
spite of news of a Dollars 736m net loss in the final quarter of last year,
compared with a profit of Dollars 91m a year earlier. The shares held up
well because earnings were affected by special one off charges, and because
the company issued positive statements about the outlook for this year.
Pfizer eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 65 in busy trading after broking house
PaineWebber downgraded its investment rating on the stock due to
uncertainties surrounding a class-action lawsuit that might be filed against
the company alleging that a unit of Pfizer manufactured defective artificial
hips.
Airline stocks rebounded from news earlier in the week of bad fourth quarter
earnings. Delta rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 51 7/8 , AMR, parent of
American Airlines, put on Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 63 1/8 , and UAL climbed
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 123 1/2 .
Cellular telephone companies remained under heavy pressure over speculation
that use of the telephones causes health problems. Motorola slumped Dollars
4 7/8 to Dollars 51, and on the Nasdaq market, McCaw Cellular dropped
Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 32 1/2 and LIN Broadcasting fell Dollars 3 3/4 to
Dollars 78 1/4 .
Canada
TORONTO SHARE prices ended the week little changed in active trading.
According to preliminary data, the 300 composite lost 2.45 points, or 0.0
per cent, closing at 3,305.47. Advancing issues led declines 352 to 265,
volume fell to 40.73m shares from 46.16m shares yesterday, and trading value
was CDollars 363.9m compared with CDollars 458.4m.
Northern Telecom fell 2 1/4 to 54 7/8 . The company said its president and
chief operating officer, Jean Monty, will replace

FT  30 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris losses ground after
interest rate speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORPORATE news dominated trading yesterday, while the stronger dollar also
helped to lift a number of markets, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS, however, retreated after good morning gains on a rumour that base
rates were to be raised. The banking sector fell: Paribas, which after the
close reported provisional 1992 earnings below some analysts' expectations,
lost FFr10.60 at FFr363.20; Societe Generale eased FFr13 to FFr586; and Suez
slipped FFr1.50 to FFr255.
The CAC-40 index, which had seen a day's high of 1,801.26, fell steadily in
the afternoon to close 8.43 lower at 1,772.21, down 2.6 per cent on the
week. Options expiry boosted turnover to FFr3.1bn.
Alcatel, accounting for 10 per cent of the day's volume, recovered some of
Thursday's losses with a rise of FFr10 to FFr620, while Lafarge Coppee,
whose US unit reported disappointing 1992 earnings, eased FFr12 to FFr307.
FRANKFURT saw some individual moves on company news as the DAX index closed
4.01 higher at 1,571.85, down 1 per cent on the week. Turnover stayed low at
DM4.3bn, down from DM4.8bn on Thursday.
Volkswagen ended DM4.80 up at DM278.30 with a single large order hanging
over the market and Allianz, the insurer, rose DM18 to DM2,072 for a two-day
gain of DM38 on further talk of derivatives market influence.
Metallgesellschaft fell DM10 to DM329, down DM22 on the week, on a sharp
drop in profits and the confirmation of a dividend cut.
Among second liners, tough staff reductions at Kugelfischer, the ball
bearings company, took the shares up DM3.50 to DM88.50; but PWA, the
papermaker, fell DM6.50 marks to DM154 as it reported a collapse in 1992
profits.
AMSTERDAM was encouraged by the firmer dollar and stronger oil prices with
Royal Dutch up Fl 2.00 at Fl 147.90 as the CBS Tendency index rose 0.4 to
97.6, down 1.2 per cent on the week.
Daf slipped Fl 1.15 to Fl 6.05 in spite of news that it had secured
short-term financing; investors remained worried over long-term prospects.
ZURICH was supported by strong domestic demand in a moderately active
session. The SMI index finished 18.5 higher at 2,091.1, a fall on the week
of 0.5 per cent.
Roche certificates led industrials higher with a SFr60 rise to SFr4,100
after falls earlier in the week, when investors were reported to be
switching out of the stock. Sandoz certificates added SFr30 to SFr3,110.
Adia fell SFr11 to SFr157 after Thursday's SFr27 decline in further reaction
to its worse than expected results.
SMH was in demand after favourable press comment on the prospects for its
Swatchmobile plans. The registered shares rose SFr60 to SFr1,555.
MILAN saw renewed strength in Fiat and the Comit index rose 8.89 to 486.91,
a rise of 0.9 per cent on the week.
Fiat ordinary fixed L340 higher at L4,340 and firmed to L4,410 after hours
in response to the better than expected results for 1992, announced after
the close on Thursday.
The positive tone spilled over into other industrials but the market also
derived some strength from good results from Banco Lariano. The shares,
widely held domestically, rose L350 to L4,950.
Montedison, down almost 14 per cent since the beginning of the week, firmed
L30 to L1,130, while its parent Ferruzzi rose L33 to L1,136.
The pick-up was attributed to the lack of any more of the bad news that had
dogged the shares during the week and recurring speculation that Montedison
might be planning a disposal.
BRUSSELS was lifted by a stronger steel sector. The Bel-20 index was 7.37
higher at 1,188.25, up 1.3 per cent on the week, in turnover of BFr1.3bn.
Cockerill added BFr6 to BFr100 while Clabecq put on BFr10 to BFr376.
STOCKHOLM recovered some of the ground lost during in previous session with
a rise in the Affarsvarlden index of 15.9 to 895.0, down 1.9 per cent on the
week. Electrolux B gained SKr7 to SKr217 ahead of its 1992 results due next
Thursday while Ericsson, the day's most active issue, saw its B shares
improve SKr4 to SKr176.
DUBLIN returned to the attack again after Thursday's interlude, and
continued speculation that the punt will be devalued saw the ISEQ overall
index rise 15.68 to 1,271.05, up 15.68 per cent on the week.
Brokers said that the punt looked safe for the weekend but that senior blue
chips including Bank of Ireland, up 2 1/2 p at IPounds 1.84, CRH, 6p better
at IPounds 2.13, and Smurfit, up 8p at IPounds 2.58, were bought on the view
that the government, sorely tested this week, will not be able to hold out
much longer.

FT  30 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Juniors outperform Canadian
heavyweights - The growing popularity of second and third-tier stocks with
Toronto investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors searching for the real action in Canadian stock markets these days
need to look beyond Toronto's benchmark TSE 300 index.
The index, which covers the 300 companies with the biggest market
capitalisations, bumped along in a narrow band between 3,400 and 3,600 for
most of 1992, ended the year 6.5 per cent lower than it began; it has fallen
further in 1993.
However, the TSE 300 is dominated by a few dozen heavyweight banks,
utilities and manufacturers. The top 50 companies make up 72 per cent of the
index's weight, with the next 50 contributing another 13 per cent.
Mr Michael Shannon, an analyst at Burns Fry in Montreal, notes that 'the
bottom 50 companies, which have 1.1 per cent of the index, could go
bankrupt, but so long as BCE (the telecommunications group which has a 7.7
per cent weighting) went up 15 or 20 per cent, the TSE 300 would show no
change'.
Most of the leading performers these days are among second and third-tier
companies. An index compiled by Burns Fry, which tracks the share prices of
companies in the bottom half of the TSE 300, together with about 200 others
with a market value of more than CDollars 15m (Dollars 11m), has performed
more strongly than the TSE 300 for more than two years.
On a total return basis, including dividends, the Burns Fry index climbed 19
per cent in 1991 and another 13 per cent last year.
The growing popularity of investments in smaller companies is reflected in a
proliferation of 'special opportunities', 'special growth' and 'capital
appreciation' mutual funds.
Many Canadian pension funds are for the first time setting aside some of
their cash flows for small-capitalisation investments.
Mr Sebastian van Berkom, a Montreal institutional portfolio manager
specialising in small-cap stocks, predicts that they will outperform
traditional mainline investments until at least the mid-1990s.
While hard to prove , smaller Canadian companies generally appear to have
responded more energetically to opportunities created by the 1989 US-Canada
free trade agreement.
Their managers are less preoccupied with cost-cutting and restructuring, and
have been able to give more attention to expansion and acquisitions.
Many are also in cyclical, export-oriented sectors, such as energy and
forest products, which have benefited more than the big banks and utilities
from a 13 per cent fall in the Canadian dollar over the past year.
Junior oil and gas producers and drillers have been especially popular among
investors. They have lower overheads than the giants of the energy industry
and have grown fast by picking up properties discarded by companies such as
Imperial Oil and Petro-Canada.
Mr John Embry, who manages Royal Bank of Canada's recently-launched Canadian
Growth Fund, says that 'the problem with the big companies is that they're
not even replacing their reserves. You're dependent on a higher oil price.'
Specialised lumber producers have been another small-capitalisation
favourite. While Canada's mainline forestry companies struggle to overcome
sluggish pulp and newsprint markets, the niche players in the timber
industry are making hay from the recent surge in North American lumber
prices and the fall in the Canadian dollar.
Less than two months after going public at CDollars 7.88 a share, Riverside
Forest Products of Vancouver is now trading at over CDollars 14. Its glamour
stems from the attractive price it paid for a lumber and plywood mill which
it bought from Fletcher Challenge Canada just as timber prices were taking
off last year.
Other popular lumber stocks include Slocan Forest Products, Green Forest
Lumber and International Forest Products. While portfolio managers are
confident that the cycle in small-cap stocks has at least a year or two to
run, they warn against being caught up in the excitement.
'You've got to be very selective and have a disciplined approach,' says Mr
Allan Jacobs, vice-president at Canada Life Investment Management in
Toronto. Mr Embry at Royal Bank says he has already become uncomfortable
with 'the degree of speculation and the valuations' of many high-technology
and bio-technology stocks.
As an example of a bubble waiting to burst, he cites Newbridge Networks, a
fast-growing supplier of telecommunications networks, whose share price has
rocketed in the past year from less than CDollars 10 to a peak earlier this
month of CDollars 61.88. Newbridge has slipped back by almost CDollars 5 in
the past week.
Mr Jacobs says that Canada Life's small-cap portfolio is limited to
companies with healthy balance sheets, strong management and a track record
of solid earnings.
Shares trading below book value would not be considered. 'The key is to buy
real companies,' he asserts.

BUENOS AIRES opened sharply higher following Thursday night's government
measures to boost market liquidity in the Argentine. These included cuts in
minimum reserve requirements, more flexible credit and banking rules, and
the near-elimination of stamp duty. The Merval index was 6.35 per cent
higher at 416.83 within the first half hour of trading .

FT  30 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei index eases after
week of recovery
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices moved marginally lower on late afternoon profit-taking, but
sentiment remained firm amid active trading throughout the day, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed down 39.63 at 17,023.78, 4.2 per cent higher on
the week, after a low of 16,950.44 and a high of 17,177.69. Active buying by
financial institutions and public funds countered arbitrage selling and
profit-taking, with share prices falling just before the close on large-lot
selling by a foreign broker.
Volume totaled 320m shares against 326m. Gains outnumbered losses by 544 to
404 with 179 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
gained 7.01 to 1,298.88 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.16 to
1,058.17.
Short sellers continued to cover positions, as speculation continued of an
imminent discount rate cut. Comments during parliament by Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa, the prime minister, dismissing worries of large-lot selling by
companies facing redemptions on equity linked bonds, eased fears over a weak
stock market ahead of the March year end book closing.
Trading in Oji Paper and Kanzaki Paper was suspended in the afternoon
session on reports of a merger. After the close the two companies announced
that they would merge in October at the ratio of five Oji shares to six
Kanzaki shares. Kanzaki rose Y11 to Y615 and Oji fell Y4 to Y871 before
trading was halted.
Some shipbuilding stocks extended gains on a comment by Mr Miyazawa that the
use of doubled hull tankers may become a strict requirement. Hitachi Zosen
rose Y11 to Y527 but Mitsui Shipbuilding fell Y6 to Y381 on profit-taking.
Nippon Housing Loan rose Y9 to Y289 on reports of a restructuring plan,
centring around rate cuts by its creditors. Isuzu Motors, was the volume
leader for the third straight trading day, rising Y3 to Y367 on active
buying by dealers.
In Osaka, the OSE average closed up 133.09 at 18,423.45 in volume of 44.3m
shares. Ono Pharmaceutical gained Y100 to Y5,570.
Roundup
Some bright spots emerged in Pacific Rim markets.
SINGAPORE overcame two days of resistance and the Straits Times Industrial
index closed at an all-time high in volume which picked up to 95.52m shares
from Thursday's 61.25m.
The index put on 21.93 to 1,620.16, or 1.7 per cent on the week. The
previous record of 1,607.12 was set on March 27, 1990. Recently neglected
shipyards were in demand.
HONG KONG more than halved sharp early losses as bargain hunters returned in
the afternoon. The Hang Seng index ended 53.10 lower 5,743.65, down 2.9 per
cent on the week. It had fallen 125 points in early trade after renewed
Sino-British wrangling over Hong Kong's future. Turnover stood at HKDollars
1.90bn.
Leading stocks led the losers, with HSBC Holdings falling HKDollars 1 to
HKDollars 60 after Thursday's HKDollars 1.50 decline.
BOMBAY continued to see speculative demand fuelled by expectations of an
expansionary budget at the end of next month. The BSE index nosed through
the 2,700 level briefly before closing at 2,680.79, up 35.43 on the day
on5.4 per cent on the week.
The recovery has taken place in spite of political uncertainty and the
lingering impact of bloody riots in Bombay earlier this month.
SEOUL ended lower for the fourth consecutive day as investors displayed
little interest in buying, brokers said.
The composite index closed 7.83 down at the month's low of 679.96, or 2.8
per cent lower on the week.
KUALA LUMPUR was led higher by Malayan Banking which rose 60 cents to
MDollars 9.60 after its 38 per cent rise in half-yearly net profits. The
composite index rose 6.08 to 624.49, little changed on the week.

FT  30 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Power sector setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in the regional electricity stocks (recs) and the power generators
(gencos) reeled under the impact of heavy selling pressure caused by
recommendations put forward by the House of Commons Select Committee which
has investigated the UK energy market.
Utilities specialists said the market took fright at the committee's call
for tighter regulation of the electricity distribution market, but pointed
out that it would be up to Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of
Trade, to decide on energy policy and that his decision would not be known
until the end of next month when the Energy White Paper will be published.
'It has to be stressed that these are only recommendations, not policy
decisions,' said an electricity specialist. What troubled the market, the
specialist said, was a reference to excessive rates of return in the
electricity distribution industry. The generators were hit by the
inferenceof increased price regulation on the generation of electricity.
Although closing well above the day's lowest levels both sectors ended
sharply lower. Midland was the worst performer in the 'recs', closing 18 off
at 440p, while London dropped 17 to 422p. Southern, the sector's only
Footsie 100 representative, lost 17 1/2 to 17 1/2 p.
National Power retreated 10 1/2 to 293 1/2 p, on 8.5m traded, and PowerGen
14 to 296p, after 10m shares changed hands.
Gains in oils
Oil shares were among the market's best performers, responding to news that
two US senators had proposed a bill setting a Dollars 25 a barrel floor on
domestically produced crude oil and proposing a tax on oil imports. The news
drove oil prices sharply higher, with Brent crude settling around the
Dollars 18.50 a barrel level.
Analysts pointed out that such a move would transform BP's fortunes. Shell
was also seen as a big beneficiary of any such move.
BP closed 8 up at 245 1/2 p and Shell 7 up at 558p. But analysts said import
tariff moves would attract massive opposition from non-oil producing states
in the US and could also attract a windfall profits tax.
Among smaller oil stocks, rumours that a predator, possibly Clyde Petroleum,
could be stalking Premier Consolidated saw the shares move up 2 more to 27
1/4 p following turnover of 16m shares, the heaviest single day's business
for many months.
Defence stocks busy
Overnight confirmation that Saudi Arabia will, after all, buy 48 Tornado
aircraft as part of the Al Yamamah-2 contract prompted a sharp rise in
British Aerospace shares and well as many other engineering/ electronics
stocks seen as big beneficiaries of the deal.
British Aerospace shares, a strong market in recent sessionsas the market
began to anticipate such a deal, raced up to close a net 18 higher at 253p,
their best level since July 1992. Turnover was a hefty 18m shares, the
highest single day's business since last September when the group announced
a restructuring.
Specialists said the euphoria generated by confirmation of the contract may
well carry BAe shares further ahead but emphasised the weakness of the
group's balance sheet and the danger to the dividend. 'It's long-term good
news but will not make much difference in the short term,' said one analyst.
Other stocks to benefit from the news included GEC, which will provide the
avionics for the aircraft, and moved up 6 to a 1992/3 high of 290p. FR Group
moved up 12 to 263p, Smiths Industries 11 to 365p and Meggitt 4 to 98p.
Rolls-Royce edged up 1 1/2 to 126 1/2 p and Lucas jumped 6 to 149p.
Burton rights
Market rumours were confirmed for a second time this week as stores group
Burton followed in Asda's footsteps in making a big cash call. Burton's
1-for-4 rights issue will raise Pounds 163m and, like Asda, will be largely
invested in store refurbishment. Although the timing took the market by
surprise, analysts were supportive with even bears of the stock advising
clients to take up the rights on the back of the group's recovery potential.
The shares fell 2 1/2 to 72 1/2 p in turnover of 23m.
Other money-raising exercise stories abounded. Allied Lyons was once again
target for gossip that it would launch a 1-for-5 cash call at 525p early
next week. Allied again strongly denied the story.
Talk that Argyll Group is considering a convertible bond issue was heard,
with the food retailer said to be looking to raise in excess of Pounds 100m.
Rights issue hints were later heard around Unigate, off 7 at 314p, and
United Biscuits, a penny adrift at 366p.
An old and similar rumour hurt Rank Organisation, with weak figures from
Rank Xerox and a large seller in the market adding to the negative
sentiment. Despite later reports that the sale of some of its London hotels
was imminent, the shares fell 29 to 688p.
A profit forecast downgrade by one house in Tesco was said to have helped
the shares tumble 8 to 259p.
A placing of 2.5m shares at 126p in MFI Furniture, said to be done by Smith
New Court, pinned the shares back 2 to 126p.
News and information company Reuters rose 20 to 1,394p. It was buoyed by US
buying, dollar strength and this week's announcement of a service to rival
the stock exchange's screen-based system.
Pharmaceuticals giant Glaxo rose 8 to 694p as a result of bear closing,
buying to meet the selling commitments made during the account.
With US investors increasingly realising that Hanson shares provided a
better yield than cash as well as exposure to cyclical recovery, the stock
improved 4 1/2 to 250 1/2 p.
British Steel received support from one US house which upgraded its rating
to a strong buy. Steel shares were up in the US and closed 2 higher in
London at 73 1/2 p.
Medeva picked up 4 at 219p as Nikko Europe moved to a hold from a buy.
Selected Irish companies attracted interest on the belief that the country
would leave the ERM at the weekend. Paper and cardboard group Jefferson
Smurfit rose 10 to 275p and building materials group CRH was bought up to
226p before closing unchanged at 224p. the ERM.

FT  30 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MODERATE day's trading in the derivatives market was dominated by the
closing of the trading account in the underlying equity markets and mounting
concern over possible imminent rights issues, writes Christopher Price.
In futures, the March FT-SE contract opened positively at 2,833, helped by
good overnight industrial news. It reached its high-point of 2,838 around
10am.
However, with growing concerns over the number of companies said to be
considering a rights issue, and traders anxious not to be long ahead of the
new account on Monday, March drifted. It hit its low of 2,812 at around 1pm
when it also dipped below fair value.
Then strong US durable goods figures prompted a rally and March closed at
2,822, a fall of 14 on the previous session, and around 10 points ahead of
its fair value level of around 7.
In traded options, 29,662 contracts were traded, with the FT-SE 100 making
up 4,796 and the Euro-FTSE 4,292. BAe was the top stock option at 1,864.

FT  30 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rights fears encourage profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STEADY flow of rights issues took the heart out of the UK stock market
as the two week trading account came to its close yesterday. The equity
funding call for Pounds 163m from Burton, the store group, was recognised as
only the first of a queue of rights issuers expected to march through the
market next week.
With many gilt-edged market participants still licking the wounds inflicted
by the turmoil surrounding this week's government funding and the unexpected
cut in domestic interest rates, cash has become somewhat scarce in the stock
market, albeit temporarily. Government bonds lost early gains yesterday,
closing a shade off on the day as renewed pressures appeared in the ERM
currencies and the dollar raced higher after an expectedly strong gain in
December durable goods orders.
Initial improvement in share prices was swiftly reversed when stock index
futures were sold off heavily. The Footsie fell steadily on increased
volume, and lost the 2,800 mark briefly at mid-session. However, a late
rally by dollar stocks, took the FT-SE Index to a final reading of 2,807.2,
for a loss on the day of 9.7. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index followed suit, losing
8.7 to 2,954.8. Non-Footsie volume represented 62 per cent of Seaq turnover
of 773.1m shares; Thursday's retail business was worth Pounds 1.45bn.
The Footsie has gained 26 points this week, responding to the reduction in
UK base rates to 6 per cent. Over the account, the Footsie has added 42.1
points or 1.5 per cent.
Electricity generator stocks weakened on parliamentary proposals to
subsidise Britain's coal industry. But oil shares improved and defence
stocks responded strongly to the announcement of orders for 48 Tornado
aircraft by Saudi Arabia.
Profit-takers focused on the interest-related stocks which have outperformed
this week. Breweries, food industry stocks, banks, stores and hotels were
all out of favour, with rights issue worries adding to the pressure on food
retailers.
Among the mostly firm blue chip internationals, BAT Industries remained a
weak feature beneath concerns over both the tobacco and insurance sectors of
the group.
Equity strategists have generally welcomed this week's base rate cut, and
the possible move to 5 per cent rates at Budget time. But Mr Ian Harnett at
Strauss Turnbull remains convinced that base rates will be up to 8.5 per
cent by the year-end, by when Warburg Securities also expects rates to be
rising.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Punt at three ERM floors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRISH PUNT was beleaguered inside the European exchange rate mechanism
yesterday, falling for the first time to its ERM floors against 3
currencies, writes James Blitz.
The Irish currency has survived two speculative attacks in the last six
months, but yesterday's pressures were acutely intense.
Two commercial banks in Dublin raised their prime rates to 28 per cent from
16-17 per cent, putting the burden of defending the currency firmly on
Ireland's consumers and businesses.
The punt's fall to its ERM floor against the D-Mark for the first time since
September also highlighted how severe the selling pressure has been this
week. For most of yesterday it was trading below its ERM floors against the
Belgian franc and Dutch guilder.
Ireland's coalition government has ruled out a devaluation of the currency,
and there was no sign yesterday of a European Monetary Committee being
convened to consider an ERM realignment.
There are good arguments against one taking place this weekend. The French,
for example, are still opposed to any readjustments of the ERM ahead of
their March elections, for fear that instability could spill over to the
franc.
However, the punt is now considered by some analysts to be heavy overvalued
against sterling. Many analysts believe its position is unsustainable.
Concerns remain that a punt devaluation could be followed by renewed selling
of the French franc, as dealers seem out a new currency to victimise in the
ERM.
Although the French franc sat comfortably at around FFr3.85 against the
D-Mark yesterday, French 1-month money rose to 13 1/2 per cent as ERM
tensions grew. However, France's socialist party has virtually acknowledged
defeat in the March parliamentary elections, and it may keep rates at these
levels until the poll is over.
The dollar yesterday rose more than 3 pfennigs against the D-Mark after the
release of figures showing that durable goods orders jumped a startling 9.1
per cent in December.
The dollar rose nearly 2 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark, closing at
DM1.6090. It pushed sterling to a six year low of Dollars 1.4830. The pound
closed in London at Dollars 1.4870, some 3 cents down on the day.
Sterling fell back 1 1/4 pfennigs against the D-Mark, closing at DM2.3925.
However, Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Banking Corp in London,
believes that the pound will be underpinned at DM2.38 because the recent
gloom about the UK economy has been over-exaggerated.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Money Markets: UK overnight at 100%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OVERNIGHT rate for lending sterling cash rose to 100 per cent yesterday
after the Bank of England posted a huge shortage at the end of a tight week
in the money markets, writes James Blitz.
The Bank announced a shortage of Pounds 2.35bn at the start of the day,
later revised up to Pounds 2.4bn. Cash is always tight at the end of the
month, when dealers try to square their books. The market is also in the
middle of a tax collection period, which creates big demands for funds among
the clearing banks.
However, the market found it difficult to remove the shortage for several
reasons. One was the paucity of bills in the hands of clearing banks and
discount houses. A dealer said that large quantities of bills had been used
to mop up Thursday's Pounds 1.8bn shortage.
Another dealer said that the Bank had made an error in offering to buy a
repurchase agreement which was due to expire on February 26, at the start of
the day. For technical reasons, this was not in the interest of market
participants. A sign of the stickiness of the market was that late
assistance was very high at Pounds 780m.
The sharp rise in the 'overnight' would have brought substantial profits and
losses, especially on a Friday when loans must be funded for three days.
For example, a trader who had bought a 1-month cash asset worth Pounds 1m at
6 1/2 per cent would reap a profit of around Pounds 5,000 in 30 days time.
But this weekend, he may have incurred interest payments of more than Pounds
8,000 servicing the loan by borrowing overnight cash.
Such wild fluctuations in sterling rates have raised concerns about the Bank
of England's money market operations in the past.
In Europe, cash rates in the French franc market rose to new highs on
rumours that the Bank of France would raise its intervention rate to defend
its currency. The intense pressure on the Irish punt, which is seen as a
strong candidate for devaluation, has raised fears that the franc could come
under speculative pressure.
One-month French francs rose to 13 1/2 per cent from around 13 per cent the
previous day. The March franc futures contract fell another 43 basis points
to close at 88.40, as dealers assumed that French rates will remain high
until the parliamentary elections.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Giro speeds cash transfers in Europe -
New system responds to complaints about banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSFERRING money internationally through commercial banks is slow and
expensive - something that is well known to anyone who makes and receives
payments regularly. Often, the customer finds it difficult to discover the
price.
There is, however, an answer to the problem, at least for intra-European
payments. A new system called Eurogiro links 14 European countries and could
be joined by Japan before long.
The 14 members are the three Nordic nations - Sweden, Norway and Finland -
Switzerland, and all EC members except Italy, Greece, and Portugal. Italy is
expected to announce that it intends to join when the Eurogiro directors
hold their next meeting in Brussels on Friday.
Japan's Postbank would also like to join, but the United States is a problem
because there is nothing resembling the post office giro system in America.
Eurogiro is run by the Danes, who got the job because the giro system is
especially well developed in Scandinavia. Its managing director, Mogens
Hansen - a co-director of Denmark's GiroBank - said in Copenhagen this week
that it began in November last year in response to criticisms of the system
operated by commercial banks.
Hansen said: 'We offer the consumer a product which is cheap. It is
transparent: the customer knows exactly what the cost is for both sender and
recipient. And it is fast: we guarantee to complete a transfer within three
bank days of a debit, or one day less if the system for urgent transfers is
used.'
A card, available to all customers, lists prices for payers and payees in
each country. For example, making a payment from Denmark costs DKr15 while
the receiver in the UK pays Pounds 2.
'We guarantee to keep our prices lower - or, at a maximum, never higher -
than the banks,' Hansen said.
Britain's Girobank, which has been owned wholly by the Alliance &amp; Leicester
Building Society since being privatised in 1989, is a part of Eurogiro. But
the giro system is relatively undeveloped in Britain.
According to Girobank's press office, the UK operation carries out about
135,000 transactions a year compared with about 250m by Denmark's GiroBank,
although Denmark's population is only 5.1m to Britain's 60m.
Hansen said that since Eurogiro opened - accompanied by a big advertising
campaign in all member countries - interest had been enormous. Eurogiro
expects to make around 7m transactions in its first year.
In view of the large number of trade transactions between European
countries, this total is quite small. But Hansen points out that the more
people who use Eurogiro, the cheaper it will become.
The system is easy to use. The recipient must have a giro account and the
sender needs to know the number, but the sender does not necessarily need an
account.
You can go to the local post office, fill out a grio form, pay cash at the
counter - and off it goes.

FYFFES, the Irish-based fruit and vegetable distributor, is heading for a
modest increase in pre-tax profits on Tuesday, having weathered recession in
Europe and ERM currency upheavals during its year to end October 1992.
Profits of IPounds 28.5m are expected against IPounds 27.1m last year, with
the dividend likely to rise to 0.8939p (0.8126p) after the interim was upped
to 0.3549p (0.3226p). Earnings per share, diluted by issues in 1992, are
likely to fall to 5.7p from 6.73p.
Expansion into continental Europe has come at a difficult time. The group's
year-end coincided with sterling's 15 per cent decline in value against the
Irish currency, with 50 per cent of turnover coming from UK operations.
Bullough, the office products and refrigeration group, is expected to
produce results on Monday in line with its December profit warning of a
slump from Pounds 20.8m to Pounds 8.5m in pre-tax profits for the year to
October 31. Earnings per share are likely to be between 4.5p and 4.6p
(11.55p), with the dividend held at 6.05p. Profits this year could rise to
Pounds 12m, confirming the group's position as a potential recovery stock.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Truth of the Matter: A mid-winter pilgrimage - Nigel Spivey
pays his respects to Athens, the city which gave birth to democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAKING A pilgrimage to Athens in midwinter has much to recommend it. Strong
winds pummel at the city's miasma of smog, and temperatures are rarely more
than a little fresh. Tavernas put out tables on the pavement, and women are
in furs for status, not insulation. But it is timely for more than
considerations of comfort. Athens is celebrating a birth. The city invites
you to pay your respects to its most nimble and long-lived offspring:
democracy, born here 2,500 years ago.
As one might expect, given the recent collapse of walls and iron curtains,
much is being made of the anniversary, with scholars and politicians joining
all sorts of jamborees. I made my own visit last month, for a conference
organised by the American School at Athens, called 'The Archaeology of
Democracy' .
To he a pilgrim to democracy's birthplace is more satisfying than the
history books might imply. Relatively little is known about the supposed
progenitor of Athenian democracy, Kleisthenes. No statues exist to him. And
rightly so, perhaps.
Such frugal sources as we possess regarding him suggest that he is a
wheeler-dealer: not a man of the people, but an aristocrat seeking to
upstage rivals by engaging popular support. Kleisthenes is credited with a
series of manoeuvres during 508 and 507 BC which included a decimal system
of voting districts (designed to reflect the interests of rural as well as
urban areas), and a five-hundred strong council elected by those districts.
Whatever Kleisthenes himself called these manoeuvres, later Greek
commentators were in no doubt: it was the beginning of demokratia, literally
'people-power'.
So much for Kleisthenes. The relics of the political system which was
rapidly established in his wake are, however, more substantial than his
historical presence. For more than 60 years American archaeologists have
been excavating within the hub of ancient Athens, the Agora. To translate
that as 'the marketplace' understates its function in the topography of
democratic Athens. It was the principal point of traffic, negotiation and
general hob-nobbing in the city; it was also host to most of the monuments
and institutions one would now describe as 'civic'.
Democracy in classical Athens never sold itself short. The Athenians were
proud of it: they made a fetish and a cult of it. Democracy was still
infantile when Athenian citizens went to defend it against invading
Persians. The Battle of Marathon in 490 BC, when the Persian hordes were
held off Greece by a small and mainly Athenian detachment, has been
described (by John Stuart Mill) as a more important event in British history
than the Battle of Hastings.
Had the Athenians lost - so this logic goes - we all might now be subjects
of Saddam Hussein or some other oriental tyrant. The archaeology of Athenian
democracy is presented by its American excavators with a particular sense of
communion. Thomas Jefferson, we learn, had classical Athens uppermost as the
ideal of his own political activity.
And Americans believe that their version of democracy approximates more
closely to the Greek ideal than most others.
The American excavations have revealed not only the foundations of the
various council buildings and meeting places in the Agora. Much of the
minutiae of democratic protocol has also emerged. Ballot boxes, voting
tokens, little water-clocks for timing speeches: these testify to the
scrupulous building-in of safety devices to protect the system from
corruption.
There was always the fear that someone might aggregate too much power for
himself: hence the process of ostracism, introduced very soon after
Kleisthenes, which served as an annual opportunity for the citizens to
banish anyone looking too big for their boots.
It was a quaint process: names were inscribed on old shards of pottery, and
by a simple majority the person with most shards (ostraka) went into exile
from the city and its hinterland for ten years. And it worked simply: the
popular assembly (the ekklesia) decided whether to hold an ostracism vote;
that decided, so long as the basic quorum of 6,000 citizens voted, the most
unpopular nomination departed Athens within ten days. After his exile, he
returned to take up full citizenship.
Examples of the inscribed shards survive by the thousand: you see a nice
range of them in the Agora Museum.
One can hardly help thinking of modern equivalents for some of these
processes. So it might be convenient to see ostracism as simply replaced
with ordeal by media: in cases like that of David Mellor, the 'popular'
press certainly justified its campaign as being in 'the public interest'.
But wandering about the ruins of Athens, it is not so much the familiarity
of democracy as its peculiarity that strikes one. Take the site of the
popular assembly, the Pnyx: a terraced hillside where the popular assembly
met. True, it could only accommodate 6,000 citizens - roughly one fifth of
the voting population - but this is still an astonishing proportion of
voters actually involved in decison-making.
The more one ponders the natural habitat of these ancient political animals,
the more one realises the extent of the gulf between their concept of
democracy and our own.
Apart from the widespread indifference shown towards politics by the
citizens of most modern democracies, there is the matter of time: unless you
had slaves and other types excluded from politics (in ancient Athens, that
included women and foreigners), you would hardly have time to get so
involved in 'people-power'. And is a device like ostracism really akin to
the strategic smut campaigns conducted by newspapers reliant on smut
(political or otherwise) for their sales?
In this respect the ruins of Athens are misleading. The city was highly
self-conscious about its image. The monuments of Athenian democracy are
easily confused with the monuments of Athenian imperialism, and become
loosely re-employed as totems of order and stability. Thus the Greeks are
using the Parthenon as a backdrop to their claim to the name of Macedonia;
and IBM likes to use the Parthenon as a symbol of computers which never go
wrong.
The totemic force of Athenian ruins lulls us into a sense of familiarity
with their political system. We tend to overlook the fact that democracy was
designed for a city-state, not a nation, nor even a community of nations. We
tend to overlook the fact that it had an economic basis completely different
from the basis of market forces.
Were it possible to recall Plato and Aristotle - neither of whom regarded
democracy as anything like an ideal political arrangement - they would both
be staggered that, 2,000 years on, the world still celebrates what
Kleisthenes started. But that, in a sense, is beside the point.
The lineage claimed by modern democracy may be spurious, but it has been so
widely believed by so many for so long that there is no use in disowning it.
If classical Athenian democracy is not a durable institution, its mythology
certainly is.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
I LIVE in Notting Hill, where I often see a rat, a large and friendly rat -
Rasta, I call him. For all I know there may be 20 or 30 rats involved,
coming and going, performing their chores and tasks, but to me he is a
composite, droll and disconnected. I imagine he lives on dope.
My affection for Rasta the rat is not shared by Miss Lee, my executive
assistant, a Yorkshirewoman and a Thatcherite. Whenever I say I have seen
Rasta she flies into a rage and telephones Westminster City Council,
demanding to speak to the rat-catcher. Westminster City Council lives in awe
of Miss Lee, and immediately sends a rodent officer (or operator, or
operative) who peers down manholes and leaves bits of cheese that he and the
other rodent officers have soaked in poison. But they never catch Rasta.
Quite by chance, I discovered this week that it was Westminster City
Council, back in 1944, that first started calling its rat-catchers rodent
officers - a feat for which it gets a star mention in The Politically
Correct Phrasebook by Nigel Rees, which Bloomsbury has just published
(Pounds 12.99).
Until I read this book I had assumed, lackadaisically, that PC and its
terminology were as doomed as they are execrable - an American invention
that would shortly wither and die, so long as people like me continued to
use vigorous words vigorously.
Here, for example, are some words and phrases I use often which are now
judged to be politically incorrect: knacker, subnormal, menopause, victim
of, unemployed, vagrant, sunset years, spinster, stout, mature woman,
Christmas, jungle, human, history, homosexual, hackette, handicapped, fat,
buxom, fleshy, plump, obese, cleaning lady, dwarf, bonny, broke, burglar and
boring.
Boring? To be politically correct, we should say differently interesting.
Fat? Stout? Plump? Buxom? Fleshy? Obese? According to Nigel Rees:
'Differently sized appears to be the front-running substitute at the moment,
with differently weighted somewhat to the rear. Or you can talk about a
person with an alternative body image.'
Spinster? Use, rather, single-by-choice. An old maid is now a
single-by-choice senior citizen.
Jungle? It has derogatory associations. Use tropical rain forest.
Hackette? The addition of '-ette' to any standard (male) word is now far
beyond the pale. So out go suffragette, hackette, bachelorette and,
especially, says Rees, majorette. Yet I am fond of majorette. It is a word
with resonance. I am even fonder of hackette. To put things bluntly,
hackette is not a word I plan to stop using. It is a beautiful word that
means female journalist, and is apposite in the extreme.
The reason I say this is that all the female journalists I know wear
exceedingly short skirts, fishnet stockings, down-at-heel boots and orange
make-up. They are strident and manipulative. Many of them bite their nails.
Their hair can be quite greasy. They smoke and they curse and often, at
lunchtime - I have seen this with my own eyes - they consume
erotically-named cocktails and Pounds 30 bottles of wine while thrusting
their blowsy charms on anyone who will listen to them. They are . . .
hackettes, and ever more shall be so.
Nor do I ever plan to stop using beautiful, brassy words like fat, buxom,
fleshy, vagrant, spinster, human, burglar, broke or boring.
Nigel Rees explains that many PC coinages are but jocular inventions,
including the -challenged suffix designed to portray personal disadvantages
in a more kindly light - ethnically challenged for Jewish, morally
challenged for criminal, metabolically challenged for dead. And he picks his
way with care in explaining how PC in its weirder, more threatening forms
should be distinguished from efforts to find appropriate and inoffensive
expressions - justified euphemisms - for describing, for example, people
with physical or mental disabilities ('Down's syndrome' for 'mongolism').
But he warns us of the consequences when everyday realities are dressed up
over-tastefully and ambiguously so as to pander to the squeamish. And he
laments the tendency of the PC movement to replace direct and colourful
words with dull, lifeless ones.
Next week I plan to use the word hackette 90 times a day. And fat. And
fleshy. And buxom. Buxom buxom buxom buxom buxom. I also quite like wop.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Private View: A German doctor at Britain's bedside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROBERT Bischof is a German manager who has spent half his life destroying
Britain's manufacturing industry. Now he wants to rebuild it.
He has taken his ideas to John Smith, leader of the Labour Party. Why
Labour?
'In the UK, it's a social stigma for businessmen to vote Labour - but that's
Labour's fault. In my country, it's quite different. I don't support them
out of political allegiance but because of economic necessity. I feel they
are close to changing the British system to something that can work.'
The Conservative government could not do it, Bischof said, even if John
Major wanted to, because it had got itself stuck in an ideological
cul-de-sac. 'For example, 'trickle-down' has turned out to be absolute
rubbish. Aspirations for getting richer are so limitless that if the rich
can keep it to themselves they will never let anything trickle down.'
So Bischof has decided that industry's last hope lies with Labour: provided,
that is, the Labour party can be persuaded to give up class war, throw away
its cloth cap, look attractive to the middle classes, embrace regulated
capitalism and strive for a social market consensus along German lines that
will put an end to the stop-go, politicised management of the economy for
ever.
His proposal is revolutionary but not new: it was much canvassed in the
1970s. What is new, says Bischof, is the urgency. Like the car on the
roller-coaster, the British economy emerges weaker and slower from each
recessionary plunge. And with President Clinton in the White House and
Labour chewing over its fourth general election defeat in a row, he thinks
the time for the Big Idea has arrived.
Bischof has two excuses for his alien presumption. The first is that he has
lived and worked in England for 25 years, regards it as home and wants to go
on liking his adoptive country.
The second is that he knows only too well how easy it is for a foreign
company entering the boom-and-bust British market to cut the native
opposition to shreds. He has done it himself.
In 1967, he was sent by Jungheinrich, a Hamburg manufacturer of fork-lift
trucks, to start up an import and service network in the UK. In those days,
90 per cent of trucks sold in Britain were made in Britain. Today, 90 per
cent are imported, or made in the UK by foreign-owned companies.
'Why does it happen?' Bischof said. 'We (he means 'we British') are very
innovative. When my kids were playing with computers, my brother's kids in
Germany could still not even spell the word.'
His Manchester company became the biggest of Jungheinrich's European
offshoots. 'It's not because our managers are cleverer than those in British
companies,' he said. 'The difference is they take a long-term view and their
system is transportable.
'British managers have got one arm tied behind their back, one leg in
plaster and a blindfold on. They have been given a tough time, which is why
I say it was a relative walkover to destroy their manufacturing base. We've
got to get a better system.'
Bischof agrees with Germany's president, Richard von Weizsacker, that it is
not people but the system that determines the success or failure of an
economy.
'Under communism, for example, you could work yourself to death and get
nowhere. That is very true for Britain, too.
'You don't have to be a socialist to want what I am proposing: you just have
to be intelligent. As Sir Ralf Dahrendorf (warden of St Antony's College,
Oxford) says: these days you can't be anything but a social democrat. These
ups and downs are destroying the social fabric - resources, capital,
everything.'
Bischof has other credentials to buttress his opinions: he is one of the 100
managers chosen by the German chancellor to sort out the state conglomerates
of former East Germany.
Working from what used to be Goering's air ministry in Berlin, Bischof has
for the last two years been finding western buyers for the viable bits of a
big engineering combine. Four thousand workers have been kept; the other
14,000 are being re-trained.
Bischof is no demagogue. He speaks quietly, even inaudibly, interposing an
interrogative Ja? every couple of sentences.
Occasionally, he lets loose. For example, he says Anthony Barber and Nigel
Lawson, the Tory chancellors responsible for the two big artificial booms of
the post-war period, should be awarded the Iron Cross for services to German
exports.
He has the modest Majoresque appearance you might expect from his
background: economics at Hamburg University under Prof Karl Schiller, later
West Germany's economics and finance minister, an apprenticeship in banking
(apprenticeships are still normal in Germany), and a first job as assistant
to the managing director of Jungheinrich.
His father, a master baker, spent time in Doncaster and Northern Ireland as
a prisoner of war. The two sons were born in their grandfather's house on
the Baltic island of Rugen in former East Germany where the family had
retreated from the British bombing raids over Hamburg.
It is Germany's post-war example that Bischof would like Britain now
belatedly to follow. During the post-war liberal-capitalist era of which
Ludwig Erhard was the chief architect, the leftwing Social Democratic Party
(SPD) lost election after election.
In 1959 it moved to the centre, changed its constitution, became a people's
party instead of a working-class party and was rewarded with office when
Erhard's boiler ran out of steam.
The British Labour party must break its historical ties with the unions,
Bischof said, and political parties must be publicly funded. It must tear up
its class roots and reform the welfare state along economic, not
ideological, lines. 'Sometimes ideas are good for the heart but also make
economic sense. We are not just do-gooders.'
Governments should protect and regulate both sides of the market equally.
'For me, Mickey Mouse in Fleet Street being paid, although he never turned
up, is as vulgar and horrible as a 35 per cent APR (annual percentage rate)
on hire purchase. Both are totally ludicrous, and would be impossible in a
well-structured system.'
What would a well-structured system look like?
Bischof said Britain should stop trying to compete with low-wage, developing
countries. Labour should be more expensive, not less, to encourage
investment and quality output. It should be harder, not easier, to fire
workers, and mass redundancy should cease to be the cheapest option.
Unemployment benefit should be seen as an insurance award and raised, not
cut, so that demand did not collapse during recessions.
Top executives, the new Brahmin caste, should be statutorily accountable to
supervisory boards which would recognise that employees, as well as
shareholders, have rights. Directors would have to negotiate their pay and
justify their plans.
'Takeovers are far too easy in Britain. I would force companies to make a
five-year business plan, with investment, research and development, product
development, export quotas, and not just let them get away with milking and
destroying assets.'
As a further discouragement to short-termism, the pension funds and life
companies might, as in Germany, have their equity portfolios restricted and
be barred from buying the shares of highly-geared companies. Government
reliance on the interest rate - a tax on industry and the less well-off -
was 'a big mistake' and should be abandoned as a means of controlling
demand.
I asked Bischof whether people would listen to a German telling them what to
do.
'I think it's half and half. It's not possible to go through the official
channels of the Confederation of British Industry and so forth. (He called
the CBI 'intellectual dwarfs'.) On the other hand, people listen because I
have done it, in a way. I have been successful in Britain. I helped to
destroy part of this industry that I worked in. I've done all the damage to
the British balance of payments.
'But I want to live here. I like living in Britain. My kids want to make
their lives here, and I am very worried. This is a super country which is
slowly and surely going down the chute.
'Sometimes people say to me: 'If you're not satisfied, why don't you push
off and live somewhere else?' But I live here because I like it. I sometimes
think I'm the only one who does.'
Why do you prefer it to Germany?
'I think it's the degree of personal freedom one has in the UK. I like the
people, maybe particularly here in the north.
'And the whole social environment - though I do realise one lives in a
slightly false world if one lives in a well-off suburb such as mine.'
But isn't it precisely what you like about England which is at the root of
the problem? Doesn't this easy-going nature, this dislike of order and
regulation, make the kind of reform you're proposing impossible?
'That's a very good point. But I don't think you have to give up personal
freedom to have a certain amount of order in public life. Built into
capitalism, into democracy and the free market concept is a very
self-destructive element. We must make sure our values don't get destroyed
by excessive freedom.'
Britons, said Bischof, are innovative, lateral-thinking and creative. They
have to be. That can also make them chaotic. Germans, on the other hand, are
too programmed, too bureaucratic, and have a propensity to run round like
headless chickens when things begin to go wrong - as they are now beginning
to do.
'Of course Germany has made mistakes - the system is too complicated, and
excessively social (he means welfare-minded). We (the British, that is) must
keep our strengths and at the same time find a good framework. I did that in
my own company.
'It's typically German to do things 150 per cent - history has shown us that
not a few times. But I don't think we're in danger of getting anywhere near
150 per cent here. If we could just get to 75 or 80 per cent, that would be
marvellous.'

FT  30 JAN 93 / Arts: Thrilled to be black - Nigel Andrews explains why
'film noir' is solid gold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT IS 'film noir'? Of all the catch-phrases in all the languages in all
the world, none has walked into more movie lives than this one. It was born
in Paris in 1945 and today it is a citizen of the globe. You can scarcely
read a review column without bumping into it and movie-makers themselves,
wise to its critical popularity, turn out movies as if to solicit the
phrase.
In the first two months of this year the dark-toned thrillers are tumbling
over themselves: Night And The City, Deep Cover, Midnight Sting, The Public
Eye. And even para-modern crime movies like Reservoir Dogs and Man Bites Dog
clothe themselves in the laconic moral midnight that was film noir's great
gift to 20th century sensibility.
The phrase was coined by a group of postwar French critics who saw a rhyme
between the sombre movie thrillers of the 1940s/early '50s and the
contemporaneous Serie Noir crime novels, in which American hardboiled
fiction (in translation) loomed large. As a coinage film noir was solid gold
and soon became universal tender. Not content with using it to underwrite
appraisals of primal 'noirs' like Laura, Double Indemnity and Build My
Gallows High - films awash in apres-guerre shadows, threateningly
emancipated women and maze-like moral ambiguities - critics handed the
currency down to succeeding generations.
Today every thriller with a hardboiled hero or fatal woman, plus (if
possible) outbreaks of venetian blinds and rain-sleek streets, is showered
with the loose change of noir criticism. Some movie people, like
critic-filmmaker Paul Schrader, rage against the anachronistic
word-bandying. 'Film Noir came up after the war through a convergence of
influences', he told me on the set of Light Sleeper, where I had been
foolish enough to suggest the picture was a modern FN 'There were the
expatriate Germanic influences in Hollywood, and there was the sense of
let-down that many Americans felt after the war when guys came home and
couldn't get work and their wives were more independent because they'd had
jobs.
'It was a kind of dead-end social-psychological backlash and it crept into
cinema after the war. From the mid-1950s it gradually died out with the new
affluence and the rise of TV and colour photography. So the phrase refers to
a specific historical period. There's no such thing as a modern film noir.'
Thank you. Lecture appreciated. But so long as they can pass it across the
counter, can we doubt that critics will go on using the phrase? Or that
film-makers - who are just critics with cameras - will go on pandering to
the popularity of noir and neo-noir as a style?
Here, for instance, is The Movie Book Of Film Noir (Studio Vista Pounds
16.99). Edited by veteran buff Ian Cameron, once a founder editor of Movie
magazine, that 1960s growbag of noir consciousness (here a 5000-word essay
on Hitchcock, there a tractactus on Tourneur), it is a priceless primer.
Priceless in all senses. Its 21 essays are so ornately intense it is hard
not to giggle at times. Read the maze of 'Gestalten' and 'suppressive
narratives' that Douglas Pye builds around a mediocre Fritz Lang film,
Beyond A Reasonable Doubt.
But the book is also affirmatively priceless. All the key components of noir
as a style are here. The Byzantine plotting (The Maltese Falcon, The Big
Sleep); the matching obfuscations of decor and lighting (often by immigrant
cameramen or directors trained in German Expressionism); the battered,
cynical protagonists (Bogart, Mitchum); and the strong-willed, sexually
charged women (Stanwyck in Double Indemnity, Hayworth in Gilda and The Lady
From Shanghai) who were re-writing the rulebook of male-female rapport.
The best essay is Jonathan Buchsbaum's 'Tame Wolves And Phoney Claims.'
Buchsbaum takes the word paranoia, the most-used coin of all in the noir
currency, and polishes it to a psychiatric exactness. Then he shows where
the word is apt (and where not) in analysing films like Double Indemnity or
Murder My Sweet. The premise of disturbance or disorientation, the fear of
personal or sexual inadequacy, the search for secure data: these components
of paranoia clearly lead to the noir iconography of questing (detective)
heroes, threatening conspiracies and erotic mystery.
Noir, as the book insists, was a style, never a genre. It was an emotional
condiment that could season different dishes. Though its favourites were the
mystery thriller and hardboiled detective story, its nihilist melancholia
could also be shaken over the Western (Duel In The Sun, The Naked Spur), the
romantic potboiler (Bogart's no-ideals anti-hero in Casablanca) and even the
sci-fi film (Invasion Of The Body Snatchers).
Today noir is back and one disputes Schrader's theory of the inauthenticity
of its modern heir. True: film noir first emerged in the postwar era when
God created perfect conditions for paranoia in a patriarchal society. Men
returning from the war a jangle of new anxieties; women busting out from the
kitchen or marital bed; and post-'45 austerity painting America in the
colours of Poverty Row, black and white with grey an additional option.
But 50 years after Laura, the 1993 new year films look just as genuinely
noir as those circa 1943. Deep Cover, a mazy thriller full of jet-dark
moralising, and The Public Eye, whose gritty fictionalised portrait of the
1940s news photographer Weegee opens in Britain next week, are both in
colour; but it is a colour that rejoices in negating itself. And if
Reservoir Dogs features no fatal women, its picture of male pride being
socked in the solar plexus - or socking itself - is as merciless as in The
Big Heat or Build My Gallows High.
Even the titles ask us to pin the label 'noir' on them, abounding in words
of darkness or concealment - night, midnight, deep. And to keep us happy
later in the year more 1990s-noir titles, plus films, are lining up. Woody
Allen's next UK-released offering is a pastiche period thriller in
black-and-white called Shadows And Fog. And farceur Carl Reiner is busy
making Triple Indemnity, a spoof on you-know-what.
The 1990s are becoming as noir as the 1940s for a simple reason. Carbon-copy
social conditions prevail. We have economic austerity. We have women coming
on strong after years of limbering up at the Feminist Gym. And we have a
world where the west is once more playing anxious policeman as History
ignites come-and-get-me conflicts around the world.
For extra measure, it is seven years to the new millennium - and isn't it
always darkest before a dawn?

FT  30 JAN 93 / Arts: Bronzes bequeathed to BM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE Icklingham bronzes
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Roman treasures now in New York which were stolen from a Suffolk farm in
1981 by a gang using metal detectors ('Long hunt for the raiders of the lost
art,' Weekend FT, November 16 1991) - are coming home.
Not at once, and not to Suffolk. But after legal action in New York by John
Browning, the farmer from whose field the bronzes were taken, and out of
court negotiations, their present owners, Leon Levy and his wife Shelby
White, have offered to bequeath them to the British Museum.
The bronzes once adorned a Roman temple. They include a statuette of Vulcan,
horse collar fittings, two helmets, and face masks for putting on wooden
statues. The most spectacular piece is a bronze cheetah inlaid with silver
spots. The field at Icklingham was robbed frequently when metal detectors
became popular in the 1970s. Over the years Browning has had to sit on guard
in the hedge at nights and has caught 13 people.
News of the bronzes spread quickly as the robbers tried to sell them.
Photographs were circulated which, luckily, were seen by the British Museum.
The Suffolk police followed the trail to the Continent and Australia and
started extradition moves there, but no prosecutions followed.
The bronzes surfaced in 1988 at New York's Ariadne Galleries, which tried to
sell the cheetah for Dollars 600,000 to the Getty Museum in Malibu,
California. While the Getty was eager to buy, it was cautious about
acquiring pieces with a murky provenance and consulted the British Museum.
When the BM recognised the animal, the Getty withdrew. Ariadne then sold it
to Levy, who had bought the other pieces already.
In the meantime, Browning and his solicitor, David Barns, had begun a
campaign to regain the bronzes. Little help came from the British
government, which has not ratified the UNESCO convention prohibiting and
preventing the illicit import, export and transfer of ownership of cultural
pottery (the US has). Despairing of official action, Browning started
proceedings as a private individual in New York in 1991. He was convinced
there was enough evidence of the New York bronzes coming from Icklingham to
secure their repatriation, even if it did not suffice for criminal
prosecutions.
Browning's perseverance has won, but he will continue to battle to improve
the law's protection for the cultural heritage buried in British soil. And,
as he said this week: 'A bequest to a third party is not really my idea of
what to do when you're caught with your trousers down. But the goods will
come back to their country of origin. That is what is important.'
The return, however, is likely to take time. As it may be our children or
grandchildren who will be the first to see the bronzes installed in the BM,
there is an urgent need for a scholarly study of them now.

<TEXT>
TO THE South Bank (again), to hear about the bright new future (again). 'The
world's largest arts complex' has gone through more retreads than Gary
Glitter and, like Gary, still manages to look the same, like a rather
down-at-heel dowager. For over a decade there has been talk of blowing up
the ugly, dangerous concrete walkways to make the South Bank more appealing.
Originally, property developers were to beautify the place in return for
retail opportunities. Now chief executive Nicholas Snowman is looking, like
everyone else, for Lottery money. He wants Pounds 15m for an external
facelift.
With this likely to prove a pipe-dream it is hardly worth mentioning his
further plans to knock down the Hayward and build a new art gallery on the
car park. It is just possible that the Government will make the South Bank a
Millennium Fund priority because it hugs such a vital site. But any scheme
is likely to be imposed on the current management rather than in response to
it.
This week Snowman published the Arts Council's five year appraisal of the
South Bank. It is mildly complimentary, and the Council upped its annual
grant by 2 per cent to Pounds 13m. But the Arts Council, like Snowman, fails
to confront the basic issue: does it want the South Bank to put on
challenging concerts of contemporary and unfamiliar music and lose money, or
does it want large audiences? It wants both, and thinks that by asking the
South Bank to market its programme better it can square the circle.
In fact Snowman is now trying to boost audiences, which have fallen to a
disastrous 60 per cent at the Festival Hall. He has moved the BBC Symphony
to the smaller Elizabeth Hall, and he has tried to identify the Festival
Hall as the home of top quality orchestras, like the newly resident LPO and
regular guest visitors.
Snowman admits there have been too many under-rehearsed, boring, symphony
concerts at the Hall, 'events' rather than 'experiences'. They will still
happen, but Snowman is looking for new clients. He has his eyes fixed on pop
music.
This is nothing new - I well remember seeing Jimi Hendrix play the guitar
with his teeth at the Festival Hall - but in recent years the management has
been elitist and out of sympathy with the populist. Three sell-out
performances last autumn by Sandra Bernhard helped change its mind. Now up
to 15 per cent of the performances will be pop, jazz or folk - if promoters
can be sold on the South Bank ambience. To help persuade them Snowman is
thinking of allowing drinks to be taken into the plush interiors (ice creams
were consumed during the recent English National Ballet season with no great
disasters).
It might catch on. London is desperately short of good rock venues (the
imminent closure of the Town and Country at Kentish Town has caused much
heartache), and by a nice irony the Albert Hall is trying to cut down on its
pop concerts in favour of more classical programmes. So here is one of those
markets that the Arts Council report was so keen for Snowman to develop.
Perhaps we are returning to the old GLC ideal of the South Bank as a
'People's Palace'.
*****
The Royal Academy is going through an expansionist phase. Two good years
have given it illusions of grandeur and it has its eyes on the contingent
Museum of Mankind, which in the 18th century was the garden of Lord
Burlington, whose house is the home of the RA.
The RA wants to convert it into an independent centre for British
architecture. And, guess what, it is looking for Lottery money to finance
the development. The idea is that the Museum of Mankind can move all its
Mayan masks and Melanesian totems back into its former premises, the British
Museum, once the British Library has made the space available by
transporting its books to the new Euston Road site. This plan is built on so
many maybes that it seems pie-in-the-sky, apart from one factor.
Mrs Henry J. Heinz II is believed to have promised the RA a seven figure sum
towards an architectural gallery. There are certainly plans for the RA to
share shows with the Heinz gallery in Pittsburgh, and its exhibition, Lord
Burlington and Chiswick House, will make a symbolic trip to the RA in 1995.
So it could have the seed corn money; architecture needs a public space. The
RA will need to move fast: Dr Khalili has earmarked the Museum of Mankind as
the home for his collection of Islamic art, valued at Pounds 1b, which he is
keen to loan to the UK.
Could this rekindled interest in architecture offer a clue to one of the
most intriguing elections of 1993, the new President of the RA? Sir Roger de
Grey is approaching 75, and a successor will be voted upon in December.
Around a hundred RAs can vote. One of the names in the frame is that of the
architect Richard Rodgers. Elisabeth Frink was a popular choice but her
health probably rules her out. Among the artists, Tom Phillips, Allen Jones
and Norman Ackroyd are likely contenders.

One man doing his bit to save Venice is Peter Boizot of the Pizza Express
chain. If you order a Veneziana pizza, 25p goes to Venice in Perilcampaign.
To date this has raised over Pounds 300,000, making Mr Boizot the largest
individual patron of the appeal. At a more modest level 10 per cent of the
sale of paintings of Venice on display at the WH Patterson gallery,Albemarle
Street also goes to the Fund. Last year's exhibition raised Pounds 4,000.

HERE IS the content of late-evening programme on Radio 4, after A Book at
Bedtime. First, a song from Harry Lauder, then a switch to the origins of
Thomas Cook and Son's tourist schemes, that began in 1841 as a temperance
activity. Drink soon featured unofficially,and sex too - what did one go to
Paris for? There was a number about Cook's in Lionel Monckton's musical, The
Runaway Girl. But this leads us to Edison's invention of sound-recording in
1877, and we are back for a moment with Harry Lauder, before moving on to
Caruso, John McCormack and James Joyce with whom he once recorded a duet.
This is Hindsight, presented on six Friday mornings by Dr Christopher Andrew
and repeated more aptly at bedtime on Wednesdays. I saw no philosophical
conclusion to these recollections, except the reminders of more recent
things. They are leaves in a loose-leaf album, and a pleasant way to woo
sleep.
The current Book at Bedtime, is a semi-dramatic reading of a ten-part
adaptation of Sarah Cauldwell's Thus Was Adonis Murdered, with five parts
left. Kathryn Hunt reads the letters Julia is sending from Venice, where she
is on an arts tour. They tell of her weakness for handsome Ned, but the
press tells of Ned's death from stabbing. Neville Barber presents the story
from the different viewpoints.
Madame Bovary, Radio 4's Classic Serial, now at 2.30 on Sunday afternoon, is
a different brand of serial story, ably directed by Kay Patrick, who
emphasised the primary colours of the familiar story. Emma's home life does
not sound as boring as Nicola Pagett makes it seem with her contrasting
ambition; her trouble is ideas above her station. Robin Polley's Rouault is
decent enough, but you can understand it when Emma asks 'Is that all there
is?' Paul Downing's young Leon Dupuis will do for home-style romance. As for
Stephen Moore's Bovary, he is a friendly, even ambitious, doctor, tedious as
he may appear at the ball. He is to start a new practice tomorrow. Then
what?
Mr Wroe's Virgins, Radio 3's Sunday play, is adapted from Jane Rogers's
novel by Mike Harris. Prophet Wroe is a small crazed hunchback, but a
powerful preacher, leader of the Christian Israelites. He persuades the
people of Ashton-under-Lyne that the world is to end in 1830 and the New
Jerusalem will be built at Ashton. The Lord, he says, insists that he must
have seven virgins to help him, and sure enough seven virgins are
provided,some more virginal than others.
Wroe is played by Alun Armstrong; he has a great speech at Huddersfield,
about the world's end, that almost won over faithless virgin Hannah (Barbara
Marten). Joanna (Melanie Thaw) is the most faithful virgin, tireless in good
work. - Leah (Victoria Finney) is hardly virgin at all, having a 4-month
bastard 'orphan'. and Martha (Jane Hazlegrove) is educationally subnormal,
though not so much so that she cannot tell when Wroe abuses her in a ditch.
She finishes up living on the moors.
Wroe is also seen naked with Hannah, a sensible woman more interested in
workers' lives than Wroe's mission. The other three virgins are less
interesting, but the operative four are beautifully contrasted. Michael Fox
directed, and there was missionary music by Paddy Cunneen. There will be a
four-part television version of the story next month on BBC2.

DREAMS OF A FINAL THEORY
by Steven Weinberg
Hutchinson Radius Pounds 16.99, 260 pages
SCIENCE has advanced so dramatically in the 20th century that its
practitioners often feel, says Steven Weinberg, like 'Siegfried after he
tasted the dragon's blood, when he found to his surprise that he could
understand the language of birds'. First, Einstein's relativity theories
changed our concepts of space, time and gravity. Later, quantum mechanics
dissolved the world of material particles into wave functions and
probabilities. And then the marriage of relativity and quantum theory
produced a surreal world of hidden symmetries in which the concept of matter
no longer figures.
This is heady progress. Part of Weinberg's aim in his stimulating book is to
tell how it happened and what it means. He is well-equipped to do so; in
1979 he won the Nobel Prize for physics, and later wrote a famous popular
account of the origins of the universe, The First Three Minutes. But
Weinberg has a second and for his own purposes more important aim, which is
to argue in support of a dramatic 'Big Science' project aimed at exploring
hitherto unreachable levels of physical reality.
In the last two decades, Weinberg says, particle physicists have been
frustrated. The reason is that theory has outstripped experimental capacity.
Theoreticians have leaped ahead in conceptualising the deep structure of the
universe; but to test their ideas new laboratories are needed,
unprecedentedly large and expensive. This book states the case for building
them.
It is a topic close to Weinberg's heart. He is head of an Dollars 8bn
project in Texas to construct a Superconducting Super Collider (SSC), a
53-mile-long oval tunnel in which protons can be smashed together at energy
levels far greater than those now experimentally possible. The results
promise a dramatic increase in scientific understanding.
In testifying to Congressional funding committees on behalf of the SSC,
Weinberg found that he had to explain the recent history of particle
physics, its present deadlock, and the discoveries that an SSC promises. He
also found himself defending fundamental physics against its critics, among
them other scientists wishing to promote their own research in the fierce
competition for funds. An obvious format for a non-specialist statement of
Weinberg's case is a book; and here it is - highly literate, comprehensive,
challenging, a survey of an exciting and extraordinary field of enquiry by
one of its leading figures.
Weinberg's task is to describe the current 'standard model' of elementary
particles and forces, and to explain why it is now at an impasse. The model
results from marrying relativity and quantum mechanics, which are mutually
incompatible in all but a very few interpretations. The standard model is
the best of these few. In older theories, atoms were conceived as miniature
planetary systems with electrons orbiting a nucleus. The new model argues
that there are no particles as such, only bundles of energy in various
fields. Fields are modifications of space, and there is one for each type of
particle. Electrons are energy bundles or 'quanta' in electron fields,
photons are quanta in electromagnetic fields. The nuclear particles are
themselves compounds of more elementary quanta, 'quarks', each with their
own fields. These phenomena are described by field equations, and their
interactions - the strong and weak nuclear forces, the electromagnetic
force, and gravity - are governed by the general principles of quantum
mechanics and relativity.
This model has proved highly successful in its predictive and explanatory
power. But it is full of problems, which theoreticians have been trying to
understand and which SSC-type experiments might resolve. The chief is that,
although the standard model offers some success in unifying the
electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces, it does not unify them with the
strong nuclear forces. Still worse, it has no way of describing gravitation
in terms of quantum field theory.
The aim of deriving a unified theory for all nature's forces is therefore at
a stand. Such a theory is the grail of fundamental physics, and would, in
Weinberg's view, constitute the "Final Theory' about physical reality.
Theoreticians offer proposals, like 'superstring theory', to overcome the
standard model's difficulties. But only SSC-type experiment can turn such
guesses into progress.
Weinberg promotes the SSC as a key towards discovering the final truth about
the universe. This involves him in two controversial commitments. First, he
is a realist about the standard model; he believes that field theory
describes the world as it really is. And therefore, secondly, he is a
reductionist about particle physics; he believes that all other sciences
rest on it, and 'with enough computer power and time' can be explained by
it. These beliefs involve him in quarrels with fellow-scientists unpersuaded
by reductionism, and with philosophers unpersuaded by realism.
Many biologists count among anti-reductionists. They see living organisms as
having 'emergent' properties inexplicable on the basis of microstructure
alone. Emergent properties are those which complex systems have but their
parts lack; consciousness, and life itself, are examples - neither seem
inferrable from an organism's underlying physics. Even some of Weinberg 's
fellow-physicists, those working on condensed matter and low temperature
phenomena, are unpersuaded that particle physics answers their questions.
These issues are profoundly important, and not just because billions of
research dollars turn on them.
Weinberg is right to oppose those philosophers whose scientifically
illiterate relativism leads them to think that science is merely one among
many ideologies, and - according to some - a 'sexist, racist and
imperialist' one at that. But he misunderstands Positivism, which he defines
as the claim that science should avoid talk of unobservable entities and
forces. Positivists indeed allow such talk, but treat it as purely
instrumental in helping us to construct useful theories. Weinberg believes
that one can deduce a theory's truth from its utility, but Positivists deny
this; Ptolemy's geocentric astronomy worked for navigation and prediction of
eclipses, they point out, but we do not think it true.
Weinberg's controversial claims are stimulating and the whole issue of
fundamental physics, now at a crucial point in its history, is immensely
important. The question is: should we invest further huge sums in attempts
to understand the universe, with so many other demands on our purses?
Weinberg has written an important, and an exhilarating, book in urging the
affirmative answer.

PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION
by D M Thomas
Bloomsbury Pounds 15.99, 278 pages
FLYING INTO LOVE
by D M Thomas
Sceptre Pounds 5.99, 261 pages
IT IS difficult to say which of these novels - last year's Kennedy saga,
Flying into Love, or this year's dose of Auschwitz-angst, Pictures at an
Exhibition - is the more distasteful. Nuns, women in general and President
Kennedy get a bad time in the former, while the latter has it in for
concentration camp survivors and Thatcher's chattering classes. The trouble
is that both books are - up to a point  - compulsively readable and no doubt
their content will be given serious intellectual consideration in some
quarters.
D M Thomas's obsession with sexual perversity and death is supposedly
rendered respectable in the case of Pictures at an Exhibition by his
interest in psycho-analysis and the after-effects of the extermination of 6m
Jews in the last World War. In the Kennedy book, Thomas's masturbatory
fantasies about nuns and Kennedy are prefaced by the fuzzy assertion that
'fiction is a kind of dream and history is a kind of dream and this is
both'. But few people have such nasty dreams as Thomas.
The same D M Thomas is a poet of some stature (winner of a Cholmondeley
Award in 1981; The Puberty Tree, New and Selected Poems is published by
Bloodaxe Books, Pounds 8.95) but you would never guess it from these two
offerings. In both, he uses mainly dialogue or some form of confessional
narrative - letter, journal or a transcript of an analytical session - and
so the language is reduced to the level used by his characters in everyday
life. Poets do not necessarily have interesting minds outside their poetry.
The White Hotel succeeded largely because of the transformational power of
the heightened language in which it was written. Take that away and what you
have left, as here, oscillates between the banal and the absurd.
Pictures, for example, opens with the first-person accounts of Galewski, a
Jewish doctor whose medical qualifications give him privileged status at
Birkenau and whose psycho-analytic experience is sought by the German Dr
Lorenz. We then shift to a middle-aged woman in 1991 and read verbatim her
first session with a young trainee therapist, Chris, who is himself being
analysed by an elderly and infirm Dr Jacobson who may or may not be related
to one of the doctors in the Birkenau section. Jacobson's other student
therapist, Rachel, has an obsession about a massacre of children at Byelaya
Tserkov: both she and Chris are obviously totally unsuited to their new
profession. Jacobson knows this, so what is he up to?
The story is cleverly convoluted and there are generous helpings of illicit
sex between the various protagonists as it unravels. The chapters are named
after paintings by Munch, which are given further consideration during an
exhibition organised by Jacobson's wife, where Munch himself appears to talk
to one of the more deranged characters. The shock ending, which is
presumably meant to be enigmatic and thought-provoking, comes across as
merely melodramatic and cheap.
Melodramatic and cheap are also the words that spring to mind to describe
the Kennedy book. This is idol-bashing taken to psychopathic extremes and is
interesting only as an example of the depth to which a once-talented writer
can sink when he picks the wrong topic. It's a real stinker.
