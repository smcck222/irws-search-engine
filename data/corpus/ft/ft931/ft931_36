FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: US workers lobby Tate meeting - Union
claims that dispute at Staley has soured relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A US TRADE union told shareholders attending Tate &amp; Lyle's annual meeting in
London yesterday that a dispute at a factory in Illinois was 'souring' the
business.
Leaflets handed out at the entrance to the Barbican Centre, where the
concert hall stalls were packed for the meeting, claimed that demoralised
workers were less productive and that the dispute was giving the sugar and
starch group 'a bad name.'
'Labour relations problems at AE Staley are bad business for you,' declared
the leaflet, produced by the Allied Industrial Workers. It represents 760
hourly-paid workers at the Decatur factory, where management wants to reduce
high costs through flexible working on shifts and in teams, incurring some
job cuts.
Mr Ed Feigen, a shareholder representing the union at the meeting, accused
the local management of showing 'no willingness to negotiate' and of seeking
to provoke a strike so that workers could be replaced.
'Is it possible for Staley to get its employees to be more productive and
efficient if they are treated like the enemy?', he asked. He urged the main
board to intervene.
Mr Neil Shaw, Tate's chairman, replied: 'The need to be competitive is the
most fundamental requirement. Without that we don't have jobs.' He had
'absolute confidence' in the local management.
Mr Larry Pillard, Staley's chief executive officer, said: 'Staley operates
nine other plants where it has an excellent employee relationship.
'At Decatur, they have developed a set of working practices that are simply
out of date and not competitive with practices in other parts of Staley or
the rest of the industry. Changes have to be made.'
He said he believed in 'employee partnership' and denied that a lock-out was
being sought.
Shareholder reaction ranged from a muttered 'hmph, load of nonsense' to a
sympathetic request for the management to bring in a peace maker.
After the meeting Mr Dave Watts, union branch leader, said he hoped
shareholders would press the board to seek a 'common sense solution'.
He also refuted a statement made at the meeting that the dispute was not
about money, claiming that cuts in benefits would cost workers Dollars 3 an
hour out of average pay of Dollars 13.40.
Staley has offered a 10 per cent pay increase over three years and says
workers have been involved in 'designing shifts' at the three other corn
plants, only one of which is unionised. It denied accusations of 'union
bashing'.
Tate acquired Staley in 1988 for Dollars 1.48bn - funded mainly by Dollars
800m debt, of which nearly half has been paid off, and a rights issue. Last
year its profit contribution, before interest, fell by more than Pounds 30m
to about Pounds 65m.
Declining US performance lay behind Tate's first profits fall for 14 years -
it made Pounds 189.5m (Pounds 230.8m) pre-tax on Pounds 3.37bn sales.
One of Mr Shaw's main themes was that with the global sugar market growing
by 2 to 2.5 per cent a year and starch by 5 to 6 per cent, 'we have no need
to do anything other than continue to be more and more efficient.'

FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Du Pont turns in Dollars 230m
deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESTRUCTURING and debt redemption charges caused a Dollars 230m
fourth-quarter loss at Du Pont, the leading US chemicals group.
For the whole of 1992, Du Pont saw its underlying income before charges
slump to Dollars 975m from Dollars 1.4bn in 1991. The company, however,
suffered a full-year net loss of Dollars 3.9bn, or Dollars 5.85 per share,
after recording Dollars 5.1bn of special charges related to changes in
accounting standards concerning employee benefits and income taxes.
Du Pont, which is engaged in a sweeping two-year reorganisation that
involves asset sales, management changes and redundancies, said the
full-year 1992 results included Dollars 463m of charges related to
restructuring.
This charge also took in cost reduction programmes and payments made in
relation to the recall of Benlate, a fungicide.
Full-year after-tax operating income - excluding the impact of accounting
charges - was Dollars 326m for the chemicals division, up from Dollars 300m
in 1991. The fibres division had Dollars 582m of such income, up from
Dollars 561m in 1991.
The polymers business earned Dollars 415m, up from Dollars 249m, and the
Conoco petroleum business saw profits drop to Dollars 480m from Dollars 854m
in 1991. Diversified businesses earned Dollars 241m against Dollars 197m in
1991.
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 1992 were Dollars 9.3bn, down from
Dollars 10bn. Revenues for the whole of 1992 were Dollars 37.8bn, 2 per cent
higher than 1991 after adjustments were made to reflect a new joint venture
in coal.
Mr Edgar Woolard, Du Pont's chairman, said business conditions in the US
continued to be difficult during 1992. He said there was also a significant
weakening in markets outside the US during the latter part of last year,
particularly in Europe.
Mr Woolard said that once accounting and other non-recurring charges were
stripped out, earnings for the full year were nearly equal to 1991 levels,
despite the poor operating environment.
Union Carbide, the Connecticut-based chemicals group, reported Dollars 17m
of net income in the fourth quarterof 1992, compared with a loss of Dollars
63m in the same quarter of 1991.

Looking ahead, the Du Pont chairman said cost reduction and restructuring
efforts - including recently announced plans to control employee health care
expenses - were improving the company's global competitive position.
He added that prospects in 1993 would depend largely on the rate of
worldwide economic recovery and continued progress in cutting costs.
On Wall Street, Du Pont's share price before the close was Dollars 46, down
by Dollars  1/8 . Union Carbide, the Connecticut-based chemicals group,
reported Dollars 17m of net income in the fourth quarter of 1992, compared
with a loss of Dollars 63m in the same quarter of 1991. Net profits for the

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MCI Communications, the second-largest US long-distance telecommunications
carrier, yesterday reported a 17 per cent increase in fourth-quarter
earnings amid strong revenue and traffic growth.
The company reported earnings of Dollars 160m, or 60 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 137m, or 52 cents, in the same period of last year. Revenues
rose 13 per cent to Dollars 2.76bn from Dollars 2.44bn, while traffic was up
14 per cent.
For the full year, MCI reported earnings of Dollars 589m, or Dollars 2.21 a
share, against Dollars 522m, or Dollars 2.01, in 1991, while revenues were
Dollars 10.56bn, up 11 per cent compared with 1991's Dollars 9.49bn.
The fourth-quarter figures included revenue, less expenses, of Dollars 56m
from a previously-announced intelligent network licensing agreement with
Stentor of Canada. The company recorded one-time costs of Dollars 47m due to
a business reorganisation announced last year.
Mr Daniel Akerson, president, said factors contributing to the 25-year-old
company's first year with revenues over Dollars 10bn included its Friends
and Family programme - an innovative scheme which cuts the price of
residential calls and now has more than 10m customers  - as well as major
contracts reached with clients such as the Federal Aviation Authority.
The company said that in 1993 in would focus on developing its 800 toll-free
services, expansion of its data products, extending its international reach
and developing new technologies such as personal communications services.

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph's plan to take a one third stake in McCaw
Cellular Communications, the largest cellular telephone operator in the US,
came under attack yesterday from one of the seven 'Baby Bell' local
telephone companies, which urged the Federal Communications Commission to
investigate the deal, writes Martin Dickson.
Bell Atlantic, which operates in the mid-Atlantic seaboard region, said the
union would create 'competitive and public interest concerns of the most
fundamental kind.' It added that two other Baby Bells - New York-based Nynex
and Southwestern Bell - had also asked the FCC to investi-gate.
The Baby Bells were spun off from AT&amp;T, America's largest long-distance
carrier, under an anti-monopoly court settlement in 1984. This banned the
Baby Bells from telephone manufacturing and the long distance market.
Bell Atlantic said AT&amp;T's 'overnight transformation' into its largest
wireless competitor made it imperative that Bell Atlantic be freed of the
1984 constraints.

FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Time Warner plan to cut debt
moves ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIME WARNER, the leading US media and entertainment group, moved ahead with
its plan to lower its debt burdens by announcing plans to redeem the
remaining 20m shares - at a cost of Dollars 1.1bn - of its Series D
convertible preferred stock, writes Alan Friedman.
Last week Time Warner said it would redeem Dollars 2.5bn worth of the Series
D stock.
The share buy-back provides more evidence of the company's intention to
tackle the cost of preferred stock dividends, which have been a heavy burden
on the balance sheet.
Prior to yesterday's announcement the company had a total of Dollars 4.1bn
of preferred stock outstanding. Dividend payments for both Series C and D
preferred stock, which was issued as a result of the 1989 agreement by Time
to merge with Warner Communications, cost the company Dollars 579m in 1991.
Following the Dollars 1.1bn redemption there will still be Dollars 3.1bn of
Series C preferred stock outstanding.

<TEXT>
TIME WARNER, the US media group, has announced plans to build in Orlando,
Florida, the most ambitious interactive cable-based home entertainment and
communications network yet attempted in the US on a commercial basis.
The company, which runs the second-largest cable television business in the
US, said it would eventually integrate this new operation, which it calls a
'full service network,' into its other cable markets across America.
The move is an important step in the battle over which industry - cable
television or local telephone companies - will be the main conduit providing
multi-media services to the home.
Mr Gerald Levin, chairman, said that the move 'clearly establishes cable's
technology as the primary pathway for information and entertainment'.
Mr Joseph Collins, chairman of Time Warner Cable, said the full service
network being introduced in Orlando would allow consumers to call up movies
on demand, as well as interactive games and video shopping. It would also
give access to distance learning.
The company has also applied for an experimental licence to test personal
communications services - a kind of mobile telephone system, similar to
cellular telephony - in the Orlando area and also planned to offer customers
access to long-distance telephone service providers.
This is a direct threat to local telephone companies, which derive a large
proportion of their revenues from access charges to link local customers to
long-distance telecommunications groups.
Orlando is one of Time Warner's main cable television markets, with some
500,000 subscribers. The service will operate initially in an area with some
4,000 residential customers.

FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Fourth-quarter earnings at
Boeing dip 6%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOEING, the US aircraft manufacturer which this week announced a sharp cut
in its production programme, also reported a 6 per cent drop in
fourth-quarter earnings, but a 4 per cent increase for 1992 as a whole.
The company reported net earnings before accounting changes of Dollars 377m,
or Dollars 1.11 a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with Dollars 403m,
or Dollars 1.17, in the corresponding period of 1991. Sales were Dollars
7.5bn, against Dollars 7.8bn.
For 1992, it reported earnings of Dollars 1.635bn, or Dollars 4.81 a share,
compared with Dollars 1.567bn, or Dollars 4.56, in 1991. Sales rose from
Dollars 29.3bn to Dollars 30.2bn.
Mr Frank Schrontz, chairman, said Boeing expected 1993 sales to drop to
around Dollars 26bn, with commercial aircraft deliveries dropping to about
340 units, against 441 in 1992.
Mr Schrontz said the increase in 1992 net earnings before an accounting
change was mainly attributable to increased commercial aircraft sales and an
improved operating performance, particularly in Boeing's space and defence
business. The latter returned to profitability, with operating earnings of
Dollars 204m on sales of Dollars 5.4bn.
However, these factors were partially offset by higher research and
development expense, particularly for the company's 777 airliner, lower
interest income and a higher tax rate.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Boeing and Airbus partners agree to super jumbo study
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOEING, the world's largest commercial jet manufacturer, and the four
European Airbus consortium partners yesterday agreed to carry out a 12-month
study into joint development of an 800-seat super jumbo airliner.
If the feasibility study is successful, it could lead to a significant
realignment in the world commercial aircraft industry and usher in a new era
of air travel.
But the agreement between Boeing and the four partners - Aerospatiale of
France, Deutsche Aerospace, British Aerospace and Casa of Spain - is also
widely regarded as a manoeuvre by both sides to ensure a leading role in any
super jumbo project.
Boeing and the European companies will study the demand for a double-deck
airliner capable of carrying between 550 and 800 passengers over a range of
7,000 to 10,000 nautical miles.
They will also examine the possibility of forming a consortium to develop
and produce the super jumbo, whose research and development costs alone are
expected to exceed Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.5bn).
Boeing and the Airbus consortium have been studying the possibility of
developing such an aircraft for three years. They agree there will not be
sufficient demand to make rival super jumbo projects viable.
'Based on preliminary research, we currently believe that such a project
would be too big for any one manufacturer,' Mr John Hayhurst, head of large
aircraft development at Boeing, said in Seattle yesterday.
'Studies indicate there may be a need for a larger airplane around the turn
of the century, but the market for such an airplane is limited,' he added.
Mr Jurgen Schrempp, head of Deutsche Aerospace which has led the
negotiations with Boeing, said the development of a super jumbo needed
'global collaboration'.
Mr Hayhurst said Boeing was entering the feasibility study 'with a clear
hope of making it a success'. It reflected a new way of doing business for
Boeing which in the past has tended to adopt a do-it-alone attitude.
But there is still suspicion in the European camp that Boeing is seeking to
pre-empt Airbus's own plans for a super jumbo which would make further
inroads into the dominance Boeing exerts in the large aircraft market with
its 747 jumbo.
Airbus is not part of the study. One reason widely suggested for excluding
Airbus as an entity was to avoid any eventual US anti-trust objections since
it is the world's second-biggest airliner manufacturer after Boeing.
Another reason put forward by aerospace industry analysts is that Boeing is
likely to want to retain leadership of any super jumbo project and believes
this would be easier to achieve by collaborating with the individual Airbus
partners rather than the European consortium itself.
In spite of yesterday's agreement, Airbus and Boeing will pursue their own
large aircraft studies.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Redundancy move is ruled unlawful

<TEXT>
A UNILATERAL change to employees' redundancy terms at a General Electric
Company plant was unlawful, the High Court ruled yesterday at a sitting in
Birmingham.
Lawyers representing unions involved believe this case alone will cost the
company Pounds 5m and have wide-ranging implications at other GEC plants and
at other companies.
The case directly affects the Beeston plant of GPT in Nottingham, which is
60 per cent owned by GEC and 40 per cent by Siemens.
As part of a cost-cutting exercise in 1991 GEC reduced the relatively
generous redundancy terms which then prevailed at many plants to near the
statutory minimum of one week's pay for each year of service.
The effect of yesterday's ruling by Mr Justice Connell is that GEC has to
reinstate the original redundancy terms at Beeston of four weeks' pay for
every year of service for the 1,800 employees.
It will also almost certainly have to make up the difference between the
original and the new terms for 800 employees made redundant after the terms
were changed. The company said last night that it had not decided whether to
appeal.
The main legal point clarified yesterday was that redundancy terms enshrined
in a collective agreement were deemed to be part of an individual contract
of employment.

The company said last night that it was still considering the judgment and
had not decided whether to appeal. The unions at Beeston, led by the TGWU
and GMB general unions and the MSF white-collar union, said the judgment
would cost the company at least Pounds 5m at Beeston alone. Legal costs of
the case, which the company was ordered to pay, come to more than Pounds 1m.
The main legal point clarified yesterday was that redundancy terms enshrined
in a collective agreement were deemed to be part of an individual contract
of employment.
Mr Phil King, a partner in solicitors Robin Thompson &amp; Partners who
represented the unions, said: 'This judgment could have far-reaching
implications and by making redundancy more expensive for companies could
save a large number of jobs'.

HITACHI, the Japanese electronics and electrical manufacturer, and Texas
Instruments, the US high-technology group, are joining forces in the
research and development of next-generation advanced computer memory chips,
the companies said yesterday.
Hitachi and Texas Instruments will pool their finances and human resources
to begin basic research into the development of 256-megabit dynamic random
access memory (dRAM) chips, which would store 16 times the amount of
information that can be stored in currently available 16-Megabit dRAMs.
In a similar move, NEC of Japan and AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications group,
are moving closer to agreeing to join forces on the development of the
256-Megabit dRAM.
NEC said yesterday that it was likely to agree with AT&amp;T to develop jointly
0.25 micron processing technology which is essential for the mass production
of 256-Megabit chips.
AT&amp;T does not manufacture dRAMs but has conducted advanced research in
processing technology.

FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Substantial losses at Finnish
oil group

<TEXT>
NESTE, the Finnish state-owned oil and petrochemicals group, said yesterday
that adverse market conditions, heavy financing costs and exchange rate
losses lay behind a substantial loss before reserves and taxes in 1992.
The preliminary report did not quantify the size of the deficit, nor did it
indicate whether it had exceeded the FM914m (Dollars 172.6m) loss which the
group incurred in the first eight months. In 1991, the group made a FM478m
profit.
The slump in international refining margins was a significant factor in the
downturn, while prices for petrochemicals and plastics reached 'an
exceptionally depressed level.'
The group was also hit by the weak markka, following two devaluations within
12 months, and a worse performance from its shipping unit.
The operating margin declined to FM1.9bn from FM2.5bn in 1991, although the
group noted that 'compared with the early part of the year, operational
performance improved during the last four months, when nearly half the
operating margin was generated.'
Net sales were 5.5 per cent higher at FM55.9bn. Oil sales rose to FM45.5bn
from FM42.7bn, with chemical sales up to FM9.1bn from FM8.9bn.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Fiat searches for a model solution: Italy's largest private
sector company is counting on a new range of cars to regain momentum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman of Fiat, Italy's biggest private sector
company and one of the world's largest automotive groups, will today reveal
the financial health of the group in his annual letter to shareholders.
In contrast with previous years, when the letter has contained mostly good
news, this year is different. The document comes at a testing time for Fiat,
which is controlled by the Agnelli family, and for its 71-year-old chairman
who will hand over to his younger brother, Umberto, in June 1994. The
handover will come while many of the challenges facing Fiat, founded 93
years ago by Mr Agnelli's grandfather, remain unresolved.
Today's letter will make sombre reading. Many industry observers expect
preliminary 1992 results to indicate a small loss at the group's main Fiat
Auto cars subsidiary, which accounts for almost half its L60,000bn (Pounds
26bn) annual turnover. The car business includes Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Ferrari
and Innocenti.
Problems with other sectors, notably its Iveco commercial vehicle subsidiary
 -in loss for the past two years - and with its tractors and earth-moving
equipment operations, remain pressing.
Group earnings have been falling steadily since their peak in the late
1980s. In spite of big one-off gains from the sale of non-core subsidiaries,
net profits after minority interests in 1991 declined by more than 30 per
cent to L1,114bn from L1,613bn in 1990 - itself a sharp fall from the
L3,306bn made in 1989.
While many leading car makers are experiencing hardship because of the
economic downturn, Fiat's problems run deeper than most. Its dominance of
Italy's private sector makes the question of whether it can resolve its
difficulties a matter of national importance.
The state of Fiat's financial health affects more than the Agnelli family,
which still owns almost 40 per cent of the company. Fiat and its
subsidiaries account for about 11.4 per cent of the capitalisation of the
Milan stock exchange, while the group's 300,000-strong workforce makes it
one of the biggest employers in Italy.
The group's problems are concentrated on the car side. In 1988 and 1989 it
was challenging Germany's Volkswagen group for leadership of the west
European new car market. But by last year Fiat had fallen to fourth place
behind VW, General Motors and Peugeot. In 1992 Fiat sold an estimated
1,605,000 cars, 7.4 per cent fewer than in 1991. By contrast, VW, GM,
Peugeot and Renault all increased their sales.
The impact has been greatest in the domestic market, once Fiat's uncontested
domain, where foreign competition has undermined its earlier dominance. The
main cause of its difficulties is an ageing model range. Although the small
Uno hatchback, launched in 1983, has hung on to its position as the
best-selling car in Italy, demand has been dented by newcomers such as
Ford's Fiesta, Renault's Clio and the Peugeot 106.
Other Fiat models, such as the facelifted big Croma saloon, now more than
seven years old, and Lancia's flagship Thema model, which dates from late
1984, are also showing their age. 'The group virtually missed an entire
generation of new cars,' says Mr John Longhurst, European motor analyst at
James Capel, the London stockbroker.
Even more recent models, such as the mid-sized Tipo hatchback, have proved
disappointing. The Tempra saloon, closely related to the Tipo and introduced
in 1991, has done much less well than expected, while recent models from
Lancia and Alfa Romeo have also turned in average performances.
Fiat's share of its home market has shrunk to 44.3 per cent from a peak of
about 60 per cent in 1988. In an effort to arrest its decline and regain
market share Fiat has sliced profit margins with cut-price financing deals
and generous trade-ins.
The problem of the group's car business will be exacerbated by the expected
downturn in domestic demand this year. After Italian car sales reached a
peak last year, the market, Europe's second-biggest after Germany, looks set
to falter as recession bites. Sales in November fell by 11 per cent - the
first double-digit percentage point drop for years - while December sales
were 6 per cent down on the previous year.
Meanwhile, foreign manufacturers have mounted an unrelenting attack. Ford's
Fiesta now vies with the Fiat Panda as the second-best-selling car in Italy.
VW and GM have also benefited at Fiat's expense - sales of the Volkswagen
marque rose by almost 21 per cent last year, while GM's Opel soared by
almost 34 per cent.
Now Fiat faces an additional challenge from Japanese production in Europe
mainly by Nissan, Toyota and Honda in the UK. Although imports of
Japanese-built cars to Italy are restricted by a long-standing bilateral
agreement, the new EC-produced models are not subject to such curbs.
Nissan's sales, founded on its UK-made Primera, leapt by nearly 51 per cent
to more than 26,000 in 1992, albeit from a relatively small base. Late last
year, the company started selling in Italy its Sunderland-built Micra small
car, a model aimed straight at the heart of Fiat's main market. Before long,
UK-made Toyotas and Hondas will be following Nissan.
Fiat's answer has been a huge investment drive to update its range. The
group has earmarked L40,000bn in spending between 1992 and 1999 to renew its
models and build factories. Within the next six years it plans to unveil 18
new models (a figure which includes the Cinquecento minicar and Alfa 155
saloon brought out last year).
No model will be more important to the fate of the car business than the
'model B', which will replace the Uno. Scheduled to be unveiled at
September's Frankfurt motor show and to go on sale later this year, it will
be a crucial factor in improving the group's fortunes, with output of
600,000 units from three plants a year.
The first cars will start rolling off the assembly line at Fiat's big
greenfield facility at Melfi in southern Italy in the second half of the
year. The factory, which will turn out 450,000 cars a year at full capacity
in late 1994, is aimed at matching the productivity of its rivals. Also in
the south, at Pratola Serra, Fiat is building an engine works which will
produce 3,600 engines a day for Melfi and other facilities.
Though the factories will be highly robotised, they will avoid the
occasional over-reliance on automation seen at Fiat's showcase Cassino plant
in the 1970s and 1980s. The investments have been accompanied by the closure
or restructuring of smaller or less efficient facilities such as the Desio
and Chivasso works in northern Italy.
Finally, the group is also looking to new markets to reduce its dependence
on Italy and provide growth which is no longer obtainable in its main west
European markets. Crucially, it still has to crack its perennial problems in
the UK, where it captures barely 2 per cent of the market.
Outside western Europe, it bought 90 per cent of FSM, Poland's biggest car
producer, last year, with which it has had a long-standing relationship. FSM
is the sole source for the Cinquecento and may, in time, produce other new
Fiat models. The company has also tried to take a stake in Russia's VAZ cars
group - whose models are derived from old Fiat products - though the deal is
stalled because of Russia's political uncertainties.
The need for huge investment in plants, models and foreign ventures,
combined with customer incentives to regain market share has bitten deeply
into Fiat's cash reserves. The group has been forced to raise its borrowings
while turning increasingly to asset sales to generate one-off profits to
tide it over until new models are in the showrooms.
Today's results are expected to show that the group's net financial position
has deteriorated to a deficit of more than L3,500bn - at least L1,000bn
higher than the L2,510bn reported in the 1992 mid-year accounts and compared
with L270bn at the end of 1991.
The pressure on Fiat's financial resources has taken its toll on its credit
rating. Earlier this month, Moody's Investors Service, the US credit rating
agency, downgraded the rating on the short-term debt of some Fiat
subsidiaries from Prime-1 to Prime-2.
Fiat's short-term answer has been asset sales. In 1991, it made an estimated
L500bn through selling its Telettra telecommunications subsidiary to Alcatel
Alsthom, the French engineering and telecoms group. Last year's group
profits will be boosted by a further extraordinary gain of about L700bn from
the sale of its 25 per cent stake in the Italian company formed from the
merger of Telettra and Alcatel's Italian operation.
Brokers are now openly discussing what Fiat will sell next. Mr Giovanni
Agnelli himself raised the pitch late last year when he said the Rinascente
retailing business, Toro insurance and Cogefar-Impresit building and civil
engineering arms were 'not strategic'.
Each is substantial. Rinascente, best known for its department stores, is
Italy's biggest retailer, with net profits of L101bn on sales of L4,595bn in
1991. Toro, a leading Italian insurer, made net profits of L134bn on
premiums of L2,083bn in 1991. Cogefar Impresit is Italy biggest construction
group, with net profits of L31bn on sales of L1,698bn in 1991.
All three could prove appealing to domestic rivals wanting to gain market
share or to foreigners seeking to break into the Italian market. Although
Cogefar Impresit has been hurt by the downturn in the Italian construction
sector and the country's growing scandal over kickbacks to political parties
and speculative buying on the hope of takeovers has pushed up shares of all
three companies.
But will asset sales be enough to staunch Fiat's cash haemorrhage? Two
important and unexpected factors have worked in its favour in recent months.
The lira's devaluation last September and subsequent exit from the European
exchange rate mechanism means Italian exports are now about 20 per cent
cheaper against the D-Mark and most of the currencies of Italy's main
industrial European rivals.
The devaluation 'has put the clock back to 1987', says one senior Fiat
executive. The 20 per cent drop compensates for four years during which
Italy's competitiveness declined by an annual 4 to 5 per cent against its
main trading rivals, he says. With inflation running at an annual rate about
5 per cent higher than that of France and Germany, Italian goods were
becoming steadily less attractive abroad.
The lower value of the lira is likely to force importers to raise their
prices in Italy, although few have done so yet. Higher prices from
competitors will allow Fiat to increase margins at home by eliminating
expensive customer incentives. 'We now believe we can keep our market share
without being blooded in terms of margins,' says the executive.
The cheaper lira will also enable Fiat to cut prices abroad, potentially
allowing it to sell more cars. Or it could maintain existing prices but
improve its profits thanks to the cheaper lira. The signs are that it will
choose the latter course. 'We don't think a price cut will let us gain
market share in such difficult conditions,' the executive says. 'We are not
there to start a price war.'
Fiat's second piece of good fortune came with last July's agreement between
employers and trade unions to abolish the scala mobile wage indexation
system. The agreement should help to limit the high domestic labour costs
which employers have cited as one of their biggest competitive
disadvantages. The agreement was 'a victory', according to the Fiat
executive, 'but only one which has brought us back to previous competitive
levels'.
The two developments may have taken some of the pressure off the Fiat group,
especially on the cars side. But the benefits will take time to come
through. Much will still depend on selling assets, especially if the car
market deteriorates further and pushes Fiat's auto operations deeper into
the red. The Fiat executive does not exclude such sales, but stresses that
no negotiations are currently under way for any of the retailing,
construction or insurance subsidiaries. In any event, Fiat will not
undertake a 'fire sale', he stresses.
He also dismisses persistent reports in the Italian press of the sale of a
stake in Fiat itself to a leading Japanese car maker - the most often
mentioned contender being Toyota. 'I've got fed up denying it and treat it
now as a joke,' he says.
Ultimately, it is on the success of its new models that Fiat's fate depends.
Pending the introduction of the Uno replacement, this year's outlook for the
group remains 'dismal', according to one industry observer. Demand for cars
is expected to become more depressed, especially in Italy, while competition
will probably intensify.
Fiat will continue to be affected this year by the lack of appealing new
models while one-off financial costs stemming from plant closures and the
possibility of related labour disruption in the face of continuing job cuts
and short-time working may worsen. Even assuming the models restore Fiat's
status in the west European market and its fortunes at home, the group faces
at least two more taxing years.

FT  28 JAN 93 / KLM in talks on accord with three European airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is considering launching formal negotiations on
strategic co-operation with Swissair, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and
Austrian Airlines.
The partnership talks are the latest example of the growing trend of
consolidation in the airline industry with carriers scrambling to forge
alliances to position themselves in the newly-liberalised European aviation
market.
The Dutch carrier, whose merger talks with British Airways ended in failure
11 months ago, confirmed that the four European airlines had already had
informal discussions and would now be looking into starting official
negotiations.
KLM declined to say whether it would be seeking an equity link with the
other three airlines, and it refused all further comment on the potential
deal.
SAS said the four carriers had decided to study 'whether official
negotiations on some form of strategic co-operation could lead to a
successful result'.
Swissair, SAS and Austrian Airlines are already grouped in a loose
partnership called the European Quality Alliance, which focuses on
co-operation in marketing activities and flight timetables.
Although Austrian Airlines is smaller, KLM, Swissair and SAS are roughly the
same size and have close similarities in their approach to the airline
business.
In recent months, there have also been signs that SAS and Swissair are
increasingly keen to strengthen their relationship.
Before entering into negotiations with BA, KLM had held talks with SAS on
joining the partners in the European Quality Alliance. These contacts have
now been revived, especially as there appears to be little chance of KLM and
BA resurrecting partnership talks.
The UK flag-carrier is now concentrating on winning US government approval
for its partnership deal and equity investment in USAir, the sixth largest
US carrier.
In Europe, BA has also acquired large stakes in a German and a French
regional airline as well as taking over Dan-Air, the financially troubled UK
carrier, since the breakdown of its talks with KLM. It has also bought 25
per cent of Qantas, the Australian carrier.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government plays down U-turn on pit
closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH, DAVID OWEN and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT was last night putting a brave face on its imminent climbdown
over the future of the coal industry following a cross-party committee's
agreement on plans which would save at least half of the 31 pits threatened
with closure.
As ministers finalised a draft of the white paper on the mining industry, Mr
Tim Eggar, energy minister, denied the government faced a U-turn on the pit
closures.
Pledging to take 'very careful account' of what the committee had to say, Mr
Eggar warned that any proposals were 'likely to cost the economy as a whole
more than the proposals we came forward with in October'.
Ministers have focused on plans by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, to create an additional market of just 12m tonnes.
But advance warnings yesterday from potential Tory rebels, including Mr
Winston Churchill, chairman of the Conservative Coal Group, suggested the
government would be unlikely to get away with proposals to save fewer than
the 15 or so pits the select committee report implies.
Mr Heseltine is due to meet representatives of Mr Churchill's group in the
next couple of weeks to discuss the government's plans ahead of publication.
One school of thought last night was that the government would risk defeat
in the Commons debate due after its plans are published if it conceded too
little. Labour might win over some Tories by tabling an amendment calling
for the adoption of the select committee's recommendations.
The cabinet body also discussed which pits should make up the total number
to be reprieved, with one line of argument that British Coal should take the
decision on the basis of which pits would be most able to survive when the
support was fully withdrawn.
Other ministers have suggested, however, that the government should decide
and be able to take into account factors such as local unemployment levels,
and the readiness to alter working practices.
The select committee's 300-paragraph report states that there should be no
increase in consumer electricity charges as a result of a proposed five-year
subsidy.
It expresses a strong preference for raising the funds needed by diverting
part of the nuclear levy to coal. As an alternative, the money could be
obtained direct from the Treasury. Ministerial opinion appears to be
hardening against using the nuclear levy as a subsidy route.
This money would help finance the installation of clean coal technology and
subsidise 16m tonnes of extra domestic coal output - enabling British Coal
to deliver it to the electricity supply industry at world prices.
The first-year cost of the report's proposals is estimated at Pounds 300m,
of which the direct coal subsidy would account for about Pounds 120m,
equivalent to Pounds 7.50 a tonne.
The extra market would be created by postponing the planned liberalisation
of the UK electricity market, giving power companies freedom to sign more
long-term contracts.
The report also suggests measures to achieve sales of a further 3m tonnes of
coal outside the electricity sector.
The report proposes both a new licencing authority and an Energy Commission
with powers modelled on the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. It also
recommends that all proposed pit closures be referred to the modified
colliery review procedure.

HITACHI, the Japanese electronics and electrical manufacturer, and Texas
Instruments, the US high-technology group, are joining forces in the
research and development of next-generation advanced computer memory chips,
the companies said yesterday.
Hitachi and Texas Instruments will pool their finances and human resources
to begin basic research into the development of 256-megabit dynamic random
access memory (dRAM) chips, which would store 16 times the amount of
information that can be stored in currently available 16-Megabit dRAMs.
In a similar move, NEC of Japan and AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications group,
are moving closer to agreeing to join forces on the development of the
256-Megabit dRAM.
NEC said yesterday that it was likely to agree with AT&amp;T to develop jointly
0.25 micron processing technology which is essential for the mass production
of 256-Megabit chips.
AT&amp;T does not manufacture dRAMs but has conducted advanced research in
processing technology.

FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: IBM starts hunt for new axeman -
The task facing the next chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE new chief executive of IBM must be tough enough, many believe, to
eliminate tens of thousands more jobs. This is in spite of the fact Mr John
Akers, whom he or she will replace, has cut Big Blue's workforce by 100,000
over the past seven years.
Industry observers and analysts have underlined that finding a replacement
for Mr Akers, who is to relinquish his role as chief executive but stay on
as chairman, would be a hard task. IBM announced Mr Akers' move on Tuesday.
The task of finding the successor has fallen to Mr James Burke, an IBM
director and former chairman of Johnson and Johnson, who will head a
newly-created committee of outside directors.
The newly-empowered 'nomination and executive compensation committee',
comprising IBM's non-executive directors, has said it will look for
candidates outside as well as within the company, and expects to make an
appointment within the next three months.
Having set a precedent by looking beyond IBM's own top management ranks, it
appears likely an outsider will be chosen. 'There is a mood for change. To
appoint an insider after making such a dramatic move would be a
disappointment,' said one close observer. 'It will probably be an outsider,'
agreed Mr Richard Shaffer, president of Technologic Partners, an industry
consulting group.
Most of IBM's senior managers have spent their entire careers at the
company, he points out. 'IBM needs more outside directors, more outsiders in
top management, and a lot more arguing among senior executives,' he
suggests.
'They need somebody who is not as genteel as Akers, somebody who can be
tough.'
Yet the 'shock effect' of putting a new management team in place may be what
is needed at IBM, says Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, chief executive of Compaq
Computer who replaced Compaq's co-founder, Mr Rod Canion, in 1991 after a
boardroom coup.
'A new team can start afresh with a clean sheet on what needs to be changed
and how. If it is the same guys it is an evolutionary process, rather than a
revolution.
'This will get IBM beyond the denial phase,' says Mr Pfeiffer, 'past the
stage of responding to wishful thinking that everything is going to be OK
when the economy improves.'
A newcomer would also need to be given free rein by the board of directors,
Mr Pfeiffer said. Whether IBM's new chief executive will have such freedom
remains unclear.
Also uncertain is how long Mr Akers will remain as chairman of IBM after a
new chief executive is appointed. It will be up to IBM's directors to decide
whether and when to elect a new chairman.
Before this week's announcement, Mr Akers was expected to remain as chairman
until the end of 1994 when he turns 60, IBM's traditional retirement age.
From Mr Akers' statements on Tuesday, it appears IBM is seeking an executive
who will execute the recovery strategy already in place.
Mr Akers emphasised that the company remained strongly committed to its
strategy to improve IBM's competitiveness and profitability.
A new IBM chief executive might also reflect upon how quickly directors can
lose confidence in top managers. Just a month ago, Mr Akers confidently told
Wall Street analysts 'the IBM board support this management, the board
supports me and I do not plan to step aside. I have not given it any
thought.'
Yet Mr Akers was evidently persuaded to give a great deal of thought to his
role at IBM, and on Monday the company's board accepted his proposal that it
begin looking for somebody to replace him.
The degree to which IBM's directors encouraged Mr Akers to step aside
remains unclear.
'We may never know what really happened,' said one IBM manager, 'but it is
clear that he (Mr Akers) made an abrupt change, and it seems unlikely that
he would do so without pressure from the board.'

The shares are to be issued to International Business Machines for a total
subscription price of Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 326,000) at 65p per share. In
addition, Tadpole will issue to IBM warrants to subscribe for 2.22m new
ordinary shares - equivalent to 10 per cent of Tadpole's fully-diluted share
capital.
The deal is the result of negotiations agreed when the electronics company
moved from the over-the-counter market to a listing in December last year
and announced it had formed an alliance with IBM.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN Vice President Alexander Rutskoi was quoted as saying yesterday that
Moscow was ready to use its veto power in the United Nations Security
Council to halt 'ill-conceived' US attacks on Iraq, AP reports from Moscow.
His criticism was among the harshest yet by a Russian leader and was at odds
with the line taken by President Boris Yeltsin. The vice president has often
disagreed with Mr Yeltsin, and his comments reflected hard-line pressure on
the president to oppose the US actions.
The United Nations must 'not allow the US to act in this way on its own
will,' Mr Rutskoi told the Interfax news agency. Russia was prepared to use
its 'possibilities' as a veto-wielding member of the Security Council to
prevent further raids.
' I am against the tactics of force against Iraq being employed by the
United States,' the vice president told Interfax.
Several Russian officials and lawmakers stepped up their criticism of the US
raids following an attack on Baghdad this month. The Foreign Ministry later
demanded a UN review of the US actions.
Mr Rutskoi criticised the 'disproportionate and sometimes ill-conceived
deployment of the US military.' He accused the US of claiming UN permission
for the raids while acting almost unilaterally. Armed Iraqis have crossed
the border three times over the past week to rob Kuwaiti farmers and their
Asian employees, Sheik Ahmed al-Hamoud al-Sabah, Kuwait's interior minister,
said yesterday.
He said he believed the intruders were Iraqi security police dressed in
civilian clothes. They stole money, watches and television sets, he said.
Nevertheless, the minister noted that security had improved markedly since
January 17, when Iraq removed six police posts from land ceded to Kuwait
under a new border demarcated by the United Nations last year.
'But still we have incidents, especially shooting at night,' said Sheik
Ahmed.
There have been numerous border incidents involving smugglers of sheep,
whisky and guns since the end of the Gulf war nearly two years ago.
Both the minister and western officials said agricultural projects along the
border were most likely to be the flashpoint for future clashes between Iraq
and Kuwait.
About 50 Iraqi farmers must move onto Kuwaiti soil to harvest their crops -
mostly tomatoes, along with onions and garlic, officials said.

France's ecologists have almost caught up with the ruling Socialist party in
public support, two months ahead of parliamentary elections, an opinion poll
published yesterday showed, Reuter reports from Paris.
The BVA poll for Paris-Match magazine put support for the United Ecologist
list at 19 per cent, a gain of four percentage points in two weeks, while
the Socialists stood at 19.5 per cent, as their slow erosion was continued.
The ecologists draw much of their support from disillusioned Socialist
voters. The centre-right alliance of the RPR and UDF slipped to 39 per cent
from 41.5 per cent.
The extreme-right National Front was credited with 11 per cent and the
Communist Party with 8 per cent.

<TEXT>
DIRECT foreign investment in Romania doubled in 1992 and is expected to show
a similar increase this year, the country's development agency said
yesterday.
Foreign companies committed Dollars 269.1m last year, bringing total foreign
investment to Dollars 537.8m since the overthrow of the Ceausescu regime in
December 1989.
Western European groups continue to provide most of the capital, accounting
for 69 per cent of investment with North America providing 15 per cent.
Shell, one of four western companies to be awarded oil exploration
contracts, made the biggest single investment in 1992, worth Dollars 44m.
However, Italian companies, which have targeted textiles, engineering and
metallurgy, are the top investors with Dollars 70.5m, according to Romanian
Development Agency figures.
Despite uncertainty over the new government's commitment to far-reaching
economic reform, the RDA is confident investment will double again in 1993.
With funding from the European Community's Phare programme of aid to eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union, the agency recently hired Saatchi and
Saatchi, the advertising agency, as part of moves to improve the country's
image with investors and publicise its fledgling privatisation scheme.
'There is a relative lack of information about Romania and investment
opportunities here. Countries like Hungary have promoted themselves more
than we have, and it shows. We intend to remedy that this year,' said Mr
Florin Bonciu, RDA director general.
In addition, the state-funded RDA has proposed amendments to the foreign
investment law to enable foreign companies to own land in Romania and
repatriate profits.

FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Reuters launches UK equities service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REUTERS, the international news and information group, yesterday launched an
extensive new UK equities service to challenge Topic, the London Stock
Exchange's dominant service.
The Equity Focus service is the repackaging of a service which Reuters first
launched at the end of 1991, after the Exchange had been forced to abandon
rules requiring companies to channel all stock market announcements through
its regulatory news service.
Reuters' new service has been repackaged to appeal to Topic users, and uses
the more familiar Epic codes for companies, rather than the Reuters codes.
It has also been priced aggressively with a view to undercutting Topic.
Equity Focus, like Topic 2, the Exchange's update of its original teletext
service, is based on personal computers. The 1,400 workstations which took
Reuters' previous equities service will get a free upgrade.
The new service blends Reuters news and analysis of British companies from
all over the world with the full regulatory news announcements.
Mr John Parcell, managing director of Reuters UK and Ireland, said: 'Users
can bring up detailed prices, news, graphs, and historical information with
one simple command.'

FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: USAir losses deepen after
charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
USAIR, the sixth-largest US carrier in which British Airways has invested
Dollars 300m for a proposed 19.9 per cent voting interest, yesterday
released fourth-quarter and full-year figures showing modest improvement in
operating performance, but significantly larger after-tax losses thanks to
one-off charges.
The heavily-indebted carrier also announced agreement on a revised aircraft
delivery schedule with Boeing which, USAir said, would cut its capital
expenditure requirements by Dollars 835m between 1993 and 1996.
USAir's figures showed a pre-tax loss of Dollars 254.1m in the fourth
quarter of 1992. This compared with a tiny Dollars 2.9m profit in the same
period of 1991 and was scored on a 2 per cent decline in revenues, at
Dollars 1.63bn.
The fourth-quarter deficit meant that USAir lost Dollars 600.8m pre-tax last
year, compared with Dollars 414.8m in 1991, on revenues of Dollars 6.69bn
(up from Dollars 6.51bn). The after-tax loss of Dollars 1.22bn, compared
with a Dollars 305.3m deficit for 1991, reflected a one-off, non-cash charge
of Dollars 745.7m, to cover the new US accounting standard on non-pension
retirement benefits, partly offset by a Dollars 117.6m tax credit.
Even at the pre-tax level, USAir's results were riddled by one-off items,
and Mr Seth Schofield, chairman, was quick to focus on an improvement in the
underlying operating results.
USAir's operating loss for the 12 months, before any exceptional or
extraordinary items, narrowed from Dollars 219.4m to Dollars 166.4m,
although in the final three months it widened again from Dollars 14.4m to
Dollars 31.7m.
'While we are concerned about the continuing propensity of the industry to
offer too much capacity in the face of weak demand, we are seeing positive
trends at USAir in unit revenues and unit costs,' claimed Mr Schofield.
Within the 1992 pre-tax figure, USAir incurred Dollars 170.1m of
extraordinary charges. The annual non-operating expense - mainly interest
charges on the group's large debt - totalled Dollars 264.3m, compared with
Dollars 241.3m in 1991.
Mr Warren Buffett, the US investor and chairman of the Berkshire Hathaway
group, and Mr Charles Munger, vice-chairman at Berkshire Hathaway, have
joined the USAir board. Berkshire Hathaway has held a tranche of USAir
convertible preferred shares for some years.

FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Veba suffers from 'marked loss'
in chemical operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NET profits at Veba, the Dusseldorf-based conglomerate, fell by 20 per cent
last year to DM900m (Dollars 570.7m), down from DM1.02bn in 1991. Sales
climbed by 12 per cent to DM67bn, reflecting the inclusion of the forwarding
company Schenker for the first time.
The profits drop was due to a 'marked loss' in the company's chemicals
operations, combined with a substantial deterioration in earnings in the oil
division. Profits increased in trading, transportation and services as well
as the core electricity generating business.
A fall of this magnitude was expected after the company warned last month of
the impact of extraordinary charges to cover the costs of redundancies and
other rationalisation measures, mainly in the chemicals sector. These were
likely to amount to DM337m for 1992, the company warned at the time.
Mr Klaus Piltz, chief executive, said in early December that the group
planned to cut 7,000 jobs by the end of 1993, 5,000 of them in 1992. Over
last year as a whole, the number of employees rose by 13,000 to 130,000, an
increase of around 11 per cent, reflecting the acquisition of Schenker.
Other factors affecting profits were extraordinary provisions in the nuclear
energy field and start-up costs for new plants in the chemicals and oils
businesses.
Veba intends to hold its 1992 dividend at DM12 per share, the same level as
in 1991.

Ilkeston
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHEPHARD HILL CIVIL ENGINEERING has been awarded five new orders totalling
more than Pounds 6m. Pick of the bunch is the award of the Pounds 3.4m A6007
Ilkeston relief road to the company's Midland region based in Chesterfield.
For Derbyshire County Council, Shephard Hill is to build 1.1km of dual
carriageway, partly in cutting up to seven metres deep, with retaining
walls, two footbridges and a pedestrian underpass.
Shephard Hill is to renew its long association with British Coal Opencast
which has engaged the company to carry out Pounds 1.25m of roadworks in
connection with the Bleak House site near Cannock.
Staffordshire County Council's design services department has designed the
scheme and will supervise the diversion of the Hednesford and Ironstone
roads as well as the construction of two underpasses.
Network SouthEast has placed an order worth Pounds 1.2m with Shephard Hill's
southern region to reconstruct and lengthen a railway bridge at Loampit
Vale. This is necessary to accommodate the Lewisham town centre improvement
which is also being undertaken by the company from its High Wycombe office.
Other orders include coastal protection works at Caister (Pounds 169,000)
and foundations for a substation (Pounds 103,000).

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FINCANTIERI, the Italian state shipbuilding group, has sold two of the
warships ordered by Iraq but never delivered because of hostilities in the
Gulf, in a Dollars 250m (Pounds 164.4m) deal with the Moroccan navy.
The two corvettes formed part of a L3,000bn (Pounds 1.3bn) 1980 Iraqi order
for four corvettes, four frigates and some support vessels. Though the order
has been partly paid, the ships completed and Iraqi crews were at one time
training in the military port of La Spezia, delivery was initially halted by
the Iran-Iraq war and then by the invasion of Kuwait.
The financial burden of the Iraqi order has weighed heavily on Fincantieri,
which has reported steady losses as a result of the crisis in shipbuilding
and interest charges on spending for the order.
In 1991 it lost L174bn, a substantial proportion of which is believed to
have stemmed from costs relating to the Iraqi order.
Mr Enrico Bocchini, the company's chairman, declined to speculate on reports
that the four remaining frigates would be sold to the Italian navy.

FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: French banks face downgrading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, may lower the ratings of six
French banks. The short and long-term debt ratings of Banque Indosuez,
Banque Paribas, Banque Worms, Compagnie Bancaire, Compagnie Financiere de
CIC et de L'Union Europeenne and Credisuez have been placed on creditwatch
with negative implications.
S&amp;P cited the increased credit risk facing French banks at a time when their
operating margins are near a six-year low. French banks have been hard hit
by the problems of small and medium-sized companies, and the decline of the
commercial property market, but only began to make significant provisions in
1992, according to the agency.
Banque Indosuez has a large exposure to real estate and to the equipment
leasing sector through its subsidiary Locafrance. The Paribas group is
suffering from an increasing level of non-performing loans and has
significant exposure to commercial property. Its subsidiary, Compagnie
Bancaire, is exposed to property and equipment finance.
The long-term senior debt of both Indosuez and Paribas is currently rated
AA-. S&amp;P said that a final decision on the ratings will be made after
meeting the senior management of the banks affected.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NET profits at Veba, the Dusseldorf-based conglomerate, fell by 20 per cent
last year to DM900m (Dollars 570.7m), down from DM1.02bn in 1991. Sales
climbed by 12 per cent to DM67bn, reflecting the inclusion of the forwarding
company Schenker for the first time, writes David Waller in Frankfurt.
The profits drop was due to a 'marked loss' in the company's chemicals
operations, combined with a substantial deterioration in earnings in the oil
division. Profits increased in trading, transportation and services as well
as the core electricity generating business.
A fall of this magnitude was expected after the company warned last month of
the impact of extraordinary charges to cover the costs of redundancies and
other rationalisation measures, mainly in the chemicals sector. These were
likely to amount to DM337m for 1992, the company warned at the time.
Veba intends to hold its 1992 dividend at DM12 per share.

FT  28 JAN 93 / United Biscuits braced to lift crumbling US profits:
Initiatives to strengthen Keebler subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Eric Nicoli, chief executive of United Biscuits (UB), Britain's fourth
biggest food manufacturer, would never admit it publicly. But this week he
must be reflecting that adversity has its compensations.
The resignation on Tuesday of Mr Tom Garvin after 15 years as president of
Keebler, UB's troubled US subsidiary, has cleared the way for top management
to get to grips with a business that has often seemed intent on operating at
arm's length from the rest of the group since it was acquired in 1974.
The autocratic and combative Mr Garvin has been replaced by Mr Brian
Chadbourne, head of McVitie's biscuits, UB's biggest division. A trusted
lieutenant of Mr Nicoli, the 40-year-old Mr Chadbourne has won praise for
maintaining McVitie's UK profits in recession while knitting together a
series of recent acquisitions in continental Europe.
Mr Garvin's departure has seemed likely since UB reported last September a
57 per cent fall in Keebler's first-half trading profit to Pounds 12.1m -
sharply reversing a steady recovery in the company's margins after they were
savaged by the US 'cookie war' in the mid-1980s.
The debacle, which cut group pre-tax results by 17 per cent, was a big blow
to Mr Nicoli and his team of youthful top managers. Since Lord Laing's
retirement in 1990 after 17 years as chairman, they have made profitable
international expansion a strategic priority and a test of their management
credentials.
The main cause of Keebler's latest problems was another bout of severe
price-cutting in a weak market to which the company, the second largest US
cookie and cracker producer after Nabisco, was slow to respond. However,
Keebler also bungled the launch of several products on which it had been
counting to maintain market share.
At UB's urging, Keebler has already moved to repair the short-term damage.
Since last autumn, it has closed a bakery, trimmed management and begun
controlling trade and promotional spending more tightly, while going all-out
to recapture market share.
A more disciplined approach is also being brought to the introduction of
products. Although Keebler is a prolific innovator - its 'Sweet Spots'
cookies were the second most successful new supermarket product in the US
last year - it has been repeatedly handicapped by technical and production
difficulties.
Although Mr Nicoli says there was little improvement in Keebler's profits in
the second half of last year, he says he is confident of 'a considerable
recovery in 1993, even without any price increases'.
The biggest challenge facing Mr Chadbourne, who has spent the past two
months preparing for his new job, is to find a way to achieve sustainable
profits growth over the longer term. Mr Nicoli believes a 10 per cent
operating margin is attainable. However, Keebler's margin has not exceeded 7
per cent in the past decade and sank to 2.4 per cent in the first half of
last year. By contrast, Nabisco, whose US cookie sales are three times
higher than Keebler's, has regularly earned a margin of about 14 per cent.
Frito-Lay, the US market leader in salty snacks, in which Keebler also
competes on a small scale, boasts a margin of more than 20 per cent.
Part of Keebler's problem is that although it serves a nationwide market it
has a revenue base far smaller than those of the market leaders, so its
marketing, sales and distribution costs - at about half of gross sales - are
high by industry standards.
Many industry observers blame Keebler's expensive 'store-door' delivery
system, which distributes products to retailers. Carrying relatively low
volumes, one analyst likened it to 'a Rolls-Royce without a VIP to
transport'.
Mr Nicoli, who recently completed a review of Keebler with the aid of
McKinsey, the management consultants, says UB is looking at ways to manage
the delivery system more efficiently. However, he believes the biggest scope
for cost savings lies in targetting marketing spending more effectively.
Another priority is salty snacks, a fast-growing market in which Keebler has
never made a profit. Mr Nicoli believes the key lies in pricing policy,
which is receiving close attention. 'It is clear that we have the
manufacturing and new product development capacity. We should be able to
market effectively and make money,' he says.
But UB's biggest and boldest initiative to strengthen Keebler is its entry
into own-label cookie manufacturing through the Pounds 47m acquisition this
month of Bake-Line, the leading US specialist in the sector. UB began
manufacturing own-label biscuits for UK retailers 20 years ago and it today
accounts for almost 40 per cent of McVitie's output. The company believes
its experience can be profitably applied in the US, where own-label's share
of the market has increased rapidly in the past few years.
'Own-label in the US is where it was in Britain 15 years ago,' says Mr
Nicoli. 'It is still relatively low-quality, cheap and unattractively
packaged. But as US retailers increase their marketing effort, they will
want to improve the quality of own-label. The business is bound to grow.'
Not everyone in the industry agrees. Mr David Johnson, president of
Campbell's Soup, which owns Pepperidge Farm cookies, thinks the growth of
own-label in the US is mainly because of recession. He also doubts that
American food retailers can match the success of their UK counterparts in
building the strong brand image that has enabled them to present own-label
products as quality items.
With Keebler accounting for a third of UB's sales, and its performance
offering a particularly visible test of the group's management, much rides
on whether the vision of the future shared by Mr Nicoli and his colleagues
turns out to be the right one.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Boeing and Airbus partners agree to super jumbo study
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOEING, the world's largest commercial jet manufacturer, and the four
European Airbus consortium partners yesterday agreed to carry out a 12-month
study into joint development of an 800-seat super jumbo airliner.
If the feasibility study is successful, it could lead to a significant
realignment in the world commercial aircraft industry and usher in a new era
of air travel.
But the agreement between Boeing and the four partners - Aerospatiale of
France, Deutsche Aerospace, British Aerospace and Casa of Spain - is also
widely regarded as a manoeuvre by both sides to ensure a leading role in any
super jumbo project.
Boeing and the European companies will study the demand for a double-deck
airliner capable of carrying between 550 and 800 passengers over a range of
7,000 to 10,000 nautical miles.
They will also examine the possibility of forming a consortium to develop
and produce the super jumbo, whose research and development costs alone are
expected to exceed Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.5bn).
Boeing and the Airbus consortium have been studying the possibility of
developing such an aircraft for three years. They agree there will not be
sufficient demand to make rival super jumbo projects viable.
'Based on preliminary research, we currently believe that such a project
would be too big for any one manufacturer,' Mr John Hayhurst, head of large
aircraft development at Boeing, said in Seattle yesterday.
'Studies indicate there may be a need for a larger airplane around the turn
of the century, but the market for such an airplane is limited,' he added.
Mr Jurgen Schrempp, head of Deutsche Aerospace which has led the
negotiations with Boeing, said the development of a super jumbo needed
'global collaboration'.
Mr Hayhurst said Boeing was entering the feasibility study 'with a clear
hope of making it a success'. It reflected a new way of doing business for
Boeing which in the past has tended to adopt a do-it-alone attitude.
But there is still suspicion in the European camp that Boeing is seeking to
pre-empt Airbus's own plans for a super jumbo which would make further
inroads into the dominance Boeing exerts in the large aircraft market with
its 747 jumbo.
Airbus is not part of the study. One reason widely suggested for excluding
Airbus as an entity was to avoid any eventual US anti-trust objections since
it is the world's second-biggest airliner manufacturer after Boeing.
Another reason put forward by aerospace industry analysts is that Boeing is
likely to want to retain leadership of any super jumbo project and believes
this would be easier to achieve by collaborating with the individual Airbus
partners rather than the European consortium itself.
In spite of yesterday's agreement, Airbus and Boeing will pursue their own
large aircraft studies.

<TEXT>
The optimistic interpretation of UB's management reshuffle at Keebler is
that it will enable the parent to impose stricter discipline over its
wayward child. The depressing one is that it highlights just how little
control UB has over its own destiny.
No matter how well the new chief executive performs, Keebler will continue
to be hampered by the brutal reality of the US biscuit and snacks markets.
Despite being number two in its chosen fields, Keebler remains a
comparatively small player with few easy expansion routes. Market terms are
largely dictated by the dominant Nabisco. As yet, there is little sign of a
truce in the biscuit price war, which has so disfigured Keebler's margins,
although economic recovery will clearly help.
A similar problem applies to Ross Young's, UB's frozen foods business in the
UK, which shows a dismal return on assets despite severe rationalisation. In
both cases, UB's energetic new management must be sorely tempted to cut and
run. Yesterday's moves, though, imply a renewed resolve to struggle through.
That may be the only viable option given the difficulties of disposing of
such assets in current markets. But it also suggests UB's share price will
limp, no matter how fast the other half of the business runs. UB's style
will be further cramped by high borrowings, which limit the scope for
acquisitive growth.

7.1bn, up 7 per cent from Dollars 6.7bn.
US sales grew 6 per cent in the year and 9 per cent in the quarter, while
overseas sales gains were stronger. Overseas sales were up 17 per cent for
the year and 13 per cent for the quarter.
At December 31, 39 per cent of McDonald's sales, 44 per cent of its
operating income, and 32 per cent of its restaurants came from outside the
US.
McDonald's said improvements in the US were largely due to cuts in operating
and development costs, and its value pricing programme. Overseas, expansion
and improved operating margins bolstered prof-its.
The company added 675 restaurants in 1992, including 480 outside the US, and
120 additional outlets were under construction.
At the end of the year, the company had 13,093 restaurants in operation, up
from 12,418 in December 1991. Of the total, 4,134 were in major markets
outside the US.

FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: US bank to spend Dollars 600m on
First City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEMICAL Banking, the third-biggest US bank which was formed from the merger
last year of Manufacturers Hanover Trust and Chemical Bank, yesterday agreed
to commit a total of nearly Dollars 600m to assume Dollars 4.4bn in deposits
and acquire Dollars 6.6bn of assets of the defunct First City Bancorporation
of Texas from the US government.
Chemical will pay Dollars 346.8m and agree to inject Dollars 251m of capital
as part of an agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the
US bank regulatory agency that seized First City last October.
The transaction is being handled through Chemical's Texas Commerce
Bancshares subsidiary, which will retain 34 First City branches, bringing
its total network in Texas to 126 offices. TCB has assets of Dollars 18bn at
present and earned Dollars 180m in net profits last year.
The assets being acquired represent about three quarters of First City's
previous total assets.

<TEXT>
DOW JONES, publisher of the Wall Street Journal, yesterday posted a 6 per
cent rise in underlying fourth quarter earnings to Dollars 37.8m from
Dollars 35.5m.
Earnings were distorted by charges of Dollars 8m in the quarter which
brought reported net income to Dollars 29.8m, or 30 cents a share. A year
earlier, net income stood at Dollars 3.5m, or 3 cents, including one-time
charges of Dollars 32m.
Revenues rose 4 per cent to Dollars 476.1m from Dollars 456.1m.
For the whole of 1992, Dow Jones had net earnings of Dollars 107.6m, or
Dollars 1.06 a share, compared with Dollars 72.2m, or 71 cents, in 1991.
Revenues advanced 5.4 per cent to Dollars 1.82bn from Dollars 1.73bn.
Results included charges of Dollars 18.8m in 1992 for the adoption of new
accounting standards and write-downs. The company had charges of Dollars 32m
in 1991.
Dow Jones had forecast 1992 earnings between Dollars 1.03 and Dollars 1.07 a
share after charges of Dollars 25m.
Gannett, US publisher of 82 daily newspapers including USA Today, turned in
fourth quarter net income of Dollars 114.2m, or 79 cents, on revenues of
Dollars 935.1m compared with earnings of Dollars 97m, or 68 cents, on
revenues of Dollars 901.2m a year earlier.
For the full year, Gannett had net income of Dollars 199.7m, or Dollars
1.39, including charges of Dollars 146m for the adoption of new accounting
standards. In 1991, Gannett earned Dollars 301.6m, or Dollars 2. Revenues
rose to Dollars 3.47bn in 1992 from Dollars 3.38bn.

FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Bell Atlantic attacks AT&amp;T
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph's plan to take a one third stake in McCaw
Cellular Communications, the largest cellular telephone operator in the US,
came under attack yesterday from one of the seven 'Baby Bell' local
telephone companies, which urged the Federal Communications Commission to
investigate the deal, writes Martin Dickson.
Bell Atlantic, which operates in the mid-Atlantic seaboard region, said the
union would create 'competitive and public interest concerns of the most
fundamental kind.' It added that two other Baby Bells - New York-based Nynex
and Southwestern Bell - had also asked the FCC to investi-gate.
The Baby Bells were spun off from AT&amp;T, America's largest long-distance
carrier, under an anti-monopoly court settlement in 1984. This banned the
Baby Bells from telephone manufacturing and the long distance market.
Bell Atlantic said AT&amp;T's 'overnight transformation' into its largest
wireless competitor made it imperative that Bell Atlantic be freed of the
1984 constraints.

FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Time Warner plan to cut debt
moves ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIME WARNER, the leading US media and entertainment group, moved ahead with
its plan to lower its debt burdens by announcing plans to redeem the
remaining 20m shares - at a cost of Dollars 1.1bn - of its Series D
convertible preferred stock, writes Alan Friedman.
Last week Time Warner said it would redeem Dollars 2.5bn worth of the Series
D stock.
The share buy-back provides more evidence of the company's intention to
tackle the cost of preferred stock dividends, which have been a heavy burden
on the balance sheet.
Prior to yesterday's announcement the company had a total of Dollars 4.1bn
of preferred stock outstanding. Dividend payments for both Series C and D
preferred stock, which was issued as a result of the 1989 agreement by Time
to merge with Warner Communications, cost the company Dollars 579m in 1991.
Following the Dollars 1.1bn redemption there will still be Dollars 3.1bn of
Series C preferred stock outstanding.

'counter-coup'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMANIN

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE depth of the boardroom battle at American Express, which led to Monday's
surprise announcement that Mr James Robinson had salvaged his job as
chairman, became apparent last night when two directors who had opposed Mr
Robinson said they were resigning.
Mr Rawleigh Warner, a long-time outside director and former chairman of
Mobil, resigned - effective immediately - yesterday. Mr Warner was described
by company insiders as one of the most vocal critics of Mr Robinson and
among those keen to see him leave American Express.
Mr John Byrne, chairman of Fund American Companies and another outside
director, is also leaving the board, although American Express claimed
yesterday that he first said he would not be seeking re-election last
November. Mr Byrne was among those board members who opposed Mr Robinson's
plan to name Mr Harvey Golub, his hand-picked aide, as chief executive.
The company said last night that both directors were leaving for 'personal
reasons'.
Many Wall Street analysts and investors have been angered by what the US
media are terming Mr Robinson's 'counter-coup'. Not only did Mr Robinson
survive as chairman; he was also named chairman and chief executive of
Shearson Lehman, the loss-making investment bank and brokerage subsidiary.
Since the announcement, a total of Dollars 1.3bn has been wiped off the
company's market capitalisation.
The resignations were announced after trading on Wall Street had closed.
Earlier in the day the company's share price was still falling in the wake
of the management upheaval and the disclosure of poor 1992 earnings.
At close of trading in New York last night the share price was Dollars 1
lower at Dollars 23 in unusually heavy trading volume of 4.6m shares. Since
the management shake-up was announced on Monday, the company's share price
has fallen by nearly 11 per cent.

Dollars 19.1m, or 14 cents a share, up from 12.6m, or 9 cents, in the
corresponding 1991 quarter, writes Laurie Morse in Chicago.
The company said earnings for the quarter and the year were enhanced by
strong copper and gold sales from the expanded Indonesian mining and milling
operations of its copper and gold company subsidiary.
Fourth-quarter sales were Dollars 413m, compared with Dollars 369m in the
year-ago period. For the year, Freeport-McMoRan had earnings of Dollars
169.1m, or Dollars 1.17, compared with Dollars 40m, or 29 cents, in 1991.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Proposed forces cuts threaten UK's role in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN could not undertake further long-term peacekeeping responsibilities
in Bosnia without a review of the armed forces cuts suggested in the Options
for Change programme, defence officials told MPs yesterday.
The cross-party defence committee was also told the UK had rejected a US
request to send ground troops to Somalia because of the strain the army's
commitments were already causing.
Separately, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, gave a warning that
Britain's ability to play an active role in seeking to resolve international
conflicts had to be limited.
'Obviously we cannot be everywhere and we cannot do everything,' he said in
a speech at the Royal Institute of International Affairs. Diplomatic
postings were undermanned compared with the UK's main colleagues and
competitors.
He was particularly discouraging about the prospect of a greater role for
the UK in Bosnia. 'To impose and guarantee order in the former Yugoslavia
would take huge forces and huge risks over an indefinite period.'
The defence committee's report, due to be published on February 9, is
expected to call on ministers to rethink the programme of reductions in the
light of the threats to international stability that have emerged since the
end of the Cold War. Labour has renewed its demand for an urgent review of
defence policy.
Mr Bill Reeves, a senior defence official, told the committee the number of
troops needed to enforce the UN peace plan, which proposes breaking up
Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces, was so large that the decision
would have to be for ministers. One estimate is that more than double the
number of UK troops in place now would have to be sent.
The committee was also told that even in a crisis the army could not send a
second battalion with Warrior armoured vehicles to Bosnia to reinforce the
Cheshire battalion group in the immediate future because troops were tied up
in Northern Ireland.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Arts: Return of the 'Screw'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since it was seen first at the English National Opera 13 years ago, Jonathan
Miller's staging of Britten's Henry James opera has always commanded
admiration. In this latest revival by David Ritch, nothing seems second-hand
or dated. The current fascination with child abuse prompts new frissons,
perhaps, as no doubt does the popular 'revelation' of the composer's shy
faiblesse for boys with unbroken voices. But the production here makes no
sticky capital of those; in its (partly new) cast, it has all the capital it
needs.
In David Hersey's lighting (reproduced by Neville Currier), the designs by
Patrick Robertson and Rosemary Vercoe still look faultlessly apt: shadowy
projections of country-house views upon a quasi-Japanese structure of pale
screens, casting disoriented perspectives beyond them. In the pit James
Holmes conducts his first-rate small ensemble to searching, vigorous
purpose. There is no longueur.
As the haunted children Miles and Flora, 12-year-old Samuel Burkey again
offers tight little smiles that suggest inner stresses, and Megan Davis -
new to the cast, but much older - captures sinister pubescent mischief with
uncanny success. Like their elders, they play with a subtlety rare on a big
stage like the ENO's, and they sing in consistent character. Christine
Bunning repeats her vampirish Miss Jessel, a delectable study in ruined
allure.
Philip Langridge returns as the abuser from beyond the grave, Peter Quint,
imperious and ambiguous, with a copper-coloured mane and trenchant,
transparent diction. That latter virtue also makes his new doubling as
Narrator a superb prologue to the piece, every word steeped in unspoken
forebodings. This will be no surprise to regular opera-goers, who are well
aware that Langridge is now at the remarkable peak of his operatic prime.
There is a fine new Mrs Grose from Mary Lloyd Davies, who projects
conviction and looks utterly to the manor born, a model of trim, homely
decency. Toward the end, after her sleepless night hearing Flora's ghastly
dream-confessions, I thought she looked under-harrowed - but the style of
this Turn of the Screw does not accommodate raw scarification.
Neither did Valerie Masterson's new Governess reel much at the final
catastrophe, which left her 'Malo' lullaby with less wrenching Affekt than
it wants. This well-loved soprano wields such tremulous, nerve-end poise,
however, and such vulnerable beauty and frailty, as to make her already
unforgettable in the role. It is her first operatic entry into Britten, and
a perfect choice.
On the first night, the ensembles were not yet in perfect focus; when they
are, and Miss Masterson can bestride them with full dramatic authority, she
will be more memorable still.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Press watchdog condemns bugging
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Press Complaints Commission, the self-regulatory body for the newspaper
industry, said yesterday that bugging private telephone calls was an
invasion of privacy and therefore contrary to the industry's code of
practice.
But it recognised at its latest monthly meeting that exceptional
circumstances might arise justifying publication. It called for legislation
to clarify the law surrounding the issue.
The commission also deplored publication by some newspapers of a transcript
of a conversation allegedly between the Prince of Wales and Mrs Camilla
Parker-Bowles.
It proposed changes to toughen the existing system of regulation, and agreed
that the composition of the commission should change to include a majority
of lay members to underline the its independence. It also urged editors to
endorse a 'strengthened' code of practice which would be recognised as fair
by the public.
The commission welcomed moves to include copies of the code of practice in
some journalists' contracts.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Property fraud charges imminent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEST MIDLANDS police will soon charge with fraud at least 10 and possibly 12
businessmen - including company executives, solicitors and property valuers
 -who allegedly set up a series of illegal commercial property transactions
in Birmingham and the Black Country.
Deals valued at about Pounds 50m have come to light during a nine-month
inquiry by the West Midlands commercial fraud squad, helped by the fraud
investigation group of the Crown Prosecution Service.
The investigation is concentrated on the purchase and sale of 15 properties
where loans of Pounds 6m have been taken out.
Five people have been arrested, though no charges have been brought. Further
arrests are expected in the next two months.
The properties - offices, pubs and warehouses - changed hands as the first
cracks started to appear in the commercial property market during 1989-90,
when credit was still readily available.
The deals allegedly had elements in common, and were made as follows:
A property would be bought legitimately.
It would be given a new, but inflated, professional valuation and sold on
sometimes once, sometimes twice, to companies associated with the original
purchaser.
Loans would be raised on the authority of the inflated valuation. But loans
were not repaid and companies taking them out went into liquidation.
The companies involved were thus able to obtain money at two levels, from
the difference between the original purchase price and the inflated resale
price, and from the loans.
West Midlands police became alerted to the possibility of a commercial
property ring from two sources: first, when they were investigating a series
of residential property mortgage frauds, and second, through concern by the
yet unnamed lending institutions.
It set up an inquiry team of 10 officers, which narrowed its investigation
to specific transactions.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Tourist chief failed to win allies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN MR WILLIAM Davis went to see Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage
secretary, last Tuesday he hoped to be told that the government wanted him
to remain as chairman of the British Tourist Authority and the English
Tourist Board.
Mr Brooke did not oblige. Mr Davis's three-year term, which ends in March,
is the shortest served by any chairman of either body.
Mr Davis, a publishing millionaire, said he was going because of the
government's lukewarm attitude to tourism, evidenced by its decision to cut
the ETB's grant from Pounds 15.4m this year to Pounds 9.1m by 1995.
One tourist industry insider said: 'I think he was keen to hear that he had
been reappointed. But it has to be said he wasn't very good at being
diplomatic. Even if you are an entrepreneurial type, there have to be ways
to influence civil servants.
'Frankly, he's rubbed people up the wrong way in the industry as well.'
Attacks on the government's tourism policy usually elicit a favourable
response from the industry. Mr Davis's swipe has not, however, met with
universal approval.
While the ETB, which concentrates on domestic tourism, is to have its grant
cut, the BTA, which represents Britain abroad, is being treated more gently.
The BTA grant of Pounds 32.1m is to increase to Pounds 33.5m in 1995.
An executive with one large UK hotel group said he thought the BTA was more
important. If necessary, it should be favoured at the expense of the ETB.
'If the cake has to be cut, that's the right way to cut it,' he said.

Ethiopian officials said a four-man team of Unita generals had arrived and
that a first round of talks with a government team was due to start this
morning.
Although a temporary cease-fire was negotiated, fierce fighting continued
yesterday around the city of Huambo, UN officials told AP in Luanda.
Thousands have been reported killed in three weeks of fighting there.

<TEXT>
RUSSIAN Vice President Alexander Rutskoi was quoted as saying yesterday that
Moscow was ready to use its veto power in the United Nations Security
Council to halt 'ill-conceived' US attacks on Iraq, AP reports from Moscow.
His criticism was among the harshest yet by a Russian leader and was at odds
with the line taken by President Boris Yeltsin. The vice president has often
disagreed with Mr Yeltsin, and his comments reflected hard-line pressure on
the president to oppose the US actions.
The United Nations must 'not allow the US to act in this way on its own
will,' Mr Rutskoi told the Interfax news agency. Russia was prepared to use
its 'possibilities' as a veto-wielding member of the Security Council to
prevent further raids.
' I am against the tactics of force against Iraq being employed by the
United States,' the vice president told Interfax.
Several Russian officials and lawmakers stepped up their criticism of the US
raids following an attack on Baghdad this month. The Foreign Ministry later
demanded a UN review of the US actions.
Mr Rutskoi criticised the 'disproportionate and sometimes ill-conceived
deployment of the US military.' He accused the US of claiming UN permission
for the raids while acting almost unilaterally. Armed Iraqis have crossed
the border three times over the past week to rob Kuwaiti farmers and their
Asian employees, Sheik Ahmed al-Hamoud al-Sabah, Kuwait's interior minister,
said yesterday.
He said he believed the intruders were Iraqi security police dressed in
civilian clothes. They stole money, watches and television sets, he said.
Nevertheless, the minister noted that security had improved markedly since
January 17, when Iraq removed six police posts from land ceded to Kuwait
under a new border demarcated by the United Nations last year.
'But still we have incidents, especially shooting at night,' said Sheik
Ahmed.
There have been numerous border incidents involving smugglers of sheep,
whisky and guns since the end of the Gulf war nearly two years ago.
Both the minister and western officials said agricultural projects along the
border were most likely to be the flashpoint for future clashes between Iraq
and Kuwait.
About 50 Iraqi farmers must move onto Kuwaiti soil to harvest their crops -
mostly tomatoes, along with onions and garlic, officials said.

Norway and Sweden, agreeing they were unlikely to go to war with each other,

The two foreign ministers, Ms Margaretha af Ugglas of Sweden and Mr Thorvald

tension when Norway and Sweden ended their 91-year union in 1905.

France's ecologists have almost caught up with the ruling Socialist party in
public support, two months ahead of parliamentary elections, an opinion poll
published yesterday showed, Reuter reports from Paris.
The BVA poll for Paris-Match magazine put support for the United Ecologist
list at 19 per cent, a gain of four percentage points in two weeks, while
the Socialists stood at 19.5 per cent, as their slow erosion was continued.
The ecologists draw much of their support from disillusioned Socialist
voters. The centre-right alliance of the RPR and UDF slipped to 39 per cent
from 41.5 per cent.
The extreme-right National Front was credited with 11 per cent and the
Communist Party with 8 per cent.

<TEXT>
DIRECT foreign investment in Romania doubled in 1992 and is expected to show
a similar increase this year, the country's development agency said
yesterday.
Foreign companies committed Dollars 269.1m last year, bringing total foreign
investment to Dollars 537.8m since the overthrow of the Ceausescu regime in
December 1989.
Western European groups continue to provide most of the capital, accounting
for 69 per cent of investment with North America providing 15 per cent.
Shell, one of four western companies to be awarded oil exploration
contracts, made the biggest single investment in 1992, worth Dollars 44m.
However, Italian companies, which have targeted textiles, engineering and
metallurgy, are the top investors with Dollars 70.5m, according to Romanian
Development Agency figures.
Despite uncertainty over the new government's commitment to far-reaching
economic reform, the RDA is confident investment will double again in 1993.
With funding from the European Community's Phare programme of aid to eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union, the agency recently hired Saatchi and
Saatchi, the advertising agency, as part of moves to improve the country's
image with investors and publicise its fledgling privatisation scheme.
'There is a relative lack of information about Romania and investment
opportunities here. Countries like Hungary have promoted themselves more
than we have, and it shows. We intend to remedy that this year,' said Mr
Florin Bonciu, RDA director general.
In addition, the state-funded RDA has proposed amendments to the foreign
investment law to enable foreign companies to own land in Romania and
repatriate profits.

FT  28 JAN 93 / US-EC clash over steel trade: British Steel hit by 109% duty
 -Clinton angers trading partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW Clinton admin-istration and its largest trading partners, including
the European Community, became embroiled in their first trade conflict last
night when the US Commerce Department imposed stiff dumping duties on carbon
steel products from 19 countries.
The highest tariff - 109.22 per cent - has been levied on steel plate
exported by British Steel.
The EC attacked the decision, describing it as unwarranted and heavy-handed.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, said he would raise the matter
urgently in talks early next month in the US with Mr Mickey Kantor, the
Clinton administration's trade representative.
The action, Sir Leon, said was 'particularly unfortunate and inopportune at
the beginning of a new US administration'.
Japanese steel makers said they were surprised by the US decision and denied
that they had been dumping steel in the US, where their market share has
been in decline.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry in Tokyo said it was
concerned that protectionist moves by the US could disrupt the international
steel market.
In an effort to defuse a potentially explosive trade conflict so early in
the Clinton adminis-tration's term, Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary,
coupled the announcement with a statement distancing himself from the
findings that steel was being dumped. 'They are not policy statements'
although they are 'mandated procedures and are the result of exhaustive
investigations', he said.
Steel is the first in a queue of potentially serious trade conflicts between
the US and the EC which includes vehicle imports, oil, aviation services and
government procurement. Several powerful US industrial lobbies expect the
Clinton administration to act more firmly than President George Bush in
defence of US interests, and against 'unfair trade' by foreign competitors.
The 19 countries affected are Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Brazil, Britain, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South
Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Spain and Sweden.
Besides British Steel, the highest penalties - to be paid in the form of
cash deposits or bonds equal to estimated 'dumping margins' - will be levied
on companies in Brazil, Spain, Poland, Romania, Canada, Italy and Finland,
and range from 109 per cent to 53.37 per cent.
Mr Phil Wolfinden, for British Steel, said the company's sales of steel
plate in 1991 totalled only 35,000 tonnes, less than 0.7 per cent of the US
market. 'Our view is that the US steel industry's problems are not best
served by the imposition of discriminatory and wholesale trade actions,
which is how it looks from here,' he said.
The anti-dumping duties are particularly resented by producers because they
cover the period during which the EC and other steel exporters operated
under a global 'voluntary' restraints agreement with the US.
Sir Leon said EC steel producers had 'scrupulously respected' this
agreement, which ran for 10 years until last March. 'The US wants two bites
at the cherry . . . and is therefore breaking the spirit of its previous
agreement with the Community,'
The US move comes at a sensitive period when the Commission is leading
efforts to cut capacity in the European steel industry amid falling prices
and a flood of cheap imports from eastern Europe. A preliminary review is
expected next week. Asked if the US action might encourage the EC to approve
more state aid to its steel industry, a spokesman said: 'We will defend the
Community steel industry.'
Canada is expected to act against US steel producers tomorrow when Ottawa
announces preliminary determinations against imports of cold-rolled steel
from five countries, including the US.
BHP, Australia's largest steel company, expressed 'supreme surprise' at
being targeted. The group, which faces tariffs of up to 21.47 per cent,
promised to defend itself 'most vigorously'.

<TEXT>
TRADING in Daf, the lossmaking Dutch truck manufacturer, remained suspended
for a third consecutive day yesterday as the company, its bankers and
government authorities in the Netherlands and Belgium continued to work on a
refinancing and recovery package.
Daf's shares were suspended early Monday morning ahead of an announcement
about the rescue scheme originally scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, but the
four parties involved in the talks have so far failed to reach agreement.
A spokesman for Daf could not say when the company would be able to unveil
the package. The Amsterdam stock exchange said Daf's shares would remain
suspended until further notice.
Mr Cor Baan, Daf's chairman, told 2,000 demonstrating employees that he was
'neither optimistic nor afraid' that the talks would fail. 'I am, however,
greatly concerned that the uncertainty will last too long,' he added.
Mr Baan said the problem lay in conditions attached to the financing
package, but gave no details. One obstacle is thought to be job and other
guarantees sought by the government of the Belgian region of Flanders, where
Daf makes truck cabs and axles.

FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Profits warning from Remy as
sales slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REMY-COINTREAU, one of France's leading drinks groups, yesterday issued a
profits warning for 1992 because of the sluggish economic environment and
the impact of high French interest rates.
Remy, which has extensive interests in champagne as well as its signature
Remy-Martin and Cointreau spirits brands, suffered a 7.5 per cent fall in
turnover to FFr4.39bn (Dollars 823m) in the nine months to December 31.
The company said that it had experienced a recovery in demand during the
third quarter, but this had failed to compensate for the reduction in sales
during the first half.
It did not disclose details of its profit performance in the first nine
months, nor of its probable performance for the full year to March 31.
However, the company confirmed that it anticipated a reduction on its
FFr271m net profits recorded in the previous year.
Remy has been hit by a decline in demand across its international markets.
Sales of cognac fell from FFr1.97bn to FFr1.84bn in the first three
quarters, while sales of liqueurs and spirits dipped from FFr1.33bn to
FFr1.24bn.
Champagne was the only sector to report an increase in sales, with turnover
rising from FFr481m to FFr510m.

FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Westinghouse chief executive
quits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR PAUL LEGO, chairman and chief executive of Westinghouse Electric, is to
quit the troubled US conglomerate.
The Westinghouse board announced yesterday morning that Mr Lego, chairman
since July 1990, had 'elected to retire', although he would remain a
consultant to the group.
The company gave no immediate explanation for the move, nor indication as to
whether there had been pressure from the board. However, Westinghouse said
it would hold a news conference on the resignation later in the day.
The company elected Mr Richard Morrow, a retired chairman of the oil company
Amoco, as chairman and Mr Gary Clark, 57 and president of special
operations, as president and acting chief executive officer.
Mr Morrow, 66, has been on the Westinghouse board since 1986.
The board is to look for a new permanent chief executive, and said it would
consider candidates from both inside and outside the company.
Mr Lego's resignation came only 24 hours after Mr John Akers, chief
executive of troubled International Business Machines, announced he was
resigning.
Over the past year, US boards and shareholder activists have grown much more
aggressive in ousting managers at poorly-performing companies.
An important example was set at General Motors, where the board forced the
resignation of Mr Robert Stempel, the chairman, who was deemed to be moving
too slowly to reform the company.
The 62-year-old Mr Lego and the Westinghouse board have been widely
criticised over the past year by shareholder activists for failing to react
with sufficient vigour to the severe problems of its financial services
business.
However, Mr Lego, a 37-year Westinghouse veteran, managed to soften the
criticism last November when he announced a drastic restructuring of the
group.
This included plans to get out of financial services, cut its dividend, take
a Dollars 1.13bn after-tax charge, and sell several businesses to bolster
its balance sheet.

takes toll

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOLVAY, Belgium's largest chemicals group, yesterday reported a 14 per cent
drop in profits in fiscal 1992, excluding extraordinary items.
The fall in earnings - which excludes minority interests - was blamed on a
slowdown in the European economy which reduced demand for plastics and
alkalines.
The weak performance saw shares in Solvay drop by 0.2 per cent to BFr12,750
in one of the most actively-traded shares on the Belgian stock market
yesterday.
Solvay, one of the world's top 20 chemical groups, said capital spending
would be 18 per cent lower in 1993 than in 1992, although research and
development would be maintained at BFr13bn. Turnover in 1992 fell 1 per cent
to BFr252bn.
Solvay will publish formal results in April, but yesterday's preliminary
statement indicated they would show full-year earnings before extraordinary
items falling to BFr8.4bn against BFr9.8bn in 1991.
Including minority interests, the figures would show a sharper drop of 18
per cent in net profits in 1992. These third-party interests - primarily the
former joint venture in peroxides with Laporte, the UK company, have
virtually disappeared following a group reorganisation.

SPAREBANKEN Nord-Norge, Norway's third-largest savings bank, bounced back
into the black in 1992 with a net profit of NKr160.4m (Dollars 23.9m),
compared with a NKr41.2m loss a year earlier.
The bank said the improvement was due to a reduction in credit losses, lower
costs and improved interest earnings. Credit losses were cut by NKr114.7m to
NKr245m, while net interest income was lifted by NKr17.6m to NKr893.7m.
Credit losses of NKr127m stemming from non-corporate customers were higher
than the board had anticipated, the bank said.
Operating profit, before credit losses, was up by NKr86.9m to NKr405.4m.
Operating costs fell to NKr330.7m last year from NKr385.2m in 1991.

oil group

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NESTE, the Finnish state-owned oil and petrochemicals group, said yesterday
that adverse market conditions, heavy financing costs and exchange rate
losses lay behind a substantial loss before reserves and taxes in 1992.
The preliminary report did not quantify the size of the deficit, nor did it
indicate whether it had exceeded the FM914m (Dollars 172.6m) loss which the
group incurred in the first eight months. In 1991, the group made a FM478m
profit.
The slump in international refining margins was a significant factor in the
downturn, while prices for petrochemicals and plastics reached 'an
exceptionally depressed level.'
The group was also hit by the weak markka, following two devaluations within
12 months, and a worse performance from its shipping unit.
The operating margin declined to FM1.9bn from FM2.5bn in 1991, although the
group noted that 'compared with the early part of the year, operational
performance improved during the last four months, when nearly half the
operating margin was generated.'
Net sales were 5.5 per cent higher at FM55.9bn. Oil sales rose to FM45.5bn
from FM42.7bn, with chemical sales up to FM9.1bn from FM8.9bn.

DONNAY Industrie, the Belgian sporting goods group, yesterday went into
liquidation after struggling for months to stem its losses and to solve its
financial problems.
The company, which is best known for its tennis racquets and its sponsorship
contract with Mr Andre Agassi, the US tennis star, has a troubled financial
history.
Donnay went out of business in 1988, only to be rescued from the receivers
by Bernard Tapie Finance, the holding company controlled by Mr Bernard
Tapie, the controversial French industrialist then making his name in
financial circles by buying up bankrupt businesses. Mr Tapie later extended
his sporting goods interests by buying Adidas, the German company.
Donnay was restructured under Mr Tapie's ownership. He sold its industrial
interests in 1991 to Carbon Valley of Italy, and then sold the rest of the
company in the same year as part of his divestment programme.
The Donnay trademark is owned by the Walloon regional government.
In spite of a number of rationalisations and reorganisation, Donnay has
remained in the red in an intensely competitive international market. The
company diversified into bicycle frame manufacture, but has faced stiff
competition from French, US and Japanese manufacturers.
The Walloon regional government said yesterday that a number of potential
purchasers had indicated their interest in buying Donnay from the
liquidators.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Arts: Rheingold in Chicago - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Planned as the start of a new Ring, this Das Rheingold at the Lyric Theatre,
Chicago has its definitive moment in the second scene, at the point where
the assembled gods are wondering quite what to do. As in the opera at this
juncture, a lot of diverse forces have been brought together - in the cast,
in the orchestra, in the design elements - but the spirit of fire has yet to
arrive.
Zubin Mehta conducts an extraordinarily thin-textured performance, one
which, in its disconcerting starts and stops, suggests old-fashioned
accompanied recitative and which never lifts to embody or empower the music.
August Everding, the producer, opts for an easy literalism and easy
sterotypes (the interpretation of Fricka as a wheedling mumsy is grotesque).
John Conklin's design ideas are borrowed from hither and yon, and just
dumped on to the stage.
The collage quality of the production is revealed at once, in the imagery
displayed during the orchestral prelude: first a huge projection of a
faintly pre-Columbian mask with a broken nose (only at the other end of the
opera does the apparition of Erda finally suggests this is her signature),
then the three norns spinning a rope of blue light, then the Rhine (a water
photograph at the back of the black, grille-sided box in which everything
takes place) and her maidens.
These last are doubled - and this is the production's one thrill - by three
flying acrobats in elasticated harnesses, using the great height of the
Chicago stage opening to dart and bounce and flutter with marvellous
agility. Even this display, though, is not as magical as it might have been
without the ineffective efforts to disguise the machinery, and there is a
similar not-quite-achieved feel to other aspects of the staging.
For no very good reason, the scenes in the gods' world incorporate a
Japanese-style low rectangular enclosure painted in cinnabar red. The giants
are shadowed by immense framework puppets, which soon lose their surprise
and begin to look merely redundant. And the costumes are all over the place:
long black robes and purple sashes to make the giants look like a couple of
monsignors, a Fricka done up in decadent splendour as cousin to Herodias,
and Froh and Donner in bikers' leathers.
The production's virtues have to be sought among the cast, where strengths
abound. The presence of so many international names - James Morris as Wotan,
Ekkehard Wlaschiha as Alberich, Matthias Holle as Fasolt - looks like
cheque-book casting, but it has impressive results.
Mr Morris comes to Chicago having sung his role everywhere from San
Francisco to Covent Garden, and on two recordings, but he still sounds
fastened to and driven by the urgency of Wotan's dilemma: with no hint of
any discomfort through a hefty stretch of impressively hefty singing, he can
afford to colour the occasional attack with a grating strength, and, if
anything, he sounds more purposeful than he has before.
Mr Wlaschiha's severe, black voice and presence cannot reach to the
lubricity of the opening scene, but thereafter this is a stark portrayal.
And Mr Holle produces sound and phrasing of a ravishing quality to suggest
in Fasolt the pride and perfection of the humble.
Equally admirable are some of the younger singers. Dennis Petersen brings a
sudden burst of life to the stage in his appearance as Mime: his singing is
quick and sure, and neatly characterised without being turned into a croak,
while in his acting he leaps out from the slough of the production.
Nancy Maultsby is splendidly sure and strong all the way down to Erda's
depths; Mark Baker is a lustrous Froh; and Bryn Terfel, no less, brings his
musicality, burly eagerness and confident vocal force to the part of Donner,
which seems far too small a space for a singer of his distinction to be
crammed into.
The opera is always waiting to be stolen by Loge, and this muddled
production puts nothing, dramatically, in his way. Barry McCauley sings the
part with a Heldentenorish resolution and, though his acting tends to be
careful, easily has the last laugh as the gods climb into Valhalla through
the production's heavy-handed image - red poles emerging through the gold
stairway - of blood to come.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Arts: RA's plans for 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The early work of Georges Rouault; the city paintings of Pissarro; a major
retrospective of 20th century American art; and Master drawings from the
Getty Museum are the main dishes on the Royal Academy's exhibitions menu for
1993.
There is also a late dessert, the cache of Modigliani drawings which he gave
to his physician and which have recently come to light; 200 are to be shown
in January 1994 and they are expected to increase the reputation of this
rather stereotyped artist.
As ever the Summer Exhibition fills the RA from June 6. Last year it
attracted 122,000 visitors and 1,700 of the 12,000 submitted works were
hung. This year the RA will take 30 per cent of the price of any art sold.
Following the success of its new Sackler galleries, the RA is launching a
Pounds 7.8m appeal to refurbish its main 19th-century rooms. It is also
casting eyes on the nearby Museum of Mankind. If this, as planned, moves its
exhibits back into the British Museum after the final opening of the British
Library, the RA would like to take over the space and make it the national
centre for architecture.
The RA had a good financial year in 1992, with attendances breaching the 1m
mark. There was actually a final surplus of Pounds 320,000. But secretary
Piers Rogers forecasts two difficult years ahead, with sponsorship support
increasingly hard to find. The latest exhibition, The Great Age of British
Watercolours, is drawing disappointing attendances in its opening weeks.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Arts: All stoked up over Dracula - Cinema
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA (18) Francis Coppola
MIDNIGHT STING (15) Michael Ritchie
ANNABELLE PARTAGEE (18) Francesca Comencini
TRIPLE BOGEY ON A PAR FIVE HOLE Amos Poe
Bloodsucking Counts can seldom count on long hibernations between movie
crazes. Or between those cyclical cries of commentators that a newer, truer,
sexier vampire has been born. It is only 12 years, by my guttering candle,
since silken-tongued Frank Langella's Dracula, presiding over a pack of
vampire films, was acclaimed for putting the sex back into the story. Gary
Oldman for Francis Coppola is now acclaimed for doing the same in Bram
Stoker's Dracula.
But when was sex ever out of the story? Stoker's novel is as Freudian as a
pre-Freudian text could be. Apart from the cinema's first great Blood Count,
the bat-eared, rat-toothed Max Schreck in Nosferatu, every new prince of
darkness has been acclaimed for re-eroticising the role. Bela Lugosi made
women swoon; Christopher Lee hissed out sex appeal as starlets dropped like
flies; and now Oldman's metamorphic seducer, inducing orgasms in his women
as pollen induces sneezing, is hailed for  - yes - putting the sex back into
Stoker.
Certainly something is being put into Stoker. Coppola directs as if he has
been sitting on a Pandora's box of pictorial invention since The Godfather.
Out fly wild painted mountain scapes, shadows that move independently of
their owners, giant diary pages embossed on blood-red landscapes, snuffling
Steadicams snaking through undergrowth, blood-weltered monsters flung
against walls and becoming an army of rats, and an anti-hero who changes
guise as often as - well, as Coppola himself in the most protean career any
major film-maker ever had.
Do we detect a hint of self-portraiture, even unwitting? After Godfather III
 -Corleone-Coppola as King Lear - here is Coppola as the tragic prince: a
demonised hero seeking love (the admiration of movie audiences) through the
doomy blur of an ineluctable blood-lust (commercial mandates of money-mad
film industry). Far-fetched? Nonsense. It is as tenable a theory as any
other now being flung about in the climate of out-with-the-essay pens, here
comes Dracula again. The reason everyone thinks Coppola's film has put the
sex back into Stoker is because it has put the sensual elan back into
Coppola.
The film is an education in lyrical chaos. The first six days of Creation
must have been something like this: magnificent, disorderly, terrifying,
stroboscopic. Writer James V. Hart (of Hook) claims his screenplay is true
to the untapped inspirational founts in Stoker's original: he has talked
about warrior princes fallen from grace and Victorian sexuality put on the
psychiatrist's couch. But the script seems muddled and multi-directional to
me, and it majors in gauche dialogue. Are we supposed to giggle when Anthony
Hopkins's Van Helsing outlines to the dead Lucy's grieving fiance his
post-funeral arrangements: 'I just want to cut off her head and take out her
heart.'
Coppola cuts off the script's head and puts in some art. Base matter is duly
set boiling with being. As Apocalypse Now rearranged the face of nature,
weaving man's own features into the jungle vistas, this Dracula makes the
landscape symbiotic with the living beings. Keanu Reeves's amiably callow
Jonathan Harker, a hero-narrator lost in his story like Martin Sheen up the
Mekong, finds Dracula-Kurtz in his lair and stumbles on the great Gothic
secret of existence. This is: that the average fearful human being, unnerved
enough by life before death, is horribly afraid that there is life after
death and lots of it.
So Gary Oldman's Count is an appetite incarnate, an Id that clothes itself
in different guises. He dies in mediaeval Romania, an armadillo-armoured
warrior. He rises to meet Reeves as an ageing, monster-wigged dandy with
mutinous shadow. And later he mutates into a frockcoated dark-glassed
seducer, a wolf, and a ravening bat-monster.
Portrait of the film-maker as rabid quick-change artist; and portraits of
the audience as his willingly terrified victims. As Count Coppola ravishes
our senses with some of the most beautifully haywire scene-painting since
Hieronymus Bosch, Count Oldman taps the tuning fork of his lust, pitched to
the human scream, on demure Mina (Winona Ryder) and not-so-demure Lucy
(Sadie Frost).
Yes, the film is foolish in its drawing-room scenes: all gowns, dinner
jackets and Brit accents waiting to be savaged by the primitive. But two
scenes leap towards brilliance. one, the dark-glassed Count ushers Mina off
a London street into an early kinematograph show, where literal ravishment
is rhymed with the aesthetic ravishment of a screen train rumbling towards a
screaming audience. In the other, the massed band of heroes and heroines
gallops over midnight crags to their revenge rendezvous at Dracula's castle,
in a paint-and-matte sequence as kinetic as a Saturday matinee serial and as
richly-coloured as one of the Corman-Poe films on which Coppola served his
apprenticeship.
Beside sequences like these, the putting-the-sex-back-into-Stoker passages
seems tired and dutiful. Here an orgasm, there a rape; somewhere else a
frolic with three nude devil-maidens, born out of giant bedsheets like the
Rhinemaidens in the time-tunnel Ring. No, the sex is an old old story. What
makes this Dracula special is the hand and eye of a great film-maker playing
God, in the few interludes when the script and its post-Freudian
prescriptions allow him to.
The delightful Midnight Sting, despite title, has no night-walking creatures
sinking sharp body-parts into their victims. Unless you count con man and
ex-con James Woods, his brain honed to a point by years of gainful
imposture. Fresh from jail, he is determined to give Diggstown ('the rural
capital of cash fighting') and its owner Bruce Dern, who won the town after
a crooked bet, a boxing night to remember. Woods puts up ex-prizefighter Lou
Gossett Jr, a sagging-chested 48, and wagers that he will win ten fights in
a row against local comers.
Seconds out. Ring bell. Roll camera. Director Michael Ritchie (The
Candidate, Smile), adapting a Leonard Wise novel, gives the all-day boxathon
the right Rockyish rubato of slow builds and sudden flurries. And this tale
of a ringside 'sting' has a cunning sting in its own tail. But the real
prize-fight happens outside the arena: in the three-way play-off between the
stars. Woods is a human dynamo, all fizzing wires and switch-on smiles;
Gossett is a cunning old bear lumbering after new honeypots; and Dern, with
his roguish rodent charm, does more expressive things with his teeth than
Dracula ever dreamt of.
Elsewhere it is desperation week at the cinema. Avoid Francesca Comencini's
Annabelle Partagee , a French film about l'amour in which l'ennui takes over
early on. And send only those moviegoing friends time-warped in the 1960s to
Amos Poe's Triple Bogey On A Par Five Hole. The shaggy-dog title denotes a
shaggy-dog film: four characters drifting round New York in a yacht while a
fifth (Eric Mitchell) tries to unravel their mystery-prone family history.
Deeply minimalist, deeply minimal.
It is never too late to say goodbye, and Audrey Hepburn deserves a last
bouquet from a lasting admirer. She was a star for a simple reason. She had
a beautiful face and a beautiful voice but there was an enchanting mismatch
between the two. The features belonged to a free-as-air pixie, but the voice
was husky and choked as though the pixie had strayed to earth and drunk too
much champagne. Hence her prowess in mournful-funny princess roles: from
Roman Holiday to War And Peace, Breakfast At Tiffanys to My Fair Lady. Her
serious, giddy naturalism seemed modern 40 years ago and still seems fresh
when viewed today.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Arts: Handel's Ottone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To judge from the recent Handel operas in London the age of lavish Baroque
splendour has long gone.
The only way that this production of Ottone reached the stage was with
generous funding from a concert hall in Tokyo, where it had already been
presented, and even then the organisation which was promoting it expects to
make a loss of about Pounds 5,000 on its single performance at the Queen
Elizabeth Hall on Monday.
In these circumstances some indulgence may be exercised over shortcomings in
the staging. In fact, Patrick Garland's production, consisting of little
more
than a throne and a bench under the watchful eye of a Roman imperial eagle,
only just deserved to be called
that, rather than a concert performance in costume.
(One does wonder where the money went.) But at least it had the virtue that
it did
not often distract from the music.
The opening night of Ottone in January 1723 must have been a splendid
affair. Handel was writing for an all-star cast, including the famous
castrato Senesino, who took the title-role, and a
soon-to-be-equally-celebrated soprano, Francesca Cuzzoni, arriving from
Italy for her first London appearance. The work may lack the individual
flair of the great Handelian operas, but it does have its fair share of
memorable solo arias.
At this performance the Senesino role was taken by James Bowman, for whom
the present revival was largely undertaken. It is difficult
to imagine what an impact a castrato might have had in this music, but
Bowman, even these days when his counter-tenor is less
malleable than in his youth, makes the music come alive with a fine sense of
spontaneity. His most moving aria, 'Tanti affanni', was sung with both force
of expression and intimacy.
In Cuzzoni's role, Claron McFadden was beautifully lyrical, rather than
dazzling. (This was the original 1723 version of the score, before Handel
added extra arias to show off his soprano's brilliance.)
Jennifer Smith played the ambitious mother, Gismonda, and Dominique Visse
the
son she tries to push on
to the throne, his piercing counter-tenor making the pretender sound a
spoilt
child. Linda Ormiston sang the fighting mezzo role of Matilda and Michael
George, in firm bass voice, the pirate Emireno.
All round there was some want of personality in the singing, although that
may have derived from the
playing of the King's
Consort under Robert King, which was always admirably stylish, but less
keen to probe far below the music's surface. I note, incidentally, that
Cuzzoni's fee was Pounds 1,500, which must have been a vast sum in 1723, and
yet the season made a profit.
Clearly, the economics
of putting on an opera have changed since then.

Class changed A coati is an irresistibly pretty beast which few of us know a
great deal about. Wildlife on One: Noses of Nancite (BBC 1, 8.00) is filmed
in the region of Costa Rica where coatis gambol through the trees and feast
off turtle-eggs on the silver sands. Theirs is a convivial society in which
the females dominate and males are allowed back only once a year for
procreative purposes.
I continue to admire the remarkably intelligent series, The Essential
History of Europe (BBC 2, 8.00) which this week looks at Portugal, a country
which within 20 years has experienced a quite astonishing change in
standards of living.
Jokes about Swedish au pairs have seemingly and mercifully gone out of
fashion but the Radio 4 documentary series Soundtrack (7.20) follows the
story of one such appurtenance of middle-class comfort. Which leads into the
return of another admirably intelligent series which one might go so far as
to call a jewel of British broadcasting, Radio 4's Analysis. Tonight (8.00)
a new series starts with an inquiry into what it means for the British to
talk about a national heritage, a national culture, etc.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Fiat searches for a model solution: Italy's largest private
sector company is counting on a new range of cars to regain momentum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman of Fiat, Italy's biggest private sector
company and one of the world's largest automotive groups, will today reveal
the financial health of the group in his annual letter to shareholders.
In contrast with previous years, when the letter has contained mostly good
news, this year is different. The document comes at a testing time for Fiat,
which is controlled by the Agnelli family, and for its 71-year-old chairman
who will hand over to his younger brother, Umberto, in June 1994. The
handover will come while many of the challenges facing Fiat, founded 93
years ago by Mr Agnelli's grandfather, remain unresolved.
Today's letter will make sombre reading. Many industry observers expect
preliminary 1992 results to indicate a small loss at the group's main Fiat
Auto cars subsidiary, which accounts for almost half its L60,000bn (Pounds
26bn) annual turnover. The car business includes Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Ferrari
and Innocenti.
Problems with other sectors, notably its Iveco commercial vehicle subsidiary
 -in loss for the past two years - and with its tractors and earth-moving
equipment operations, remain pressing.
Group earnings have been falling steadily since their peak in the late
1980s. In spite of big one-off gains from the sale of non-core subsidiaries,
net profits after minority interests in 1991 declined by more than 30 per
cent to L1,114bn from L1,613bn in 1990 - itself a sharp fall from the
L3,306bn made in 1989.
While many leading car makers are experiencing hardship because of the
economic downturn, Fiat's problems run deeper than most. Its dominance of
Italy's private sector makes the question of whether it can resolve its
difficulties a matter of national importance.
The state of Fiat's financial health affects more than the Agnelli family,
which still owns almost 40 per cent of the company. Fiat and its
subsidiaries account for about 11.4 per cent of the capitalisation of the
Milan stock exchange, while the group's 300,000-strong workforce makes it
one of the biggest employers in Italy.
The group's problems are concentrated on the car side. In 1988 and 1989 it
was challenging Germany's Volkswagen group for leadership of the west
European new car market. But by last year Fiat had fallen to fourth place
behind VW, General Motors and Peugeot. In 1992 Fiat sold an estimated
1,605,000 cars, 7.4 per cent fewer than in 1991. By contrast, VW, GM,
Peugeot and Renault all increased their sales.
The impact has been greatest in the domestic market, once Fiat's uncontested
domain, where foreign competition has undermined its earlier dominance. The
main cause of its difficulties is an ageing model range. Although the small
Uno hatchback, launched in 1983, has hung on to its position as the
best-selling car in Italy, demand has been dented by newcomers such as
Ford's Fiesta, Renault's Clio and the Peugeot 106.
Other Fiat models, such as the facelifted big Croma saloon, now more than
seven years old, and Lancia's flagship Thema model, which dates from late
1984, are also showing their age. 'The group virtually missed an entire
generation of new cars,' says Mr John Longhurst, European motor analyst at
James Capel, the London stockbroker.
Even more recent models, such as the mid-sized Tipo hatchback, have proved
disappointing. The Tempra saloon, closely related to the Tipo and introduced
in 1991, has done much less well than expected, while recent models from
Lancia and Alfa Romeo have also turned in average performances.
Fiat's share of its home market has shrunk to 44.3 per cent from a peak of
about 60 per cent in 1988. In an effort to arrest its decline and regain
market share Fiat has sliced profit margins with cut-price financing deals
and generous trade-ins.
The problem of the group's car business will be exacerbated by the expected
downturn in domestic demand this year. After Italian car sales reached a
peak last year, the market, Europe's second-biggest after Germany, looks set
to falter as recession bites. Sales in November fell by 11 per cent - the
first double-digit percentage point drop for years - while December sales
were 6 per cent down on the previous year.
Meanwhile, foreign manufacturers have mounted an unrelenting attack. Ford's
Fiesta now vies with the Fiat Panda as the second-best-selling car in Italy.
VW and GM have also benefited at Fiat's expense - sales of the Volkswagen
marque rose by almost 21 per cent last year, while GM's Opel soared by
almost 34 per cent.
Now Fiat faces an additional challenge from Japanese production in Europe
mainly by Nissan, Toyota and Honda in the UK. Although imports of
Japanese-built cars to Italy are restricted by a long-standing bilateral
agreement, the new EC-produced models are not subject to such curbs.
Nissan's sales, founded on its UK-made Primera, leapt by nearly 51 per cent
to more than 26,000 in 1992, albeit from a relatively small base. Late last
year, the company started selling in Italy its Sunderland-built Micra small
car, a model aimed straight at the heart of Fiat's main market. Before long,
UK-made Toyotas and Hondas will be following Nissan.
Fiat's answer has been a huge investment drive to update its range. The
group has earmarked L40,000bn in spending between 1992 and 1999 to renew its
models and build factories. Within the next six years it plans to unveil 18
new models (a figure which includes the Cinquecento minicar and Alfa 155
saloon brought out last year).
No model will be more important to the fate of the car business than the
'model B', which will replace the Uno. Scheduled to be unveiled at
September's Frankfurt motor show and to go on sale later this year, it will
be a crucial factor in improving the group's fortunes, with output of
600,000 units from three plants a year.
The first cars will start rolling off the assembly line at Fiat's big
greenfield facility at Melfi in southern Italy in the second half of the
year. The factory, which will turn out 450,000 cars a year at full capacity
in late 1994, is aimed at matching the productivity of its rivals. Also in
the south, at Pratola Serra, Fiat is building an engine works which will
produce 3,600 engines a day for Melfi and other facilities.
Though the factories will be highly robotised, they will avoid the
occasional over-reliance on automation seen at Fiat's showcase Cassino plant
in the 1970s and 1980s. The investments have been accompanied by the closure
or restructuring of smaller or less efficient facilities such as the Desio
and Chivasso works in northern Italy.
Finally, the group is also looking to new markets to reduce its dependence
on Italy and provide growth which is no longer obtainable in its main west
European markets. Crucially, it still has to crack its perennial problems in
the UK, where it captures barely 2 per cent of the market.
Outside western Europe, it bought 90 per cent of FSM, Poland's biggest car
producer, last year, with which it has had a long-standing relationship. FSM
is the sole source for the Cinquecento and may, in time, produce other new
Fiat models. The company has also tried to take a stake in Russia's VAZ cars
group - whose models are derived from old Fiat products - though the deal is
stalled because of Russia's political uncertainties.
The need for huge investment in plants, models and foreign ventures,
combined with customer incentives to regain market share has bitten deeply
into Fiat's cash reserves. The group has been forced to raise its borrowings
while turning increasingly to asset sales to generate one-off profits to
tide it over until new models are in the showrooms.
Today's results are expected to show that the group's net financial position
has deteriorated to a deficit of more than L3,500bn - at least L1,000bn
higher than the L2,510bn reported in the 1992 mid-year accounts and compared
with L270bn at the end of 1991.
The pressure on Fiat's financial resources has taken its toll on its credit
rating. Earlier this month, Moody's Investors Service, the US credit rating
agency, downgraded the rating on the short-term debt of some Fiat
subsidiaries from Prime-1 to Prime-2.
Fiat's short-term answer has been asset sales. In 1991, it made an estimated
L500bn through selling its Telettra telecommunications subsidiary to Alcatel
Alsthom, the French engineering and telecoms group. Last year's group
profits will be boosted by a further extraordinary gain of about L700bn from
the sale of its 25 per cent stake in the Italian company formed from the
merger of Telettra and Alcatel's Italian operation.
Brokers are now openly discussing what Fiat will sell next. Mr Giovanni
Agnelli himself raised the pitch late last year when he said the Rinascente
retailing business, Toro insurance and Cogefar-Impresit building and civil
engineering arms were 'not strategic'.
Each is substantial. Rinascente, best known for its department stores, is
Italy's biggest retailer, with net profits of L101bn on sales of L4,595bn in
1991. Toro, a leading Italian insurer, made net profits of L134bn on
premiums of L2,083bn in 1991. Cogefar Impresit is Italy biggest construction
group, with net profits of L31bn on sales of L1,698bn in 1991.
All three could prove appealing to domestic rivals wanting to gain market
share or to foreigners seeking to break into the Italian market. Although
Cogefar Impresit has been hurt by the downturn in the Italian construction
sector and the country's growing scandal over kickbacks to political parties
and speculative buying on the hope of takeovers has pushed up shares of all
three companies.
But will asset sales be enough to staunch Fiat's cash haemorrhage? Two
important and unexpected factors have worked in its favour in recent months.
The lira's devaluation last September and subsequent exit from the European
exchange rate mechanism means Italian exports are now about 20 per cent
cheaper against the D-Mark and most of the currencies of Italy's main
industrial European rivals.
The devaluation 'has put the clock back to 1987', says one senior Fiat
executive. The 20 per cent drop compensates for four years during which
Italy's competitiveness declined by an annual 4 to 5 per cent against its
main trading rivals, he says. With inflation running at an annual rate about
5 per cent higher than that of France and Germany, Italian goods were
becoming steadily less attractive abroad.
The lower value of the lira is likely to force importers to raise their
prices in Italy, although few have done so yet. Higher prices from
competitors will allow Fiat to increase margins at home by eliminating
expensive customer incentives. 'We now believe we can keep our market share
without being blooded in terms of margins,' says the executive.
The cheaper lira will also enable Fiat to cut prices abroad, potentially
allowing it to sell more cars. Or it could maintain existing prices but
improve its profits thanks to the cheaper lira. The signs are that it will
choose the latter course. 'We don't think a price cut will let us gain
market share in such difficult conditions,' the executive says. 'We are not
there to start a price war.'
Fiat's second piece of good fortune came with last July's agreement between
employers and trade unions to abolish the scala mobile wage indexation
system. The agreement should help to limit the high domestic labour costs
which employers have cited as one of their biggest competitive
disadvantages. The agreement was 'a victory', according to the Fiat
executive, 'but only one which has brought us back to previous competitive
levels'.
The two developments may have taken some of the pressure off the Fiat group,
especially on the cars side. But the benefits will take time to come
through. Much will still depend on selling assets, especially if the car
market deteriorates further and pushes Fiat's auto operations deeper into
the red. The Fiat executive does not exclude such sales, but stresses that
no negotiations are currently under way for any of the retailing,
construction or insurance subsidiaries. In any event, Fiat will not
undertake a 'fire sale', he stresses.
He also dismisses persistent reports in the Italian press of the sale of a
stake in Fiat itself to a leading Japanese car maker - the most often
mentioned contender being Toyota. 'I've got fed up denying it and treat it
now as a joke,' he says.
Ultimately, it is on the success of its new models that Fiat's fate depends.
Pending the introduction of the Uno replacement, this year's outlook for the
group remains 'dismal', according to one industry observer. Demand for cars
is expected to become more depressed, especially in Italy, while competition
will probably intensify.
Fiat will continue to be affected this year by the lack of appealing new
models while one-off financial costs stemming from plant closures and the
possibility of related labour disruption in the face of continuing job cuts
and short-time working may worsen. Even assuming the models restore Fiat's
status in the west European market and its fortunes at home, the group faces
at least two more taxing years.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Beyond Japan's trade surplus
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S swelling trade surplus, which is on course to return to mid-1980s
proportions this year, will, regrettably, guarantee a tense run-up to July's
summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrialised countries in Tokyo. The
surplus continues to provide a red rag to the same US protectionist bulls
responsible for yesterday's anti-dumping tariffs on steel imports. But the
Japanese government can pre-empt these complaints. It is stagnant imports
into Japan that are swelling the surplus; domestic stimulation is the best
way to stem the tide.
Japan's export performance has, in fact, been rather disappointing recently.
US not Japanese industry has better demonstrated how to soften the blow of a
fall in domestic demand by shifting production abroad. US export volumes
grew by 5.8 per cent in the year to the third quarter of last year while
Japanese exports grew by just 1.2 per cent over the same period. But US
import volumes rose by 9.2 per cent while Japanese imports fell by 4.4 per
cent.
These trends are likely to continue over the coming year. An accelerating US
recovery, alongside a sluggish world economy, will mean a rising US trade
deficit. Meanwhile, yesterday's news confirms that the slump in Japanese
consumer confidence and spending is deepening. Department store sales fell
by 3 per cent in 1992 and 5.7 per cent in December, compared with a year
earlier.
Naturally, Japan's bureaucrats are nervous about stoking up the economy
merely to stave off international trade pressures. Excessively low interest
rates in the late 1980s were to blame for the subsequent inflation. But
domestic considerations now demand a looser policy stance. Bank lending
remains sluggish, industrial output fell last month by 8.2 per cent on the
previous year and the high level of unsold inventories shows no sign of
falling. A recovery in private domestic demand is many months away, despite
the official view that recovery is imminent.
A further, and sizeable, cut in the official discount rate is long overdue.
But there is little chance that interest rate cuts alone will persuade
Japanese industry to start investing; and debt-burdened banks will not be
able to start lending again for years. The priority for the Bank of Japan
must be to tackle these bad debts directly, before profit-taking pushes the
stock market down further.
For rapid results, Japan needs a fast, and easily reversible, fiscal
stimulation. Reversibility argues for public spending over tax cuts; speed
is best achieved by accelerating planned public works spending into the
first half of the year so that the coming financial year's austere budget
can be bolstered by a supplementary budget announced at July's G7 summit.
Rather than pandering to the protectionist lobby, President Bill Clinton
could then present a US budget deficit-reducing package as a mutually
beneficial G7 deal.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Leading Article: New Mercedes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER TWO years of post-unity boom, the German motor industry is imbibing a
high-octane dose of reality. Since the German economic downturn became
evident last summer, the main German producers have been accelerating
announcements of labour and output cuts. Volkswagen's new chairman estimates
production costs exceed Japanese manufacturers' by 30 per cent. VW has yet
to deliver a proper response. By contrast, Mercedes-Benz has unveiled a
strategy to meet what may be the most wide-ranging challenges in the
company's history.
The motor subsidiary of Daimler-Benz is putting forward a plan with
consequences and implications for the whole of German industry. It is
broadening its product range, moving into the city car and 'multi-purpose
vehicle' segments, pruning management, transferring assembly to Spain, South
Korea and Mexico, and searching for international partners, especially in
components.
Mercedes' problems partly mirror those of German manufacturing in general.
High labour charges, relatively short working hours and the rise in the
D-Mark will lead to a deterioration in the company's costs of 15 to 20 per
cent this year vis-a-vis several European countries. Competitive
disadvantage is doubly hurtful during recession; German car sales may fall
15 per cent in 1993.
Mercedes has to tackle weak points embedded in the company's culture. It is
paying the price for failure to heed shifting international patterns of
supply and demand. Japanese luxury car makers have undermined its presence
in the US. Customers are turning away from status symbols in search of
vehicles offering greater practicality and value for money. Preoccupation
with quality is laudable, but the 'Mercedes-knows-best' mentality has
sometimes insulated the company from the marketplace.
Recognising this, Mr Helmut Werner, Mercedes' chief executive-designate, has
condemned the company's tendency to 'over-engineer' products. Following a
line taken by Chrysler in the US, Mercedes wants to move to 'target
pricing'. Its engineers will no longer be driven by dreams of creating the
'ultimate' car - but by what customers want to pay.
Mercedes' step down from hauteur into a wider market is not risk-free. It
must cut costs, but not technical excellence. It must shed staff when
Germany's traditional consensus with labour has grown brittle. Daimler's
motor operations must achieve a virtual corporate revolution at a time when
the company's overall diversification strategy faces difficulties.
Backed by its dominant shareholder, the Deutsche Bank, Daimler-Benz
undoubtedly has the long-term financial muscle to see the changes through.
If the plan succeeds, Mercedes could offer a blueprint of how Germany's top
companies will look after the year 2000. Mercedes will be leaner, fitter,
more flexible and customer-orientated. And its manufacturing will be a lot
less concentrated in Germany.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Needlessly bust
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THE number of business failures showing no sign of abating, the
suspicion is growing that Britain's recently revised insolvency laws are
still dangerously deficient. Potentially sound businesses are, it is
claimed, being needlessly broken up. Insolvency fees appear sky-high. And
the new procedure of administration, intended by the 1986 Insolvency Act to
give potential survivors a breathing space, has, on one estimate, been used
in less than one per cent of insolvency cases.
The clearest evidence of a bias against resuscitation lies in the
preferential treatment accorded to the Inland Revenue and the Customs and
Excise. Whereas unsecured creditors have a continuing interest in keeping a
company afloat, government departments know that as preferential creditors
they can usually extract their money quickly in an insolvency. Voluntary
arrangements with creditors designed to permit companies to trade their way
out of trouble are thus frequently blocked.
Insolvency can also appear unduly tempting for the banks where they have the
benefit of security. Certainly the infrequent resort to administration
reflects their predilection for receivership. Not that bankers are
exclusively to blame. Administration orders are expensive, difficult to
obtain and risky for directors whose conduct may be investigated by the
administrator.
It does not help that insolvency practitioners themselves can be involved in
potential conflicts of interest. There have been too many cases of
investigating accountants subsequently conducting lucrative receiverships
after pronouncing borderline companies beyond hope. Creditors' committees
have not found it easy to prevent insolvency practitioners stringing out
receiverships, thereby swelling fees. A more flexible and less expensive
sanction than seeking redress from the court is called for.
In trying to promote the practice of intensive care, there is clearly a
balance to be struck. The problem with a lenient approach like the US
Chapter 11 bankruptcy procedure, which leaves directors in charge, is that
companies can rack up inordinate losses at the creditors' expense for too
long. This can threaten the viability of a whole industry, as in the case of
the US airlines. Yet as Coopers &amp; Lybrand has recently argued, there are
plenty of ways in which Britain could avoid that risk. It suggests, inter
alia, encouraging company voluntary arrangements by introducing a stay on
creditors' remedies while rescues are put together; and making
administration orders easier to obtain and more attractive to directors.
With unemployment soaring and business failures running at an estimated
80,000 or so a year, insolvency reform is no longer wholly devoid of
political sex appeal. The president of the Board of Trade, Mr Michael
Heseltine, should give it higher priority on his agenda.

<TEXT>
Is Observer alone in thinking Tony Pidgley, boss of highly-rated Berkeley
housebuilding group, sounds too good to be true?
Last night's BBC Radio 4 programme - Counting the Cost - gave a fascinating
insight into the Bentley Turbo driver's humble background. Now 45, he was a
Barnardo boy until the age of four, and was then adopted by gypsies, lived
in a railway carriage, and was only 10 when he did his first deal. He bought
a sow and profited on the piglets.
His gypsy family never bought anti-freeze for its fleet of lorries. Instead,
young Pidgley was given the job of draining the radiators last thing at
night and refilling them first thing in the morning.
He owes a key lesson - 'careless talk costs money' - to his gypsy
horse-dealing Uncle Vic, who Pidgley still thinks knows more about real
economic events than the chancellor of the exchequer, who seems keen to
court him as one of that rarest of British species: a successful
housebuilder.
Another of his admirers is NatWest Securities' Angus Phaure, one of the
City's top building analysts. He says Pidgley knows more about making money
'than anybody in this bank', and describes his grasp of the UK housebuilding
business as 'breath-taking'.
That perhaps accounts for a further recruit to the Pidgley fan club - George
Soros, whose name has just appeared on the Berkeley share register.

Full marks to the environment department for trying to find a silver lining
in the cloud of the latest stats on house re-possessions. The official
interpretation was that the figures were welcome, re-possessions having
fallen 42 per cent since their peak.
The claim rebounded, however, when housing professionals noted that even the
most optimistic gloss that can be put on the data is that re-possessions in
the second half of 1992 were 19 per cent below the all-time record hit in
the last six months of 1991.
Hence red faces at the department. It appears that the vaunted 42 per cent
drop relates to possession orders made by the courts. Yet, as the Lord
Chancellor's staff pointed out on publishing the court statistics: 'The
figures do NOT indicate how many houses have been re-possessed . . .'
For the record, last year's figures were the second highest ever, 10 times
higher than a decade ago. Households with payments over six months in
arrears also increased by 28 per cent to a record of over a third of a
million.
Whatever became of the action to stop most of the re-possessions, which the
prime minister promised on Desert Island Discs last year?

It's not only bridge players whose hearts leap at the prospect of not one,
but two grand slams in diamonds. The De Beers' marketing department must
have been likewise stirred by two unrivalled chances to promote their rocks
both in and beyond the globe's premier selling places: Japan and America.
Firstly - and perhaps not unconnected with the worldwide televising of
President Clinton's inaugural celebrations - Hillary Clinton was persuaded
to attend wearing a 4 1/4 -carat diamond in a ring specially designed for
the occasion. The stone found in Arkansas' Crater of Diamonds park in 1977,
was loaned to Clinton by no less than Stan Kahn of Kahn's Jewelry in Pine
Bluff.
Alas, the watching millions caught not a glimpse of the glitter. In line
with convention, the presidential spouse kept her gloves on throughout the
ceremony.
Still, although thus cutting no ice at the US inauguration, the marketeers
had Japan to keep their hopes alive. Just think of the promotional potential
in the diamond engagement ring which the Japanese jewellery trade is certain
Crown Prince Naruhito has given his bride-to-be.
Boom - convention strikes again. Protocol forbids the disclosure of any
sales-boosting information about the ring. Too many Japanese would be
dismayed were their royal family to be associated with a commercial
exercise.
Worse, even informally, none of us is ever likely to cast an eye on the new
Empress's diamonds. In Japan, engagement rings are not for wearing, but for
locking away in a safe deposit.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Letter: Confusion can be avoided in contracting out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TOM FLANAGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The debate about the protection of employee rights in contracting out
public services, including your article, 'Lyell rejects ruling on EC jobs
law' (January 22), is in danger of becoming too academic. There is confusion
about the extent to which contractors must take the Transfer of Undertakings
Regulations into account, but this is not the only area of law in which one
can state principles fairly clearly but be unable to predict accurately
every outcome.
The case of Rask v ISS Kantineservice A/S has highlighted that the
regulations could apply to contracting out and it reiterated criteria which
could be used to help identify whether an entity is being transferred. This
does not mean that the regulations will apply in all cases of contracting
out. Rather than complain that that creates uncertainty or threaten in
advance to litigate, those involved with contracting out could take into
account what can be gleaned from the legal position.
For instance, tender documents could refer to the criteria set out in Rask
and give a view on each of them and on the application of the regulations
generally. Consideration can be given to indemnities and to consultation,
including with the unions, in advance of the final draft.
There need not be the sense of confusion surrounding this subject, if the
parties address the issues fully in advance.

Sir, I agree with the conclusion of the Commonwealth report as carried in
Michael Holman's article entitled 'Kenya poll overseer was removed from
bench' (January 25), that there is no information or evidence to suggest
that Mr Chesoni and other electoral commission members were associated with
or taking directions from Kenya's ruling party. The commission exercised its
due independence during the just concluded elections.

WHO'S BASHING WHOM?
Trade Conflict in High Technology
By Laura D'Andrea Tyson
Institute for International Economics, Dollars 25; Longman, Pounds 19.99.
324 pp
'If the US fails to choose the semiconductor industry as a winner, American
producers may well become long-run losers in the rigged game of
international competition.' No sentence better encapsulates the attitudes in
Laura D'Andrea Tyson's book.
The book is both thought-provoking and important. But it is important even
more than it is thought-provoking. It is important for three reasons:
because of the ideas it advances; because its author is now chairman of
President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers; and because the
president's choice itself sends a signal. Where the Reagan and Bush
administrations went shamefacedly and half-heartedly, this administration
will advance with conviction.
Professor Tyson's appointment has been roundly criticised by academic
economists, mainly for the wrong reasons. Being a first-rate theoretical
economist is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for being a good
policy adviser. Believing both in the division of labour and learning by
doing, economists should understand that. Certainly, Mr Clinton has no cause
to share the snobbery of professional economists. What he will want to know
is whether his adviser shares his objectives.
If he has read Prof Tyson's book, he will know that she does. It argues
strongly for government support of American 'high-technology' industry. Its
core is a set of case studies of how international competition in
high-technology production is distorted by foreigners. Her principal
conclusion is that the US 'can no longer afford the soothing but largely
irrelevant position that market forces alone should determine industry
outcomes in the future.'
Prof Tyson argues that:
Competitive advantage in high-technology production is man-made.
High-technology industries are 'strategic', in that 'they fund a
disproportionate amount of industrial research and development . . . and
provide quasi-rents or higher returns to labour than those available in most
other economic activities'.
'The potential strategic threats posed by foreign oligopolistic control in
some high-technology industries should be a cause for policy concern, . . .
especially when this control is exercised by the Japanese' (my emphasis).
Many of America's trading partners 'are convinced that high-technology
industries are strategic, and they are willing to protect and promote them'.
Finally, 'it is utopian to imagine that the world will have enforceable
rules for high-technology trade and investment any time soon'.
Her answer, one derived from her case studies of obstacles to access to the
Japanese market in computers, cellular telephones and semiconductors, and of
experience with Europe's Airbus programme, is what she calls a 'defensive
trade and domestic policy'.
'I recommend,' writes Prof Tyson, 'that the nation's trade laws be used to
deter or compensate for foreign practices that are not adequately regulated
by existing multilateral rules . . . In addition, I believe that, in pursuit
of defensive objectives, US policymakers should be guided by the principle
of selective reciprocity and motivated by the goal of opening foreign
markets. Wherever possible they should favour approaches that encourage
trade and competition over those that discourage them.'
Prof Tyson is right to call herself cautious. She recognises, for example,
that 'even if one accepts the notion that competitive advantage in
(high-technology) industries can be created by government action, one need
not conclude that such action is warranted - it all depends on the costs and
the benefits.' She accepts too that 'trade policy is incapable of solving
the competitive difficulties facing this nation's high-technology producers'
and shows particular awareness of the many drawbacks of voluntary export
restraints and anti-dumping measures.
What is more, she even admits that 'flawed domestic choices, not unfair
foreign trading practices, are the main cause of the nation's long-run
economic slowdown'. Meanwhile, her favourite industrial policy seems to be
support for civilian R&amp;D, including direct government funding of
'precompetitive generic technologies'.
How far are her positions persuasive and, persuasive or not, what would be
the consequences, both for the US and for the world, of attempts by the US
to do what she recommends?
Questions must be raised about many of her arguments. Is Japanese success in
high-technology manufacturing not explained by the country's high savings
and its hard-working and highly educated population? What about the failures
that litter the history of attempts by governments to promote
high-technology industry? Is Airbus an economic as well as an engineering
success? If high-technology leadership generates large positive spillovers,
why did the US, the unquestioned leader of 20 years ago, perform relatively
poorly thereafter? Do the spillover benefits of high-technology industry
offset the costs imposed by incompetent attempts to promote it?
Yet the principal concern must no longer be whether Prof Tyson is right, but
rather with the consequences of her views. One could be to give carte
blanche to US politicians and lobbyists, who are itching to have a go at
perfidious foreigners, particularly the Japanese. Another could be to flood
the world economy with high-technology products, to the great pleasure of
consumers and the frustration of producers. Yet the most important could
well be still more trade friction, as the US adopts her narrowly sectoral
and bilateral focus. Prof Tyson believes in 'cautious activism', but who
will rein in the incautious activists?

FT  28 JAN 93 / Letter: Status quo is no way to free Britain from years of
decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KEITH SYKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The case put forward by Sir Bryan Hopkin and Sir Douglas Wass (Personal
View, January 22) for the continued dependence of the Bank of England on the
Treasury was erudite, eloquent and exhaustive. It was also, to an
industrialist, utterly unhelpful.
I read and re-read it for some glimpse of what these index-pensioned knights
think that we could do to free ourselves from 40 years of decline in which
they, if they have truly earned their spurs, have surely played some part.
No such luck. Status quo is the answer. Dismiss what other countries might
have done successfully. Wisdom resides uniquely in Whitehall and
Westminster. In contrast, we in industry are not measured by eloquence of
speech nor erudition in writing but on attainment of quantified and timed
objectives. On that basis, they and their contemporaries might not have long
survived.
Try this for size: 'The nature and degree of the . . . effects (of monetary
policy) cannot be free from doubt and argument.' Ergo, do nothing.
I am confronted daily by doubt and argument, but finally a decision is taken
and its effects are measured. If it proves wrong over time (or is 40 years
insufficient?), then it is rejected and replaced.
We cannot go on like this in our self-satisfied, ossified mentality. Perhaps
the plan by Sir Terry Burns to expose some of his team to the rude realities
of trade might be extended to encompass the meeting of German, French,
American and Japanese businessmen who buy from us and sell to us.
They laugh at our navety - not of those with whom they bargain hard, but of
the worldly-ignorant rulers responsible for the economic environment in
which we struggle to exist.

Sir, Another blow to the ideal of playing cricket on level European playing
fields.
The announcement by Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, the EC's new internal
market commissioner ('Brussels truce for breach of EC single market rules',
January 22), that the Commission will go softly-softly on enforcing single
market directives once again has the law makers playing into the hands of
the law breakers.
We all know that complying with the rules costs money, so those of us who
take steps to comply are immediately placed at a competitive disadvantage

How many more UK jobs will be lost as a consequence of our efforts to be

FT  28 JAN 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Fiscal virtue, but not yet please
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British budgetary policy this year will be more interesting than usual.
There will be two Budgets - the last of the tax-only ones this March and the
first of the new-style ones bringing spending and tax together in December.
More important, the chancellor faces a medium-term problem - an entrenched
budget deficit that is not just the result of recession.
There is a good deal of uncertainty - intellectual as well as political -
about just how large the correction should be, by what means it should be
carried out and when to undertake it. Sound finance advocates got a lot of
egg on their faces by predicting disaster from Ronald Reagan's budget
deficits.
The main danger is not so much a sterling crisis or an inflationary
explosion, as a process of creeping debilitation, as in the US, where
budgetary stringency has become the main influence on foreign and defence
policy, and where more of the Budget has to be devoted to debt servicing.
The latest Green Budget, Tax Options 1993, just published by the Institute
for Fiscal Studies in collaboration with Goldman Sachs, provides the best
available insight into the UK problem. It also marks the first appearance of
political correctness in this series. 'If an executive knows that she is
going to buy a machine next year, it costs her little to buy it this year
instead if it saves tax.'
The Green Budget authors trace three possible fiscal paths. In the base line
case there is, as the Treasury hopes, a modest recovery in the economy in
the next financial year followed by 3 per cent average growth in the years
to 1997-98. This growth rate is regarded as sufficient to reduce
unemployment slowly.
Suppose the government stuck to existing public spending plans and did
nothing but adjust tax thresholds and specific duties for inflation? On the
baseline projection, the public sector borrowing requirement would rise to
about Pounds 55bn in the next two financial years - more than 9 per cent of
gross domestic product if privatisation proceeds are excluded, with only
minimal improvement in later years.
In the optimistic case, the PSBR falls to below Pounds 20bn in 1997-98 and
is then set to fall further. But this case is based on a rather unrealistic
model. The pessimistic one, where the PSBR rises to more than Pounds 80bn by
the later 1990s, is unfortunately more believable.
To the moralistically minded, even the baseline prospects will be
self-evidently scandalous. The Green Budget, however, rightly goes into some
detail on just how much correction is required. A sensible long-term
objective would be to stabilise the ratio of public sector debt to GDP once
the economy is on its normal growth path - whatever that may be.
The gross national debt to GDP ratio is now just over 40 per cent, but is
rising at 5 percentage points a year. No remotely feasible measures can
prevent it climbing further in the next few years; but it will eventually
have to be stabilised to avoid an Italian or Greek-style debt trap in which
the deficit threatens to explode under the weight of the increasing interest
rates required to service it.
The green paper authors estimate that to stabilise the debt ratio at, say,
60 per cent of GDP, the PSBR will have to be brought down from a prospective
6 or 7 per cent of GDP in 1993-94 to some 3 per cent later. Their target is
thus the same as that in the Maastricht treaty. To achieve it could require
spending curbs or tax increases of some 2 to 4 per cent of GDP, or Pounds
20bn to Pounds 40bn a year.
When should the chancellor move? The arguments for acting in December rather
than now are not those of fine tuning. There is still a threat of a
prolonged depression with slow spending, falling asset prices, and rising
unemployment, all feeding on each other. As they showed with Tuesday's 1
percentage point base rate cut, the Treasury and Bank of England have this
time not been deceived by the supposedly favourable January CBI survey. The
improvement relates to confidence and expectations rather than orders; and
the comparison is with last autumn's Black Wednesday gloom.
The case for strong measures to curb the budget deficit will only come into
its own when recovery is established. But the chancellor still needs to
outline the dimensions of the problem and how he intends to tackle it.
What will have to happen eventually? If the basic, lower and higher income
tax rates were all raised by 2 pence in the pound, if all allowances and
limits were reduced by 20 per cent, if the excise duties were raised by 20
per cent and if VAT were increased by 2 percentage points, then the
chancellor would raise in a full year Pounds 22bn. This ignores, of course,
all the adverse effects on demand and confidence from such a package, as
well as the riot which would be likely on the backbenches.
One green paper idea is to extend the tax base by abolishing VAT zero
rating, with higher social benefits to offset the regressive effect. Such a
package could eventually yield Pounds 5bn a year. On top of this there could
be revenue from taxing financial services and environmental measures such as
the proposed carbon tax.
There is, of course, no reason why the savings required should all be
obtained by tax increases. The IFS authors do discuss various spending
curbs. Some proposals, such as using private finance for public capital
projects, are dismissed as creative accounting 'constructive only as far as
the PSBR provides an inappropriate target'.
If the burden on the public purse is to fall there would have to be a shift
from tax finance to fees, which need not be confined to capital projects,
and could, for instance, cover road use.
In the longer term a diminution of state pensions, relative to private
provision, should yield large sums. Unfortunately the IFS public spending
ideas are broad brush, while all the minute study is lavished on the tax
side. Policy should be more even handed.
The government's target division of national expenditure is 45 per cent
public versus 55 per cent private, which must be a rough guide to public
preferences as revealed in the ballot box. Even this formula exaggerates the
required rise in tax rates, because the tax-take automatically rises more
than in proportion to the national income - 'real fiscal drag' in the
jargon.
There is, however, one intellectual difficulty that neither the IFS authors
nor anyone else seems to have faced. Suppose the more pessimistic
projections are realised for the few years immediately ahead? Then the green
paper arithmetic suggests that much larger budgetary curbs - say of Pounds
50m - would be required to reach the Maastricht target.
Believers in the old-time religion would say this means we would then need
even more tax increases and more public spending curbs. Traditional
Keynesians would say that on the contrary we do not need them, as under
conditions of depression high budget deficits are required as a stimulus.
May I suggest the following exercise to some economic modeller (not for the
busy executive)? If in conditions of depression a higher budget deficit
enables more output to be produced than otherwise, the gains from this
increase have to be set off against the transfer costs to future generations
of a higher inherited government debt burden.
For this exercise, monetary policy - however defined - must be assumed to be
constant and only fiscal policy be allowed to vary. As no agreement is
likely on whether fiscal policy can stimulate economy in the medium term, a
sensitivity analysis needs to be done showing how the costs and benefits
vary according to differing assumptions about its effects. Some degree of
debt trap would be worth enduring for a real growth boost and it would be
helpful to have some idea of what the trade-offs might be.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Letter: Post Office can only deliver publicly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, If the UK Post Office is to remain the most efficient in Europe and
justify the limited monopoly that enables it to provide a universal and
affordable service, then it can only do so in the public sector.
The new Post Office chairman, Mike Heron, presents ('Public spirit, private
vision', January 26) 1980s options for a business moving to the year 2000.
To present a choice between public sector stagnation and private sector
innovation is simplistic and deflects from the true issues.
We have argued that the Post Office should be free of unfair restrictions
and allowed to expand quality and range of services. However, we also
recognise that in order to meet a variety of obligations, including many
loss-making deliveries, it must remain a unitary business in the public
sector. What private company would deliver a letter to the Isle of Skye for
18p?
Post Office privatisation will prove a disaster of British Rail proportions,
equally difficult to achieve and politically unpopular. The customer,
particularly in rural areas, stands to lose a vital resource.
Mike Heron inherits the best postal service in the world. A predecessor, Sir
Ron Dearing, did a great deal to help the workers in the industry achieve
this success. His position was clear. In a letter to staff in 1987 he stated
that 'it is as a single unified corporation that the Post Office can best
provide the vital communications and financial service that this country
needs - efficiently and universally'.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Construction Contracts: Iraqi invasion compensation claims
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FISHER GROUP, the UK international chartered loss adjusting group
headquartered in Banstead, Surrey has been appointed by the Kuwaiti
authorities as loss adjusters for processing the larger claims arising from
the illegal occupation of Kuwait by the Iraqis in January 1991.
This is believed to be one of the largest loss adjusting contracts ever
awarded.
The multi-million pound contract marks the second phase of claim settlement
in Kuwait. Under the terms of its contract, Fishers will advise on claims
for compensation for damage and losses caused by the Iraqi rinvasion.
Although the claims cannot yet be quantified, Fishers expects them to be
valued at several billion ponds.
Loss adjusting for the first phase involving just the smaller claims was
carried out by an American consortium.
The processing of major compensation claims in Kuwait is based on the
implementation of the Security Council of the United Nations' resolutions
which provide for claims to be met by external Iraqi funds.
The Kuwaiti authorities established the Public Authority for Assessment of
Compensation which, in turn, appointed Fishers to undertake the contract.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Charity in fashion /
A look at Benetton's latest campaign and finds style more evident than
substance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Benetton's advertising chief, Oliviero Toscani, relishes controversy and for
much of 1992 seemed determined to attract it. The Italian clothes company,
after all, has been roundly attacked for what many consider its obscurely
gloomy or just plain tasteless campaigns.
Following newly-born babies, dying Aids patients and oil-slicked seabirds,
Benetton has now returned to an earlier cheeky advertising style. The
company's latest press and magazine ad features Luciano Benetton - group
founder and vice-president - naked but discreetly veiled by large black
type.
In the ad, Luciano Benetton calls on customers to donate their unwanted
clothes - all brands, not just Benetton's - to his 7,047 worldwide stores.
Here they will be taken by Benetton trucks for redistribution to Africa,
Asia and Yugoslavia by charities such as the Red Cross and Caritas.
For a fashion company like Benetton it is important to keep at the forefront
of style, be it in the design of clothes or advertising. Many have accused
the company of meretricious advertising which was indifferent to human
feelings; indeed, one year ago Luciano Benetton said 'making charitable
contributions . . . isn't our job'. He said then that Benetton's advertising
was neither intended to offend nor to sell knitwear, but to 'raise social
awareness' by simply provoking people into a reconsideration of the world
they live in.
To some extent what Benetton is doing is a reflection of industry confusion
over the future of brand advertising. Some of the world's largest
manufacturers of consumer products - including Heinz and Nestle - are
currently debating whether it makes sense to plough hundreds of millions of
dollars into advertising, when the connection with sales performance has
become increasingly difficult to establish.
Nestle, for instance, is now showing considerable interest in direct
marketing, sending out 50,000 UK mail shots - including pasta samples - to
promote its Buitoni brand, a different and cheaper approach to the
conventional, expensive TV advertising campaign. But there is no overall
pattern; multinationals in other sectors - particularly motor manufacturers
in the US and Europe - have announced, through the course of 1992, heavily
increased television advertising budgets.
By proclaiming the splintering and changing nature of advertising, Toscani
may therefore be pushing at open doors. Where he differs from mainstream
advertising bosses is by maintaining that what Benetton is doing is partly
an attempt to subvert the nature of advertising.
In his decade at the top, Benetton's advertising has made no reference to
jeans, jumpers or jackets; when published, each photograph has just carried
the small 'united colours of Benetton' green and white logo.
Toscani is hostile to what he regards as the conventional form of
advertising, the promotion of branded products by means of massive
expenditure. He asserts that such advertising is redundant, in a world
where, he feels, 'people take it for granted that all products of a certain
type are more or less of the same quality'. Rather than continue to use it
as a perhaps inadequate sales tool, Toscani says it should instead be the
means whereby a company communicates its core philosophy to a wider
audience, prodding people into a sometimes uncomfortable awareness of their
surrounding world.
Benetton's offbeat marketing strategy means that Toscani has been liberated
from any concern about boosting Benetton's sales, which nonetheless
increased by 7 per cent to L 1,233bn (Pounds 586.3m) in the first half of
its current financial year, up to the end of September 1992. Benetton
restricts its advertising budget to 4 per cent of its annual revenue; from
that relatively small spend it has attracted a disproportionate amount of
public awareness, by no means all adverse.
Toscani even suggests that spending large sums on advertising may well be
seen as morally questionable: 'We spend on advertising in one year in Italy
what Fiat spends in one day. With the amount large multinationals spend on
advertising they could make the best campaign in the world against drug
abuse, for example.'
To be fair, multinationals like Unilever and Mars are trying to sell
individually branded consumer products; Benetton can perhaps afford to
occupy the high ground because it is in a different game, that of trying to
sell a company image inextricably linked to fashion accessories.
Nevertheless, Toscani intends trying to explode further the whole basis of
advertising, paradoxically using his influential position with Benetton to
try to develop more open attitudes. 'Advertising people have done a lot of
social damage by telling us a lot of lies, using fake images and fake dreams
to sell us their products, so that today if you are a girl you really are a
nobody if you don't look like Isabella Rosselini and if you are a boy you
are nothing if you haven't got at least a 16-valved engine.'
Benetton's latest campaign, featuring the semi-naked Luciano Benetton, can
thus be seen on one level as another finely-calculated contortion. Once
again it eschews conventional branding; it simply flings a provocative image
in the face of 1,000 magazine and 150 newspaper readers, startling them into
awareness of the company.
Yet far from exhorting people to go out and buy Benetton clothes, the
advertisements ask readers to give clothes to Benetton for deserving causes.
Hardly advertising, in the conventional sense.
Benetton is first and foremost a fashion company, and fashion is notoriously
full of contradictions. Last year, charity was not for Benetton; this year
it is. It is perhaps as great a mistake to look for consistency in
Benetton's advertising as it is to seek it in other aspects of the fashion
business.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Changing the
prescription - The pressures forcing US drugs companies to trim their
salesforces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARJORIE SHAFFER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals groups are being forced to alter the way they market their
products in the US. The result is likely to be big cost savings as drugs
companies restructure their salesforces, once their biggest cost-centres.
The move is being driven by two important changes. First, the structure of
the healthcare market is being transformed by a rapid expansion in the
number of managed healthcare organisations. In an effort to keep down drugs
expenditure, these organisations purchase prescription medicines centrally,
making sales teams at least partly redundant.
Second, drugs companies are being forced for the first time to cut costs as
pricing pressures hit margins. 'Other businesses have been evaluating cost
containment for years, it is just new to pharmaceuticals,' said Joseph
Jackson, director of health economics at Du Pont Merck Pharmaceutical, based
in Wilmington, Delaware.
Less than 10 per cent of skyrocketing US healthcare costs stem from drugs,
but prescription costs make up the fastest rising component of the medical
care index.
Traditionally, drug firms sent out representatives to scores of physicians
who were responsible for choosing the medications their patients used.
Nowadays, an increasing number of physicians belong to managed care plans,
such as HMOs (health maintenance organisations) that are interested in
curtailing costs. Many impose controls on prescribing by devising lists of
drugs - known as formularies - from which physicians are allowed to
prescribe.
To gain access to these formularies, pharmaceutical groups are offering more
discounts, rebates and other services, say analysts, hospital administrators
and industry executives.
Richard de Leon, director of pharmacy services at the University of Michigan
Medical Centre, Ann Arbor, says that pharmaceutical firms are also putting
together a much larger number of promotional packages, typically called
'bundles,' where, for example, a price break is given on a fifth drug if
four others are put on a formulary. Some companies may bid their entire line
of drugs, and provide incentives if certain requirements are met.
As more physicians join the plans and large buying groups like
insurance-controlled HMOs gain more power in the marketplace, drugs
companies no longer need as big a sales force to call on as many physicians,
according to industry observers and executives.
'It is influencing the marketplace right now to the point that there will be
fewer detail men because they aren't necessarily going to be calling on
every prescriber in the future,' said Andrew Stergachis, chairman of the
pharmacy department at the University of Washington. 'Some of the major
companies are already thinking this way.'
As a harbinger of this trend, Roy Vagelos, chairman of Merck, one of the
world's largest pharmaceutical companies, said last year that large
institutional customers account for 52 per cent of Merck's sales volume. By
1995, such purchasers are expected to account for 67 per cent of Merck's
sales.
The large customers are supplanting 'traditional markets drive by private
fee-for-service physicians,' Vagelos said.
Consequently, he said Merck would begin reducing its direct sales force by
attrition and restructuring. Last year, Merck had a sales force of about
2,700.
Such cuts will help margins which are coming under pressure. Industry
analysts said it costs roughly Dollars 150,000 to keep a direct-sales person
on staff annually.
Not all drug firms have yet committed to reducing the size of their
direct-sales forces. 'We don't see any reduction in the near term,' said
Harvey Weintraub, vice president and marketing and sales support at Schering
Laboratories, a subsidiary of Schering-Plough.
However, Weintraub acknowledged that in the 'longer term,' the sales force
'is not likely to expand if the trend towards fewer and larger customers and
formulary constraints continue'.
Tony Bonelli, vice president of institutional health care at Parke-Davis, a
subsidiary of drug firm Warner-Lambert, said distribution channels for
pharmaceuticals had 'changed dramatically, with at least 50 per cent (of
volume) going through distribution or procurement channels of managed care'.
The nature of salesmen is also likely to change. Since they will be
negotiating with only a few managed care organisations, rather than general
practitioners, they will need to be of better quality. Clearly, the death of
the US drugs salesmen is premature, but they are likely to be better
qualified and fewer of them.

AB PHAROS MARINE has won a contract worth Pounds 18.4m from the Phillipines
Department of Transportation &amp; Communications for the supply and
installation of 100 marine aids to navigation systems.
The equipment consists of 98 solar-powered lighthouses and lightbeacons with
ranges extending for eight to 22 miles. Also to be delivered are two
lightvessels for marking a traffic separation scheme in Manila Bay, and a
radio monitoring system by which information on the operational status of
some 100 individual stations will be reported to Phillipines Coastguard
headquarters in Manila; the monitoring system will employ long-range VHF
radio using advanced transmission techniques.
The Phillipines authorities have a forward plan for major upgrading of their
aids-to-navigation network, and this project is the first stage to improve
the safety and efficiency of inter-island and international shipping routes.
Financing for the project comprises a mixed credit package consisting of a
35 per cent grant from the UK Overseas Development Administration and 65 per
cent from a long-term loan by the Bank of America's London branch, supported
by the EGCD.
The first shipment under the project is expected to be delivered in May.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Accountancy Column: Monolithic system in need of drastic
reform - The burdens the UK's auditing regime places on smaller companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STELLA FEARNLEY AND MIKE PAGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TIME has come to reform the UK's monolithic system of financial
reporting and auditing, which applies virtually identical accounting and
auditing requirements to all companies regardless of size.
Standards setters and the government have until now chosen to gloss over the
problems the current system creates. In the present climate of reform, this
gloss is beginning to wear very thin.
There have been a number of significant changes to the financial reporting
and auditing regime in the last couple of years. Some recognise the
differences between large and small organisations and those where public
interest is involved, but many do not.
While it was never admitted, the standards issued in the past by the now
defunct Accounting Standards Committee and the Auditing Practices Committee
were more geared to the listed and other larger public interest companies.
That trend continues under the bodies created more recently.
Unless some means of distinguishing these different groups is found,
improved standards in large company accounting and auditing will be held
back by the need to reflect the limited resources of small companies, and
small companies will continue to suffer unnecessary burdens.
This creates a substantial imbalance. There are only about 2,100 domestic UK
listed companies and a further 1,500 large private companies with profits
over Pounds 500,000 and turnover greater than Pounds 15m.
That is a tiny proportion of the estimated 400,000 to 500,000 active trading
companies in the country.
Similarly, just 161 firms audit all the domestic listed companies, and
adding in the 1,500 large private companies brings the total to 300
auditors. That is a small fraction of the UK's 14,000 registered auditors,
most of which never see a large client.
On accounting issues, the Financial Reporting Council and the Accounting
Standards Board are overtly focused towards larger companies. Unless legal
distinctions are made, their mission to tighten reporting will add
substantial burdens to small companies.
The problem lies in company law, which makes no distinctions based on size.
There is a concession which allows small companies to file abbreviated
accounts with Companies House. But this adds work, since the law still
requires full accounts to be prepared for shareholders.
The position is at least as bad for auditing as it is for accounting. Audit
regulation applies the same rules to all auditors regardless of the size and
risk profile of their clients.
The problem is illustrated in the recently published reports from the
regulatory bodies on the first year of audit regulation, which indicate that
many firms are falling short of the standards set by the regulators. We
would not wish to excuse poor standards of work, but the application of
auditing standards and guidelines in their present form to the audit of
small companies is not easy.
The Auditing Practices Committee was created in 1976 in response to public
concern about one or two scandals in large companies. It recognised the
different requirements of the small company by recommending a form of audit
report with limitations on scope which are inherent in the audit of many
small companies. But no really practical guidance was offered.
This form of report was withdrawn in 1989 to the indignation of many small
firms. An exposure draft on the audit of small companies was issued by the
committee shortly before its demise in 1991, but offered little advice on
application. Since then little has happened. The Auditing Practices Board
had small company audits at the very end of its list of objectives for 1992,
but there has been no sign of a statement yet.
We are currently researching the impact of audit regulation on practices of
different sizes. It is becoming apparent that sole practitioners are finding
the new regime very arduous. Regulation is having the greatest impact on
smaller practices where public interest issues are minimal.
There has been little effect on the conduct of audits in the large firms
acting in the public markets. When asked about the effects of regulation, a
partner from a large firm said: 'There are no new messages and no
challenges.' By contrast, a sole practitioner said: 'In a word,
devastating'.
A real concern for smaller firms was ignorance about what the regulators
really expected and a genuine desire for more practical authoritative
guidance which was not linked to commercial organisations.
This gulf between the auditors of small and large companies, and between the
public interest areas and the low-risk small audits, became embarrassingly
obvious last week at an open forum in Chartered Accountants' Hall in London,
where the APB's paper on the future development of auditing was being
debated.
The paper explores various ways in which the role of the auditor could be
extended and independence strengthened in order to meet the 'expectations
gap' and recommends limitation of auditors' liability. It is explicitly
directed at listed and public interest companies.
The small practitioners in the audience did not welcome the proposals,
arguing that any change would affect everyone. One speaker claimed that the
smaller firms were being 'sucked into' the problems of the larger ones and
that the costs of extending auditing would be another encouragement for
companies to evade regulation.
Extending the scope of audits and limiting liability may have some
attraction for the larger firms, which find it difficult to get insurance
cover. Our research suggests that these issues are far less important for
the auditors to, and the owner-managers of, many small businesses.
A partial solution to the difficulties of applying one set of standards and
one regulatory framework to such a diverse group might be the abolition of
the statutory audit for small companies. But any change will take
considerable time. More important, the government is currently only
considering abolition for companies below the VAT threshold for turnover
below Pounds 36,600 a year. Many small companies are above this limit.
The regime for audit regulation will be reviewed at the end of this year. It
would be an appropriate time to consider whether the one set of regulations
can be effective across the board, or whether the regime is too onerous for
the small firms and insufficiently challenging for larger ones.
While concessions in accounting regulations for smaller companies may
require changes to the law, the position is easier to remedy for auditing.
Audit regulations require auditors to comply with auditing standards, but
they do not specify what these standards should be.
That means the Auditing Practices Board could develop distinct, practical
and meaningful guidelines for the audit of small companies, which comprise
the overwhelming majority of UK businesses. It is time that a little more
attention was paid to the needs of these companies and their auditors.
We do not believe it is realistic to apply the same accounting and auditing
regime to the local sweet shop and to ICI. Nor is it sensible to expect the
same standards to apply to a sole practitioner and to Price Waterhouse.

When an important customer recently asked for a special order, Carleton
Furniture responded within hours. The speed of response - just over a year
ago it would have taken a week and a half - won the Pounds 150,000 order.
The detailed specification of a desk, drawn and fully costed, had taken half
a day.
Even more important, the specification put together at such speed actually
worked. The people who had to execute the design by cutting the metal and
fitting parts, knew their system would not design something that could not
be built.
In the opinion of Steve Dodds, group finance director, the most remarkable
achievement at Carleton Furniture is the way it has connected its
activities.
In the past two years he has seen the company evolve to a point where it is
not just healthy, but expanding its services. He says: 'We've invested in
the system at a time when most companies are putting their heads in the sand
until the recession lifts. When it does, we will be able to offer a better
customer service as a consequence of that investment.'
Carleton designers rely on a computer-aided design product, but design is
only part of the story. The Cad software has become part of a communicative
process, which feeds into all aspects of Carleton's operations, and has
opened up new horizons for the company.
Its services interconnect: designers, engineers and space planners talk to
one another as never before. Each of the production companies seats its
designers and planners together on one 'island', and even planners working
at the showrooms are linked through the computer system.
Carleton has capitalised on its ability to produce quick Cad drawings to
launch a specialist service in space planning. This has opened up a
lucrative line in 'cradle to grave' care for organisations for whom buying,
refurbishing and locating furniture is a headache. The next step - as yet
not implemented - is to provide a bar code service, so that each item is
tagged for inventory purposes.
Dodds has no background in information technology, but feels strongly that
line managers must get involved in IT buying and specification. 'The
knowledge and experience which resides in people who work in the business is
an essential part of the input: you can't expect IT experts to absorb it,
although they can advise you on technical matters.'
Only two tasks - furniture design and space allocation - were the original
goals of the the Cad system sought by Carleton Furniture Group two years
ago. Carleton's specialist requirements narrowed the choice down to four
systems.
User-friendliness was a priority, along with considerations of price, and a
reliable supplier who would keep upgrading and supporting the package.
Linking with other systems was always part of the plan.
From the beginning, Dodds recognised the importance of using a supplier who
would understand the business objectives. 'I needed someone who would listen
and go through the heartache with us. I would rather have 80 per cent of
what I required, done well, than the ability to do 99 per cent but only
achieve 60 per cent.
Dodds rejected the bafflingly complex, and those he considered difficult to
use. He found that Hewlett-Packard's engineering package Mechanical
Engineering 10 (ME-10) could cope with both the engineering design and the
more artistic space-planning work, but it was the skill of the supplier,
Cadtek, that carried the day.
Dodds says: 'I felt Cadtek was capable of taking us on the journey. They
have supplied much of the integration with other packages, and that's where
the real benefits lie.'
The chosen system was 18 'seats' of Hewlett-Packard's ME-JO software
supplied by Cadtek. A central database on the computer in Pontefract, West
Yorkshire, is fed from the various companies in the group. This in turn
feeds the Unison administrative package.
In the past, there were often difficulties in translating the drawn design
into real material requirements: there was a 'perception gap' about what
materials were really needed. The drawing office produced a design manually,
which was then translated into a bill of materials planning, and material
requirements planning on the shop floor.
Now, instead of separate computer systems, the designer names the product,
names the parts and produces a bill of materials automatically. Every
database entry is tagged with a specific part number, which ties it to a
technical drawing, an associated bill of materials and even the assembly
manual which goes with the finished product, all of which makes production
much easier.
'Everyone sings from the same hymn sheet, so there are fewer mistakes,' says
Dodds. Cadtek was responsible for writing the links between systems, working
closely with the supplier of the Unison package, Sam System Services of
Manchester. 'There are advantages in dealing with a single source supplier,
too - only one ear to bend,' he adds.
Dodds considers the aesthetics of the drawings are now better, and that all
four drawing offices have cut down development time. The next step is to
graduate to a three-dimensional software package, Solid Designer, which will
allow more detailed on-screen testing of the prototype design. The designer
will be able to check the drawing from all angles.
The A1-sized print-outs produced at the office at Heron Quays in London's
Docklands show minute details, such as the clearance span needed to open
cupboard doors. Planners would formerly have to count the various
'footprints' manually: now the computer lists and numbers the items in a
plan.
Dodds is happy to cite other instances where the Cad capability has clinched
the deal. A recent Pounds 800,000 order was won because the company was able
to produce a space-plan within a very tight deadline, partly because it
could read in existing measurements from the client's own AutoCad package.
Dodds offers some emphatic do's and don'ts for companies setting out to
implement Cad software. 'Don't underestimate the culture change that needs
to take place within the business,' he says.
'It's taken us a year longer than we expected. Do make sure you get on with
your suppliers.
'At the end of the day you're investing a great deal: if you can't get on
with them, don't do it, however good the software.'

One message running through all the cases studied so far is that change is
here to stay. In every application of IT to date, the human issues have been
more important than technical ones. Carleton discovered that reluctance to
change can be the sole impediment to a new project.
The company faced a big change in culture when trying to integrate the
drawing office with the production side. The tradition of the job being
complete when the drawings were handed over ended with the introduction of
computer-aided design. Now designers are required to understand the
manufacture of their furniture, as well as its aesthetic qualities.
Change must be managed as a business problem in its own right. Reluctance
can turn into bloody-mindedness if not handled carefully. I think Carleton
did too little preparation for the effects on work practices and paid the
price with an overrun. The Cad system forced greater changes in the
interaction between people than in the way they produce drawings.
While the design of the new system gained consistency from being put
together by just Steve Dodds and a consultant, it suffered from reduced
involvement of the key staff - the line managers. They were involved at the
specification stage, but appeared to have less say in the detailed
implementation. Perhaps more participation throughout the process might have
led to a smoother introduction.
The information technology implementation was not the sole source of
cultural change. The company itself underwent big structural changes as a
result of growth and acquisition. Dodds faces a common problem: maximising
the use of central resources but allowing autonomy in individual divisions.
Despite the problems, the system is now producing tangible benefits for
Carleton. Fast turnaround means being able to serve customers better and
control costs.

SOFTWARE PRODUCT: Hewlett-Packard's two-dimensional ME-10 computer-aided
design package for 18 seats.  Three-dimensional Solid Modeller is soon to be
introduced.
SOFTWARE SUPPLIER: The ME-10 software was developed, installed and
integrated with other systems by Cad specialist Cadtek, a third-party value
added reseller for Hewlett-Packard.  Cadtek also trained Carleton staff.
HARDWARE: Apollo 9000 Model 700 under Unix for Cad, running 18 seats of the
software, linked to a Unisys 6000/65 under Unix for commercial and
manufacturing systems.
OTHER SYSTEMS: Integrated with the Cad software is the Progress database
which feeds the manufacturing control system and the Unison integrated
financial distribution and manufacturing package from Sam System Services,
running on a separate Unisys Unix computer.  The bill of materials is
transferred directly from the Cad systems to the commercial system for
materials planning.  All four sites use the Cad software, feeding into a
central group file, which then feeds Unison.
SYSTEMS COST: The Cadtek contract amounted to Pounds 250,000, part of an
estimated Pounds 550,000 spent to date on all the systems.  In the Cad
field, software is still cheaper than hardware because Cad needs powerful
and expensive workstations.

FT  28 JAN 93 / People: Fenhalls puts on running shoes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Fenhalls, who is stepping down as chief executive of Henry
Ansbacher, the merchant bank acquired by First National Bank of South
Africa, has taken up his first outside appointment, as a non-executive
director of Hi-Tec Sports.
The sports shoe designer and distributor has seen its share price collapse
in the past nine months after fierce price wars in its UK backyard. A
fortnight ago, it announced that Sir Michael Edwardes was joining the board
as a non-executive director.
Hi-Tec chairman Frank van Wezel says that Fenhalls, who is, like Edwardes, a
South African by birth, came warmly recommended by his compatriot, who has
been a long-standing business associate. 'He is a keen ocean-racing
yachtsman and one of the first questions he asked was whether we have a line
in deck shoes,' added van Wezel. 'When we said we did, under the Bad Boys
brand, he was happy.'
Fenhalls, 49, is credited with turning round Henry Ansbacher since he joined
in 1985. Previously, he had been deputy chairman and chief executive of
Guinness Mahon, and before that had worked at American Express Bank and
Marine Midland.
Another announcement is expected in about four weeks' time of a position he
will be taking up in the City, but no further details are yet available.
Meanwhile Fenhalls is replaced at Henry Ansbacher by Peter Scaife who is on
secondment from First National Bank. Scaife becomes managing director of the
holding company and chief executive and a deputy chairman of the merchant
bank, Henry Ansbacher &amp; Co Ltd.

LABOUR MPs are to be asked to raise their personal contributions to the
party from 1 per cent of their annual Pounds 30,000 salaries to 2 per cent -
a Pounds 300 earnings cut.
The proposal came yesterday at the national executive committee, where party
leaders failed to conclude talks on a package aimed at slashing spending by
about Pounds 4m a year.
Some savings were agreed when the NEC accepted a plan to put most annual
conferences on a biennial basis to save administration costs. An exemption
was granted to the local government conference.
But there was no resolution in the dispute over the plan to cut the party's
regional offices from 11 to six.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Stronger councils watchdog is urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE were bitter clashes in the Commons yesterday over allegations of
corruption in Lambeth borough council, Alison Smith writes.
Some agreement between Labour and Tory MPs that there might be a need for
stronger powers for district auditors and for the Audit Commission, the
independent local government watchdog, was lost in angry exchanges, as Mr
Jack Straw, the shadow environment secretary, faced a concerted attack from
Tories claiming Lambeth exemplified Labour in local government.
While Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, told MPs the council was
being asked about 'breaches of competition legislation', Mr Straw urged him
to 'condemn the freeloaders, former members of your cabinet, who have had
their hands in the till and their snouts in the trough of privatised
industries'.
Mr Howard told Mr Straw his remarks were 'quite appalling'. Earlier, Labour
had published a dossier of 'mismanagement and fraud' in central government
and Tory local councils.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Political Notebook: Taxing times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week Conservative MPs have been trooping across Whitehall to sip tea
with Mr Norman Lamont and his Treasury colleagues. It is an annual ritual,
ostensibly to give the government's foot soldiers at Westminster a voice in
the shaping of the March Budget.
For much of the past 14 years it has been a sham. During his chancellorship
Lord Lawson frequently disparaged the pleadings of Tory colleagues as
vehemently as those of the Trades Union Congress. Typically his meetings
were held close enough to Budget day to ensure that key decisions had
already been taken.
But this government cannot afford to treat its backbenchers with disdain. It
tried last autumn. It is now about to pay the price in the form of a massive
subsidy to an uneconomic coal industry.
Nor can Mr Lamont. The recovery in his reputation after the Autumn Statement
has proved as short-lived as the false dawns on the economy. This week's cut
in interest rates raised a scarcely audible cheer on the Tory backbenches.
Instead the mood was one of foreboding.
The chancellor's colleagues no longer offer any pretence that they expect
him to remain in the job beyond the summer. Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Michael
Howard are front-runners to succeed him. Mr John MacGregor and Mr Michael
Portillo are also in the race.
So Mr Lamont has sent out his invitations early. With one or two exceptions,
the backbenchers are being listened to with studied respect.
As is customary, Mr Lamont has said little himself. The absurdities of
Budget purdah - rigorously enforced by the Sir Terence Burns - dictate that
even the chancellor cannot be trusted not to blurt out a Budget secret. (No
matter that Treasury ministers can chat freely with the same colleagues in
the lobbies of the House of Commons).
Mr Lamont nonetheless has offered clues to his thinking. The conclusion
being drawn by astute Tory MPs is that he remains as uncertain as they about
the best strategy for March 16.
Predictably, his starting point has been to impress on them the awful
medium-term outlook for the borrowing requirement. Mr John Major has said
that the return of economic growth will take care of most of it. Mr Lamont
is not at all convinced.
Just as strikingly, he has been cautious about the pace of economic
recovery: it will be a slow and occasionally faltering. He has intimated
also that it would be dangerous if the economy began to grow strongly when
the rest of Europe remained mired in recession. The Treasury worries more
about the trade gap than it cares to admit.
Mr Lamont has clarified the constraints imposed by the manifesto presented
to the electorate less than a year ago. Mr Major's frequent promise to widen
year-by-year the 20p income tax band is not regarded as a pledge. More
importantly, nor are his parallel reassurances that the Conservatives had no
plans to widen the VAT net.
So the question the chancellor has left in the minds of his guests is not
whether taxes will have to rise, but when and by how much. Only income tax
rates are off-limits. Extension of VAT to newspapers, domestic fuel - a
green tax - and perhaps childrens' clothes are seen as the favourites.
The MPs are no more certain than their host about where the balance should
be struck. A majority are terrified that significant tax increases in March
would lay another frost over those still-elusive green shoots. They have yet
to get used to the prospect of 3m unemployed. But a large minority believe
that unless Mr Lamont makes a start now, the financial markets will take
their revenge.
That brings us to the bright idea being floated in the lobbies: Mr Lamont
should announce a series of tax increases in March but stipulate they will
take effect as part of the December Budget.
The economic logic is that such a strategy would strengthen the recovery by
encouraging consumers to advance spending. It would also reassure the
markets that the government was ready to act over the medium term.
The Treasury traditionally opposes pre-announcement of tax increases for the
good reason that it gives interest groups the opportunity to mobilise
against them.
But for Mr Lamont there may be a political as well as an economic attraction
to make an exception to that rule. If the odds are that he will no longer be
chancellor at the end of the year, why not pre-empt in March the December
Budget?

FT  28 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Goalkeeper shoots for the Big Idea
 -Ivo Dawnay talks to Sir Gordon Borrie, head of Labour's social justice
commission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH his brown trilby, neatly furled umbrella and well-fastened mac, Sir
Gordon Borrie might more easily be taken for a spruce version of Tony
Hancock than Labour's latest intellectual eminence grise.
But beneath a modest demeanor lies a Rolls-Royce brain and enough political
surefootedness to enable him to survive as a reform-minded director-general
of the Office of Fair Trading for 16 years - most under the icy glare of Mrs
Thatcher.
Mr Graham Mather, the prominent rightwing policy guru, concedes admiringly
that his deftness at the OFT marked Sir Gordon out as one of the outstanding
public servants of his generation. 'In what must have been literally
hundreds of decisions, he never fumbled the ball once,' he recalls.
Now, in the yet more treacherous world of progressive politics, Sir Gordon's
capacity to keep goal will be tested to the full. Recently appointed
chairman of Mr John Smith's Commission on Social Justice, he has already
impressed his 15 colleagues with an ability to condense crisply lengthy
discussions without reference to a note. That skill will undoubtedly be
needed in the 18 months before he is due to publish his report.
In the sepulchral gloom of parliament's central lobby yesterday, Sir Gordon
made clear that he sees his brief as much broader than merely resolving the
agonised debate over targetted as against universal benefits.
In defining what is meant by social justice, he pledges not to dodge the
pressing question of how to find the resources to provide it. So how will he
re-concile leaping welfare demand with a limited resource base to meet it?
Workfare, perhaps, or some other form of President Bill Clinton's 'tough
love'?
For the moment, he offers no clues beyond displaying a ready scepticism over
cash benefits being the sole club in the government's bag. 'Public money may
be better spent in kind rather than in cash,' he says, listing the provision
of social infrastructure from childcare to crime prevention as essential as
Giro cheques.
The much-cited Pounds 8,000-a-year cost to the exchequer of every unemployed
individual, he says, is a massive underestimate when ramifications of high
joblessness are included such as crime, higher policing bills and insurance
premiums.
The Beveridge report dealt heavily with constructing a social security net.
The Borrie report, acknowledging the funding constraints, intends to tackle
head on the social injustice of long-term unemployment. Surprisingly
perhaps, he also appears undaunted by the broad parameters he has set
himself.
In the first six months, grassroots opinion will supplement his own panel of
experts, garnered in field-trips to Glasgow, Newcastle and Belfast. From
this, Sir Gordon will chisel the outline principles upon which the report
will be based. At this early stage, however, he will not be drawn on whether
its conclusions will be a legislative blueprint or even prescriptive.
Nonetheless, he is aware that for a listless Labour party - desperate for a
Big Idea - a great deal of hope is riding on him at a time when the Tories
too are conducting a parallel tax and benefits review. Indeed, some
mavericks such as Mr Frank Field MP complain that their radical solutions
are getting a fairer hearing with the government than with Labour's front
bench.
Sir Gordon is careful to stress that his commission is fully independent of
Labour, refusing to become enmeshed in the squabbling between the party's
'moderniser' or 'traditionalist' camps. But after a career treading
tightropes between conflicting interest groups, Sir Gordon appears now to be
relishing the opportunity of ruffling feathers. 'I think certainly our
report should cause some upset,' he concludes, fastidiously omitting to
explain whether that 'should' is a mere prediction or, in fact, a goal.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Social chapter opt-out defended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday defended Britain's opt-out from the social chapter
of the Maastricht treaty as the Commons resumed its debate on the European
Communities (Amendment) Bill.
Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, foreign office minister, underlined the 'change of
emphasis' by the European Court of Justice when appealing to Tories opposed
to the treaty not to vote against the government.
He cited some recent decisions by the court as evidence that it had moved
away from its earlier 'centralising and harmonising' approach.
Mr Garel-Jones called on Tory opponents of the treaty to take this into
account before imperilling the government's 21 majority by joining forces
with Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs eager to make Britain subject to the
social chapter of the treaty in the same way as the other 11 member states.
Tory critics argued that it would be preferable for the Commons to insert a
provision in the bill which would result in Britain becoming a party to the
social chapter than for it to be forced to comply with its objectives
through rulings by the European Court.
Mr Jack Cunningham, the shadow foreign secretary, again disputed assertions
by Mr Garel-Jones that such a change to the bill would have 'serious'
consequences for the whole of the community.
The minister admitted that the fears of Tory MPs who believed that the
economic advantages gained by Britain's not being bound by the social
chapter would lead to other member states initiating European court actions
claiming unfair competition could not be dismissed as groundless.
But he believed that the court had shown itself to be increasingly sensitive
to the rights of national governments and less interventionist in its
interpretation of EC law.
The government succeeded, by a 16-vote margin, in ending the debate on the
social chapter yesterday evening, but its whips still have time to mount an
extensive lobbying exercise among possible rebels.
Commons procedures mean that the vote on Labour's amendment is not
immediate.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major sees upturn in confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR said last night that Britain was set for a 'decisive move'
towards economic growth, Ralph Atkins writes.
He told UK businessmen in Bombay that confidence 'is beginning to return to
housebuyers, consumers and investors'. Inflation was at its lowest for 6 1/2
years, interest rates were at their lowest for 15 years and the sterling
exchange rate was 'highly competitive'.
His upbeat comments were coupled with a promise that 'the government will be
working closely with industry, especially manufacturing companies, to
maximise investment in modern equipment'.
Mr Major has signalled that he is prepared to listen more to businessmen -
and his comments could have been a hint of extra help for industry in the
March Budget.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Size of population to decline after 2030
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S population is likely to start falling from about 2030 when, it is
projected, the number of deaths will start to exceed births, Alan Pike
writes.
The effects of the ageing of the population are already being felt. Last
year there were 10.6m people of pensionable age, a rise of 16 per cent since
1971. By 2021 nearly one in five of the population will be over 65, compared
with one in 10 in 1951.
Some of the most serious implications of this will be for employers. They
will see the age structure of their workforces change considerably by the
end of the century.
In 1986 a quarter of the national workforce was aged 24 or less, but this
will apply to only one in six by 2001 - by then more than a third of all
employees available will be over 45.
Social Trends says: 'Those employers who rely on young people as a
significant source of their recruits face declining numbers over future
years.
'Better use must therefore be made of alternative recruits, such as the
unemployed, women returning to the labour market and older workers.'
The ageing of the population is one of the main factors behind a radical
change in household structure. By 1991 more than a quarter of all households
consisted of one person living alone - double the proportion in 1961.
Traditional images of households as a couple with dependent children are now
most likely to be found among some of Britain's ethnic minority communities.
Nearly two thirds of Bangladeshi and Pakistani households fit this model,
compared with only a quarter of white and West Indian ones.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH it has fallen by a third since 1981, Britain's infant mortality
record remains in the middle of the European league. It continues to reflect
social class, with rates much higher for babies born to parents in the
unskilled and semi-skilled social groups.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Births outside marriage increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UPWARD trend in births outside marriage is continuing, Alan Pike writes.
By 1991 three in 10 births were to unmarried women, which was double the
proportion 10 years earlier. Half of the births are registered with both
parents living at the same address.
The issue is one that produces remarkable variations between European
countries. Half of all births in Sweden are outside marriage compared with
only one in 50 in Greece.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Japanese urge Britain to re-enter ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE business wants the UK to re-enter the European exchange rate
mechanism, a Japanese official told MPs yesterday.
Mr Tamon Kitabatake, commercial minister at the Japanese Embassy in London,
said sterling 'needs to be stable' if Japanese business leaders are to have
the confidence to continue investment in Britain. Mr Kitabatake told the
British/Japanese parliamentary group that Japanese business leaders paid
close attention to UK relations with the rest of the EC.
Japanese inward investment in the UK peaked in 1990, and since then has
halved. Mr Kitabatake said this resulted from the bursting of the Japanese
economic bubble and the fact that much of the investment was in preparation
for the European single market. 'I feel a little pessimistic on the future
trend at this moment,' he said. 'But if the world economy regains an upward
trend, that should change.'
He said that the downturn in Japan's investment in the UK was in line with
its overseas investment as a whole. It was expected to recover in the longer
term. Only 7 per cent of Japan's assets were located overseas, compared with
14 per cent for the US and 24 per cent for the UK. About 40 per cent of
Japan's EC manufacturing investment is in the UK.
Mr Haydn Abbott, managing director of Sony UK, told MPs it was important
that the UK should not be politically or economically marginalised in
Europe. A stable exchange rate was very important, he said.
He criticised the UK for lack of attention to road and rail links. He said:
'The absolute necessity to be able to move products to their markets seems a
forgotten cause.'

FT  28 JAN 93 / Plight of poor confirmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFIRMATION that the share of income going to Britain's poorest people fell
throughout the 1980s is provided by Social Trends.
The poorest fifth of the population's share of household income fell from
9.9 per cent in 1979 to 7.9 per cent in 1988-89. When housing costs are
taken into account the share of the bottom fifth fell from 9.6 per cent to
6.9 per cent.
Only the top fifth of the population finished the 1980s with a bigger share
of total income than they had in 1979. This rose from 34.8 per cent in 1979
to 40 per cent in 1988-89, or from 35.3 per cent to 41.1 per cent after
housing costs.
The share of marketable wealth held by the richest 1 per cent of the
population fell from 21 to 18 per cent in the late 1970s, and has remained
at 18 per cent since. The most wealthy 5 per cent increased their share of
total wealth from 36 to 37 per cent between 1986 and 1990. More than half of
total wealth is held by the richest 10 per cent of the population, and 93
per cent by the most wealthy 50 per cent.
Increases in home ownership meant that by 1990 more than one third of
personal wealth was in property.
The top 10 per cent of taxpayers, who contributed 35 per cent of total tax
in 1976-77, pay more now. In 1992-93 their share will be an estimated 43 per
cent.

FT  28 JAN 93 / More take holidays in Australia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of British holi-daymakers visiting Australia and New Zealand
trebled in the 1980s as a trend for long-distance holidays grew.
In Europe, the biggest percentage increase was in holidays to Portugal. But
four out of every 10 British people do not take a holiday, a figure which
changed little during the 1970s and 1980s even though 94 per cent of
employees now qualify for more than four weeks paid annual leave.
Watching television remains the most popular home-based leisure activity. In
1991 people watched an average of 26 hours a week. They apparently retained
their critical faculties while doing so; between 1981 and 1991 complaints
about television advertising more than doubled.
Although the development of satellite, cable and video has extended the
range of television available, there has been a slight decline in the time
spent viewing since 1986.
Listening to radio, by contrast, increased from an average of less than nine
hours a week in 1986 to nearly 10 1/2 hours in 1991.
People aged 16 to 34 were keenest, with an average of nearly 13 hours.
Blackpool pleasure beach retains its position as Britain's most popular
tourist attraction with free admission - 6.5m visitors were counted there in
1991 - followed by the British Museum with 5.1m.
If this year's Social Trends suggests that the glories of Mammon may have
faded a little for many British people, there is no evidence that they are
seeking solace in the eternal.
Adult membership of the main Christian churches fell by one-sixth to less
than 7m between 1975 and 1990, although Muslim, Sikh and Hindu worshippers
all increased.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Family life shows the imprint of recession: Share ownership
accompanies household spending into decline - First fall in real household
disposable income for 10 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOOTPRINTS of the recession are to be found in almost every area of a
typical family's life, judging by the image of Britain in the latest edition
of Social Trends published yesterday.
In recent years Social Trends - described by its publisher, the Central
Statistical Office, as the 'biography of the nation' - has presented a
picture of unstoppable consumerism fuelled by credit. This year's biography
is of a different nation, where rising unemployment, redundancy and home
repossessions are the priorities.
Real household disposable income - the money people have to spend, save or
invest - fell for the first time in a decade between 1990 and 1991,
following a 71 per cent real-terms rise since 1971.
Household spending went down as well - for the first time in 15 years. There
was a 2 per cent overall fall between 1990 and 1991 with spending on motor
vehicles - down 18 per cent - suffering the biggest fall. People spent less
on alcohol and tobacco, less on household durables and less on books and
newspapers. The only categories where expenditure increased were television
and videos, and fuel and power.
Share-ownership - one of the growth areas and symbols of the 1980s -
accompanied household spending into decline. By 1990 about a quarter of the
adult population owned shares. This fell last year to 22 per cent, although
it remains far ahead of 1981's 7 per cent.
The changed economic conditions have led to the disappearance of another
late-1980s phenomenon. From 1987 to 1989, saving as a percentage of
household disposable income was negative, meaning that overall the nation's
families were spending more than they earned.
Savings are now positive again, and amounted to 2.5 per cent of disposable
income in 1991. Consumer credit has started to fall slightly, although the
amount outstanding excluding home mortgages - Pounds 53bn - still nearly
doubled in real terms between 1981 and 1991.
Social Trends says: 'After violent crime and long-term illness, one of the
greatest fears haunting society is probably that of redundancy.' Figures up
to spring of last year show that the risk of redundancy was highest in the
east Midlands and lowest in Scotland.
Unemployment is particularly severe among the young - last year nearly one
in five young men and one in seven women under 19 were unemployed - and is
far higher for ethnic minorities than the white population. The problem is
worst among the Pakistani and Bangladeshi group, where a quarter of people
in economically active age groups are without jobs.
Social Trends catalogues an array of factors such as house repossessions,
mortgage arrears, rising social security claims and declining housebuilding
figures that have a direct link with the recession.
There are other areas that provide far more room for debate. Does the first
decline since 1987-88 in the number of people attending first-division
football matches say something about the recession, or something about
football?
One of the most serious areas for this debate concerns the crime figures,
where there is heated disagreement about the possible connection between
deprivation and offending. Reports of offences like burglary, robbery and
theft which, it is sometimes argued, can have a link with the recession, all
increased between 1990 and 1991.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Campaigners go to work on smoking: Legal action will lead to
more bans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR Midland Bank's 45,000 UK employees, a smoke-free working environment has
been a fact of life since May last year. The bank, like an estimated 20 per
cent of employers, forbids staff and public to smoke on its premises.
The case of Ms Veronica Bland, awarded Pounds 15,000 in an out-of-court
settlement for the alleged ill-effects of passive smoking, illustrates why
Midland and many other organisations no longer wish to risk exposing workers
to cigarette smoke.
Indeed, Ms Bland's employer, Stockport Borough Council, has itself
introduced a no-smoking policy - implemented, it pointed out yesterday, six
months before she started her legal action. Other organisations which ban
smoking include Marks and Spencer, IBM and the Inland Revenue.
The move in the UK away from smoking in public places and at work is in line
with developments elsewhere in Europe, and in the US and Australia. The
latter, in particular, presents close parallels with developments in the UK,
says the pressure group Action on Smoking and Health (Ash).
The case in 1989 of Mr Sean Carroll, a Melbourne bus driver, produced an
overnight change in employers' attitudes, according to Ash. Before he died
of cancer Mr Carroll won a Pounds 32,000 out-of-court settlement for the
alleged effects of passive smoking. Almost immediately, states began to
legislate against smoking in public places and at work.
Even in France, where Gauloises are practically a national emblem, smoking
has been severely restricted in public places and open-plan offices.
In the US federal regulations are imminent which will force companies with
more than 10 workers to ban smoking. The move follows the Environmental
Protection Agency's classification of the smoke breathed out by smokers as a
significant carcinogen to those around them. The agency attributes about
3,000 lung-cancer deaths a year to passive smoking.
UK experts take a slightly lower-key approach. In 1988 a government advisory
body, the Independent Scientific Committee on Smoking and Health, reviewed
all the evidence and concluded that passive smoking caused a small increase
in the risk of lung cancer. Even so, it added, several hundred lung cancer
deaths a year in the UK might be attributable to passive smoking.
How much compulsion UK companies should face remains an open question. The
Confederation of British Industry is adamant that individual employers
should be left to assess the risk of passive smoking.
The same line has, until now, been taken by the government, but this may
change. Dr Brian Mawhinney, the health minister, has warned recently that
the government would not rule out legislation if voluntary bans failed to
work.
Back at Midland Bank, the need for flexibility and compassion towards
addicts is recognised. 'If a customer has a problem with his business and
comes in to see the manager, he might feel he needs a cigarette,' the bank
said. 'You have to have some element of common sense about whether you would
stop him.'

FT  28 JAN 93 / Ban on Shetland fishing widened
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BAN on fishing in an area off Shetland was widened yesterday after tests
revealed higher than normal hydrocarbon levels.
The ban, which includes the harvesting of farmed fish and shellfish, was
imposed on January 8 because of the risk of pollution from the wreck of the
Braer.
The Scottish Office said the area was being extended by five nautical miles
west of the mainland 'to prevent any possible risk to human health'.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Counselling proves positive for the unemployed: How some
executives cope with losing their jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Jilly Shaul knew all the theory about how individuals should come to
terms with the pain of unemployment. Before she was made redundant 12 months
ago she ran job-search seminars and job clubs for unemployed executives.
But Mrs Shaul became one of the thousands of unemployed individuals who,
according to the British Psychological Society this week, have been forced
to seek professional help for the trauma of losing their jobs.
'My job should have cushioned me for the shock,' says 55-year-old Mrs Shaul.
'I knew I should get rid of my feelings of anger as quickly as possible and
start being pro-active.
'In the event, as I started to get my letters of applications returned, I
started to get tearful and become as affected by feelings of rejection as my
former clients. Then my mother died and that was the straw that broke the
camel's back. I just could not cope.'
Mrs Shaul, who had watched her husband become depressed after early
retirement, contacted a psychotherapist whom she knew. 'Over a period of
some weeks I came to terms with my feelings and I became kinder to myself,'
she says.
She believes counselling facilities should be attached to every Jobcentre
and be freely available.
'Why me?' was all that 42-year-old Mr Keith Coxon, finance director of the
Nottingham Co-operative Society, was able to feel when he agreed to accept
voluntary redundancy.
Eighteen months on he has found similar full-time work at a slightly lower
salary. After periods of depression and lethargy, he has a new sense of
well-being and energy. He credits this partly to his involvement in a small
self-help group, set up with the help of Nottingham Training and Enterprise
Council.
His initial response to unemployment was fairly typical. For the first few
days he sat in his Pounds 190,000 home in a state of shock. The next step
was anger, followed by a period of intense introspection in which he blamed
himself. But he was aware of the dangers of allowing himself to deteriorate.
His GP was not particularly helpful, telling him: 'This happens to a lot of
people - just get on with life.' More solace came from his church, which he
visited more frequently.
It was the training and enterprise council's self-help group that helped
most. Mr Coxon says: 'It is the loneliness, the hurt and sense of loss that
your friends who are employed cannot understand. People in the same boat
understand. That includes our counsellors, a couple of which have themselves
experienced unemployment.
'I had never thought I was the sort of bloke that needed any advice or help.
But I have learnt so much. How to be positive again for a start and gain
self-esteem from new activities.'
He and his wife, a solicitor, sold their detached home in a desirable suburb
of Nottingham. 'It was such a relief getting rid of the Pounds 95,000
mortgage', says Mr Coxon. 'Like a lot of people I had got the status bug.'
'Now I've got a more realistic approach to my life. I would never trade up
again to a house like that until I had a lot of money in the bank.'

FT  28 JAN 93 / Repossessed homes down 9% in 1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of homes repossessed because of mortgage arrears fell last year
from the record level of 1991, the Council of Mortgage Lenders said
yesterday.
There was a sharp rise, however, in the number of households six months or
more in arrears with payments.
Repossessions totalled 68,540 last year, a fall of 9 per cent from 1991 when
75,540 properties were repossessed. But more than 350,000 households were in
serious mortgage arrears at the end of last year, 28 per cent up on the 1991
total of 275,350.
Sir George Young, the housing minister, said the figures showed that
government initiatives taken in conjunction with lenders in 1991 had started
to take effect. He predicted that falling interest rates would further ease
pressures on borrowers.
He said: 'The best mortgage rescue scheme is lower interest rates.'
But Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the lenders council, attributed the
fall in repossessions largely to actions by lenders. Had lenders not agreed
to be flexible, the number of repossessions could have exceeded 120,000, he
said.
Halifax Building Society, the largest lender, said that it had halved the
number of its repossessions over the past year.
Mr Boleat said the steep increase in mortgage arrears was caused by lenders
agreeing to lower monthly payments instead of repossessing.
Arrears had also been lengthened by the fall in interest rates, since
monthly arrears figures are calculated by dividing the total outstanding by
the monthly payments. When monthly payments fall, the arrears total remains
unchanged. But the number of months needed to pay them off goes up.
Mr John Wriglesworth, analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, described those in
arrears as on 'the waiting list for repossession'.
Rising unemployment would only add to the problem. 'Possessions will
continue to plague our country for the next two or three years,' Mr
Wriglesworth said.
Ms Sheila McKechnie, director of Shelter, the charity for the homeless,
said: 'The problem of mortgage debt is not diminishing, it is just shifting
from repossessions to long-term arrears. The crisis has been postponed, not
solved.'
Mr Boleat conceded that government mortgage rescue initiatives had made some
contribution to the fall in repossessions.
More than 10,000 homes had been saved from repossession because of the
payment of the mortgage interest part of social security benefits directly
to the lender rather than the borrower. Only 1,000 homes have been saved as
a result of the mortgage to rent schemes, however.
Mortgage lenders sold 71,000 properties during last year but held 64,970
unsold properties at the end of the year.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Satellite threat to ITV is dismissed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITV HAS little to fear from satellite television in terms of advertising,
audience or programmes, a senior ITV executive said yesterday.
Mr Craig Pearman, managing director of MAS, the advertising sales house that
represents Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, told a London conference on satellite
television that satellite sales had not risen spectacularly last year.
According to Continental Research there was an average increase of 50,000
dishes a month last year. Two other research groups, BARB and GfK, suggested
figures of little more than 40,000 a month.
Forecasts at the beginning of last year had suggested a growth during the
year of more than 90,000 dishes a month.
'Whichever estimate is taken, the annual sales are still at least  1/2 m
less than the prediction,' Mr Pearman said.
The share of viewing for satellite channels in satellite homes had fallen
significantly from 37 per cent in November 1991 to 32 per cent in November
1992.
Satellite's move to subscription would limit the audience for satellite
television.
As a result, Mr Pearman said, although ITV would lose some share of viewing
the fall would be slow and not very large.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Redundancy move is ruled unlawful
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A UNILATERAL change to employees' redundancy terms at a General Electric
Company plant was unlawful, the High Court ruled yesterday at a sitting in
Birmingham.
Lawyers representing unions involved believe this case alone will cost the
company Pounds 5m and have wide-ranging implications at other GEC plants and
at other companies.
The case directly affects the Beeston plant of GPT in Nottingham, which is
60 per cent owned by GEC and 40 per cent by Siemens.
As part of a cost-cutting exercise in 1991 GEC reduced the relatively
generous redundancy terms which then prevailed at many plants to near the
statutory minimum of one week's pay for each year of service.
The effect of yesterday's ruling by Mr Justice Connell is that GEC has to
reinstate the original redundancy terms at Beeston of four weeks' pay for
every year of service for the 1,800 employees.
It will also almost certainly have to make up the difference between the
original and the new terms for 800 employees made redundant after the terms
were changed. The company said last night that it had not decided whether to
appeal.
The main legal point clarified yesterday was that redundancy terms enshrined
in a collective agreement were deemed to be part of an individual contract
of employment.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Councils criticised over housing benefit provision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST LOCAL authorities responsible for paying housing benefit to low-income
households are failing to provide a prompt, accurate and efficient service,
says an Audit Commission report.
The local authority watchdog says that while many councils manage payment of
benefits efficiently, it is often at the cost of ignoring government
regulations. Many others have large backlogs of unprocessed claims,
unanswered queries and unopened mail.
The commission lays much of the blame for poor administration of housing
benefit on the government. The regulations for paying it are complex, change
frequently and encourage bad management practices.
Housing benefit costs Pounds 6bn a year and is paid to 3.5m low-income
households - one in six households. It is administered by councils on behalf
of central government, which repays 95 per cent of the benefit paid out and
30 per cent of the administration cost.
The report finds large variations between the speed with which councils
process claims. More than half claim to process over 80 per cent of claims
within 14 days of receiving them (the statutory target).
The subsidy arrangements also create 'perverse incentives' for councils to
ignore regulations, the commission says. Councils that encourage claimants
to backdate claims cannot recoup the additional benefit. The rules also
discourage councils from paying higher benefits than recommended by rent
officers where this is allowed.
There are also incentives to ignore evidence of overpayment or fraud,
according to the report.
The commission says district auditors will be focusing on service standards
to reduce delays and improve accuracy.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Boiler shutdown 'led to Braer disaster'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BOILER shutdown on the tanker Braer for 'routine adjustment' led to the
ship breaking down and going aground in violent seas in the Shetland islands
earlier this month.
In his first detailed public statement on the disaster, Mr Michael Hudner,
chief executive of B&amp;H Ship Management, the US operator of the
Liberian-registered vessel, defends the competence of the tanker's Greek
captain and his largely Filipino crew. The ship had been passed as sound in
a number of outside inspections.
He also defends the choice of route taking the Braer through the 25-mile
channel between Shetland and Fair Isle on its voyage from Norway to Canada.
Other routes were 'less attractive from the standpoint of safety and
navigation'.
Mr Hudner says the boiler, shut down before midnight on January 4, more than
12 hours before the stranding at 11.20am on January 5, could not be
re-ignited and therefore ceased to warm the heavy fuel oil used in the main
engine. This made a switch to diesel oil necessary just after midnight.
Although the diesel oil used by the main engine was automatically purified,
the diesel required to fuel the boiler and power the ship's generators was
found to be contaminated with seawater. This had apparently entered through
the diesel tank's air vents, which may have been damaged by some steel pipes
being carried on board, Mr Hudner says.
After further efforts to remove the water and reignite the boiler failed,
the master decided to seek shelter and at 4.36am the Braer, now 10 miles
south of Sumburgh Head, changed course for the Moray Firth. The ship then
lost propulsion from the main engine and the generators failed.
He says the Braer contacted the coastguard at about 5am but did not request
the assistance of a tug, the master calculating that it would slowly drift
clear of land.
The captain was later advised by the RAF and the coastguards to allow the
evacuation of the crew by helicopter because the ship was in danger of going
aground and causing an explosion.

The company said last night that it was still considering the judgment and
had not decided whether to appeal. The unions at Beeston, led by the TGWU
and GMB general unions and the MSF white-collar union, said the judgment
would cost the company at least Pounds 5m at Beeston alone. Legal costs of
the case, which the company was ordered to pay, come to more than Pounds 1m.
The main legal point clarified yesterday was that redundancy terms enshrined
in a collective agreement were deemed to be part of an individual contract
of employment.
Mr Phil King, a partner in solicitors Robin Thompson &amp; Partners who
represented the unions, said: 'This judgment could have far-reaching
implications and by making redundancy more expensive for companies could
save a large number of jobs'.

   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTOROLA, the US electronics company, is seeking planning permission to more
than double the size of its plant at Easter Inch in West Lothian, which
makes cellular telephones
The expansion will involve increasing employment at the plant by 600 to
1,500 by summer 1994.
Motorola opened the Easter Inch plant in January last year. It says its
current employment level of 900 people is well ahead of its original
programme. When it announced the project in March 1990 it said the plant
would eventually employ 1,500 to 2,000 people.
The Chicago-based company is seeking permission to add phases two and three
of the project, totalling 275,000 square feet, to the existing 175,000
square foot facility. Total investment will exceed Pounds 100m.
The Scottish plant will eventually be bigger than the company's plant at
Flensburg,Germany.

FT  28 JAN 93 / BNFL faces safety charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITISH NUCLEAR Fuels is to be prosecuted for four alleged breaches of site
licence conditions at its Sellafield reprocessing works in Cumbria, the
Health and Safety Executive said yesterday.
The prosecution follows investigations by the HSE's Nuclear Installations
Inspectorate into an incident during routine testing work last April at the
Windscale Vitrification Product Store, part of a Pounds 240m complex opened
in February 1991.
The inspectorate alleges:
An unauthorised modification had been carried out, disabling gamma monitor
interlocks (radiation detectors) designed to ensure safety.
Operations were done for which there were no adequate written instructions.
The interlocks were not properly connected.
There were not adequate arrangements for testing the interlocks associated
with the product flask.
The HSE said that while there were no radiological consequences from the
alleged events, it was prosecuting because of the importance it attaches to
compliance with licence conditions. BNFL will appear before Whitehaven
magistrates on February 26.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Boiler shutdown 'led to Braer disaster'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BOILER shutdown on the tanker Braer for 'routine adjustment' led to the
ship breaking down and going aground in violent seas in the Shetland islands
earlier this month.
In his first detailed public statement on the disaster, Mr Michael Hudner,
chief executive of B + H Ship Management, the US operators of the
Liberian-registered vessel, defends the competence of the tanker's Greek
captain and his largely Filipino crew. The ship had been passed as sound in
a number of outside inspections.
He also defends the choice of route taking the Braer through the 25 mile
channel between Shetland and Fair Isle on its voyage from Norway to Canada.
Other routes were 'less attractive from the standpoint of safety and
navigation'.
Mr Hudner says the boiler, shut down before midnight on January 4, more than
12 hours before the stranding at 11.20am on January 5, could not be
re-ignited and therefore ceased to warm the heavy fuel oil used in the main
engine. This made a switch to diesel oil necessary just after midnight.
Although the diesel oil used by the main engine was automatically purified,
the diesel required to fuel the boiler and power the ship's generators was
found to be contaminated with seawater. This had apparently entered through
the diesel tank's air vents, which may have been damaged by some steel pipes
being carried on board, Mr Hudner says.
After further efforts to remove the water and re-ignite the boiler failed,
the master decided to seek shelter and at 4.36am the Braer, now 10 miles
south of Sumburgh Head, changed course for the Moray Firth. The ship then
lost propulsion from the main engine and a few minutes later the generators
failed, blacking out the ship except for emergency lighting.
He says the Braer contacted the coastguard at about 5am but did not request
the assistance of a tug, the master calculating that it would slowly drift
clear of land. Coastguards located the tug Star Sirius at Lerwick in
Shetland at 6.04am, however, and the tug left harbour at 7.10am.
In the meantime the captain was advised by the RAF and the coastguards to
allow the evacuation of the crew by helicopter because the ship was in
danger of going aground and causing an explosion. The evacuation took place
between 8.25am and 8.50am and the tug arrived on the scene at 9.45am.
An attempt at 10.30am to save the ship - with five men landed from a
helicopter - failed. The Braer, with a cargo of 85,000 tonnes of crude, went
aground at Garth's Ness at 11.20am, Mr Hudner says.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Home Office refuses aid for charity plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST attempt to launch a generic advertising campaign to encourage
support for charity in the UK has been abandoned through lack of Home Office
finance.
Voluntary-sector leaders have wound up the Windsor Group, a committee of
large fund-raising charities set up in 1990 to explore ways of boosting
charitable donations.
It would have cost an estimated Pounds 4m a year to run the campaign. The 29
Windsor Group charities pledged a total of Pounds 500,000 provided the
government put up Pounds 1.5m. Promoters of the campaign believed it would
have been possible to use the pledge of government support to raise the
other Pounds 2m from grant-making trusts and private-sector supporters.
The Home Office has told the group that, in the present state of public
spending, it will not be possible to put public funds into the campaign.
The decision will add to charity managers' concerns about the government's
attitude to the voluntary sector, which ministers want to take on more
responsibilities. Charities face losing up to Pounds 147m a year in
donations because of the national lottery, the National Council for
Voluntary Organisations said yesterday. They would lose donations worth
Pounds 232m and gain Pounds 90m from the lottery, it said.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Concern on threat to wages councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAY WILL fall significantly if wages councils, which set minimum rates for
2.5m workers, are abolished, according to research commissioned by the
Trades Union Congress.
The government has argued that wages councils have become 'irrelevant' and
that their abolition will have little effect on pay rates.
But researchers from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research
and the London School of Economics argue in a paper prepared for
presentation at a TUC conference tomorrow, that many workers will face a
small cut in pay and a small number will face a large cut.
The Commons committee examining the Employment Bill is today expected to
approve the clause which abolishes the councils cover-ing retailing,
catering, hairdressing and clothing manufacture.
Unions are strongly contesting abolition and they might lodge a formal
complaint with the European Commission on the grounds of discrimination
against women. Women make up 80 per cent of employees covered by the
councils.
The research concluded that pay would fall after studying residential care
homes for the elderly, a low paid industry not covered by wages councils.
The research also challenged the government view that, because 80 per cent
of wages council workers live in households with at least one other earner,
there will be no significant impact on poverty.
The study found that a higher proportion of single parents are found in
wages council industries than in the working population as a whole - 20.3
per cent compared with 13.8 per cent. It also found that a reduction in
earnings for these workers will increase their dependence on state benefits
and therefore raise public spending.
The study also found little evidence that new jobs would be created by
abolition of councils. Government economists now accept that few jobs are
likely to be created, but that is based on the assumption that pay rates
change very little.
One economist said: 'If what these researchers say about pay reductions is
true then there could be new jobs.'

FT  28 JAN 93 / Prior says rail plans could destroy jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD PRIOR, the former Tory cabinet minister who chairs General Electric
Company, yesterday warned that the government's rail privatisation plans
could destroy Britain's trainmaking industry over the next three years.
His warning came as the government tried to meet the industry's concerns by
publishing a consultation paper on its plans to encourage trainmaking after
privatisation.
GEC is one of Britain's biggest railway equipment manufacturers, employing a
workforce of 4,000 on trainmaking and signalling in a sector directly
employing more than 12,000.
Lord Prior told the Commons transport committee that the industry had little
work beyond the completion of existing contracts and that there were very
few home orders in sight.
He feared that the government's rail privatisation plans would lead to a
drying up of orders because the transition to the new regime would be
accompanied by a hiatus in investment. The result would be heavy
redundancies.
'Unless some orders come in reasonably quickly there will be no rolling
stock industry left in three years' time,' Lord Prior said. 'I don't think
that's an exaggeration.'
Lord Prior's warning echoed the Railway Industry Association's claim last
month that train manufacturers were 'staring annihilation in the face'
because of the government's plans.
Trainmakers fear that companies winning franchises to operate BR's passenger
services will be reluctant to buy or lease new rolling stock because of the
risk that they will be unable to find a buyer for it should they fail to
renew their franchises.
Mr Roger Freeman, minister for public transport, yesterday sought to allay
the industry's fears about an investment famine with assurances that the gap
would be bridged.
He said British Rail had been given permission in the 1992 Autumn Statement
to lease Pounds 150m-worth of trains. Beyond that, BR would still be
operating non-franchised services for years to come and would continue
ordering new trains.
In addition, he hoped private-sector train manufacturers would embark on the
speculative building of rolling stock which it would then lease to train
operators. The government also planned to establish public-sector train
leasing companies which would be privatised as quickly as possible.
Addressing doubts about the private sector's willingness to invest in new
trains, Mr Freeman said he did not rule out the possibility of making some
franchises conditional on such investment.

FT  28 JAN 93 / GCSE code for marking approved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW code of practice to ensure consistent marking of the GCSE examination
was sanctioned yesterday by the government. It is designed to tackle alleged
shortcomings in assessment procedures.
The mandatory code of practice will ensure standardised procedures for
awarding grades, assessing coursework and marking spelling, punctuation and
grammar between the five GCSE examining boards in England. The code will
begin to take effect this year and will be fully in place by 1994.
The School Examinations and Assessment Council, a government agency, will
appoint independent external assessors in each of the main national
curriculum subjects, to guarantee consistent standards across groups.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, said: 'Parents and employers must have
confidence in GCSE exams. This new code will put beyond doubt the
credentials of the GCSE as a reliable way of measuring achievement at the
end of compulsory schooling.'
Claims of 'grade inflation' have been widespread since the GCSE replaced
O-levels as the examination taken by all 16-year-olds in England and Wales
1988. In 1987, the proportion of pupils gaining grades A to C in O-level,
generally considered to be the pass standard, was 39.8 per cent; in last
year's GCSEs, more than half gained the top three grades.
Lack of consistency marking the GCSE last year was criticised by the schools
inspectorate, leading Mr Patten to instruct SEAC to consider reforms.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, rejected 'the implication that GCSE standards were at risk', and
said agreement on the code was only possible 'because of existing good
practice'.
Mr Don Foster, Liberal Democrat education spokesman, said the time had come
for a single national GCSE exam board to be established. 'We have a national
curriculum,' he said. 'We should have a national exam board.'

convictions for investment fraud rose sharply as well, Norma Cohen writes.
Last year 40 cases were referred to the police or the Serious Fraud Office,
up from 32 in 1991. In total 145 cases have been referred for criminal
investigation since the Financial Services Act took effect in 1988.
The SIB statistics show that the 37 of the 40 cases referred for criminal

FT  28 JAN 93 / CBI warns on pay policy in public sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLIC SECTOR pay policy will fail unless ministers focus on the size of the
sector's total wage bill next year, rather than on the level of individual
settlements, the Confederation of British Industry warned yesterday.
The CBI will not recommend a ceiling for pay rises for next year until
nearer this year's December Budget, but Mr Howard Davies, its
director-general, said the figure was unlikely to be higher than the
government's 1.5 per cent public-sector ceiling for the current year.
Mr Davies said the government's approach to controlling pay was
unsustainable and risked collapse if the economy improved.
He said the approach could only work for a year, or perhaps two, before pay
structure and relativity problems emerged. 'The government should start to
look at the kind of disciplines the private sector has had to live with.
While pay discipline is well under control at the moment, there is no reason
to say it will not accelerate without changes in approach'.
Mr Davies said public-sector pay policies were 'easier to start than to
finish' and stressed that ministers must soon consider extending and
revising pay restraint strategy if recent progress on pay was not to be
sacrificed.
The CBI's intervention reflects growing concern among pay experts that the
line on pay will be hard to hold next year and that pay deals will try to
catch up on earlier, low settlements.
The organisation, which is enjoying renewed influence in Whitehall, is also
stepping up efforts to maintain downward pressure on private-sector pay -
year-on-year settlements in manufacturing are running at 3.1 per cent - and
to curb unit labour costs.
Mr Davies acknowledged that a total pay bill strategy in the public sector
would be more difficult to implement but said it would prove more effective
and more likely to resist upward pressures on pay levels.
He said the Treasury was nervous about a switch in focus which would give
more flexibility at local level.
Leaders of the 49,000-strong Fire Brigades Union will today meet local
authority employers and are expected to be told that they will receive a 1.5
per cent pay rise.

FT  28 JAN 93 / EC cash windfall likely, MPs told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING'S devaluation since September should mean a windfall gain for the
UK from the European Community budget, a House of Commons committee heard
yesterday.
Mr David Bostock, head of the UK Treasury's European Community group, told
the Treasury and Civil Service committee there should be an increase in
sterling receipts from the EC budget, especially for Britain's farmers.
There is unlikely to be any significant change to Britain's contributions to
the EC, however. This is because any increase in the sterling cost of the EC
budget arising from the devaluation should be offset by declines in the
measures of gross national product and value added tax on which
contributions are partly based.
UK farmers will be paid more in sterling because agricultural support prices
are denominated in 'green Ecu', which are roughly equivalent in value to the
D-mark, Mr Bostock said. Britain's receipts from the EC structural funds,
which are denominated in European currency units, will also be worth more
when expressed in sterling.
Sir John Cope, the paymaster general, told the committee the government
would be 'bidding strongly' to increase the areas of the UK that qualify for
financial support through the structural funds because of the fall in GNP
during the recession.
He said it was unlikely, however, that the UK would qualify for payments
from the so-called cohesion funds that have been created to aid Spain,
Portugal, Greece and Ireland.
These countries, the four poorest EC members, will receive the payments to
help them prepare for economic and monetary union.

FT  28 JAN 93 / JCB intent on putting the skids under its rivals: The
engineering group's hope for its new product
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN AN industry which loves gossiping about rivals' product plans, it was an
open secret that JC Bamford Excavators (JCB), the largest UK-owned
earthmoving equipment maker, was about to enter a new product sector.
The company, whose initials are a generic name for backhoe loaders - the big
yellow machines with a loader bucket at the front and a small excavator in
the rear - this week made its long-awaited entry into the fast-growing
European market for skid-steer loaders.
The launch of the innovatively-designed JCB Robot is an important step for
Staffordshire-based JCB, one of the UK's most successful privately-held
engineering groups.
It is also a rare piece of good news in an industry which has yet to see any
hard evidence of the recession lifting in the UK, and may face worsening
conditions on the Continent.
JCB said recently it was producing construction equipment at about one third
of the rate of four years ago, when the UK market was booming.
Skid-steer loaders are compact machines which can be used for anything from
light civil engineering work to clearing out chicken coops. Their
versatility, with the trend towards use of smaller machines, such as
mini-excavators, in jobs where picks and shovels would have been used until
recently, makes them relatively recession-proof.
According to Mr David Phillips of the London-based Corporate Intelligence
Group, sales in Europe have surged from 3,600 units in 1985 to about 10,000
last year and could rise to between 12,000 and 14,000 in five years.
JCB is known to have been looking at the skid-steer market for a decade.
Launching a new volume product in a relatively fast-growing sector, says Mr
Phillips, is a much more realistic way for JCB to build sales than to
attempt a 5 per cent increase in backhoe loaders, where it is European
leader with a 40 per cent market share.
JCB has spent three years and Pounds 4m developing the Robot, which will
enter a market dominated by the Melroe Bobcat, produced by Clark Equipment
of the US.
JCB has set itself characteristically tough targets for the Robot. Mr John
Bradley, JCB's marketing director, says the company aims to become the
second-biggest supplier in the European skid-steer market in about three
years, giving it about 10 per cent of the market.
That could involve taking market share from Melroe, which has about 50 per
cent of the market, and smaller suppliers such as Gehl of Germany and FAI of
Italy. Mr Phillips says the entry of another internationally-known company
alongside Melroe may expand the market.
Additionally, JCB is pinning its hopes on winning customers by redrawing the
conventional skid-steer design. The Robot's single boom allows the operator
access through a side door, cutting out the risk of injury when clambering
over or under the bucket to reach the driving seat.

FT  28 JAN 93 / BR chief hopeful on Heathrow project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR BOB REID, British Rail's chairman, said yesterday that BR and BAA, the
airports operator, were 'within days of a solution' to the deadlock over
plans for the Pounds 300m Heathrow Express project.
His remarks caused confusion at BAA, however. The company said: 'We are
optimistic that there will be a successful outcome, but there is still quite
a bit of tough negotiation to go.'
The Heathrow Express project is intended to speed passengers between
Heathrow Airport and central London's Paddington station in 16 minutes. It
is being developed jointly by BAA and BR.
The plan is for BR to carry the train on its existing tracks for three
quarters of the 16-mile journey. A private-sector consortium led by BAA
would build and operate the spur needed to take the trains off the main line
to Heathrow Airport.
Plans for the 16-mile rail link were close to collapse last month amid a
bitter dispute between BR and BAA over how it should be funded.
BAA said BR was undermining the viability of the scheme by asking too high a
price for use of its mainline tracks, but BR said BAA was at fault for
refusing to put more money into the project.
Yesterday Sir Bob told the Commons transport committee that the 'Byzantine'
negotiations with BAA were probably within a few days of solution. 'John
Egan (BAA's chief executive) and I are almost there,' he told MPs.
Both BAA and BR, however, tried yesterday to play down the prospects of an
early agreement, saying that there were difficult issues still to be
resolved.
The Heathrow Express is one of two big projects which have proved
embarrassing to the government in its attempts to involve the private sector
in providing rail infrastructure. The other is the planned Pounds 1.7bn
extension of the Jubilee Line to London's Docklands. This is currently
blocked by the private sector's reneging on a promised contribution to the
extension of Pounds 400m.
BAA is expected to file a planning application for the construction of the
new Pounds 800m-Pounds 900m fifth terminal at Heathrow in the middle of next
month, making fast rail connections all the more important.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Consultation paper on rail privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Transport's consultation paper on rail privatisation and
passenger rolling stock envisages a time of healthy leasing in new and
second-hand trains.
There is one big problem: operators will be reluctant to take out a 15-year
lease on a train if their franchise expires after five years.
A four-pronged transitional arrangement is proposed to overcome this:
Companies might win franchises for longer than five years if they promise to
re-equip a line with new trains.
The franchising authority might agree that if a franchisee investing in new
trains failed to win renewal the successor would be required to take over
the trains.
The government might be prepared to underwrite a proportion of the losses
suffered by a train lessor who failed to find a buyer or lessee for trains
made redundant by the loss of a franchise.
Public sector train leasing companies might be set up as interim measure,
though the government would aim to privatise them soon.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Textile group in Ulster investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEADING Far Eastern textile group announced yesterday it was investing
Pounds 95m in a project in Northern Ireland, with the aim of boosting its
presence in Europe.
Texmaco-Polysindo, the Indonesian manufacturer of polyester filament yarn
and garments, is locating production facilities at a site in Antrim formerly
owned by Akzo, the Dutch chemical company. It hopes to create 900 jobs over
the next three years.
The Antrim site, near Belfast airport, is to have two factories. The first
company, Norfol, will make yarn from polyester chips, and has an annual
production target of 20,000 tonnes expected to be reached by the end of next
year.
The second, Pan European Textiles, will focus on weaving and processing
fabrics from the yarn with a production target of 5,000 tonnes within the
next two years.
The UK government, through the Northern Ireland Industrial Development
Board, is to contribute Pounds 14.6m in the form of training and capital
equipment grants and in facilitating a low interest loan.
Industry analysts say Texmaco has been seeking a European site in
anticipation of the EC raising tariffs and introducing anti-dumping measures
against the third world.
It chose Northern Ireland after looking at potential sites on the UK
mainland (Leeds and Bradford), Spain, and France.
Northern Ireland officials yesterday heralded Texmaco's announcement as a
boost to confidence following a year in which the government's record for
attracting overseas investment has been criticised.
Dr Graham Gudgin, head of the Northern Ireland Research Centre (NIERC) said
last night, however, that on past experience of overseas investment it was
possible 'not all the promised 900 jobs will be created'.
A report at the end of last year by the Northern Ireland Economic Council
said employment in externally-owned plants in the region fell by 46,000
between 1973 and 1990.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Mandatory code for GCSE marking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW code of practice to ensure consistent marking of the GCSE examination
was sanctioned yesterday by the government. It is designed to tackle alleged
shortcomings in assessment procedures.
The mandatory code of practice will ensure standardised procedures for
awarding grades, assessing coursework and marking spelling, punctuation and
grammar between the five GCSE examining boards in England.
The code will begin to take effect this year and will be fully in place by
1994.
The School Examinations and Assessment Council, a government agency, will
appoint independent external assessors in each of the main national
curriculum subjects, to guarantee consistent standards across groups.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, said: 'Parents and employers must have
confidence in GCSE exams. This new code will put beyond doubt the
credentials of the GCSE as a reliable way of measuring achievement at the
end of compulsory schooling.'
Claims of 'grade inflation' have been widespread since the GCSE replaced
O-levels as the examination taken by all 16-year-olds in England and Wales
1988. In 1987, the proportion of pupils gaining grades A to C in O-level,
generally considered to be the pass standard, was 39.8 per cent; in last
year's GCSEs, more than half gained the top three grades.
Lack of consistency marking the GCSE last year was criticised by the schools
inspectorate, leading Mr Patten to instruct SEAC to consider reforms.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, rejected 'the implication that GCSE standards were at risk', and
said agreement on the code was only possible 'because of existing good
practice'.
Mr Don Foster, Liberal Democrat education spokesman, said the time had come
for a single national GCSE exam board to be established. 'We have a national
curriculum,' he said. 'We should have a national exam board.'

FT  28 JAN 93 / Hurd hits at US over UN council: Ally rapped for dues delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, hit at US calls for reform of
the UN Security Council yesterday, saying: 'If it ain't broke, don't fix
it.' For good measure, he also rapped Britain's ally over the knuckles for
not paying its UN dues.
Stressing that Britain had 3,700 troops on UN service, in six different
operations, Mr Hurd added pointedly: 'We pay our bills on time (whereas)
others who carry a heavy burden of international responsibility do not'. He
was sure 'the new US administration will find a remedy for past delays'.
Mr Hurd, addressing the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London,
avoided any direct criticism of Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of
state, who had said this week that it was 'time for some reorganisation of
the UN', including permanent membership of the Security Council for Germany
and Japan.
Pointing out that Mr Christopher had also acknowledged 'the complexity of
that decision', Mr Hurd added: 'You can say that again'.
Such a change, he said, would require amendment of the UN Charter and
therefore a wide degree of consensus. 'It can't be solved simply by adding
Germany and Japan.' Candidates for permanent membership would be very
numerous, and the outcome would be 'hard to predict and slow to reach'.
Meanwhile, 'the Security Council has to get on with its job'.
Mr Hurd also complimented France, a fellow permanent member whose position,
like Britain's, might be challenged in any reform. Pointing out that France
had more than 6,000 troops on UN service, many of them alongside British
soldiers, he remarked: 'In this new world, the interests of Britain and
France are increasingly similar and intertwined'.
The foreign secretary's main theme, in a wide-ranging address, was that an
international effort, 'comparable to those of 1815, 1919 and the years after
1945', was needed 'to avert a continuing slide into disorder', and that
Britain wished to play 'a worthy part'.
But he stressed that British troops in the former Yugoslavia had 'a
humanitarian not an enforcing role', arguing that 'no democracy could
justify to its people' the forces and risks that would be required to
'impose and guarantee order' there.
Mr Hurd reiterated British support for the Geneva conference on Yugoslavia.

FT  28 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Israeli matchmaker sees Kazakhstan as next
frontier - The beliefs that drive Shoul Eisenberg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL instability, backward infrastructure, extreme remoteness and lack
of hard cash are just some of the reasons for not doing business in the
central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union. But to Mr Shoul
Eisenberg, Israel's - and one of the world's - most secretive businessmen,
it is exactly the kind of place he likes to operate.
Late last year the government of Kazakhstan signed a Dollars 160m (Pounds
105.2m) deal with the Eisenberg group in Tel Aviv to make and install
advanced irrigation equipment in the south of the republic. It was one of a
string of projects in which Eisenberg companies are involved in Kazakhstan
and the other Moslem republics, spanning everything from agriculture and
food production, to oil refining and telecommunications.
From Kazakhstan alone the group holds letters of intent for contracts worth
Dollars 2bn.
Such deep commitment in such an uncertain corner of the world looks like
commercial recklessness, or at least supreme optimism. Mr Eisenberg thinks
otherwise. For him central Asia is the new and logical next frontier in a
business career which began in Japan in the 1940s and moved through the Far
East to China - where for the past decade he has been a ubiquitous, if
barely visible, western commercial operator.
In a rare interview in his Tel Aviv headquarters, Mr Eisenberg said that
what he is doing in central Asia follows a pattern. 'It was the same when we
started in Japan; who trusted the Japanese then? When we started in (South)
Korea, its total assets were Dollars 50m. These are now miracle countries.
In China, the Philippines, Taiwan - these were all difficult countries to
operate in. But I believe when you help them in those times and later they
become healthy, then you have friends who will help you.'
Mr Eisenberg's role in all these places has been in essence as a matchmaker
between governments anxious to develop their industrial infrastructure and
western companies with the technology and ability to help them do it. His
principal company, United Development Inc, has since 1978 arranged a string
of deals in China, from energy plants to a Dollars 150m float glass plant in
Shanghai involving Britain's Pilkington Glass. UDI now has 12 offices in
China and has reaped the benefits of China's recent rapid economic growth.
It has been estimated that Mr Eisenberg, 71, has amassed a personal fortune
approaching Dollars 1.5bn. An impish man, he chuckles at this and declares:
'I don't know. Really, I don't know.' He also laughs at suggestions in the
press that, commercially, he is the most powerful man in China. 'It is
nonsense. They made a mystery out of me because I don't talk to them.'
But he reacts sharply to the accusation that he has prospered simply by
inserting himself as a middleman in international dealmaking. 'That is not
true. I am not a commission agent. We do the business which people cannot do
themselves. We create businesses and we invest ourselves. If anyone says I
am Mr Five Per Cent it is a complete lie.'
He holds up his venture into the central Asian republics as an example. In
his search for financing - 'our biggest headache' - he has turned to
European sovereign aid programmes and the EBRD, which require that Eisenberg
companies also back projects with their own money. Then there is payment.
'We don't get paid in money, we get paid in goods,' Mr Eisenberg says.
In two agreements to upgrade Kazakhstan's oil refining, Mr Eisenberg will
seek a return from the added efficiency. 'Their yield of refined products
from crude oil is about 62 to 65 per cent. We can bring it up to 95 per
cent. We will get paid from the difference. That is our philosophy. You put
in the money first and get it back later. It's not so quick.'
Mr Eisenberg also carries a torch for Israel. Although he is an Austrian
passport-holder, he has been an Israeli citizen since 1950. The Israeli
government then enacted a law - known as the Eisenberg law  - granting tax
exemptions for his overseas operations, to entice him to base the group's
activities in Israel. He has since added to his private empire the Israel
Corporation, a public holding company whose offshoots employ 8,000 people in
Israel and turn over Dollars 2.5bn a year.
He has built up a symbiotic relationship with successive Israeli
governments, to the irritation of many other Israeli businessmen who feel he
receives too many favours from the state. Most of the latest Kazakhstan
deal, for example, will be guaranteed by the government. Senior officials
such as Mr Moshe Arens, the former foreign minister, and Mr David Kimche,
former director general of the Foreign Ministry, have over the years joined
his companies.
He says one of the reasons he has almost obsessively avoided personal
publicity is the sensitivity of working as an Israeli with regimes such as
China which have close ties with the Arab world. But throughout the 1980s,
until Israel and China established diplomatic relations early this year, Mr
Eisenberg was a conduit through which discreet relations were conducted.
During that time Israel is reported to have sold significant quantities of
arms to China, sometimes eliciting statements of concern from the US.
According to Mr Eisenberg: 'If we are asked by the Israeli government to
help them, then sometimes we will help them. But I am not a military trader.
Only if the government asks for assistance we might make some introductions.
But we have never sold one scrap of military equipment.'
In central Asia Mr Eisenberg is again acting as a kind of grand commercial
ambassador for Israel, which is anxious to cement relations with Moslem
countries on the northern fringe of the Middle East. 'You cannot be friends
and be enemies at the same time,' he says.
He admits he cannot be certain whether those links will prove as successful
as his previous ventures. In October he had to pull out of Tajikistan
because of the civil war erupting there. 'We lost a few million dollars,' he
says, almost casually, adding: 'I am sure one day we will go back.'

FT  28 JAN 93 / World Trade News: GEC Alsthom wins India contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS

<DATELINE>
   BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major, the British prime minister, ended his four-day tour of India
last night by announcing that a Pounds 140m electricity interconnector
contract had been won by GEC Alsthom, the Anglo- French engineering group.
Mr Major said in Bombay that other Anglo-Indian deals were 'in the
pipeline'. He urged the Indian government to continue its economic reforms
so further contracts could be agreed.
The prime minister called for the opening up of trade, particularly in
consumer goods; for a smaller role for India's public sector; and for the
reform of the country's labour laws to encourage job creation 'rather than
giving an illusion of job security to a privileged few'.
The GEC Alsthom contract is the biggest Mr Major has been able to announce
after leading a delegation of senior UK businessmen to India. It will be
partly funded by Pounds 63m of British aid.
Mr Brian Baldock, deputy chairman of Guinness, who travelled with the prime
minister, announced that the group's spirits division is to form a joint
venture with United Breweries of India to blend and bottle Scotch whisky in
the country.
However, the project depends on the Indian government removing a 1947 ban on
importing alcohol. There is no sign of its early relaxation.
GEC Alsthom is to supply the Power Grid Corp of India with a high-voltage
direct current convertor station to link the western and southern regions of
the country's electricity network. It will use power conversion equipment
developed at its Stafford plant.
Mr Major has been disappointed by the slow progress on a deal British
Aerospace hopes to agree with the Indian Air Force for the supply of Hawk
trainer aircraft. The contract is expected to be worth about Dollars 500m
(Pounds 329m).

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA is opening its retail sector to foreign joint ventures in 11 regions,
following high domestic consumption in a number of cities, Reuter reports
from Beijing.
Foreign businessmen will be able to enter the retail sector in Beijing,
Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Dalian, Qingdao and the five special economic
zones of Hainan, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou and Xiamen.
Retail sales rose 15 per cent last year to Yn1,080bn (Pounds 122bn).
'The state still needs to control the development of retail businesses run
solely by foreigners,' the official China Daily quoted Mr Hu Ping, minister
of commerce, as saying. 'But the state. . . will loosen its controls along
with the maturity of the Chinese market as a whole.' Details of controls
still needed were not given.
The regions are among China's most vibrant. While urban residents in the
country as a whole have average per capita monthly cash incomes of Yn176.87,
the average in Shenzhen is Yn515.80. In Shanghai the average is Yn267.62.
Officials admit statistics do not reflect the extra income earned from
second jobs and other sources. An official from the State Statistics Bureau
said that, on average, the extra income effectively doubled an urban
worker's salary.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Favoured five await the presidential nod: Mexicans spot
clues to new president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR, or less, before President Carlos Salinas anoints his likely
successor, Mexico is asking who looks favoured to receive the chief's dedazo
(nod), and wondering how independent the presidential election in 1994 might
be.
Most political commentators - who believe Mr Salinas will follow the
practice of his predecessors and choose the ruling party's candidate for the
election - conclude that the immediate effect of recent cabinet changes is
likely to be even greater presidential control over the political system.
The displacement of the seasoned interior minister, Mr Fernando Gutierrez
Barrios, by the hard-line Chiapas state governor and distinguished lawyer,
Mr Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido, removed at least one potentially independent
voice.
The vast experience of Mr Gutierrez Barrios at the interior ministry proved
invaluable in the first stormy years of the Salinas administration but the
president had grown wary of his negotiations with opposition parties, which
seemed only to weaken the morale of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party (PRI) and encourage more demonstrations after elections in various
states.
The change at interior was accompanied by others no less significant by way
of signals.
The new under-minister for electoral matters in the interior ministry is Mr
Cesar Agusto Santiago, former electoral chief of the PRI and seen by the
opposition as the alchemist behind the party's victory in the 1991
Congressional elections.
The new head of the nominally independent Federal Electoral Institute (IFE)
is Mr Arturo Nunez Jimenez, another long-time PRI member, who was
under-minister in the interior ministry until his job was given to Mr
Santiago.
The former head of the IFE, Mr Emilio Chuayffet, is now an advisor to the
interior minister and strongly tipped to be the next governor of the state
of Mexico.
With these moves, the government has turned away from putting independent
officials in charge of electoral organisations.
The president, no doubt remembering the divisions in the PRI caused by his
own selection as presidential candidate in 1987, appears determined to put
his own men in charge of the key organs for the party - interior ministry
and electoral institute.
However, the president has dropped the attorney-general, Mr Ignacio Morales
Lechuga, in favour of the human rights commission president, Mr Jorge
Carpizo. 'This sends a signal about the government's very clear decision to
end impunity both for government officials and criminals,' said a
presidential spokesman.'
The president also appointed his close friend and university colleague Mr
Emilio Lozoya to head the new energy ministry.
This extended the list of possible PRI presidential candidates to at least
five: Mr Lozoya, Mr Pedro Aspe, the aristocratic finance minister, Mr Manuel
Camacho, the populist mayor of Mexico City, Mr Donaldo Colosio, the
determined and pragmatic social development minister, and Mr Ernesto
Zedillo, the grey-seeming education minister.
All five worked under Mr Salinas when he was budget minister - another
indication of the president's almost total control of the political elite.
All five are in their 40s, share broadly the president's commitment to
economic reform, and went to graduate schools at US Ivy League universities.
Mr Camacho and Mr Aspe are widely believed to have lost ground by the recent
cabinet changes. The former is said to have hoped to leave Mexico City,
where his political fortunes have been falling as the city's pollution
levels have been rising. Also, his love of dialogue and conciliation is the
very attitude that seems out of favour in the interior ministry and the
presidency.
Mr Aspe is thought to have allied himself with Mr Gutierrez Barrios, so the
latter's departure from the interior ministry would have hurt the finance
minister, who was rash enough recently to declare publicly that rising
unemployment, falling investment, and declining wages were all 'myths'. This
led to a series of cartoons and articles depicting him as out of touch, and
indifferent to the poverty of most Mexicans.
All this sugggests that, although Mr Salinas has presided over impressive
cohesion among ministers for the past four years, the race to succeed him is
likely to lead to increasingly bitter in-fighting during the next year.

FT  28 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Brittan optimistic of early Gatt deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external economic affairs, said
yesterday that an early conclusion to the Uruguay Round of global trade
talks was both possible and 'vitally necessary'.
During a brief visit to Geneva, where he met Mr Arthur Dunkel,
director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and other
senior trade negotiators, Sir Leon told journalists he wanted to stress to
trading partners the Community's 'sense of urgency' in concluding the
six-year-old talks and his determination that they move 'into top gear'.
Although the US and EC failed in their attempt earlier this month to
conclude a last-minute deal on tariff cuts before the Bush administration
left office, Sir Leon said the time was not wasted and the outlines of a
deal on market access had become clear.
He believed it was possible to reach an overall Uruguay Round agreement
within the US 'fast-track' procedure and it was, therefore, 'vitally
necessary to do so'. However, this did not necessarily mean a completed deal
by March 2, when President Bill Clinton must notify Congress that he intends
to sign a Uruguay Round accord.
The administration's current 'fast-track' negotiating authority - enabling
it to present Congress with a trade agreement for approval or rejection
without amendment - expires at the end of May. The fear is that, if this
final deadline is missed, Congress will insist on new items, such as the
environment and worker rights, being put on the negotiating agenda.
Sir Leon, who will meet Mr Mickey Kantor, the new US trade representative,
for the first time on February 11, said the desire to put new areas on the
agenda 'should not be a pretext for failing to conclude the Round'.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Record exports by Brazil
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL registered record exports of Dollars 36.2bn (Pounds 23.8bn) last
year, notching up a trade surplus of Dollars 15.7bn - its third largest
ever.
Imports fell 2.3 per cent to Dollars 20.5bn - just 4.8 per cent of GDP,
despite a reduction in import tariffs.
Brazil's export success was due in large part to the competitivity of its
exchange rate, particularly in relation to neighbouring Argentina. Exports
to Argentina doubled from Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 3.07bn.
The main export successes were meat, paper and pulp, soyabeans, shoes and
textiles. Manufactured goods rose almost 13 per cent to Dollars 21.7bn, and
car exports were 125 per cent up.
Mr Jose Eduardo Andrade Vieira, commerce and industry minister, said that
the export target this year was Dollars 42bn, with the focus for expansion
on Asia. He pointed out that Brazil's total trade was still only 13 per cent
of GDP, below the average for Latin America.
Last year's trade performance was even more impressive than the record
Dollars 19.2bn surplus recorded in 1988 and the Dollars 16.1bn in 1989, in
that Brazil had only recently opened its markets to competition, the
minister added.
Reuter adds from Braslia: President Itamar Franco, who had cancelled a
February 16 meeting with economic aides, described as 'lies' a newspaper
report that Mr Paulo Haddad, economy minister, has prepared a plan including
measures against inflation, the state news agency reported.
Agencia Brasil, quoting Mr Francisco Baker, presidential spokesman, said the
meeting was called off because of speculation in financial markets and the
press about a new economic plan.

VENEZUELA'S top electoral body has called a new vote in two states, after
the ruling party's refusal to concede defeat in elections last month, Reuter
reports from Caracas.
Voters in Sucre and Barinas states will vote on March 14 to elect governors.
Opposition party victories there on December 6 have been contested by local
officials of the ruling Democratic Action party.
The supreme electoral council voted late on Tuesday to approve new polls,
'considering the grave political, social and economic situation' in the two
states.
The party - beset by rumours of new coup attempts brewing, and seeking to
regain support before presidential and congressional elections in December -
has shown concern at turmoil in the states.

<TEXT>
THE senior Latin American policy post at the US State Department seems
likely to go to Ms Sally Shelton Colby, following a bitter political dispute
between black and Cuban exile lobbies.
Ms Shelton Colby, a regional specialist who served in the Carter
administration, has emerged as the politically safe and qualified
alternative to Mr Mario Baeza, a black Cuban-American lawyer from New York
who was the first choice to be nominated as assistant secretary for Latin
American affairs. Mr Baeza fell foul of the Florida-based anti-Castro lobby,
led by Mr Jorge Mas Canosa, on the grounds that he might seek to negotiate
with President Fidel Castro rather than work for his overthrow.
Exception was taken to a visit to Havana by Mr Baeza last year, after which
he spoke of the desirability of ending the 30-year US trade embargo on Cuba.
Congressman Robert Toricelli, a New Jersey Democrat and author of the Cuban
Democracy Act which is in part designed to stop foreign subsidiaries of US
companies trading with Cuba, has been active in the campaign against Mr
Baeza.
However, black congressmen are infuriated by the decision to block his
nomination. Mr Baeza is a protege of Mr Ron Brown, now commerce secretary,
and of Mr Vernon Jordan, director of President Bill Clinton's transition
team. They have pointed out that Mr Mas Canosa was close to the Reagan and
Bush administrations.
Ms Shelton Colby has worked on Capitol Hill for Mr Lloyd Bentsen, now
treasury secretary, and in Mr Carter's State Department, eventually serving
as ambassador to Barbados and Grenada.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Daniel arap Moi yesterday suspended Kenya's first multi-party
parliament in 26 years. The announcement, in a news flash on state-run
radio, came after rowdy scenes inside and outside the House on Tuesday
marred the new parliament's first sitting since flawed elections last month.
Diplomats said the president, reported to be extremely upset by the
anti-government demonstration, was showing the opposition he still has
considerable executive power.
Opposition politicians immediately condemned the move, which they said
proved the president was incapable of making the adjustment from a one-party
state to a multi-party parliamentary democracy and would continue to misuse
his constitutional powers.
Officials said Mr Moi alone would announce a date for the official opening
of parliament; meanwhile, he wanted newly-elected members to return to their
constituencies to listen to the needs of the electorate.
A western diplomat said Mr Moi had been shaken by the protests, when
anti-riot police on horseback dispersed pro-opposition crowds who stoned the
cars of several ministers and blocked the road ahead of the president's
motorcade.
Inside the House, Mr Moi had his first taste of the cut-and-thrust of
parliamentary democracy as opposition MPs heckled members of the ruling
party Kanu and shouted down Mr Nicholas Biwott, the former cabinet minister
and presidential confidant.
'Mr Moi wants time to consider how he is going to deal with what is clearly
a difficult, new and unpleasant political situation for him,' the diplomat
said. Last month's elections returned 88 opposition MPs. Kanu won 95 seats,
with five still disputed.
President Moi has powers to appoint a further 12 members.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S military-led government hopes to finalise a medium-term economic
programme with international organisations to enable it to enter talks with
its creditors for debt reduction, Reuter reports from Abuja.
Mr Ernest Shonekan, head of Nigeria's new Transitional Council running
day-to-day government affairs, said yesterday in a budget address that
Nigeria needs to finalise the programme so it can press its creditors for
debt relief in 1993.
He said the medium-term strategy would complement policies under an existing
Structural Adjustment Programme.
The SAP, including financial deregulation, was started in 1986 to mend an
economy crippled by low productivity, mismanagement and lower world prices
for its main export, oil.
Though Mr Shonekan did not name the international bodies helping Nigeria
shape its new strategy, they are likely to include the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund.
Mr Shonekan said the three-year strategy aimed to resolve a range of
macro-economic issues such as inflation, budget deficit and the debt burden
between now and 1995.
It aims to achieve an average 5.3 per cent real annual growth of GDP, from
probably less than 4.5 per cent now. The programme will seek to push
inflation down to 5 per cent from 46 per cent at the end of 1992. It is also
geared towards reducing fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP from 12.4 per
cent in 1991 to 3.3 per cent in 1995, Mr Shonekan said.
Nigeria hopes the new programme, details of which were not made public, will
help it maintain a stable foreign exchange rate and achieve a viable
external balance.
Mr Shonekan said Nigeria's total foreign debt stock fell to Dollars 27.56bn
(Pounds 18.1bn) at the end of 1992 from Dollars 33.36bn a year earlier. The
improvement was due largely to debt restructuring deals with commercial
banks, which included a debt buy-back totalling Dollars 3.38bn, he said.
Despite the drop in the debt stock, Nigeria is still hard- pressed to meet
debt-servicing obligations. Mr Shonekan said it would need to spend Dollars
4.6bn naira to meet these in 1993.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW Zealand Reserve Bank yesterday said it was relaxing its monetary
policy after actively intervening earlier this month to support the New
Zealand dollar in defence of its anti-inflation targets.
The bank's governor, Dr Don Brash, said he was satisfied at 'the continued
consolidation' of the New Zealand exchange rate at current levels.
Yesterday, the dollar was trading at 53.8 NZ cents against a trade-weighted
index of main currencies, having traded at 53.5-53.8 recently. When the bank
intervened earlier this month it had fallen to 52.4.
The bank has been given total independence from the Finance Ministry in
handling monetary policy with the single objective of achieving 0-2 per cent
inflation. The bank acted when it believed the drop in the value of the
dollar endangered its inflation goal.
Yesterday the bank said it was cutting the discount margin at which it will
buy eligible Reserve Bank bills from 150 to 120 basis points. It said it was
increasing the settlement cash target from NZDollars 10m (Pounds 3.3m) to
NZDollars 15m. This is the first movement in the discount margin since the
cental bank first intervened.

JORDAN is hoping to secure up to Dollars 350m (Pounds 230m) from donor
countries meeting in Paris today to make up projected deficits in the
kingdom's balance of payments for 1933.
The aid, most likely to take the form of credits and sector-linked
protocols, is required to fulfil strictures set by the International
Monetary Fund as part of the economic adjustment programme for 1992-8.
The meeting, to be held under the auspices of the IMF and the World Bank, is
due to be attended by 24 donor countries including members of the EC and
Japan.
The Jordanian delegation, led by Finance Minister Basel Jardaneh and
Planning Minister Zayad Fareez, is said to be optimistic that the kingdom's
needs will be met.
The annual cost of servicing external debt of about Dollars 6.6bn is
estimated to be about Dollars 1.1m, 49 per cent of which is due to be paid
this year under the IMF programme, Mr Fahed Fanek, an economist, says. The
Finance Ministry says the request for Dollars 350m is required to meet this
payment in full.
Jordan boasts an impressive economic record since the adjustment programme
began.

chairman.
It will make recommendations to the governor's Executive Council on the
boundaries of 20 one-member constituencies in the Legislative Council, Hong
Kong's law-making body, for the 1995 elections. These members will be
returned by universal suffrage. The commission will be responsible for the

JORDAN is hoping to secure up to Dollars 350m (Pounds 230m) from donor

The aid, most likely to take the form of credits and sector-linked

Officials at the finance ministry say the request for Dollars 350m is
required to meet this payment in full.
Jordan boasts an impressive economic record since the adjustment programme
began.
With capital inflow in the form of aid from western countries and money
brought in by over 300,000 returnees evicted from Kuwait after the Gulf war,
the kingdom has boosted its foreign exchange reserves and local investment,
especially in the building sector.
Real gross domestic product growth for last year was about 11 per cent, and
the kingdom's foreign debt has been reduced substantially from the Dollars
8bn owed in 1991 due to repayment and buy-back transactions.
Jordan's gross domestic product for last year was Dollars 3.98bn. But
because of economic success, diplomats in Amman have expressed reservations
that Jordan's demands at the Paris talks will be met in full.
'Donors may not even need to offer the concessions the government hopes
for,' a western observer said. 'Jordan could be a victim of its own
success.'

FT  28 JAN 93 / ANC and Pretoria closer to power-sharing deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR and REUTER

   JOHANNESBURG, CAPE TOWN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE South African Government and the African National Congress appear to
have moved substantially closer to agreement on how power will be shared
between whites and blacks after apartheid, following five days of bilateral
negotiations.
The talks have raised hopes that an elected government of national unity
could be installed next year. But a number of obstacles will first have to
be overcome, including the need to agree on the decision-making process in
the new government.
Negotiators from the two sides, who met until Tuesday night, drew up
proposals calling for a power-sharing 'government of national unity' to
remain in place until roughly the end of the century, but calling on the
government to drop its insistence that compulsory power-sharing should be
written into a permanent constitution.
Leaders from the two sides, including the South African cabinet and the
ANC's policy-making national executive, must endorse the proposals before
they can be agreed. They must then be placed before a multi-party
negotiating forum, including parties such as the ANC's main rival, the
Inkatha Freedom party, and representatives of black homelands and the white
right. Government negotiators met Inkatha representatives yesterday, and
agreed to meet again next month.
But Mr Joe Slovo, one of the ANC's chief negotiators, made clear no smaller
parties would be allowed to prevent a final agreement. 'It is clear we
dearly want Inkatha to come into the process,' he said, 'but we cannot allow
it to have a veto over whether the process goes forward or not'.
If agreed, the government of national unity would be elected some time next
year, would draw up a new constitution, and then would remain in office for
a further four to five years under the new constitution.
Disagreement remains likely over how this government would take decisions.
The two sides negotiators have proposed that some decisions be taken by
consensus - implying that the white-dominated National party would have an
effective veto - but the two sides have yet to discuss which decisions would
require consensus.
The negotiators appear to have moved toward agreement on the structure of an
elected constitution-making body - their proposals call for a one-chamber
body, instead of the government's proposed bicameral assembly, but with
special powers for members elected on a regional list.
They have also moved closer to agreement on how the powers of regional and
local governments would be determined. The government had previously
insisted that such powers be agreed now, but it is now proposed that the
decision be delayed until a constituent assembly is convened.
The two sides also appear close to agreement on a procedure for replacing
the board of governors of the South African Broadcasting Corporation, long a
biased tool of the state, with more independent governors. The ANC and
government are due to meet to finalise the proposals next month.
Yesterday the government's chief negotiator met leaders of the Zulu-based
Inkatha Freedom party (IFP) to try to patch up relations after a row in
which the two sides traded charges of racism and incompetence, Reuter
reports from Cape Town. In talks between government negotiator Roelf Meyer
and the Inkatha delegation led by party chairman Frank Mdlalose both sides
appeared anxious to heal the rift that scuttled a two-day meeting last week.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Hindus triumphant in a quiet village in the north of India:
Co-existence hides a climate of fear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HINDUS and Moslems live cheek-by-jowl in Roshangarh village in northern
India, sharing the rich red earth, the well and the cart-track which leads
past piles of cow dung to the outside world.
Yet generations of co-existence in the village, about 60km north-east of New
Delhi, have not erased the invisible line separating the two communities.
The brightly-painted temple to Lord Shiva stands at one end of the village,
the white-washed mosque at the other.
The villagers have never been so acutely aware of their differences as in
the seven weeks since Hindu militants destroyed the mosque in Ayodhya. The
inter-religious riots which swept through many Indian cities passed
Roshangarh by. As in almost every other Indian village, there was no
violence. But there is tension in the air.
The Hindus are triumphant. 'We are very happy to see the (Ayodhya) mosque
pulled down; 464 years ago it was a Hindu temple and now it will be a temple
again,' says Rajendra Kumar, a 30-year-old farmer.
Mr Dharmendra Singh, a tough-talking 25-year-old, says: 'I want the Moslems
driven out of India. They have many countries. They can go to Pakistan.
Hindus only have India.' Other villagers say that at the very least Moslems
should be deprived of the vote. 'We want Hindu Raj (rule),' says Dharamveer,
the headman.
Almost without exception, the Hindu villagers support the Bharatiya Janata
party, the Hindu militant party whose supporters stormed the Ayodhya mosque.
Even their language is the language of the BJP, a tribute to the party's
formidable propaganda and organisational skills. Eleven villagers serve on
the local area BJP committee.
But the Hindu villagers are reluctant to apply their general condemnation of
Moslems to their Moslem neighbours. Roshangarh is a rich village with
electricity and piped water. The wealthier villagers have two-storey houses
which tower over the surrounding huts. They would lose much if Roshangarh
were ever consumed by violence.
The Hindus say no trouble has ever occurred in the village. Hindus and
Moslems still work together on village councils organising daily matters
such as repairing roads. 'Ayodhya will not change this. We will still talk
in the street. We will greet them at the time of festivals,' says an older
villager. Mr Singh, the young firebrand, disagrees. 'Things will change for
them when the BJP takes charge. They know it.'
The Moslem villagers are nervous and reluctant to talk openly, but their
38-year-old Imam, Mr Abdus Sattar, is not afraid to speak on their behalf.
The Moslem villagers are angry about the destruction of the mosque and
fearful about the possibility of BJP government. 'We believe the BJP is
anti-Moslem,' says Mr Sattar. 'We may lose our rights if they get to power.'
He is also anxious to avoid giving offence. He says there is no
trouble-making in the village, no arguments in the streets. Nothing. Moslems
and Hindus do not talk very much about religion. They never have done.
An old farmer adds: 'There's too much work in the fields for us to argue.'
But Mr Sattar is worried about the future: 'When the general atmosphere in
the country is poisoned, the poison eventually reaches into the villages.'

FT  28 JAN 93 / More bad news for Japanese manufacturers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE manufacturers' inventories of unsold products, as a proportion of
sales, are still rising despite a 6.1 per cent cut in industrial production
last year, official figures reveal.
The figures, published by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
yesterday, show industrial output last month was 1 per cent down from that
of November, and 8.2 per cent down on that of the equivalent month in 1991.
The fall in production was worse than officials had expected and suggests
further cuts in Japanese manufacturing output will be made before
inventories are reduced to levels allowing production to start growing
again.
Industrial production has been falling for 15 months, the longest run of
consecutive falls since the slump in output during the first oil price shock
between May 1974 and December 1975.
Manufacturers' inventories are rising as a proportion of their sales because
consumption has slumped, particularly of large costly items such as
furniture, cars and electronic household goods.
Miti's preliminary figures for December show shipments of goods from
factories fell 0.8 per cent, while the absolute level of inventories fell
0.6 per cent.
However, the ratio of inventories to sales rose by 0.4 per cent as
consumption fell away. Industrial output for last year as a whole fell by
6.1 per cent, shipments by 4.8 per cent and inventories by 0.9 per cent.
Last year, the inventory-to-sales ratio was up 9.5 per cent.
Miti expects output to rise 1.9 per cent this month and 2.3 per cent next,
despite a continuing fall in consumption.
Separate Miti figures published yesterday show sales of large retailers fell
5.7 per cent in December.

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SOBBING Hindu woman, searching for her children last night, walks past a
burnt Moslem shop in the old walled city of Delhi after clashes between
groups of Hindus and Moslems. At least one man was killed and five others
injured in the renewed outbreak of inter-religious violence, writes Stefan
Wagstyl in New Delhi.
The clashes demonstrated that tensions between Hindus and Moslems are still
running high in the wake of the destruction seven weeks ago of the mosque at
Ayodhya in northern India, which prompted riots across that part of the
country.
The trouble yesterday started when young Hindus stoned a small mosque in the
predominantly Moslem old quarter, and set alight nearby shops and homes.
Moslems fought back and the police opened fire.
The dead man, believed to be a Moslem, died of stab wounds, they said.
Police imposed curfews in the surrounding area and in other Moslem
districts, including north-east Delhi, where considerable violence occurred
last month.
Other parts of the city, including government and commercial centres, stayed
calm. Meanwhile, in Bombay, police were out in force in a suburb where two
people had been killed on Tuesday by police fire after Moslems stoned a
Hindu crowd.

FT  28 JAN 93 / NZ acts to relax monetary policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW Zealand Reserve Bank yesterday announced it was relaxing its
monetary policy after actively intervening earlier this month to support the
New Zealand dollar in defence of its anti-inflation targets.
The bank's governor, Dr Don Brash, said he was satisfied at 'the continued
consolidation' of the New Zealand exchange rate at current levels.
Yesterday, the dollar was trading at 53.8 NZ cents against a trade-weighted
index of main currencies, having traded at 53.5-53.8 recently. When the bank
intervened earlier this month it had fallen to 52.4.
The bank has been given total independence by act of parliament from the
Finance Ministry in the way it handles monetary policy with the single
objective of achieving 0-2 per cent inflation. The bank acted when it
believed the drop in the value of the dollar endangered its inflation goal.
Yesterday the bank announced it was cutting the discount margin at which it
will buy eligible Reserve Bank bills from 150 to 120 basis points. It said
it was increasing the settlement cash target from NZDollars 10m (Pounds
3.3m) to NZDollars 15m. This is the first movement in the discount margin
since the cental bank first intervened.
It is the third time the bank has acted to increase the settlement cash
target. Earlier this month, this was slashed from NZDollars 20m to zero and,
as the reserve bank said stability was returning to the market, it was
progressively lifted, first to NZDollars 5m, then to NZDollars 10.
Interest rates have gradually declined following a leap after the bank
intervened. On Friday, cash rates were quoted at 11 per cent, ahead of a
long holiday weekend, and at 8.45 per cent yesterday. Thirty-day bank bills
(9.55 per cent on Friday), were 8.35 per cent yesterday; 90-day bank bills,
(8.45 per cent last week), were quoted at 7.85 per cent yesterday.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Trade with China puts Mandalay on the road to riches: The
free-wheeling economic policy of Burma's junta has spawned a generation of
black marketeers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURMA is supposed to be poor and oppressed, but you would have trouble
believing it at the Dynasty. Recently opened on the roof of a concrete
office block, Rangoon's most fashionable restaurant and night-club is
seething with noisy revellers and new money.
Not content with spending the equivalent of a government minister's monthly
salary on an indifferent Chinese meal (the menu includes the delightful but
mysterious Hot and Sour Mutton Fighting Ball), the Dynasty's nouveaux riches
diners cheerfully flaunt their remaining banknotes and stuff them into the
hands of the gyrating female singers on stage.
Mandalay, 350 miles to the north, looks even richer. Imported Japanese cars
cruise the streets; shops are full of colour televisions, hi-fi systems,
fake Ray-Ban sunglasses from Thailand, fancy watches and torch-clock-radios;
the market stalls are groaning with toys and textiles from India and China.
Neighbouring China is the key to Burma's new veneer of affluence.
For the past four years the generals in the Burmese military junta known as
the State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc) have gradually freed the
economy from government control, tolerating the black market, liberalising
trade with China and giving free rein to the ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs
who dominate business in Burma as in the rest of south-east Asia. The Slorc
has also struck deals with the warlike tribes on the frontier.
The chief architect of Mandalay's free-wheeling economic policy is General
Tun Kyi, who until recently was the region's all-powerful military
commander. Even the fiercest opponents of military rule admire his
achievements. Mandalay, after all, has long been regarded more as a sleepy
repository of Burmese culture than as a business hub.
'Tun Kyi is the godfather of Mandalay,' says one Burmese businessman. 'If
the city needs an electric generator he has it imported from China and then
calls in the merchants and tells them to pay their share.' In return, of
course, the government turns a blind eye to the more dubious business
practices of the merchants. 'The point is, it works,' says the businessman.
The free trade boom has spawned a generation of flashy black marketeers;
they smoke imported 555 cigarettes and drink Changlee beer brewed in the
Chinese border province of Yunnan or Heineken shipped from Singapore; they
boast of their ability to buy police chiefs and immigration officers.
One such free trader explained how he exported gems and jade to China in
exchange for Chinese cassette players masquerading as Japanese brand-name
products. Mandalay, he declared with not a little hyperbole, 'will be like
Hong Kong in three years'.
At first glance it looks as though everyone is profiting from the boom. The
citizens of Mandalay say Gen Tun Kyi has repaired the market and beautified
the town; the Yunnanese have found a short and convenient trade route to the
sea, and China is investing in the repair and construction of Burmese roads
and bridges. The Burmese junta, isolated by the west because of its
miserable human rights record and its failure to release Ms Aung San Suu
Kyi, the detained opposition leader who won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, has
found a powerful friend in China. Chinese arms salesmen are among those who
frequent the bars of Rangoon.
But prosperity and the fragile peace on the border have come at a price.
Guerrillas of the Wa and Kokang hill tribes, who are closely related to the
Yunnanese over the Chinese border, have stopped fighting the Rangoon
government, but only on the understanding that they are allowed to carry
weapons and trade in opium from their strongholds in the Golden Triangle.
China is worried about the spread of heroin addiction on its territory,
while the inhabitants of central Burma are appalled by the boorish way in
which some of the Wa and the Kokang flaunt their money in restaurants and
nightclubs, and resentful of the increasing influence of China and the
prosperous ethnic Chinese business community.
Since a great fire in Mandalay a decade ago, the ethnic Chinese are said to
have bought up the entire town centre with the exception of one small hotel
and one shop, and traders say Chinese nationals are buying Burmese identity
cards at the border.
The Slorc, mindful of the Burmese nationalism to which it constantly pays
lip service, has recently sought to moderate the spread of Chinese influence
and to exert more control over the border trade. Gen Tun Kyi has been
recalled to Rangoon, ostensibly to become trade minister, but actually,
diplomats believe, because his military colleagues feared he was becoming
too powerful in his Mandalay fiefdom.
Gen Tun Kyi and his Chinese friends, however, seem to be holding their own.
Although he has been theoretically replaced as military commander of the
central region, he is still occasionally referred to as the commander by the
official press. And in the karaoke bars of Rangoon, they are singing songs
in Chinese.

FT  28 JAN 93 / 'The plan is perfect. But does anyone believe it?': As the
rouble plunges, Leyla Boulton assesses Russia's crisis package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE rouble's plunge to a record low on Tuesday, the day the government
published details of its anti-crisis programme, underlined the dilemma of
Russian economic reformers. The symptoms of crisis could not be clearer; the
government now has to show it can apply the impressive set of remedies it
has promised on paper.
The rouble's 15 per cent plunge to Rbs568 to the dollar was largely the
consequence of a loose monetary and credit policy for which both the
government and central bank share the blame. With inflation at 10 per cent a
week and the bank's discount rate at 80 per cent a year, banks and
enterprises scrambled to dump their roubles for dollars.
The package drawn up by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the new deputy prime minister for
economics and finance, includes detailed measures to fight inflation and
defend the rouble. It even revives an ambitious target, agreed with the IMF
but missed last December, to cut the budget deficit to 5 per cent of GDP by
the end of this year, compared to 15 per cent last month alone.
'The plan is so perfect that it could almost be agreed with the
International Monetary Fund as a standby programme tomorrow: the question
is, do we believe it?' asked one western diplomat, referring to a so-far
elusive IMF accord to underpin economic reforms.
Some of the package's detailed technical reforms, such as moving away from
inflationary credit emission by greater reliance on state borrowing to
finance the budget deficit, is already under way. The Finance Ministry is
due in March to issue its first short-term government paper.
The west is expected to help. Conclusion of a debt rescheduling agreement,
which would help relieve Russia's acute balance of payments problems, is
likely as soon as Russia can overcome Ukrainian resistance to Moscow's plan
to assume sole responsibility for the Dollars 80bn foreign debt. Mr Fyodorov
also intends to ask for the unblocking of a promised Dollars 6bn fund to
stabilise the rouble. Other measures, such as fighting the dollarisation of
the economy and capital flight, may prove difficult to deliver given the
lack of confidence in the authorities.
But the programme's key anti-inflationary strategy - reviewing subsidies to
inefficient enterprises and getting the central bank to restrict the growth
of money supply - can come about only if there is a consensus between the
government and the central bank.
Mr Fyodorov said yesterday he had reached a tentative agreement with the
central bank on the need to increase interest rates to the level needed to
fight inflation and to limit the distribution of credits to enterprises.
The central bank, which has often been unfairly blamed by a free-spending
government, is to present its proposals on credit policy in two weeks.
A senior bank official said he believed Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the bank
chairman, could strike a deal with the government 'as long as it was made to
look attractive politically' - referring to the free-spending parliament he
is answerable to.
But even as Mr Fyodorov was meeting central bankers, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin,
the prime minister, was promising lots of money for agriculture - a reminder
that the government must practise the restraint it preaches.
One expert forecast yesterday that no progress would be made until the
rouble hit the humiliating threshold of Rbs1,000 to the dollar. This in turn
would prompt either implementation of the plan's key tenets, or an attempt
to reimpose an old-style command economy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES of early and substantial cuts in German interest rates were dealt a
blow yesterday after two members of the Bundesbank's policy-making council
spoke out in defence of the central bank's hardline monetary policy.
Coming the day after Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, said that
excessive pay awards in eastern Germany would rule out early cuts in
interest rates, the comments from the presidents of the regional central
banks of Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg led to speculation that the
Bundesbank had launched a deliberate campaign to lower expectations of a
rate cut.
Mr Lothar Muller, president of the Landeszentralbank in Bayern, the Bavarian
regional central bank, said that he saw no reason why he could agree to a
cut in interest rates under present circumstances.
Speaking in Freiburg, Mr Guntram Palm, president of the regional central
bank for Baden-Wurttemberg, said he was worried about the calls from
government, unions and businessmen for a cut in rates. Such a cut would only
come when the fundamentals justified a cut, but the dangers for price
stability had not lessened, he warned.
The remarks of the two council members, together with those of Mr
Schlesinger the previous day, come at a highly sensitive time, as the
government is locked in negotiations over the budget and the 'solidarity'
pact and has yet to reach a deal on public sector pay claims. The private
sector meanwhile is negotiating with the powerful IG Metall union over pay
in the eastern part of Germany.
Economists said that the timing and the apparent co-ordination of the
remarks appeared designed to ensure that governments and unions did not take
a rate cut for granted as they entered into the final stages of the crucial
negotiations.
The comments also served to knock some of the euphoria out of the financial
markets, which have risen sharply this year in expectation of rate cuts by
late February or early March. Yesterday the DAX index of 30 shares fell back
13.84 points to 1,562.32 on fears that the rate cut would come later rather
than sooner.
The remarks are consistent with the Bundesbank's orthodox line that a cut in
the Lombard and discount rates, currently 9.5 and 8.25 per cent
respectively, can only come after inflation and money supply have been
brought under control. The key figures are January M3 money supply growth
and February inflation, both published next month.

Mr Mikhail Gurtovoi, head of the Russian government's anti-corruption
commission, yesterday apologised to Nizhnevartovskneftegas, one of the
biggest state-owned oil companies in the country, for accusing it of putting
aside 1.5m tonnes of oil for illicit sales, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow.
He said that the accusation was made to his commission by a group of
academics who had visited the region but that a subsequent investigation had
failed to prove the enterprise was guilty of any wrong-doing.
Mr Gurtovoi said yesterday that the commission had been disbanded by
President Boris Yeltsin, in a decree which would not be published. He said
he did not know why this had happened.
The accusation was reported in the Financial Times last August.

THE Slovak parliament yesterday failed to elect a president, in its second
attempt in two days to choose a head of state, and it will have to vote
again next month, writes Patrick Blum in Prague.
Mr Roman Kovac, the candidate of the ruling Movement for a Democratic
Slovakia (HZDS), received 78 votes, improving on the 69 votes he won in the
first round, but this was still short of the 90 votes needed in the 150
seats in parliament to win the presidency. His only other opponent, Mr Milan
Ftacnik of the Democratic Left Party, which groups the former communists,
received 31 votes. There were a number of abstentions, and eight invalid
votes.
The results are a blow to Mr Vladimir Meciar, the prime minister and HZDS
leader, who had strongly backed Mr Kovac. The next round of voting will take
place on February 15-16 with new candidates.
Meanwhile, the HZDS will hold discussions with other parties to find a
consensus candidate. This is expected to be Mr Michal Kovac, the former
chairman of the Federal Parliament of Czechoslovakia, who had been tipped as
a strong candidate for the presidency, or for a senior job in the government
or as governor of the Slovak central bank.

HOPES for rapid progress towards wage restraint in Germany suffered a

The construction workers in the IG Bau trade union are also demanding that
equalisation of wages between east and west German workers be brought
forward to April 1.
Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies, leader of the powerful public sector workers'
union, oTV, formally rejected any move to slow the process towards wage
equalisation for her members in the east. Negotiations for a new public
sector pay deal are due to restart next week, after two abortive rounds.
The eastern chemical industry workers rejected an attempt by employers to
negotiate a four-month pay freeze. They declared the negotiations formally
broken down and called for appointment of an arbitrator. The union is
demanding pay levels of 75 per cent instead of 60 per cent of the wages paid
to chemical workers in the west.
The German government and employers are campaigning for a slowdown in pay
demands, above all in the ailing east German economy, as part of the
solidarity pact being negotiated between the unions, the government,
opposition and industry. So far, there is little sign of progress on that
front.
The gloomy wage news coincided with conflicting signals in Bonn about the
solidarity pact talks themselves.
On the positive side, leaders of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union (CDU), the main party in the ruling coalition, agreed to
consider proposals for a new financing system for the massive labour market
subsidies being paid to east Germany.
That move could provide the key to a compromise in the talks, bogged down in
differences with the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) over cuts in
social spending and over how to share the burden of financing the east.
The CDU is clearly split, both on the question of how to finance
unemployment benefit, retraining costs and job creation schemes in the east,
and on how much money can be made available to subsidise the east German
Lander.
A five-hour meeting of the party leaders on Tuesday night agreed to look
again at both questions, raising hopes of a compromise with the SPD.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Krajina's Serbs demand Croat withdrawal within 24 hours

SERBS in Krajina, the disputed Serb enclave in Croatia, yesterday demanded
that Croatian forces withdraw within 24 hours from territory seized during
their six-day offensive.
The ultimatum was issued as the fighting took a new twist, with Serb forces
launching a counter-offensive. They later claimed to have seized strategic
villages around the Maslenica bridge, which joins central Croatia with its
southern Adriatic coast and which was the initial objective of the Croatian
forces.
In addition, the United Nations Protection Force disclosed last night 21 of
its number had been detained by the Serb rebels since Sunday in a hotel in
Benkovac, a Krajina town which has come under fire from Croatian troops.
Ms Shannon Boyd, an Unprofor official, said in the Croatian capital Zagreb:
'The Serb militias say the UN police have been restricted for their own
security. But this is totally unacceptable. There is no legitimate reason
for this.'
In New York, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, last night
accused the Croats of widening attacks against UN-monitored areas and said
these had jeopardised the entire peace process in the region.
Briefing the Security Council, he said Croatian troops were shelling new
targets and that their offensive had 'serious implications' for the future
of the 16,000 UN peace-keepers in Croatia, whose mandate comes up for
renewal in about three weeks.
The commander of UN forces in the former Yugoslavia, General Satish Nambiar,
yesterday met Serb leaders at Knin, the capital of Krajina. Mr Boro
Martinovic, a minister in the self-styled Krajina government, said: 'We told
him the Croats must withdraw beyond the ceasefire line by noon on Wednesday.
If not, we will have no choice but to clean the terrain by ourselves.'
Following the Security Council condemnation of the Croat offensive across UN
lines, President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia on Tuesday said he would only
order the withdrawal of Croat forces if the Serb militia returned their
heavy weapons to UN control. But hopes of a ceasefire yesterday faded amid
the Serbian counter-offensive.
In Geneva, where Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance are co-chairing peace talks on
the conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Moslem president
of Bosnia, yesterday threatened to abandon the talks. He cited continued
Serbian attacks on Moslems as the reason for the threat.
Mr Izetbegovic and Mr Mate Boban, Bosnia's Croat leader, announced a
cessation of hostilities between Croat and Moslem troops in Bosnia and vowed
to resurrect their alliance against the Serbs. But the International Red
Cross said intensified clashes between Croats and mainly Moslem Bosnian
forces around Busovaca, central Bosnia, had blocked the main humanitarian
aid routes into Bosnia.
Meanwhile, a British naval task force headed by the aircraft carrier Ark
Royal is now in position in the Adriatic.
The task force is carrying reinforcements for the 2,400 British troops
helping to protect UN aid convoys in Bosnia.

<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the main party in
the Germany's ruling coalition, is considering a new system to finance the
soaring cost of unemployment and retraining in east Germany, to spread the
burden of paying for unification.
The move could provide the key to a compromise with the opposition Social
Democrats (SPD) and trade unions over Mr Kohl's planned 'solidarity pact',
currently bogged down in differences over where to cut government spending,
and how to share the financial burden.
Prospects for an early conclusion to the negotiations over the pact worsened
yesterday, when the CDU admitted to continuing divisions within its own
ranks and postponed its next meeting to February 9, and the SPD tabled tough
conditions for any new round of talks.
At the same time there was gloomy news on the wages front, with German
construction workers tabling a pay demand for 6.9 per cent, and immediate
wage equalisation for workers in east Germany - a move in complete
contradiction to the wage restraint Chancellor Kohl is calling for in the
solidarity pact.
Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies, the leader of the public sector workers' union,
oTV, also rejected any move to slow down the pace of wage rises in east
Germany, in spite of evidence from many parts of industry that high eastern
wages are undermining investment plans.
In spite of the bad news, the latest indication of compromise from Mr Kohl's
party provides confirmation that the negotiations for the pact are still on
track, even if delayed. The Chancellor announced that he intended to be
ready to present legislation to his cabinet on February 17, to put the pact
into effect.
The move within the CDU is to consider a switch in financing of the Federal
Labour Office programmes in east Germany, which bear the brunt of western
subsidies for unemployment, job creation schemes and retraining, from
national insurance contributions to some form of direct tax ation.
That is precisely the area in which the SPD is demanding greater 'social
justice' in paying for the recovery of east Germany. The opposition wants to
levy a special tax on the better paid, primarily to pay for labour market
subsidies.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Polish coalition under fire despite signs of recovery: The
IMF conditions are spurring unrest after three years of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND'S coalition government, led by Ms Hanna Suchocka, the prime minister,
is facing a parliamentary challenge to its stringent, IMF-approved budget
policies just as the Polish economy is showing signs of recovery after three
years of reform-induced recession.
Last year, for the first time since 1988, industrial production grew by 3.5
per cent. Were it not for a drought-reduced harvest the Gross Domestic
Product would also have registered a gain.
The bad news is that parliamentary opposition is holding up the government's
effort to push through a 1993 draft budget which sets a ceiling of 5 per
cent of GDP on the public sector deficit.
Successive votes on public sector pay, housing and VAT rates have already
added 16,000bn zloty (Pounds 653m) to the proposed 81,000bn zloty deficit
target. The gap could widen further as deputies, eyes fixed firmly on future
election prospects, seek to cut personal income tax rates and minimalise the
government's planned pension savings.
The stakes are high, as the government is tied to its deficit target by a
letter of intent linked to a Dollars 660m (Pounds 426m) IMF standby loan.
Securing the loan is required to trigger a further 20 per cut in Poland's
Dollars 31.7bn official debt to western governments after an initial 30 per
cent reduction in 1991.
Failure to keep spending within agreed limits would require new
negotiations, delaying both the official debt reduction process and talks on
Poland's Dollars 13.3bn commercial bank debt with Mr Krzystof Krowacki,
Poland's newly appointed debt negotiator.
Talks were stalled for 18 months after the sacking of Mr Janusz Sawicki over
a scandal involving illegal secondary-market Polish debt sales.
Given these high stakes the government is considering two contingency plans.
One is to demand a vote of confidence to force the disparate parliamentary
opposition to approve the budget as originally drafted. The risk is that
such a gamble could fail, leading to the fall of a government which appears
to have no obvious successor, apart from President Lech Walesa, who
periodically repeats that he is ready to take on reponsibility for direct
government should he be called on.
The second course would be to accept a higher deficit and then raise new
revenues using new decree powers, backed by the president, which the
government has prepared but parliament still has to approve.
Ms Suchocka, a 46-year-old former law professor from Poznan, has already
surprised observers by her success in holding together a seven-party
coalition ranging from free-market liberals to right-wing nationalists and
her own group, the moderate Democratic Union.
Her nerve has already held through two big strikes, that of car workers last
summer and the recent strike by 300,000 miners, and the government is
sensitive to the need to involve workers and unions in the difficult
decisions facing it.
Worker unrest has been spurred by growing income differences, rising
unemployment and a 4 per cent fall in average real wages last year. But
lower wage costs helped Polish enterprises to raise exports to western
markets and restrained the growth in imports.
Export-led growth in turn helped to slow the rise in unemployment, which
nevertheless climbed to over 2.5m by the end of the year.
The government's response to shop floor unease has been to propose an
'Enterprise Pact' with the unions.
This policy seeks to involve workers in the privatisation process and
guarantees some worker participation in management, even in the private
sector.
One of the aims of the pact is to ease wage controls and the tax burden on
state-owned enterprises and shift broad economic strategy decisions to a
national tripartite commission representing unions, employers and the
government.
It remains to be seen whether the pact will convince public opinion, which
remains sceptical, especially among the unemployed and those, mainly with
jobs in the public sector, whose incomes have fallen.
President Walesa, who retains his instinctive feeling for the popular mood,
has warned that the country could experience an 'economic August', a
reference to the mass strikes of August 1980 which gave rise to the
Solidarity movement.
The economic achievements of the last year however appear to belie such
pessimism. Inflation dropped to 43 per cent last year from 60 per cent in
1991, productivity has risen by 12 per cent, and Poland registered a Dollars
734m trade surplus over the first 11 months.
However, enterprise profitability remains low, capital spending has yet to
recover and public sector industries remain deeply in debt.
The biggest surprise is that rapid growth in the private sector has been
accompanied by improved efficiency among the remaining 8,000 state-owned
enterprises.
This combination has led the World Bank to conclude that economic
improvement has 'a solid microeconomic foundation and will be sustained'
despite the relatively slow rate of foreign investment and delayed sales of
state-sector enterprises.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Scientists launch new Aids appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST ambitious effort so far to raise funds for fighting Aids will be
launched in Paris today.
Professor Luc Montagnier, Europe's best-known researcher into the disease,
and Dr Federico Mayor, director-general of Unesco, are seeking hundreds of
millions of dollars for their new World Foundation for Research and
Prevention of Aids.
The foundation, based at Unesco headquarters in Paris, hopes to raise money
from both private and public sources to 'intensify the global struggle
against Aids'.
Prof Montagnier, its president, is looking for donations, such as the FFr1m
(Pounds 118,000) 'seed money' given by a group of Italian banks, and for
investments from companies looking to make a long-term financial return from
collaborative research with the foundation.
He also hopes to work with the new US administration, which has undertaken
to increase spending on Aids.
The foundation will set up three new centres - one in France, one in the US
and one in Africa - where its scientists can follow the progress of people
who are infected with HIV but who do not yet show any symptoms of Aids.
One aim is to develop rapid clinical tests that could evaluate the
effectiveness of new drugs more quickly than those available today.
Establishing the three clinical centres and running them for five years
would cost an estimated FFr930m. In addition, the foundation plans to
sponsor more basic research, for example into co-factors - other viruses and
bacteria which act together with HIV to cause Aids.
Prof Montagnier's own laboratory in the Institut Pasteur in Paris is working
intensively on research into co-factors.
The first project in the foundation's programme of social work is to provide
education for Ugandan orphans whose parents have died of Aids, at an
estimated cost of FFr5m.
Prof Montagnier says he looks forward to working more closely with Aids
researchers in the US - including Dr Robert Gallo of the National Cancer
Institute.
The two scientists were officially credited with discovering HIV jointly in
1984, but a US government inquiry found Dr Gallo guilty early this month of
misconduct in his research.
'It's time to leave all that behind us,' Prof Montagnier said. 'It has given
the public a bad image of Aids research.'

FT  28 JAN 93 / Romania not to use force against Serb ships
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Romania yesterday said it would not use force against four Serbian ships
travelling on the Danube towards Belgrade despite US calls on Romania and
Bulgaria to prevent the vessels from breaking United Nations sanctions,
writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest.
The Romanian Foreign Ministry said it feared that the use of force against
the ships, believed to be carrying more than 40,000 tonnes of oil, could
lead to an 'ecological disaster'.
Earlier this week a Serbian ship, also carrying oil, was allowed to pass
into Serbian waters after its captain threatened to blow up the vessel or
discharge its cargo into the Danube rather than surrender. The Danube delta
in north east Romania is home to thousands of rare birds and other
endangered species.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Sterling fall puts renewed pressure on punt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING came under renewed selling pressure against the D-Mark and the
dollar yesterday as the government's 1 percentage point cut in base rates
continued to undermine the confidence of investors in the British currency.
The pound fell more than 4 pfennigs in intra-day trading, bottoming out at
DM2.388, amid strong selling from bank dealers, overseas companies and
institutional investors.
The base rate cut from 7 per cent to 6 per cent and sterling's subsequent
fall triggered fresh tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism,
pushing the punt below its floor against two ERM currencies.
There was a strong belief in the foreign exchange market that sterling's
fall had left the punt heavily overvalued against the pound, undermining
Ireland's trading position with the UK.
Ireland's central bank once again responded to the speculative attack on its
currency by raising its overnight lending rate to 100 per cent, only two
days after it had reduced the rate by one percentage point to 14 per cent.
On the Dublin interbank market, one month interest rates doubled to around
35 per cent.
The moves failed to lift the punt above its floors against the Belgian franc
and Dutch guilder after official ERM trading closed at 4 pm in London.
Sterling closed in London at DM2.3975, down nearly 3 pfennigs on the day,
and more than 11 pfennigs below the level at which it was trading three
weeks ago. Against the dollar, it closed down nearly 2 1/2 cents at Dollars
1.538. In New York it closed at DM2.3965 and at Dollars 1.5105.
There was a more modest deterioration in sterling's trade weighted index,
which measures the pound against a basket of currencies and which Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, has said he monitors closely. The index fell from
78.9 to 78.6.
The values of sterling and the punt were undermined by a growing perception
in markets that the Bundesbank may ease its short-term rates more slowly
than had been anticipated earlier this year.
Mr Lothar Muller, a member of the Bundesbank council, said conditions were
not right for another cut in German interest rates.
Uncertainty about the direction of German rates also undermined the lira,
which in London fell sharply against the D-Mark from L919.75 to L933. In
late New York dealing it was trading around L936 against the D-Mark.
The Irish government said it was determined to continue defending the punt.
However, the renewed pressure after more than a week of an easing of
tensions within the ERM is rapidly eroding the political consensus the
government had succeeded in creating last September in defending the
currency.
The Irish Farmers' Association is to hold an emergency meeting of its
national executive on Monday to discuss the crisis, which it says has badly
affected Irish food exports into the UK market.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Vickers in first export deal for new Challenger battle tank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VICKERS, the British engineering group, has won its first export order for
the new Challenger 2 battle tank with a contract from Oman expected to be
worth about Pounds 200m.
An initial deal for about 20 tanks is expected to be announced shortly and
to be followed by a further order for a similar number. Vickers yesterday
declined to confirm or deny the order.
The deal will mark a breakthrough for the company after a series of setbacks
on the export market. However, it will not be enough to bring more than
temporary relief to its tank manufacturing division.
One of its two tank production lines in Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne faces
closure unless the company secures a larger export order or work from the
British Ministry of Defence on upgrading the army's current-generation
Challenger 1 tanks.
Each of the two sister plants employs about 800 people. In the absence of
any new order, a closure decision had been expected by the end of this year.
Vickers won a Pounds 500m contract from the MoD in 1991 to supply about 140
Challenger 2s, after a long and bitter contest against rival US and German
tanks. The UK order, sharply reduced from earlier plans, was decided partly
on the strength of the export prospects that hung on it.
The company suffered a heavy blow in October when Kuwait opted for the M1A2
Abrams, made by General Dynamics of the US, in preference to the Challenger
2 for a 236-tank deal worth about Pounds 1bn including spares and support.
Vickers accused the Bush administration of using political leverage to
secure the order in the run up to the US presidential election.
Earlier last year, it was excluded from another Pounds 1bn contest in Sweden
against the M1A2, Germany's Krauss-Maffei Leopard 2 and the new French
Leclerc tank.
Vickers had been unable to obtain a Challenger 2 prototype from the British
army for trials in Sweden without breaking its UK government contract.
Oman, which already has British Chieftain tanks, was considered the most
reliable of Vickers' overseas prospects. The tanks are expected to enter
service around 1995.
Vickers is also competing for orders in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi
Arabia involving a total of more than 600 tanks. However, in the UAE
contest, expected to be for 390 tanks, the Challenger 2 is considered to be
running third behind the Leclerc and the M1A2.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Krajina's Serbs demand withdrawal by Croat forces
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Serb gunners take a rest during a lull in fighting 25 miles west of Knin,
capital of the disputed enclave of Krajina, which has been subjected to a
six-day Croatian offensive. The Serbians yesterday launched a counterattack
and issued an ultimatum demanding Croat withdrawal within 24 hours from all
territory seized since the recent resumption of fighting. Serb forces later
claimed to have seized strategic villages around the Maslenica bridge, which
is the link between central Croatia and its southern Adriatic coast and
which was the initial objective of the Croatian forces. Late yesterday the
United Nations Security Council demanded an immediate halt to the Croat
offensive into areas protected by the UN and also warned of further
unspecified action.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Council employee wins Pounds 15,000 over passive smoking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COUNCIL employee has won Pounds 15,000 compensation for the alleged
effects of passive smoking at work, in what is believed to be the first such
case in the UK.
As an out of court settlement, the case does not set a legal precedent, but
Action on Smoking and Health, the anti-smoking campaign, said there would be
a flood of similar claims from passive smoking victims.
Nalgo, the white-collar local government union, which backed the worker's
case, said the award should be 'a warning shot across the bows to all
employers who ignore the risks of smoking to non-smokers'.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, yesterday reiterated that the
government would consider legislation to outlaw smoking in public places and
at work if voluntary bans did not succeed.
The government's aim is for 80 per cent of public places to be smoke-free by
1994, with smoking banned for most employees by the year after.
Ms Veronica Bland, a 36-year-old non-smoker, who still works for Stockport
Metropolitan Borough Council, claims that between July 1988 and September
1989 she worked close to seven employees who smoked continually. She
estimates that she inhaled smoke from at least 150 cigarettes each working
day.
Ms Bland developed chronic bronchitis and alleges that, until the council
introduced a no-smoking policy in 1990, she suffered from persistent coughs,
sore throats, catarrh and eye irritations. She also says her singing voice -
she is a member of a choir - has deteriorated.
Stockport said yesterday that the settlement of Ms Bland's claim by the
council's insurers was made without any admission of liability. It added
that the council was one of the first local authorities in the country to
implement a scheme which establishes employees' right to work in smoke-free
offices.
The Association of British Insurers said the settlement was 'in no way a
precedent'. There was nothing legally or morally binding about it and there
would be 'no softening of the position of the insurance industry in fighting
this sort of case'.
Stockport's insurers had decided it was less costly to settle with Ms Bland
than investigate and pursue the case in court, said the ABI. The industry
was still waiting for a suitable test case.
Mr John Cridland, Confederation of British Industry director of
environmental affairs, said Ms Bland's case would 'certainly strengthen the
trend' towards smoke-free working environments. However, he said he did not
think the award was a 'huge step in itself' because it was a voluntary
out-of-court settlement.
Emphasising that the CBI did not favour a legal obligation for employers to
ban smoking, Mr Cridland added that 'many employers, certainly those who
care, as most do, about having a healthy and motivated workforce, are
already well down the road to voluntary policies'.

FT  28 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Smith figures disappoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POOR figures from WH Smith reverberated through several stocks, with those
with DIY interests particularly hit. Smith revealed a decline in profits to
Pounds 40.2m from Pounds 50.1m, blaming one-off items and tough conditions
at its Do It All subsidiary. However, analysts expressed concern at the
decline in margins and disappointment at the tone of the post-results
meeting.
In particular, Smith's management was said to be uncommunicative regarding
the DIY business, although an analysts' visit next week is intended to set
out future strategy. However, unconfirmed reports yesterday that Texas Home
Care, the Ladbroke subsidiary, had begun discounting heavily at some of its
Scottish stores appeared not to bode well for the sector.
Profits downgrades for Smith followed, with the ranges falling from Pounds
108m-Pounds 118m down to Pounds 100m-Pounds 110m for this year, and to
Pounds 110m-Pounds 125m for next year. In the short term, analysts foresee
further weakness in the stock, particularly, if as widely expected, the
chancellor imposes VAT on books in the Budget. WH Smith 'A' shares retreated
15 to 440p.
Shares in Boots, which co-owns Do It All, suffered on the results,
relinquishing 8 to 517p. One house was also telling clients that Boots was
weaker ahead of a review next month by the US Food and Drug Administration
of ICI's Zestril heart drug. It was suggested this would affect Boots'
Manoplax drug. ICI put on 3 at 1138p.
Other DIY groups to suffer yesterday included Kingfisher, off 9 at 550p, and
Ladbroke, 1 1/2 easier at 201p. Bearish sentiment over Smith's Our Price
music business hit Thorn EMI, down 15 at 818p.
CU rights talk
There was renewed speculation around the market that a substantial rights
issue from the composite insurance sector is imminent. Yesterday it was the
turn of Commercial Union to attract the rights issue rumours, as talk of a
possible cash call from Royal Insurance tended to die down.
CU dropped 19 to 614p as the rumours circulated in the market that the group
might ask its shareholders for around Pounds 400m. And dealers noted a sharp
increase in turnover in CU stock as the session wore on, with an
above-average 3.4m shares changing hands by the close.
Specialists said a cash-raising exercise by CU was credible and the company
could take advantage of the recent strength of the shares, which raced up to
a record high of 636p earlier this month.
The strength in the shares reflected the group's extremely small exposure to
the domestic mortgage indemnity business, which has wreaked havoc among
other insurance groups, such as Royal and Sun Alliance, and limited exposure
to the beleaguered UK property market.
Argyll better
The climb in Argyll Group shares continued as two brokers turned positive on
the stock, which has generally missed out on the surge by the other high
street food retailers.
BZW moved from a hold to a buy, citing the stock's underperformance which
against the sector was around 6 per cent before yesterday's rise. Nomura
upgraded, adding Pounds 2.5m to forecast Pounds 422.5m for this year and
looking for Pounds 472.5m for next year. The shares firmed 5 to 403p.
SmithKline Beecham 'A' fell 10 to 491p and the Units declined 8 to 429p in
the wake of selling in New York the previous night. The stock was further
affected in London as switching out of defensives into cyclicals gathered
momentum, following Tuesday's one percentage point cut in UK interest rates.
Analysts said continuing worries about the impact of the Clinton
administration on health spending had unsettled the stock. Wellcome, also
under pressure, fell 14 to 903p.
Glaxo, which failed to benefit from Tuesday's market rise, caught up
yesterday. In spite of uncertainties over the possibility of a move into the
over-the-counter market, the shares put on 6 at 688p. There was additional
support from news that Glaxo's anti-asthma drug Serevent is to be reviewed
by the US Food and Drug Administration on February 26.
Merchant bank Kleinwort Benson forged ahead 18 to 350p, reflecting the
continuing high level of stock market activity and hopes of increased
corporate finance business via rights issues and takeovers.
Berkeley, the housebuilder which recently bought and sold a small stake in
fellow construction group Higgs &amp; Hill, pocketing a substantial profit in
the process, moved up 13 to 341p as Soros Fund Management was revealed as
having taken a 3.19 per cent stake in the company. Persimmon added 7 at 215p
ahead of a presentation at BZW.
A number of brokers highlighted Northern Foods' floating debt as a
beneficiary of low interest rates. The shares rose 4 to 275p.
Shares in Smiths Industries came under pressure and at the day's worst were
down 16p after several brokers, including Hoare Govett, downgraded profits
expectations in the wake of production cuts at customer Boeing that were
announced on Tuesday. The shares later picked up to close 8 lighter on the
day at 351p.
The production cuts at Boeing also hurt TI, which fell 8 to 285p, as
Tuesday's profits downgrading from the company's broker SG Warburg finally
took effect.
Profit-taking and caution from Charterhouse Tilney in its aerospace and
defence review saw British Aerospace retreat 6 before recovering to close a
net penny off at 227p, but a recommendation of Westland in the same
publication helped the shares rise 5 to 138p. Siebe improved 6 to 451p as it
held presentations in the City.
Speculation about improved car sales helped Lex Service advance 6 to 300p.
Yield buyers were seen in Tiphook, which appreciated 20 to 359p. Further
profit-taking left NFC 4 cheaper at 270p.
The improved outlook for the construction sector gave a boost to English
China Clays, 7 firmer at 472p.
News and information organisation Reuters Holdings climbed 18 to 1366p
following the launch of a UK equities service to compete with the London
Stock Exchange's product, Topic.
Concern that a 17.5 per cent VAT charge would be imposed on publishers
faded. Kleinwort Benson argued that the charge would be only 5 per cent,
thus bringing it in line with other EC countries. United Newspapers rose 13
to 528p, Telegraph picked up 5 to 454p and Reed International put on 5 at
659p.
USM-quoted Southnews jumped 13 to 123p as a result of a mention in a
specialist tipsheet.
Public relations firm Shandwick added 2 at 23p following results on Tuesday.
SG Warburg argued in an internal note that, on a prospective rating of 7.5
times earnings, the shares were fairly valued at about 33p.
Allied Textile rose 8 to 453p on half-year results slightly above market
expectations.
BT was among the best performing FT-SE 100 stocks, with the fully-paid
shares moving forward 7 1/2 to 406 1/2 p and the partly-paid 7 1/2 to 301
1/2 p after Hoare Govett upgraded its recommendation from 'undervalued' to
'buy'. Mr James Ross, Hoare's telecoms analyst, enthused over a new discount
calling programme, which he said could be introduced by BT later this year.
The recent series of downgrades continued to depress Cable and Wireless
shares, which finished 14 weaker at 712p, also affected by switch-ing to BT.
Graseby, the electronics and precision instruments group, jumped 14 to 152p.
The market is now confident that the company will maintain the dividend when
it announces its 1992 results, expected on Budget Day.
A Pounds 17.5m rights issue initially dented the Volex share price, which
fell to 395p before staging a strong rally and closing a net 26 ahead at
440p.

FT  28 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFIT-TAKING, talk of a large rights issue and a poor gilts auction all
combined to force a retreat in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
The March contract on the FT-SE 100 opened strongly at 2,863, just ahead of
Tuesday's strong close, and early good buying sent it climbing to 2,870 by
mid-morning, at which point the contract was trading at a healthy premium of
about 30 points.
However, profit-taking and disappointment with the gilts auction led to a
reversal in the fortunes of March, and it drifted lower for the next few
hours.
The afternoon saw further falls in the contract which were brought about by
speculation of a big rights issue and the tentative opening on Wall Street.
March closed at 2,854, down 6 from its previous close but around 15 points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 9. Turnover,
although less than Tuesday's heavy figure, was healthy at 11,996 contracts.
Volume in the traded options was once again high, reaching 51,746 lots, with
a large part of the total attributed to the expiry of several of the January
stock options.
The FT-SE 100 option was busy at 15,255 contracts, as was the Euro-FT-SE 100
option at 3,137. Asda was the most actively dealt stock option with 2,448
lots. It was followed by British Gas at 2,279. BP and Hanson were also busy.

FT  28 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-takers busy in the Footsie
list
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON stock market tried yesterday to extend the gains prompted by
Tuesday's base rate cut, but was driven off course by the cool response to
the Pounds 2.5bn auction in government bonds, where several leading houses
had suffered substantial losses in the previous session. Profit-takers held
the upper hand by the close.
An early gain of 18.2, reflecting suggestions that a further reduction in
base rates might be incorporated in the March Budget, took the FT-SE 100
Index to within eight points of its all-time high. Then weakness in sterling
cast a cloud over interest rate optimism. Share prices began to sag and the
market was below overnight levels throughout the second half of the session.
The final reading put the FT-SE 100 at 2,832.5, down 3.2, with rights issue
rumours overshadowing sentiment.
Second-line stocks took up some of the slack as investors sought out shares
overlooked in the market's strong advance following the reduction of base
rates to 6 per cent.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, in direct contrast to the FT-SE 100, rose steadily
to close 12.9 higher at 2,964.5. Non-Footsie stocks also increased their
contribution to the day's business, providing around 56 per cent of the
session's Seaq volume total of 753.4m shares.
The full impact of Tuesday's unexpected cut in base rates was confirmed by a
total of Pounds 1.72bn in retail business in equities on that day's Seaq
volume figure of 861.7m shares. Leading securities houses are believed to
have suffered losses in equities, having trimmed positions sharply on Monday
in order to open short positions in government bonds ahead of yesterday's
auction.
These trading losses at marketmaking firms helped to subdue the equity
market yesterday. Estimates of trad-ing losses in the gilt-edged market
range from Pounds 15m towards Pounds 25m.
However, investors were still prepared to buy stocks likely to benefit from
the base rate cut. Once again, the building materials, construction and
contracting sectors found buyers. Banks were weakened by profit-taking,
however, and rights issue rumours fell heavily across the insurance sector.
Store and retail shares also gave ground as the continued uncertainty over
Christmas sales was fuelled by disappointment with the trading results from
WH Smith. More convincing confirmation of a recovery in UK retail sales is
still regarded as a necessary basis for a second leg of the bull run in the
equity market which began when sterling left the European exchange rate
mechanism in September.
Rights issue rumours strengthened towards the close of trading, when several
old market targets were hoisted above the parapet again. While traders
refused to be stampeded yesterday, there was general agreement that rights
issues are more likely to be brought forward now that the predicted base
rate cut is out in the open.
Equity strategists are now increasingly bullish. Mr Nicholas Knight, the
arch bull at Nomura Research Institute Europe, referred to 'Golden Tuesday',
stressing that the significance of the latest one point cut in base rates
cannot be overstated. Unlike some analysts, Mr Knight refuses to be alarmed
by the ratings of 17 times historic earnings now ruling in the stock market.

FT  28 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US markets weaker in subdued
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices weakened, with secondary stocks taking an especially big
beating as investors booked some of the profits earned in the recent rally,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 7.56 down at 3,291.39. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 1.84 to 438.11, while the Nasdaq
composite, hard hit by profit-taking, closed 9.26 lower at 697.90. Trading
volume on the New York SE amounted to 277.5m shares.
Equities posted big advances on Monday and early Tuesday, but the recent
surge of buying seems to have petered out, leaving investors to consolidate
their gains and search for a fresh incentive to buy stocks.
Hopes that the Clinton administration would take firm action to tackle the
budget deficit were behind the rise in prices earlier this week, but those
hopes were beginning to dwindle yesterday as the new president got into his
first fight with Congress (over allowing gays in the military).
The market is worried that if relations between the White House and Capitol
Hill sour early, the chances of President Clinton pushing through
deficit-cutting measures will be reduced.
Pessimism about the political situation depressed prices, and prevented the
market from riding the coattails of a rally in US Treasury bonds. The
appearance of Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, before the
Congressional joint economic committee, had little effect on the market. Mr
Greenspan said growth was moving at a firmer pace but that the economy still
faced 'headwinds'.
American Express fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 23 in volume of 4.6m shares as
investors continued to register their dissatisfaction at the decision of Mr
James Robinson to stay on as chairman of the group, and to take over the
running of Shearson Lehman, the brokerage subsidiary.
Westinghouse Electric firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 14 in volume of 1.5m
shares on news that Mr Paul Lego, the troubled company's chairman and chief
executive, is retiring.
General Dynamics rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 115 after the defence
contractor posted fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 174m, up from Dollars
129m a year ago.
Union Carbide firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 17 after the company reported
fourth-quarter earnings of 12 cents a share, an improvement on the 49 cents
a share loss recorded in the same period a year earlier. The figures were in
line with analysts' forecasts.
On the Nasdaq market, profit-taking after recent big gains took its toll,
especially of leading issues. Intel fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 112 5/8 ,
Amgen Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 60, Microsoft Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 86 1/4
and Sun Microsystems Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 38 1/2 .
Pyramid Technology was in strong form, advancing Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 15
in busy trading after revealing fiscal first-quarter profits of 4 cents a
share, a turnround from the Dollars 1.56 a share loss reported a year ago.
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed with a slightly easier bias after active trading. The
TSE 300 index lost 1.2 at 3,311.6 and declines led rises by 312 to 290 after
volume of 42.7m shares.
The 14 stock groups were evenly divided between winners and losers, with
financial services down 1.49 per cent.
Royal Lepage dropped CDollars 1 1/2 to CDollars 3.50. The company reported
increased fourth-quarter losses and said it would omit the quarterly
dividend on common shares normally paid in February.

FT  28 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Ireland obsessed by currency issues -
Speculation on a devaluation of the punt has been moving equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Having suffered a gloomy 1992, the ISEQ overall index falling by 11 per
cent, the Irish equity market faces a deepening recession this year,
overshadowed by the ongoing currency crisis, high interest rates and the
prospect of a sharp increase in unemployment.
Bearish forecasts for the market currently outnumber the bulls; but all
hinges upon whether one views the government's current no-devaluation policy
as the one most likely to bring down interest rates in the short term, and
whether sterling will strengthen to take the pressure off the punt. This, in
turn, depends upon one's views of the UK and German economies for the year
ahead.
After sterling abandoned the European exchange rate mechanism last
September, the punt came under heavy pressure, forcing up interest rates and
exhausting the government's currency reserves.
The Irish stock market fell to its 1992 low of 1,095 in October. In
November, following the realignments of the peseta and escudo, equities
rallied on the expectations of an imminent devaluation of the punt, the
index gaining 18.5 per cent and closing the year at 1,227.
The government, however, held its nerve, pushing interest rates still higher
to maintain the punt's parity within the ERM, and the speculators lost
theirs - until they came back in force yesterday. The ISEQ, having wavered
around 1,220 for some time, got excited again yesterday and rose 31.21 to
1,264.33.
After four months of querulous support for its policies, the government now
faces a rising howl of protests from farmers and business leaders and a
growing pile of reports from economists, who are saying that the economic
costs of defending the punt in terms of ruined businesses and lost jobs are
not worth paying. This week, Mr John Bruton, the leader of the parliamentary
opposition, nailed his flag to the devaluation mast, accusing the government
of having lost control of the economy.
Three of the four main stockbroking firms in Dublin are now forecasting
further falls in the market in 1993 if the government does not devalue. NCB
brokers say a no-devaluation scenario would result in a 'significant
negative effect' on Irish corporate earnings and that 'domestic and foreign
institutions will be wary of investing in assets that might ultimately lose
relative value if a devaluation were eventually forced'.
Davy Stockbrokers, having produced a bullish prediction of 20 to 30 per cent
growth for 1993 last December on the assumption of a realignment of the
sterling/punt rate to 0.98 (currently 1.09) in the new year, have been
throwing those forecasts out of the window and issuing profits warnings for
Irish companies. Mr Robbie Kelleher, head of research at Davy, says: 'If the
government does stick to its no-devaluation policy, there can be little hope
for growth this year.'
Mr Dan McLaughlin, chief economist at Riada stockbrokers, says: 'The outlook
depends very heavily on whether there is a devaluation or not. I strongly
believe there will be. The measures that have been put forward are dealing
with the symptoms, not the problem itself. The exchange rate has become the
policy in itself, instead of a policy tool to adjust to what the economy
requires. If there is a devaluation, then Irish equities look very cheap on
their current p/e rating of 12 and there would be a significant rally of
maybe 20 per cent.'
The countervailing view comes from Mr Mike Moroney, head of research at
Good-body's, the stockbroking arm of Allied Irish Banks in Dublin.
'We believe devaluation is not the panacea that others are expecting. The UK
and US equity markets have been driven up by the expectation of a rapid
reduction in interest rates. Even with a realignment in the ERM, our rates
will still be tied to those of Germany, and there is likely to be an
interest rate penalty of devaluation which could last 18 months to two years
before they drop significantly.' He thinks German rates will soon fall by as
much as two percentage points, and that the Irish market would perform
better in a no-devaluation scenario.
Leaving currency and interest rate predictions aside, all identify an
underlying 'technical problem' in the market. With the progressive
abandonment of exchange controls, Irish institutions have been diversifying
their portfolios out of Irish equities and into foreign ones. Irish pension
funds reduced the level of Irish equities in their portfolios to 23 per cent
last year from 28 per cent in 1991, and from a high of 34 per cent in 1989.
This move does not reflect a view that either the market or companies on the
market are poor value in their own right, says Davy. 'Rather, it reflects
the fact that the menu offered to investors in the Dublin market is a
limited one.'

FT  28 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rise pared as
rate cut hopes are diminished
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LATE afternoon bargain hunting by institutional investors spurred a rally,
but share prices closed only marginally higher after profit-taking had
eroded most of the gains, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average finished 17.05 up at 16,509.68 after a day's low of
16,398.21 and high of 16,645.93. The index rose sharply in the last 15
minutes of trading before losing steam in line with a weakening futures
market.
Volume remained light, totalling 200m shares against 203m previously. Rises
led declines by 511 to 401, with 202 issues unchanged. The Topix index of
all first section stocks put on 4.19 at 1,260.10 and, in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.35 to 1,023.51.
Hopes of an imminent cut in the discount rate receded on tighter money
market operations by the Bank of Japan. However, traders said some investors
still expect a rate reduction next month.
Meanwhile, some brokers hope that a possible listing by JR East, one of the
seven divisions of the former national railway, which will apply for
inclusion in April, will activate the market.
Shipbuilders were actively traded on reports that the recent spate of oil
spills may prompt the government to implement requirements enforcing tankers
to be constructed with double hulls. Sasebo Heavy Industries advanced Y34 to
Y525, Hitachi Zosen rose Y18 to Y490 and Mitsubishi Heavy gained Y8 at Y508.
Sumitomo Bank, which announced that it would write off non-performing loans
worth Y100bn to Itoman, the ailing textile trader, for the current fiscal
year, firmed Y10 to Y1,720.
In Osaka, the OSE average closed 79.57 higher at 17,885.34 in volume of
40.7m shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets continued to be mixed.
HONG KONG finished moderately higher, with overseas demand for bank issues
continuing to provide support. The Hang Seng index gained 16.16 at 5,939.89
in volume that eased to HKDollars 2.03bn from Tuesday's HKDollars 2.09bn.
HSBC Holdings, the largest local bank and stock, continued to top the
actives list and added 50 cents at HKDollars 62.50. Bank of East Asia, which
today will be the first blue chip bank to report results, climbed 75 cents
to HKDollars 36.
Swire Pacific 'A' picked up 75 cents to HKDollars 31 on signs that the cabin
crew strike at its Cathay Pacific Airways unit was crumbling. Cathay
improved 5 cents to HKDollars 9.35.
SINGAPORE turned mixed after the Straits Times Industrial index briefly
touched a new high of 1,607.22 in morning trading. It later turned back to
close a net 2.21 off at 1,603.07 in volume of 56.86m shares, against 43.79m
on Tuesday.
QAF, linked to the Brunei royal family, was the most active issue with
13.58m shares traded on rumours of a Brunei asset injection. The stock rose
5 cents to 91 cents.
AUSTRALIA rose, although equities failed to maintain strong early momentum
provided by the overnight London and Wall Street markets. The All Ordinaries
index ended 5.6 ahead at 1,534.8. Turnover came to a healthy ADollars
251.8m.
BTR led industrial volume after a block trade of 1.97m shares at ADollars
2.50. It closed 4 cents up at ADollars 2.53.
Among other heavily traded issues, Pioneer shed 3 cents to ADollars 2.24,
and Goodman Fielder was 1 cent easier at ADollars 1.72 after the company
rejected speculation that it was likely to be the target of a hostile
takeover bid.
Many investors are turning to Goodman Fielder from Arnotts, which rose 2
cents to ADollars 9.52 on the eve of the close of Campbell Soup's ADollars
9.50 a share takeover offer. Campbell said it had almost 40 per cent of
Arnotts by mid-afternoon.
TAIWAN stocks were dragged down by political uncertainty and heavy
profit-taking from strong gains made before the Chinese new year holidays.
The weighted index fell 137.53, or 4 per cent, to 3,283.09 in moderate
turnover.
MANILA turned higher after a large order for San Miguel shares by a foreign
group based in Singapore sent the market up, overcoming early profit-taking.
The composite index put on 7.03 at 1,324.34.
San Miguel 'A' shares closed 2 pesos firmer at 75 pesos and the 'B'
appreciated 5 pesos to 120 pesos.
SEOUL was lower, the composite index losing 7.91 at 694.59.
KUALA LUMPUR drifted easier in thin trading as many investors stayed on
holiday. The composite index slipped 1.45 to 624.89.
BANGKOK relinquished further ground amid profit-taking in bank shares. The
SET index shed 4.56 to 983.41 in Bt9.05bn turnover.
Construction conglomerate Siam Cement, on announcing lower than expected
profits, declined Bt10 to Bt508.

FT  28 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris falls on worries over
banking sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORPORATE news dominated the Continent yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS weakened after Standard and Poor's, the US credit ratings agency, said
that it was placing six French banks, including subsidiaries of Suez, down
FFr10.90 at FFr260.50, and Paribas, FFr2.70 lower at FFr 375.00 on
creditwatch.
The CAC-40 index closed down 15.20 at 1,777.35 in turnover of some FFr2.3bn.
Alcatel Alsthom lost FFr15 or 2.4 per cent to FFr625 after Paribas Capital
Markets lowered its rating from hold to underweight.
FRANKFURT blamed cooling hopes of interest rate cuts, yet again, and selling
of equities from the DTB derivatives market as the DAX index fell 13.84 to
1,562.30, featuring falls of over 1 per cent in Deutsche Bank, Daimler and
Siemens.
However, market turnover stayed low, falling from DM5.4bn to DM4.6bn.
Deutsche Bank fell DM7 to DM633.50 on an unchanged DM15 dividend and a
report that the engineer, KHD, was considering a rights issue. Deutsche has
a 40 per cent indirect holding in KHD, which rose DM2.80 to DM101.80 on the
hope of share price support from the banks.
AMSTERDAM saw Hoogovens gaining Fl 1.50 to Fl 26.90 on news after Tuesday's
close that it was to lift steel prices by up to 15 per cent from April.
James Capel, in a comment on the European steel sector yesterday, forecast
that, in common with previous years, the 'strategic ploy' of announcing an
April price rise was to boost sales. After April, the brokers note, the
increases only held for a brief period.
The CBS Tendency index was flat at 97.7.
BRUSSELS was little changed although steel shares performed strongly after
Hoogovens' announcement. The Bel-20 index added 0.15 to 1,178.45 in volume
of BFr1.04bn.
Cockerill, due to make a statement on prices later this week, closed BFr6
higher at BFr95 with a high 141,000 shares traded. Luxembourg steel maker
Arbed followed in its wake, rising BFr80 to BFr1,995.
Solvay, down BFr25 at BFr12,750, turned back from a firm start after
announcing that 1992 net profit before extraordinary items would fall 14 per
cent, at the high end of analysts' expectations.
MILAN saw continuing weakness in Montedison while the Comit index rose 7.29
to 480.38. Montedison was fixed L26 lower at L1,155 before falling to L1,124
after hours as a Socialist MP called for an investigation into its former
joint venture with ENI.
Speculation that Gemina could be planning a disposal - its stakes in
Ambrovento and Burgo have both been mentioned - ignited the insurance and
banking sector. Gemina firmed L41 to L1,255, Ambrovento advanced L120 to
L4,100 but Burgo slipped L130 to L5,470.
ZURICH ended near the day's lows as profit-taking eroded prices. The SMI
index fell 20.2 to 2,064.1.
Nestle shed SFr15 to SFr1,050 in response to last year's 7.9 per cent rise
in group sales, announced after the market closed on Tuesday.
Roche certificates declined SFr60 to SFr4,030 amid reports that investors
were turning instead to Sandoz, SFr50 higher at SFr3,170.
STOCKHOLM reversed early gains after Stora announced a preliminary 1992 loss
of SKr1.4bn after a 1991 profit of SKr1.1bn. Its B shares closed down SKr4
at SKr259. The Affarsvarlden index fell 3.2 to 893.0 in turnover of SKr565m
after Tuesday's SKr745m.
VIENNA saw short-covering lift the ATX index 17.91 or 2.4 per cent to 761.62
with Austrian Airlines putting on Sch120 to Sch1,650.
ATHENS saw profit-taking after strong gains earlier in the week and the
general index closed 15.89 lower at 732.16.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: UK cut brings down punt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING FELL about 4 pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday, bottoming out
at DM2.3880, in the face of strong selling pressure from bank traders and
institutional investors, writes James Blitz.
Foreign exchange dealers remained bearish about the pound in the wake of
Tuesday's 100 basis-point cut in UK base rates to 6 per cent. New signs that
the Bundesbank will not ease policy as quickly as had been expected
continued to depress the UK currency.
Sterling came under strong pressure in the early morning in London, and fell
below the psychologically important level of DM2.40 at the start of US
trading. It later closed in London at DM2.3975, down nearly 3 pfennigs on
the day. Against the dollar, it ended almost 2 1/2 cents lower at Dollars
1.5145, and in New York fell to Dollars 1.5105.
A small consolation for the UK authorities may have been the slower
deterioration in sterling's trade weighted index, a measure which the UK
chancellor has said he watches attentively. It fell yesterday from 78.9 to
78.6.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, said there
was no reason to believe that the currency would fall below the historic low
of DM2.3693 set on October 5 last year.
In his view, 6 per cent base rates had already been priced into the market
and the conditions for a modest recovery which could underpin the pound have
been set in place. Mr Hannah believes that sterling remains fundamentally
undervalued from its purchasing power parity of around DM2.55 to DM2.60.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, an economist at Citibank, believes the pound is far more
vulnerable in the short term. 'We are quite likely to test the historic lows
and fall through them,' he said. He added that the market felt there was a
growing willingness in the UK to ease policy, but that this was not
triggering an economic upturn.
The cut in UK interest rates led to a dramatic fall for the Irish punt,
because sterling's drop weakened Ireland's trade position against the UK,
one of its biggest trading partners.
Speculation that the Irish currency must now be devalued pushed the punt
below its ERM floors against the Belgian franc and Dutch guilder, forcing a
rise in the overnight rate for lending punts to 100 per cent.
Dealers wondered whether a devaluation of the Irish punt might renew
pressure on other ERM currencies.
Denmark's high interest rates seemed particularly punishing yesterday, given
the 11.7 per cent rise in unemployment in the year to December. The French
franc eased slightly to FFr3.383 to the D-Mark.
The D-Mark yesterday rose against most European currencies, helped by
bearish comments on rates from a Bundesbank council member. But the German
unit weakened against the dollar, which closed at DM1.5835 compared with
Tuesday's DM1.5770, and in New York ended at DM1.5863.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Money Markets: Longer dates rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS IN sterling markets continued to take the view yesterday that UK
base rates would be cut again before the summer, writes James Blitz.
However, although the rate for one-year sterling cash traded well below 6
per cent yesterday morning, the market took a more cautious view of rate
moves after the currency fell below DM2.40 against the D-Mark.
In the morning, one-year money was bought as low as 5 3/4 per cent. Also,
the Dec-ember 1993 short sterling contract opened at 94.45, which assumed
that three-month money at the end of the year would be at 5.55 per cent.
That prices in a 50 basis-point cut in the UK by the close of this year.
Later in the day, however, several factors forced dealers to reconsider the
assumption that there will be big rate cuts this year.
There were worries that the currency's weakness against the D-Mark and
dollar would endanger the UK chancellor of the exchequer's targets for
reducing price inflation.
Some dealers also argued that, if base rates did move down to 5 per cent,
the chances of another reduction following that one would be very slim
because of the dangers of inflation. In other words, 5 per cent base rates
would bring back a positive money market yield curve.
That assumption was clearly felt by futures dealers as they pushed the
December contract down 24 basis points to stand at 94.21 at the close, which
assumes that three-month money will be at 5.79 per cent by the end of the
year.
The June and September contracts priced three-month money in at 5.63 per
cent by the close. The futures market is effectively saying that UK base
rates may rise in the last three months of this year.
The same retracement was seen in the cash market, where the one-year rate
rose back to 6 15/16 per cent by the close. Three-month money finished at 6
5/16 per cent from a previous 6 3/16 per cent. The rise was partly due to a
big shortage of Pounds 1.3bn in the discount market which proved difficult
to remove.
The March French franc contract tumbled a further 27 basis points on growing
signs that France will find it hard to reduce its official interest rates.
Calm surr-ounded the French currency, but the weakness of the punt and the
Bundesbank's intransigence over rates have raised new fears.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: The oilman's land of
opportunity - Existing exploration contracts cover only 17 per cent of
Peru's 70m hectares of potential oil-bearing territory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERU REMAINS 'the great unexplored in the oil business,' says Mr Roger
Alderson, general manager in Peru for Simon Petroleum Technology. 'No-one
questions the technical possibilities of major finds here.'
The country has more that 70m hectares of potentially oil-bearing territory
but only 17 per cent of that is covered by existing exploration contracts.
Since 1983, investment in oil exploration in Peru has been in almost
continuous decline. Last year companies under contract with state-owned
Petroperu invested a mere Dollars 43m in exploration, a tenth of the amount
invested ten years earlier. Proven oil reserves have slumped to about 350m
barrels, half of their 1982 level, and Petroperu estimates exploration
investment should be at least Dollars 115m a year.
But the situation, it is hoped, is about to change. The controversial return
to democracy in Peru via congressional elections on 22 November could now
pave the way for a long-awaited spurt of foreign investment.
'The April 5 coup didn't scare investors away,' says Mr Alderson, 'but it
did slow things down. If Peru's democracy is now accepted as valid, we're
away and flying. Peru has ten times the opportunities of Argentina, for
example, and, historically it's no less stable or any worse a risk than
either Argentina, Colombia or Bolivia.'
For the past two years, SPT (formerly Robertson Research) has been working
with Petroperu to boost foreign interest in Peruvian oil. Twice-yearly
promotional tours have targeted oil operators, largely in the US, who are
seeking fresh fields for expansion.
A big factor in Peru's favour is recent legislation governing foreign
investment in general and oil exploration in particular. 'The current law
works,' says Mr Jaime Quijandria, president of Petroperu. 'We can prove we
offer better conditions than Colombia, Argentina or Ecuador - and investors
are coming.'
One hiccup has been the delay in gaining final approval for contracts. But
under new, streamlined procedures Petroperu has been able to reach speedy
agreement with three US oil companies over exploration and development, but
Peru's council of ministers has inexplicably been dragging its feet.
One of these contracts is with Great Western Resources for exploration in
the Peruvian jungle; another with Olympic of Denver, Colorado, in
association with a Peruvian firm Petrolera San Juan for drilling in the
northern coastal area of Piura; and the third, an exploration and production
contract, with Texas-based Clayton Williams.
The proposed joint venture with Clayton Williams, the ebullient Texan
operator who once ran for governor of his home state, is Petroperu 's first
 -and the first for an area already producing. Clayton Williams has an 80
per cent share and will bear the full Dollars 10m initial cost of drilling
five wells. Petroperu's contribution will come in down the line when a
further 40 wells are planned.
Mr Quijandria is convinced that Peru must, as Colombia did, get its oil
industry off the ground with a series of similar smallish contracts. 'The
larger companies aren't risk-takers,' he says. 'They prefer the smaller fry
to come in and do the donkey work - then they'll move in later.' There are
only two big names operating locally at present, Mobil and Occidental
Petroleum - and both have been in Peru for years. Occidental has increased
its output by 20 per cent in the past few months since settlement of a
long-running dispute with the previous Peruvian government.
Mobil's hopes of striking it big in Peru's unexplored central jungle,
meanwhile, have been dashed. The company boldly entered the central
Huallaga, centre of the Peruvian illegal cocaine trade, two years ago. The
camp was attacked by Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrillas in December
1990 and had to be almost completely rebuilt.
Terrorism is not the reason for the pull-out, however. After investing about
Dollars 32m in necessary infrastructure, the first well drilled was dry. 'At
least we've learned there's no oil there at 9,000 ft down,' says a
philosophical Mr Quijandria. 'But remember the Huallaga basin has never been
drilled before - it would have been utopian to find oil first go.'
Petroperu's promotional efforts focus on two Peruvian basins, the Ucayali
and the Maranon. Both have basic transport infrastructure in place and are
close to Peru's northern pipeline. Initial surveys show the jungle zone of
Madre de Dios is also promising, but transport is more of a problem.
The hurdle is getting the first investors interested. Petroperu is having to
go it alone with development of the rich Chambira deposits, where oil was
struck three years ago. Now that Dollars 30m in financing has been agreed
with the Andean Development Corporation (CAF), Chambira should be producing
7,500 barrels a day within 12 months.
'This is a totally no-risk enterprise,' says Mr Quijandria. 'Yet we offered
it for a year to the private sector and no-one was interested.'
While the complex process of privatising Petroperu is taking time, senior
company managers, perhaps surprisingly in a massive state-owned enterprise,
are full of initiatives. In recent weeks, Petroperu has reached a 'maquila'
(lease on idle capacity) agreement with trader Marc Rich to utilise 20,000
b/d of idle capacity at its La Pampilla refinery.
Marc Rich will bring in Dollars 18m of crude every 45 days for refining. The
refined products will be left for Petroperu to market locally, and the
residual crude will be re-exported. Later, when domestic Peruvian prices are
more internationally competitive, it is expected that Marc Rich will market
in Peru under its own brand-name.
Camisea, the vast gas and condensates field discovered by Royal Dutch Shell
in the Peruvian jungle in the mid-1980s, remains the most exciting prospect.
Shell is dragging its feet - but Peru's current, dramatic electricity
shortage is injecting fresh urgency into the search for a solution.
State-owned Electroperu is now contemplating construction of several
gas-fired thermal plants near Camisea. Electricity could be shipped over the
Andes by cable instead of building a gas pipe-line.
'It's a financing problem now,' says Mr Quijandria. 'I'm suggesting the
government appoint an agent to get a consortium together for the Dollars
1.4bn needed to develop Camisea. Then we have to put pressure on Shell to
say whether they'll agree to head it.'

FT  28 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Export boost for Chicago soya
futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US SOYABEAN futures got a boost from news of export demand and record
domestic use of soyabean meal, but Chicago's maize futures remained stuck in
a morass of oversupply, and wheat prices only managed a small rebound from
Tuesday's 5 cents-a-bushel tumble.
Late in the session soyabeans for March delivery were up 5 cents at Dollars
4.81 1/4 a bushel.
News from the US Department of Agriculture late on Tuesday afternoon that an
'unknown' country had bought 256,000 tonnes of US soyabeans helped boost
that market early yesterday. Commercial traders thought the mystery sale was
going to 'a European destination', although there had been some suggestion
that China was the buyer.
US soyabean exports are far ahead of last year. Some 70 per cent of USDA's
projected export sales are already placed, with the marketing year only
one-third over.
Yesterday morning, the department released its monthly report on US soyabean
crushing. Analysts said it implied that US farmers and livestock feeders
used a record 2.246m tonnes of soyameal in December. The crush figures aided
the soyabean rally.
Mr Dan Cekander, director of grain research at the Chicago brokerage firm of
Rodman and Renshaw, said the high soyameal consumption figures were in line
with bigger livestock herds in the US. 'Cattle, hogs, and broilers - in
every category we have higher meat numbers than last year,' he said. Maize
rations for livestock are supplemented with soyameal to boost protein and
quicken weight gain.
US maize futures held in a tight range. The year's huge crop has left
farmers with large stocks on hand. Each time futures prices manage a small
rise, producers flood country terminals with grain, keeping a lid on any
advance. Late in the day March maize was barely changed at Dollars 2.16 3/4
a bushel.
March wheat futures were up 2 1/4 cents at Dollars 3.80 3/4 a bushel late in
the afternoon, in part because of news that Sri Lanka was seeking to buy
100,000 tonnes of US wheat under the Export Enhancement Program. Morocco and
Lebanon were also US wheat buyers, helping to offset Russia's inability to
purchase US wheat because of credit problems.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Heavy selling hits New York
cotton market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW YORK Cotton futures struggled to catch a footing today after a three-day
price slide that left the March contract below its 2-cent a lb limit on
Tuesday and down another 2 cents in early trading yesterday.
The plunge ended a 2-month-long rally that was built on perceptions that
while there were abundant global supplies of cotton, the only bountiful
source of high quality cotton in the world was the US. New York Cotton
futures specify delivery of top-grade Memphis cotton.
While the assumption of short supplies of high grade cotton was correct,
analysts say, the rally was deflated by a government report on Friday that
showed an inordinately large number of long positions in the cotton futures
market were held by speculative traders. In futures jargon, that meant that
the cotton futures had been bought by 'weak hands' and not commercial
interests, leaving the market vulnerable to a sell-off.
Smelling an easy kill, commodity funds and other dealers triggered the
sell-off Monday, successfully forcing speculative longs out of the market as
prices tumbled.
Cotton futures for March delivery bounced off the 57.80 cents a lb level at
midday, with analysts noting substantial buying interest by domestic cotton
mills and Asian importers as the prices reached attractive levels.
The quality concerns had driven March cotton futures from about 58 cents a
lb at the start of the year to over 63 cents late last week. The 5 cent loss
since Friday's close has come amid heavy trading volume. The contract low of
51.32 was set in October, and few expect a return to that price.
Mr James Steel, senior commodities analyst with the brokerage firm Refco,
believes the week's wash-out is near bottom, and that fundamental demand for
high quality cotton will again push prices higher. 'I am unreservedly
telling my clients to buy this dip,' he said.
China, one of the world's largest cotton producers, and also a net importer,
is in the process of harvesting its crop. Drought and boll weevil pests have
made China's crop production estimate a controversial 21m bales, according
to the US Department of Agriculture.
Mr Steel says regardless of the Chinese crop size, it is fair to bet that
Chinese crop quality will be poor, further widening the spread between world
and US cotton prices. Traders are also aware that while there is a world
cotton surplus, more than half the world's stocks are sitting in Asia and
China, with fewer than 4m bales in storage in the US.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sri Lanka tries to revitalise
coconut industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER

<DATELINE>
   COLOMBO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SRI LANKA'S coconut industry, one of the island's three traditional export
industries, is trying to expand acreage and improve productivity and land
utilisation, according to government officials and analysts, reports Reuter
from Colombo.
It is also exploring new markets for its products, in what has become a
fiercely competitive industry, while fighting the effects on production of
drought and the removal of a fertiliser subsidy.
'Production last year was better than the year before,' a senior official of
the Coconut Industries Ministry says. 'We estimate 1992 production to be
2.3bn nuts as against 2,17bn nuts the previous year.' This year he expects a
'marginal increase' in production, 80 per cent of which is consumed locally.
Two years ago output was 2.5bn nuts. The fall, according to the country's
central bank, was caused by reduced fertiliser application after subsidies
were withdrawn and the delayed effects of a prolonged drought. 'The
government should give the fertiliser subsidy again,' says one broker.
'Fertiliser prices are too high for estate owners to bear.'
Last year, as the prices of processed coconut products improved, the island
earned an estimated Rs4bn (Pounds 60m) from exports, up from Rs3.4bn the
previous year.
Earnings from desiccated coconut sales accounted for more than half of total
coconut export earnings. The price of a tonne of desiccated coconut, nearly
all of which is exported, rose to Dollars 1,000 from Dollars 750 in 1991.
The industry, the main market for which is the European Community, is trying
to re-enter the lucrative US market for desiccated coconut, which it
monopolised at one time as a pioneer producer and sole exporter.
The American market is now dominated by supplies from the Philippines.
Sri Lanka exported 460 tonnes of the desiccated product to the US in 1991,
up from 280 tonnes the previous year.
It is also eyeing former communist countries. 'There is medium and long-term
potential, perhaps more than the EC, in Russia and eastern Europe,' the
ministry official says. 'If that market opens up it might increase demand
for desiccated coconut by 50 per cent.'
Industry officials say that, in spite of growing competition from new
exporters like Indonesia, the world's biggest coconut producer, Sri Lanka is
able to hold its own because its desiccated product is considered to have
the best flavour.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian farm sector to get
emergency support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR VIKTOR Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, has signed a resolution
on emergency support for Russia's struggling farm sector and proposed an
overhaul of the system of subsidies, according to the Itar-Tass news agency,
Reuter reports from Moscow.
The document proposed granting low-interest credits to farm producers and
raised the possibility of writing off debts incurred by agricultural
companies to finance capital investment.
CIS television said the programme would add Rbs160bn (Dollars 281m) to the
Russian budget. It quoted Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the vice president, as
saying that Russia would also allocate Dollars 250m to build new processing
facilities for agricultural products, but gave no details.
Tass said subsidies, including half their fuel expenses, would be paid to
cattle-breeders who sold their livestock to the state. Subsidies of 50 per
cent would also be paid on all types of fuel and energy used for heating and
for transport of fodder for farms which suffered drought or other natural
disasters in 1992.
The resolution said direct subsidising of producers should be replaced
during 1993 by subsidising of goods in the form of guaranteed prices for
basic products. The volume of subsidies would be cut gradually.
The pro-market government is trying to implement sweeping changes in the
chronically inefficient farm sector by breaking up large collective farms
and encouraging private farms to start up.
But farmers are clamouring for more government support, arguing in
particular that loans are too expensive.

This weeks British interest rate reduction, and its accompanying currency
disturbances, have had not had the effect of enlivening wool textile trade.
There is more interest in how prices may have been affected, but not to the
point of placing business. The firming effect is very slight because of
continuing difficult and competitive conditions throughout Europe.
Australian and most world wool values meanwhile only manage to drift along
without clear trend. The AWC market indicator was down to 502 cents a kg. on
January 27, compared with 509 a week before.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: CIS likely to smelt less
western copper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COPPER SMELTERS in Russia and Kazakhstan will experience a sharp drop in
business from western merchants this year, predicts Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken,
part of the Banque Indosuez Group.
About 300,000 tonnes of stockpiled copper concentrate (an intermediate
material) was shipped by merchants from the west to smelters in the
Commonwealth of Independent States for treatment in the second half of last
year, it estimates. This resulted in an unexpected production increase of
more than 100,000 tonnes for the year.
'Not only did this alleviate the smelter bottle-neck which occurred during
the first half of the year, it also prevented the copper market from
registering a significant supply deficit as seemed likely at mid-year,'
points out analyst Mr Wiktor Bielski in Carr's latest Metals and Mining
investment update.
However, Carr believes that the concentrate stockpiles are now nearly
exhausted and that in 1993 only about 100,000 tonnes will be shipped to
Russia and Kazakhstan for toll smelting (the system where smelters treat
other companies' material for a fee).
This would result in only 30,000 to 35,000 tonnes of 'extra' copper
production from this source this year. 'Given the internal infrastructure
problems in the CIS and the long distances involved, coupled with the recent
fall in treatment charges, it may well prove unprofitable to undertake toll
smelting in Russia at all this year,' adds Mr Bielski.
Meanwhile, Carr expects imports of copper to China to continue growing
strongly. Mr Bielski estimates that China's copper imports rose from 114,000
tonnes in 1991 to 280,000-300,000 tonnes last year and expects that to be
exceeded in 1993.
China's domestic copper production is running at full capacity (about
575,000 tonnes a year) and no expansions are expected for about three years,
whereas demand is on course to rise to an annual 950,000 tonnes by the
mid-1990s (up from about 650,000 tonnes in 1991).
Carr suggests that net copper imports to the west from the former eastern
bloc countries might disappear almost completely by the mid-1990s, a
substantial reversal from the 254,000 tonnes imported in 1990.

London robusta COFFEE futures finished with gains of around Dollars 32 to
Dollars 40 on key positions but were well below the day's highs as the
market continued to experience a modest technical bounce after recent heavy
losses. However, dealers said the rally had been relatively muted and it was
quite possible that the downtrend would resume shortly. New York arabica
coffee prices were ahead in late trading. London COCOA closed with pared
gains; the market seems set for a period of range trading between Pounds
690-Pounds 700 and Pounds 740 a tonne for the March contract, dealers said.
The weakness of sterling continued to underpin values. GOLD steadied on the
London bullion market after Comex held downside support following early
losses. But sentiment leaned towards the market drifting down to test the
Dollars 330 a troy ounce level. Nymex PLATINUM prices were down on profit
taking at midday. But continued concern over the availability of supply in
the physical markets was limiting losses.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Survey of Leeds (8): Phone-based industries buck trend -
Emergence of a new breed of skilled office workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW type of skilled office worker is emerging in Leeds. She or, not
infrequently, he, is familiar with computers and how databases work, finds
keyboard work easy, has a good telephone manner and an ability to relate
quickly to customers on the phone, writes Ian Hamilton Fazey.
Most of these office workers are young and adaptable, with women in the
majority, though plenty of men are also to be found in the offices
concerned. They are not so much selling as servicing. Jobs created are
already in the thousands, so a large pool of experienced labour with
transferable skills is growing.
The companies involved all run telephone-based service operations and three
in particular - First Direct, National Breakdown and Club 24 - stand out for
bucking the UK's recession in the last two years.
But why in Leeds?
Mr Kevin Newman, head of First Direct, the 24-hour, direct access telephone
banking subsidiary of Midland Bank, says there was a very good reason for
setting up the UK's first such operation in Leeds - the way that local
people talk.
A study of dialect showed that the Leeds accent offends no one. It is not
strong 'Yorkshire' and sounds neither northern nor southern, nor Midlands,
nor Scottish. This is an important marketing consideration if Scots are
likely to be put off by Cockneys or everyone may possibly be discomfited by
Brummies or Scousers.
'We also needed a large conurbation with a large labour force, where people
were familiar with the financial services sector,' Mr Newman adds. 'The
other factor was an immediately available single-storey building of 50,000
sq ft. Leeds had one.'
First Direct's decision seems to have been vindicated by sheer speed of
growth. That the company hit the right spot in the market is shown by
360,000 people opening accounts in the first three years. Customers are able
to do all of their banking transactions by phone, at any time.
New accounts are rolling in at a rate of 10,000 a month, but the Leeds
labour market seems easily to have met the recruitment demands this has
created. Jobs have gone from zero to more than 1,000 now, and Mr Newman
expects to take on another 300 people this year.
The company soon outgrew its 50,000 sq ft and took on 20,000 sq ft more.
More expansion is envisaged.
Very similar skills are needed by workers at National Breakdown, the
Leeds-based vehicle recovery and roadside servicing business. Its chairman
is Mr Ernest Smith, an indefatigable 46-year-old who has been putting
competitive pressure on the Automobile Association and the Royal Automobile
Club for the past 20 years.
Unlike the AA and RAC, National Breakdown does not employ its own patrolling
repair and vehicle recovery staff. Instead, it uses a 1,500-strong network
of independent garages throughout the UK. It relies on computerised
databases and the telephone to operate.
The company has been extraordinarily successful: sales were Pounds 12,500 in
1973, but are Pounds 70m now; it employs 550 in Leeds, and won the race
against the AA and RAC to achieve the BS5750 quality assurance standard.
There is a perpetual waiting list of would-be agents, so none can afford
complacency .
National Car Parks bought out Mr Smith's two partners in 1984 but he remains
at the helm as a minority shareholder. He has just brought in Mr Tim Ward
from Visa - another business relying on telephones and computers - as
managing director.
Mr Ward will run the UK business while Mr Smith concentrates on Europe,
where he is building a similar network of agent garages, running the
operation from Strasbourg.
In Leeds, National Breakdown now handles a third of British Telecom's
telephone paging calls. This uses the same type of office skills as those
needed by National Breakdown and First Direct.
This use of National Breakdown's skills to process other companies' business
is known as 'outsourcing' - and nowhere is there a better example of it as a
growth industry than at Club 24, near Leeds city centre.
Club 24 started more than 20 years ago managing customers' budget accounts
in-house for Hepworth and Burtons, the mid-range men's tailors.
By the mid-1970s, it had developed into a financial services business and
was incorporated as Club 24 in a joint venture with Forward Trust. The name
came from the formula for calculating credit limits - 24 times the monthly
sum any customer was prepared to pay.
In 1985, Hepworth took full control and three years later - when Hepworth
had become Next - Club 24 had expanded, operating in-store credit for
several high street store chains and handling 2.3m accounts.
The business ran into trouble as recession bit because of the exposure
involved in Next carrying Club 24's debt on its balance sheet. To survive,
Club 24 has dropped out of financial services but has turned itself into an
outsourcing bureau - managing credit or any other type of high-volume,
telephone-based operation for other companies, but not carrying the risk of
any debt involved on its own books.
Thus, Cellnet uses Club 24 as sole supplier of support administration
systems for its drive into consumer mobile telephone markets; Kingfisher to
manage its credit business; and the Co-operative Bank to process the fixed
term loans it sells through retail outlets.
New business includes one-third of British Telecom's radio paging and credit
management for Yorkshire Electricity. Debt collection - for other people -
is also a growing business.
The effect on jobs has been dramatic. When Next was in trouble and Club 24
with it, more than 200 jobs were shed and another 300 were threatened. There
are more than 600 jobs now and numbers are growing.
All three companies have therefore enabled the Leeds labour market to make a
telling point about its capacity for training and flexibility with modern
technology.
Jobs have gone for ever in the now-empty warehouses where Hepworth suits
were made up but, in less than a generation, a substantial part of the
labour market has adjusted to a different type of demand. The social and
economic processes involved could well repay serious study with lessons for
elsewhere.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Survey of Leeds (9): Hotel guests spoilt for choice - Why
Leeds needs to develop itself as a tourist destination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEVER before has Leeds had an oversupply of hotel rooms. But, by the end of
next year, that is what it is about to get. The stock of good quality
bedrooms for international business travellers will then have increased by
nearly 80 per cent in 10 years.
The city centre's present stock is just under 1,000 rooms. The Marriott
chain will open a 245-bedroom hotel in September and the Copthorne will join
the market with 150 new bedrooms 12 months later.
The prospect of oversupply seems to have awakened the Leeds Hotels
Association to the need for better, co-ordinated joint marketing. The advent
of new tourist attractions such as the Royal Armouries and Tetley's brewing
industry visitor centre will help fill some rooms at weekends, but the city
has now embarked on a critical self-examination about what else it has to
offer.
One of Leeds' problems is that it winds down rapidly in the early evening.
This in part a consequence of many affluent people living outside the city
in attractive, easily accessible countryside or towns such as Harrogate,
Otley and Wetherby, but it is also a function of size.
At about 750,000 people in the conurbation, the market is less than a third
the size of Greater Manchester's, which consequently has a livelier
night-life, a wider range of entertainment and leisure, and the 'feel' of a
24-hour city.
Leeds is not short of good theatre and culture but lacks a critical mass.
Good restaurants, such as La Grillade, Sous le Nez, 42 The Calls and the new
Leodis, could compete anywhere in the world, but walking through the city at
night is often a lonely experience.
'Leeds has always been seen as a business destination but it can - and must
 -also develop itself as a tourist destination,' says Mr Robert Kirby,
general manager of the Bass group's Holiday Inn and a driving force of the
hotels association.
Mr Kirby says the hotels, city council, industry, commerce, the two
universities and the Royal Armouries must work together on marketing. The
association wants to see a conference and exhibition centre developed. It
would cost about Pounds 15m and would probably have to be built near the
Hilton Hotel - not far from the Tetley project and the Royal Armouries.
The Hilton, with 210 bedrooms, will remain Leeds' biggest hotel until the
Marriott opens this year. It has long scored over rivals - such as the
Queens at Central Station and the Metropole in the commercial quarter - by
being 'modern', but while competition has forced refurbishment of older
hotels, the general shortage of rooms has been a cushion for all.
The Holiday Inn - which opened three years ago - has provided a foretaste of
intensifying rivalry, as has the development of 41 The Calls - with a good
restaurant next door - in formerly derelict warehouses along the River Aire.
Mr Kirby says that despite recession, Holiday Inn achieved 65 per cent
occupancy in 1992 at an average of Pounds 65 per room, net of VAT. Occupancy
rates were 52 per cent and 45 per cent in the two previous years. On the
way, Mr Kirby picked up six quality or training awards.
He is now urging the association to spearhead a total quality management
drive throughout the city, involving hotels, restaurants, shops and even
taxis. By tying in with Leeds training and enterprise council, he thinks the
hotels should also be able to help upgrade skills throughout the service
sector.
He trained initially as a chef at North Lindsay College, Humberside, a
centre of excellence in food industry education, but learned about quality
through working in Switzerland and Italy.
'We hope the oversupply will be absorbed as Leeds comes out of recession,'
he says, 'but we have to help things along by improving what we offer to
both the business and tourist markets.
'There is a huge potential for tourism, which the new developments will
highlight, but we cannot sit back and wait for things to happen. The road to
excellence is always under construction.'

FT  28 JAN 93 / Survey of Leeds (7): Strong arm of the law - The city heads
a legal regional table
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POSITION of Leeds as Britain's leading law centre outside London was
confirmed this month when Legal Business, a trade magazine, published its
latest league table.
Ranked by annual gross fees, Leeds has six firms in the top 20, three of
them in the top five.
The three giants are Dibb Lupton Broomhead, Hammond Suddards and Booth &amp; Co,
respectively in first, second and fourth place. The three firms on the next
rank are Simpson Curtis, 12th, Eversheds Hepworth &amp; Chadwick, 15th, and
Walker Morris, 18th.
Gross fees ranged from Pounds 28.8m for Dibb Lupton Broomhead to Pounds 9.8m
for Walker Morris, but will be surpassed this year. Mr Robin Smith, head of
Dibb Lupton Broomhead, says his firm's sales are running at an annual Pounds
36m, up from Pounds 22m two years ago.
The corporate law industry is a good one to be in, with counter-cyclical
elements that a l l o w recession to be weathered. For example, insolvency
and litigation come into the ascendancy in bad times, when corporate finance
and merger and acquisitions markets falter.
However, the league table flatters Leeds because neither Dibb nor Hammond
Suddards is entirely in the city, earning fees also in Manchester and
Sheffield in Dibb's case and in Bradford, from where AV Hammond leapt to
take over Last Suddards in Leeds in 1988. Each also runs a London office.
This would put Booth &amp; Co at the top of the league if it were based on
single-city offices - not that this makes Booths either provincial or
parochial.
More than half its work is in the financial sector and spread widely: this
month it won a competitive tender against rivals in all the big cities to
handle all non-property legal work in England for Scottish Equitable.
Simpson Curtis, Eversheds Hepworth &amp; Chadwick and Walker Morris also operate
only from Leeds. In contrast, Broomheads was Sheffield's leading law firm
when it merged with Dibb Lupton in 1988 and work is still spread evenly, in
terms of numbers of fee-earners at desks, between the two cities.
There are about 220 staff - 105 of them fee-earners - in each place. The
firm has another 149 people in London, 69 of them fee-earners, and 50 in
Manchester, half of them solicitors. There are also 110 back-office workers
in Bradford.
This gives Dibb a payroll of 750 people, making it a very large business
indeed. Hammond Suddards has about 620 in total, of whom 250 are Leeds and
50 in London. Bradford back-offices house the rest.
However, all of the firms have a national outlook. They grew out of demand
from regionally-based clients, but are marketing themselves much more widely
now. Hammond Suddards, for example, handles all of ICI's environmental and
planning work.
All have at least doubled in size in the past five years. Size matters: it
enables them to house many different types of specialist and pursue a
'swings and roundabouts' policy in changing markets.
Price advantage was one driving force for growth, as London prices went
silly for northern commercial clients in the latter half of the 1980s.
Even though London rents have dropped, Leeds still has an edge. Mr Peter
Thompson, managing partner of Eversheds Hepworth &amp; Chadwick says salaries of
supporting staff such as secretaries and legal executives are several
thousand pounds per head per year more in London than Leeds, a situation
that is unlikely to change.
Mr Trevor Lewis, managing partner of Hammond Suddards, says anewly-qualified
solicitor costs about Pounds 5,000 a year more in London than in Leeds.
Typically, what costs Pounds 150 an hour in legal fees in Leeds costs Pounds
50 more in London.
Mr Smith puts the price advantage of a highly experienced lawyer's time even
higher if the price is carried into London itself. 'We can provide the same
quality in our London office at a price which makes much more sense in the
market. We reckon we can charge - in London - Pounds 100 an hour less than
some of the big City firms for the same level of advice,' he says.
That is because back-office work is carried out in Leeds, Sheffield or
Bradford, where overheads and staff wages are lower. 'But we don't sell on
price; we sell on quality,' Mr Smith avers. Even so, Dibbs is winning a lot
of work from hard-pressed south-east corporate clients looking for savings.
Specialisation has also helped firms to develop market leadership in
particular niches. In 1987, Eversheds Hepworth &amp; Chadwick was one of the
first anywhere into environmental issues, poaching lawyers from local
authorities - the enforcers of green law - to act instead for companies so
they could get on the right side earlier of tightening legislation.
Simpson Curtis has recently carried its fight into London too. It has three
partners there in new offices near St Paul's, with another two on their way.
Mr Martin Shaw, senior partner, has also started a drive against
London-influenced 'macho' practices. 'When you're doing a flotation or
acquisition, why do meetings have to start at 5:30pm and go on all night?
What are people trying to prove? There is no need for it and it doesn't
impress clients.
'Our clients are now much more sophisticated. They have got over the
mystique they used to associate with the law and question why we have to do
things in certain ways. They want to see efficiency. And we have to
demonstrate value for money, to give the client more than he expects.'
All the law firms have trimmed in the recession, but, paradoxically, have
never stopped recruiting qualified people. The drive to reduce numbers is
about efficiency, shedding indirect staff and less able partners. 'We are
all investing heavily in buildings and technology to push up productivity,'
Mr Smith says.
'None of us is part of the inner circle of City of London institutions. We
sell our services to clients who, in the main, make and sell things. This
shapes the way we do things ourselves. We see ourselves as no different from
any other commercial undertaking.'
Mr Lewis says Leeds' modern legal industry probably began about 10 years
ago, when London prices started to escalate. That was when AV Hammond 'went
entirely commercial', dropping all criminal and matrimonial work.
Though everyone claimed to be as good then as they are now, all know they
are in a new, professional league, according to Mr Thompson.
All acknowledge that competition among themselves has been a strong force
for change and better practice. It has also attracted clients. 'If you want
to buy an antique, you go to a place like Harrogate where there are enough
dealers to create a genuine market,' Mr Lewis says.
'Competition has never been tougher,' says Mr Shaw. 'There is serious
undercutting, including loss leaders being offered to win other business.'
Some of those City institutions make have to look to their laurels.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Survey of Leeds (3): The will to get things done - Impact of
the development corporation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the Leeds Development Corporation was imposed upon the city in 1988, it
did not receive a rapturous welcome from the local authority.
City or district councils rarely like development corporations. They resent
the loss of planning powers and funds to these unelected quangos.
In Leeds there was a feeling that a development corporation was particularly
unnecessary since the economy was flourishing and property developments
would have occurred through market forces.
Mr Brian Walker, chairman of the Labour council's economic services
committee, says: 'A lot of the developments in the corporation's area would
have happened anyway. Many planning consents had already been given.
'The corporation area covers only 1 per cent of Leeds and we were starved
for money to develop the other 99 per cent.'
Mr Jon Trickett, leader of the city council, says: 'We felt at the time that
we, the democratically elected representatives, should have decided where
money was to be spent. To channel funds into just one area could have
created an imbalance in the city. We have some deprived inner city areas
which require attention.'
The city council set up the Leeds City Development Company, a private
developer, to act as a rival to the development corporation.
Since then, however, feelings towards the corporation have warmed. Mr Walker
now sits on the board of the LDC.
Through the Leeds Development Agency, its economic development arm, the city
council has joined with the development corporation and other private sector
bodies to form the Leeds Initiative. This umbrella organisation has
succeeded in attracting investments to the city.
The development corporation says it has created 6,500 jobs in four years at
a cost of Pounds 6,000 a job and that this compares with an average cost
across the 11 urban development corporations of nearly Pounds 30,000 a job.
In some ways the the LDC had an easier task than other UDCs. Unlike Teesside
or Tyneside, there are no large tracts of derelict, polluted land which have
been laid waste by the decline of traditional manufacturing industries.
The Leeds urban development area is more like Trafford Park in Manchester.
It is a nexus of live industries, notably engineering and light
manufacturing. The area is in need of refurbishment and environmental
improvements but not wholesale redevelopment. Of the 1,300 acres under the
LDC's remit, about 300 to 400 acres are considered in need of total
redevelopment.
The LDC itself has bought or 'assembled' only 43.23 hectares (102 acres).
The main part of the developement area stretches south away from the River
Aire directly next to the city centre. There is easy access and the area is
the obvious place for Leeds' inner core to expand. The LDC has another tract
of land in its care - the Kirkstall Valley - which is non-contiguous.
In the main area there are few houses: hundreds rather than thousands live
within the LDC's boundaries. This has meant there have been few costly,
acrimonious and time-consuming compulsory purchase orders to implement.
Ironically, the LDC has benefited from a lack of funding. When it was set up
in 1988, it was to have a life of five years and was given just Pounds 15m
of government money. This ruled out grand, costly infrastructural projects
from the start.
Mr Stuart Kenny, development director of the LDC, says: 'Because of the
tight funding we never set out a vision or grand design like some
development corporations. We never made extravagant claims about how many
jobs we would create and never gave out specific investment or job targets.
We just tried to do what we could as we went along.'
What the LDC has achieved, apart from the jobs created, is to facilitate or
enable 3m sq ft of new property to be built. There have been 57 environment
schemes approved and 42 environment grants awarded. The LDC has spent around
Pounds 36m. This, in turn, has generated over Pounds 120m in private sector
investment, a ratio of nearly four to one.
The development corporation's life has been extended to 1995, with hopes
that that it might continue for a further term.
Much of the 3m sq ft of new property is industrial factories in three
business parks and refurbishments of older buildings. There has been some
B1, light industrial/office projects along the River Aire, together with
environmental improvements and the opening of a hotel and some restaurants.
Critics of the LDC say these developments would have taken place with or
without a development corporation. However, Mr Peter Hartley, chairman of
the LDC, says: 'They might have happened, but certainly not in my lifetime.
Some of the planning consents had been sitting there for 20 years.
'It is not a question of money making things happen, but of will. We have
had the determination to push things through and speed up the planning
procedures.'

LEEDS is not unique among large British towns and cities, but it is a rarity
in one respect. Despite the growth of service industries during the 1980s,
it did not enter the recession with a surplus of new office space arising
from speculative building, writes Stewart Dalby.
Mr Robert Firth of Bernard Thorpe, a leading Leeds estate agent, estimates
that if purpose-built properties such as the 400,000 sq ft building for the
benefits agency of the Department of Social Security and other pre-let
properties are left out of the reckoning, there is about 700,000 sq ft of
office or light industrial (B1) space on offer out of a total stock of some
10m sq ft.
Much of this, however, is old, second-hand stock for which there would not
be a great demand even if there were not a recession.
Mr Firth says: 'There is around 150,000 sq ft of new B1-type properties
ready for moving into. The take-up of such space in 1991 when recession was
well and truly with us was around 200,000 sq ft a year. At the height of
activity in the late 1980s the take-up of office space was around 400,000 sq
ft a year. You can say there is an underlying shortage of this type of
property in Leeds city centre.'
In industrial properties - such as B2-type premises for manufacturing
industry and B8 for warehousing and storage - the situation is only slightly
easier.
Mr Michael Haigh of Knight, Frank &amp; Rutley estimates 700,000 to 900,000 sq
ft is available for B2 and B8 premises. Much of this is older property.
There is about 300,000 sq ft of newer buildings.
The situation with industrial property was helped by the arrival in 1988 of
the Leeds Development Corporation. Many of the developments it facilitated
have been industrial buildings. Specifically, the development corporation
has helped build three small industrial estates.
Lettings for offices and factories are slow because of the recession. But
one result of a lack of surplus in both sectors is that prices have held up.
Mr Firth reckons the peak for offices was Pounds 19 a sq ft in 1990.
'Clients are looking for special deals and rent holidays. But for prime
sites we are asking and getting Pounds 18 to Pounds 19 a sq ft for letting,'
he says.
Mr Haigh says: 'The market is quiet but for basic B8 warehousing properties,
rents are holding at around Pounds 4 a sq ft.'
On the retail side, it seems much the same. Rents have dropped from a peak
of Pounds 166 a sq ft for prime zone A rents to about Pounds 140 a sq ft.
But there seems to be remarkably few shops to let in the prime areas.
The lack of surpluses in the three commercial property market segments is
due neither to Yorkshire caution nor because the arithmetic did not make
speculative building look attractive to developers. Uncertainty about how
the city council wanted Leeds to develop is to blame, according to Mr Ian
Barraclough, the regional managing partner for Bernard Thorpe in Leeds.
He says: 'In the mid-1980s the sums certainly stacked up for developers.
Rents were Pounds 8 for prime properties and this was ample for a good
profit. But investors were unclear where to develop.
'The inner core - a half square mile of offices - had been largely
developed, although renovations and refurbishments continued to come up. The
council wanted to keep the area immediately to the east of the inner core
for shopping.
'To the immediate north was the university, the hospitals and the
administrative area. The council decided new developments should be to the
west around the central station. Two large sites, one of 8.5 acres and
another of six acres were earmarked.'
On one of these, Coopers &amp; Lybrand last year agreed to take 70,000 sq ft of
space in a Postel scheme in Wellington Street. This was considered a great
coup for Leeds.
However, 1987 saw the introduction of what Mr Barraclough calls the Use
Classes Order which brought in the business class (B1) property
classification. This meant that properties which could once only be used as
factories could be employed for a variety of purposes including offices.
In 1988, the Leeds Development Corporation was established with a remit to
develop a large area to the south of the city centre.
The effect of these two events was to switch the emphasis away from the
west, around the station, towards the south of the city centre on both banks
of the River Aire. There has since been considerable development there,
including a new headquarters for KPMG Peat Marwick, Asda's headquarters and
computer centre, as well as a new hotel and restaurants.
Mr Barraclough says: 'Developers are holding off at the moment, but a lot of
land is available. There is probably room for another 1m sq ft of properties
along the river banks. The area around the station will pick up in time.'
Another project is the proposed development of a large-scale out-of-town
business park. Curiously for a big city such as Leeds which has expanded in
recent years, it has only two small industrial estates. These are Lawns Wood
and the Arlington Business Park. They amount to less than 18 acres between
them.
A new road linking the A1 with the M1 near the city will pass by a site of
about 200 acres which has been earmarked for development. While much will be
for housing, there could be 70 acres of commercial development. GMI
Rovinian, a local developer, has an option to develop the commercial land.
Mr David Pollock, a partner in GMI, says: 'Now that the A1-M1 link is
definitely going ahead, the business park will almost certainly happen -
within the next 10 years.'

FT  28 JAN 93 / Survey of Leeds (4): Royal Armouries captured
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the Leeds Development Corporation's great coups has been the
relocation of the Royal Armouries from the Tower of London, writes Stewart
Dalby.
The armouries had been there for 900 years and among the items added over
the centuries were Henry VIII's battledress and an entire suit of armour for
an Indian elephant. Conditions at the Tower were too cramped for a proper
display and the need to move the collection was recognised several years
ago.
Last year, after reading that Sheffield had won the relocation, Mr Stuart
Kenny, LDC's development director, phoned the Tower to find that the deal
had not been finalised. Together with Leeds City Council, the development
agency and private landowners, a financial package was put together to site
the museum at the disused Clarence Dock on the River Aire.
The museum should be open by 1995 or 1996. It will cost about Pounds 35m and
could create 200 jobs. With 1m visitors a year anticipated, the economic
benefit to Leeds could be an annual Pounds 30m.
Before the Royal Armouries receives its first visitor, the Tetley visitor
centre should be under way on a site close to the Clarence Dock. Tetley is
the largest brewer in Leeds, with 800 public houses.
The project has yet to be given a proper name. To call it a visitor centre
rather understates the scale of the scheme which will include a
fully-fledged museum of brewing, costing Pounds 6m to build. The museum will
be a working one, with craftsmen such as coopers and brewers demonstrating
their skills. There will also be an Elizabethan coaching inn, a Georgian gin
palace and a Victorian pub.
Mr Graham Kershaw, Tetley's company secretary, says: 'We have done our
homework and are convinced that there is a demand for this museum.' The
company is expecting 250,000 visitors a year.
The LDC has been instrumental in building a Pounds 600,000 footbridge across
the River Aire from the city centre to both the Tetley museum and the site
where the Royal Armouries is to be housed.
Unlike Glasgow, Leeds lacks cultural attractions. The Armouries and the
visitor centre will be the first steps in developing a larger tourist
industry to augment the city's white collar sector and increase the range of
non-manual jobs.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Survey of Leeds (5): City of rich and poor - The gap between
haves and have-nots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARP differences between the haves and have-nots of modern urban society
have become increasingly obvious in Leeds where professional and financial
services have created thousands of new, well-paid jobs in banks, building
societies, law and accountancy firms since the mid-1980s.
The new jobs give the impression of widespread economic regeneration, but
they have been largely confined to the city centre. In some areas, local
unemployment has risen in the wake of the decline in old manufacturing
concerns.
The trappings and symbols of city centre investment - such as new office
buildings, expensive clothes shops and good quality wine bars and
restaurants - have highlighted social differences. This is much to the
concern of the city council's Labour party leadership.
In Leeds, the contrast is particularly striking because one of the most
deprived inner city areas - comprising the Chapeltown and Harehills
districts - abuts the city centre.
From the top of Chapeltown Road, with a Caribbean restaurant on one side and
a Yugoslav Social Club on the other, one can watch completion of the
gleaming new Department of Social Security building, locally dubbed the
'Kremlin'.
The benefits agency of the DSS and the Department of Health executive are
being, or have been, relocated to Leeds. It is expected that 2,000 jobs will
be created by the moves but how many will go to people in Chapeltown is
debatable.
Unlike the Gorbals district of Glasgow, where large numbers of socially
deprived people were moved to peripheral housing estates,
Chapeltown-Harehills has not been broken up and about 31,000 people live
there in 11,000 households.
Mr Roy Dean, manager of the Chapeltown Business Centre says: 'The population
has been roughly the same for some years. There has not been much net
emigration, but the ethnic mix might have changed a bit.'
About a third to a half of the population consists of racial minorities.
Broadly, people of Afro-Caribbean origin live in Chapeltown and those of
Asian descent - notably from Bangladesh - live in Harehills. The
Bangladeshis are the most recent arrivals in a long history of immigration
into the area, which is still a patchwork of minorities, though
Afro-Caribbeans and Asians dominate.
The district has many large, once grand, Victorian houses divided into
flats, as well as terraces of back-to-back cottages.
Chapeltown is characterised by the usual indices of deprivation. There is
high unemployment - 30 per cent overall and more than 50 per cent among
ethnic minorities. There are more children per family than in other areas of
Leeds - and more single parents.
There is a higher proportion of rented accommodation and fewer households
with a car; a notorious red light district; a high level of crime; and a
rising trend of drug-related problems and criminal activity.
This mix of deprivation and racial tension erupted in riots in 1981, said at
the time to be copycat riots after Toxteth in Liverpool and Brixton in
London, but Mr Dean, a social worker in the area at the time, believes they
were the result of frustration at the lack of attention the area received.
'There was just too little money spent on the housing stock, on jobs and on
education,' he insists.
A government inner city task force - a team of civil servants and business
people set up to promote and help channel funds to inner-city training and
employment - was established in the mid-1980s. It supported more than 100
projects, spending about Pounds 1.6m directly.
The task force has recently been wound up, with some programmes taken over
by the Leeds Development Association. Through its business centre, the LDA
runs 15 workshops and advises on training and 'self-build' initiatives.
Much has been done in terms of brightening up shops, building new homes and
refurbishing old ones. However, Mr Dean says: 'It is a long haul and the
problem does not just go away. At the heart of it is unemployment. There is
a lot of retail business, but hardly any manufacturing or other commercial
activity.
'Many of the young people here have never had any work and see little
prospect of getting any. Outside the bookmaker's you will see young men
hanging around. Some of them will have mobile phones. They will be doing
drug deals. That is the only kind of work there is for them.'
Chapeltown may be the most deprived area of Leeds' run-down areas but it is
not the only one.
Mr John Siddall, head of the LDA, says: 'I estimate that, of the Leeds
population of 700,000, more than 100,000 live in what can be described as
deprived inner city areas. They represent one of our greatest problems.
Because Leeds is perceived as a flourishing city with average overall
unemployment levels we get little help from the government.'
Leeds is not an assisted area and therefore has no access to 'Brussels
money' such as the European regional and social funds. This year it also
failed to win money from the City Challenge programme, now abolished by the
government, which is saving money by cutting urban funding.
Mr Jon Trickett, leader of the council, says that the inner city areas are
one of Leeds' greatest problems. He chairs the Leeds Initiative, which links
the public and private sectors to find ways forward through the
difficulties.
'Increasingly, people in these areas are being left out of the economy. A
priority is to provide training and incentives so they can get jobs and be
part of the city's development. It is difficult. We have only a little urban
aid. We get around Pounds 5m but even that is being cut,' he says.
With Leeds' very success hindering access to public sector funds, the hope
is to find local solutions which will help wealth spill outwards to
Chapeltown and other deprived areas. Mr Trickett does not hide his anxiety
at the possible consequences of failure.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Survey of Leeds (1): Survival of the fittest - Helped by a
good mix of industry and commerce and by public sector investment, Leeds has
weathered recession better than most large cities in Britain. Now the
economy is stirring and recovery may have begun
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY

<TEXT>
IT IS not quite true that Leeds is the English city the recession forgot,
but at first glance it almost looks that way. There are tower cranes on the
skyline, unemployment is 9 per cent and lower than the national average and
house prices have slipped by less than 5 per cent.
'Of course recession has not passed us by,' says Mr Peter Coles-Johnson,
chief executive of Leeds chamber of commerce and industry. 'We know from our
resignations last year - 12 per cent of the membership - that more people
than usual ceased trading. Normal turnover is about 6 to 8 per cent.
'Life is hard at the moment, but the good news is that so many have
survived. We have a broad spread of industry, with many small and
medium-sized businesses. That's been our saving grace. Long-term, things
look extremely good.'
Leeds certainly seems to have got off lightly. There has been more of a
knock-on effect from a distressed outside world than internal pain. The
reasons appear to be:
the city's optimum size of about 700,000 people;
population stability - unlike other northern cities, it is not struggling
with declining local tax and spending bases;
a heterogeneous industrial and commercial mix that allows different sectors
to function counter-cyclically to each other or out of phase with the
national economic cycle;
its role as the financial and professional services capital of the east
Pennines;
flexibility of labour - for decades Leeds' sectoral spread has made it
normal for people to switch between industries and learn new skills,
establishing a change-accepting culture;
its location on the M62 at the end of the M1, a pivotal point in northern
England;
the proximity of the Humber ports, the north's fast-growing gateway to
European markets;
the Leeds Initiative, a partnership of private and public sectors, has
concentrated on improving stations, roads into the centre and corridors
through it - fundamental developments which affect the look and feel of a
city;
a large injection of public spending in the form of inward investment.
This last factor has been significant during the recession. In 1989 the
government decided to relocate most of the departments of health and social
security to Leeds. Mr Jon Trickett, leader of the Labour-controlled city
council, puts the direct value of this at Pounds 60m of construction work to
house the departments and 2,000 jobs.
Indirect benefits include a growing demand for supporting services, from the
highly professional to the mundane. All local markets - from office space to
sandwich bars - will be boosted.
Another area of large public sector spending is education. The city's two
universities - Leeds and Leeds Metropolitan, the former polytechnic - are
growing towards 17,000 students each and combined budgets of more than
Pounds 200m.
Prof Alan Wilson, vice-chancellor of Leeds University, is a geographer, so
he can speak with authority on the impact. He puts the economic multiplier
at between 2 and 2.5. This includes another major impact on the construction
sector: the university has 6,000 units of student accommodation and needs to
add 500 a year to cope with growth, a Pounds 5m annual capital commitment.
Private sector arrivals in Leeds include British Telecom's mobile
communications division, which is expanding to 767 full-time equivalent
staff in the city this year. It moved north from Euston Tower two years ago,
eliminating London weighting from salaries and reducing rents from Pounds 53
to Pounds 11 a sq ft.
Mr Paul Pagliari, head of personnel, says the ease of access from Leeds to
other parts of the country was another deciding factor, coupled with good
labour markets and prospects - since realised - of lower staff turnover.
Location was also considered crucial by Mr Ken Rigby, one of five general
managers of Midland Bank, who last year moved out of London as part of
Midland's campaign to devolve power and so rebuild relationships with
customers.
He now oversees all of the bank's northern operations from Leeds, which he
chose in preference to Manchester, because 'it is right in the middle of my
patch'.
Seasoned observers find the relationships between banks and their business
customers less strained than elsewhere - another indicator of lower levels
of economic distress.
'Leeds has a wide commercial and industrial base and has withstood recession
a lot better than the south of England,' says Mr Alastair Thompson of
Barclays. 'We do have customers with problems, but by and large there are
many well-managed businesses and we are happy with each other.'
Yorkshire Bank, which is now Australian-owned but continues to enjoy a long
tradition of local loyalty, claims 20 per cent of the market among small and
medium-sized businesses. 'There will be casualties in the recovery,' says Mr
David Knight, chief executive. 'Some companies which have got through the
recession will have been too weakened by it to take advantage of any upturn,
but we will try to help. But there are still a lot of good businesses
around.'
Nonetheless, London-based banking decisions have been seen as damaging by
some Leeds companies. Bank of Scotland, which moved to Leeds in 1985 looking
only for corporate business, has picked up several companies that have
fallen out with their bankers.
'We had to be in Leeds because of the expansion of its professional
community,' says Mr Austin Reilly, Bank of Scotland's regional director.
'Small or medium-sized owner- managed businesses are our target. Leeds has
so many of them.'
Mrs Andrea Ingham, of Leeds training and enterprise council, says there are
more than 30,000 businesses in the city, of which 17,500 are VAT-registered.
Of the latter, 47 per cent employ fewer than five people, but only 14 per
cent more than 25. This provides a stable overall structure, but with many
opportunities for local mergers and acquisitions.
Deals did, however, slow almost to a stop in the recession. 'It became
almost impossible to get senior debt,' says Mr David Buckley, who heads
Ernst &amp; Young's corporate advisory services in Leeds. 'Some banks went out
of the market. They won't admit it; but they did. They just turned
everything down.'
He says there is renewed activity now, with companies looking for
acquisitions and willing to make decisions. 'We expect to see some companies
cutting costs and declaring redundancies in the spring. But another tier
have done a business plan for the next 12 months and are taking the first
steps to doing something.
'We don't know when the recession is going to end but a lot of uncertainty
has now gone away,' Mr Buckley adds.
Some Leeds companies, such as Waddingtons, the high technology and security
printers, have done particularly well despite recession, investing Pounds
96m in the last five years, while turnover has topped Pounds 200m a year.
Its product range now runs from stamps to ultra-thin plastic margarine tubs.
Another printer, Opax, a recent management buy-out from Norton Opax, expects
to do well out of printing Britain's new lottery tickets.
Mr Ian Bainbridge, managing director of Computer Services for Industry, says
markets are now harder because companies will only buy products which add
value or improve productivity. The 'nice-to-have-even-
though-we-don't-really-need-it' extra sales of the late 1980s have
evaporated. But export opportunities - accounting for a quarter of his
output - are better after devaluation.
Mr Richard France, of the surveyors Erdman Lewis, says there is a cautious
optimism that was absent before Christmas. 'Confidence fell so low after
Black Wednesday, it could not go lower. The only way after that was up.
'We might all have looked like tortoises to the hares in the south in the
1980s, but we now have a stability they do not and can plan for the future,'
he adds.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: UK gilt prices mixed after Bank auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK government bond prices were mixed in the wake of the Bank of England's
Pounds 2.5bn auction of 8 1/2 per cent Treasury stock. Dealers said that
although the market was long of stock at current levels, prospects had
improved now that the auction was out of the way.
Cover on the auction was 1.18 times, the lowest since the Bank resumed its
auctions in April 1991, but above the all-time low of 1.07 times reached in
January 1988. The 'tail' was also long at  7/32 , which compared with just
1/32 or  1/16 in previous auctions.
After the auction, the Bank of England issued a further Pounds 550m worth of
existing gilts: Pounds 300m of 8 per cent gilts due 2003 at 124 7/16 ;
Pounds 100m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked gilts due 2001 at 162; and Pounds
150m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked gilts due 2009 at 147 1/8 .
The Liffe March long gilt futures contract fell to 100.26 immediately after
the auction results but then climbed to the day's high of 101.09. It closed
at 101.03, down  1/16 on the day on volume of 55,937 lots.
GERMAN government bond prices got some support from the successful auction
of 7 1/8 per cent 10-year bonds for the Treuhand privatisation agency which
raised DM4.76bn.
However, dealers said the shorter end of the market underperformed the
longer end as remarks by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank's president, on
Tuesday dashed hopes of an early cut in domestic interest rates.
The Liffe March bund futures ended 0.12 point higher at 92.83 in average
volume of 42,770 lots. Dealers who are expecting a downward correction in
the market said the contract could fall to around 92.30.
FRENCH government bond prices also came under pressure at the short end as
rate cut hopes faded in spite of a firm franc. The market was weighed down
by news that Standard &amp; Poors, the US credit rating agency, may downgrade
the credit rating of six French banks.
The 8 1/2 per cent OAT due 2003 ended down 0.19 point at 103.80 to yield
7.95 per cent, while on the Matif, the March bond futures contract closed at
112.92, down 0.14 on the day in volume of 125,662 lots.
US TREASURIES rose across the maturity range after strong demand at the
afternoon sale of new five-year notes erased the market's bad memories of
Tuesday's much less successful two-year note auction.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/32 at 104
19/32 , yielding 7.240 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was even firmer, up  3/16 at 99 31/32 , yielding 4.250 per
cent.
The lack of demand for the two-year notes on Tuesday caught dealers and
investors by surprise, and cast a cloud over the auction of Dollars 11.5bn
in five-year notes scheduled for the afternoon. Early indications that
demand for the five-year issue would be strong, however, helped buoy prices
in morning trading.
Strong demand for the new issue resulted in the five-year notes being
awarded at a yield of 5.66 per cent, better than expected.
Prices were also helped by comments from Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of
the Federal Reserve, who said that while the economy was growing at a
quicker pace, it was still moving into 'headwinds'.

FT  28 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: New French futures contract
welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE new French futures contract based on long-dated government bonds is
expected to get a warm reception when it starts trading today on the Matif,
the Paris futures exchange.
Traders expect the FLT contract to be popular both with speculators and with
investors seeking to hedge their portfolios. It will be one of the few
contracts in Europe, apart from those in the Ecu and Dutch markets, whereby
investors can play the yield curve up to 30 years.
Daily volume is expected initially to be around 20,000 contracts, but should
increase. However, the Matif's 10-year bond future, which trades an average
of 120,000 contracts a day, is expected to remain the most active.
The creation of the French treasury bond futures contract has been made
possible by the existence of a mature underlying market, itself the result
of the government's decision to extend its debt profile in recent years. The
total outstanding of cash OATs with a maturity of 15 years and over now
stands at FFr178.9bn.
Since 1987, average monthly issuance in France has increased progressively,
and in 1992 average volume per month was around FFr8bn. The French treasury
has announced that it will issue FFr220bn worth of OATs, of which almost
half is expected to be at the longer end.
Four OATS, due 2008, 2012, 2019 and 2023, totalling FFr172.3bn, will be
deliverable into the FLT contract, of which the OAT due 2023 will be the
cheapest to deliver into the March contract.
Groupe Worms has joined Robert Fleming, the UK bank, in taking a controlling
minority stake in Ifabanque, one of the few Arab institutions still
operating in the west.
Banque Worms, part of the UAP group, has ceded its place in Ifabanque, which
is two-thirds owned by Kuwaiti and Saudi Arabian shareholders, to Groupe
Worms.

FT  28 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Controversy hits Sweden's Samurai issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S Y200bn Samurai bond issue arranged by Nomura Securities yesterday
became the subject of controversy when the three other leading Japanese
securities houses set a precedent by refusing to participate, citing the
aggressive pricing of the transaction.
Their refusal is particularly embarrassing for Nomura because of the high
profile of the deal, the largest issue to date in the Samurai market (the
Japanese domestic bond market for foreign borrowers).
The controversy has also dealt a blow to the development of a market once
seen as a dumping ground for aggressively-priced deals. Under pressure from
the Ministry of Finance, the securities houses last year reformed the market
by bringing in practices already common in the Eurobond market, such as the
fixed price re-offer mechanism and consensus pricing, designed to improve
transparency.
Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi all told Nomura that they did not see any demand
for four-year bonds with a 4.2 per cent coupon and priced at par, but Nomura
went ahead with the pricing as planned.
'There are quite a few competing products for Japanese investors, offering
yields around that level or better,' said an official at one of the
securities houses which stayed out of the deal.
They also pointed out that Sweden's recent five-year Eurobond is currently
yielding 66 basis points over the JGB yield curve, while the new four-year
Samurai issue is yielding only 44 basis points more than the four-year JGB.
The two markets are not directly comparable, as they are made up of
different investors, and most traders report stronger demand in Japan than
in Europe for yen bonds.
An official at Nomura pointed out that the three securities houses were the
only underwriters to decline, while 41 other institutions agreed to join the
underwriting group, and added that it had placed nearly half the transaction
on its own by the end of the first day.
Meanwhile, new issues in the Eurobond market yesterday were spread across a
variety of currency sectors. Finland's successful Dollars 1bn global
offering, launched on Tuesday, was priced at the narrow end of the indicated
range to yield 63 basis points over the comparable US Treasury.

FT  28 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Government debt auctions will
test investors' appetite / Review of the arguments for the convergence of
European bond yields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE two auctions of government debt due to be held today in France and Spain
will prove important tests of investor appetite for high-yielding bonds. For
as tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism ease, bond market
analysts and investors have begun to re-examine the arguments for
convergence of European bond yields.
For the first time since April, France has decided to sell Ecu-denominated
government bonds, representing the first sovereign issue of Ecu bonds since
Denmark rejected the Maastricht treaty on European economic and monetary
union and threw the Ecu and European bond markets into a state of confusion.
Spain, meanwhile, is holding an auction of new three, five, and 10-year
bonds. The coupons are higher than on the existing issues, providing a more
realistic picture of yields in the secondary market.
Dealers and economists believe that both auctions are likely to go well.
France is due to issue between Ecu500 and Ecu700m of 8 per cent OATs due
2003. Mr John Hall, economist at Swiss Bank Corporation, described the
French Ecu auction as 'very significant' adding that 'the French are helping
to rebuild the credibility of the market'. Earlier this week, the Bank of
England said it would resume issuing three-year Ecu notes.
Other market analysts have said it is 'psychologically important' for the
market that France is creating a new 10-year benchmark, rather than
reopening an existing issue'.
Mr Kit Juckes, economist at S. G. Warburg Securities, said the decisions by
France and the UK 'show a willingness by governments to get the Ecu bond
market up and running again'. The French auction is expected to go well,
given that the amount involved is not particularly large.
Even though Ecu yields have come down from a maximum of just above 200 basis
points over 10-year German bonds in October to around 110 basis points
recently, they are still yielding more than 10-year French franc denominated
OATs. In other words, it is costing the French treasury more to raise the
funds in Ecu than it would in francs.
The Spanish government bond market has seen strong buying interest from UK,
US and European investors recently as tensions within the ERM have eased,
allowing Spain to cut interest rates on Friday. Investors have been keen to
lock into high-yielding Spanish paper on expectations of further falls in
yields. Ten-year Spanish bond yields have fallen from their October peak of
14.03 per cent to around 11.75 per cent recently.
'The convergence argument is back on track to a certain extent,' says Adrian
James, international bond analyst at NatWest Capital Markets.
While ERM tensions appear to have eased recently, analysts point out that if
the Irish punt is forced to devalue, tensions could resume. The French franc
may also come under pressure again closer to the French general election.
More importantly, bond analysts say investors will probably have to wait for
the Bundesbank to cut German interest rates before other European central
banks can safely follow suit.
Although Spanish bond yields have fallen back dramatically, they are still
above the levels seen in early 1992. So the bonds to be auctioned today -
the 11.85 per cent bond due 1996, the 11.45 per cent bond due 1998, and the
10.90 per cent bond due 2003 - have higher coupons, reflecting the rise in
yields in the secondary market.

FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Campbell Soup lifts Arnotts
stake to 39%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARNOTTS, the Australian biscuit company, yesterday claimed that Campbell
Soup, the US food group, was unlikely to hold more than 50 per cent of its
shares when a hostile takeover bid closes today.
Mr Bill Purdy, Arnotts' chairman, said the board had been assured that
family shareholders who own 20 per cent of the stock would not accept
Campbell's offer price of ADollars 9.50 a share. He added he was convinced
other family shareholders, who own a further 6 per cent of the stock, would
also refuse the offer. He said talks with financial institutions had been
'encouraging.'
Campbell, which owned 33 per cent of Arnotts before the bid, said it
received acceptances for 5m shares yesterday, increasing its stake to just
under 39 per cent. The higher shareholding entitles Campbell to increase its
representation on Arnotts' board from two to three under a 1985 shareholding
deal between the two companies. But a New South Wales court ruled recently
the deal required Campbell to acquire over 85.1 per cent of Arnotts before
it could take control of the board. Campbell has said the offer will not be
increased, and dismissed suggestions it will launch a higher offer after the
existing bid closes. The bid values Arnotts at ADollars 1.3bn (USDollars
928m),

FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Westpac chief re-elected after
holder action

<TEXT>
WESTPAC, the troubled Australian bank, finally concluded its adjourned
annual meeting yesterday, but not before shareholders forced a poll on the
re-election of Mr John Uhrig, the recently-appointed chairman.
Mr Uhrig was subjected to further attacks by small shareholders, who forced
the adjournment of the meeting last week after angry criticism of the bank's
financial performance. However, Mr Uhrig and another director subject to
re-election were both re-elected by a large majority with the support of
institutional and corporate shareholders.
However, rebel shareholders blocked two changes to the bank's deed of
settlement recommended by the board to bring the bank in line with federal
corporations law. The changes, which would have abrogated elements of a 19th
century Act of Parliament, failed by a small margin to achieve the approval
of 75 per cent of shareholders at the meeting, as required by the deed.
Westpac announced on Sunday that Mr Robert Joss, a vice-president of Wells
Fargo, the US investment bank, would take over next month as managing
director, replacing Mr Frank Conroy. There was criticism of the five-year
contract offered to Mr Joss, which includes options for 5m Westpac shares
which could be worth up to ADollars 8m (USDollars 5.7m), depending on the
bank's share price. However, most shareholders supported the appointment. Mr
Joss faces a challenge in turning round Westpac, which reported a record
loss of ADollars 1.5bn for the year to end-September, after bad debts of
ADollars 2.6bn and a US tax liability of ADollars 106m.

FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Restoring faith in a banking
system - Japan's CCPC will tackle the industry's problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON ARRIVING at work, staff at the banks' new self-help organisation will be
forcefully reminded of the property collapse that triggered Japan's banking
crisis.
The offices are on the top floor of a half-empty building in an area of
Tokyo which during the 'bubble' years of the late 1980s was a thriving
business district.
Formally established yesterday, the Cooperative Credit Purchasing Company
(CCPC), as the loan buying organisation is known, will open its doors on
Monday to financial institutions and their non-performing loans. But the
opening has been rushed and staff have had little time to prepare for the
task of restoring confidence in the banking system.
In defending the organisation against criticism that it is little more than
a paper company, Japanese banking officials argue the CCPC is 'a genuine
attempt to meet our problems head on'.
However, the two executives and 22 staff of the CCPC will handle only a
small portion of the estimated Y50,000bn (Dollars 405.5bn) in non-performing
loans which weigh heavily on he banking system and the Japanese economy.
The CCPC's first task will be to enable Japanese banks to write-off a part
of their property exposure. If the banks bring in their bad loans before a
February 5 deadline, there will be enough time to assess the collateral and
name a buying price for the loan credit, allowing the institution to
declare, for tax purposes, a loss at the close of the financial year on
March 31.
A second function of the CCPC is to establish a floor under property prices,
which have fallen about 40 per cent over the past two years. After
collecting the prices of the property collateral, which will be valued by
independent assessors, the CCPC will either release details of individual
deals or produce an aggregate index to try to stimulate the property market.
The Federation of Bankers' Associations estimates Y500bn in non-performing
loans will be handled in the first year of the organisation's life, expected
to be 10 years. The federation insists this will alleviate the bad-loan
burden, which officially rose by 54 per cent to Y12,300bn over the six
months to end-September for the 21 leading Japanese banks.
There is no doubt the CCPC, through its paper shuffling, will speed tax
write-offs, but doubts remain about its ability to revive the property
market or the banking system. Stronger banks will benefit most, as each of
the 162 member-institutions will have to provide the CCPC with the funds to
buy its own non-performing loans.
Under tax laws, a write-off can only be made if an institution can prove it
has lost money, generally through the sale of the collateral. By providing
an independent valuation and, technically, 'buying' the loan at market
value, the CCPC will enable banks to book a loss, even though the deal is
done with its own money.
The finance ministry has indicated these write-offs will be accepted, but
has apparently indicated that banks should exercise self-restraint, as tax
revenues are declining and the budget deficit is widening. There will also
be pressure on the independent property valuers hired by the CCPC, as the
higher the valuation of the property collateral, the lower the tax write-off
and the higher the apparent floor under property prices. But Mr Masaaki
Tanaka, senior manager of the corporate planning division at Mitsubishi
Bank, which has played the leading role in establishing the CCPC, said the
valuers must be objective in their estimates, otherwise their reputation
would be harmed.
Mr Shinichiro Goto, president of the CCPC and a former senior managing
director at Mitsubishi Bank, said specialist housing loan companies may be
eligible for help after they devise restructuring plans. He insisted the
banking industry would look after its own, and not require direct government
assistance.
However, troubled Japanese regional banks are already receiving assistance
from the Bank of Japan, which has increased its lending at the official
discount rate of 3.25 per cent, allowing ailing regional institutions and
their commercial bank backers to fund restructuring programmes.
The self-funding character is a point of honour for the banks, as is the
independence of the appraisal committee. In assessing prices, the committee
will not only value the land collateral, but will examine the assets of any
guarantors and review the company's cash-flow and earnings potential.
From beginning to end, the bank which made the initial loan will be held
responsible. When the property collateral is finally sold, it will be forced
to book another loss if the amount was less than the CCPC appraised value.
And, if at the end of the CCPC's life the property is unsold, the same bank
will be responsible for finding a buyer.

the adjournment of the meeting last week after angry criticism of the bank's

Westpac announced on Sunday that Mr Robert Joss, a vice-president of Wells
Fargo, the US investment bank, would take over next month as managing
director, replacing Mr Frank Conroy, who resigned last month.
Mr Uhrig said the bank hoped to emulate the successful restructuring of
Wells Fargo over the last few years. He said the restructured bank was
'pretty close to the way we think Westpac should be in the future.'
There was criticism of the five-year contract offered to Mr Joss, which
includes options for 5m Westpac shares which could be worth up to ADollars
8m (USDollars 5.7m), depending on the bank's share price. However, most
shareholders supported the appointment.
Mr Joss faces a significant challenge in turning round Westpac, which has
suffered a series of reverses, climaxing in a record loss of ADollars 1.5bn
for the year to end-September, after bad debts of ADollars 2.6bn and an
unexpected US tax liability of ADollars 106m.
Five directors, including the then chairman, resigned last year after a
ADollars 1.2bn rights issue was largely ignored by shareholders, leaving 72
per cent of the shares in the hands of sub-underwriters.
The board lost two more directors earlier this month when Mr Kerry Packer
and an associate quit after Mr Uhrig and other directors rejected calls for
a significant acceleration of the restructuring programme.
Mr Packer, the Australian publishing entrepreneur, is Westpac's
second-largest shareholder with 10 per cent of the shares, half of which is
in the form of options.

FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Nachi hits Y16bn loss as finance
failures bite

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NACHI-FUJIKOSHI, a leading maker of bearings and machine tools, yesterday
revealed the scars inflicted by diversification into financial business
during the late 1980s by announcing a net loss of Y16.4bn (Dollars 132.3m)
for the year to November and suspending dividends for the first time since
1968.
The company, which reported a net profit of Y307m in the previous period,
was also hit by the downturn in capital spending by Japanese manufacturing
industry, leading to a 20.9 per cent fall in sales to Y132.4bn.
Nachi was one of Japan's best-known exponents of zaiteku, or financial
speculation, during the late 1980s when many conservative industrial
companies invested heavily in the stock market.
The stock market collapse over the past three years has created large stock
appraisal losses and large unreported property losses, undermining core
businesses of several leading companies. Nachi-Fujikoshi reported a stock
appraisal loss of Y7.96bn for the year.
Along with many other Japanese companies, Nachi established a financial
subsidiary during the 1980s, and the parent company was forced to write-off
Y5.5bn in loans and guarantees.
'We foresee difficulties ahead, but the company is intending to lift its
business performance,' said Nachi, which has begun a three-year streamlining
programme aimed at reducing its workforce of 4,800 by about 500 people.
The combination of the collapse in asset prices and weak industrial demand
has severely weakened the company. For the current year, Nachi expects a
pre-tax loss of Y1.8bn (Y4.8bn loss), and sales of Y123bn, down 6.8 per
cent.

FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Campbell's stake in Arnotts
'unlikely to exceed 50%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARNOTTS, the Australian biscuit company, yesterday claimed that Campbell
Soup, the US food group, was unlikely to hold more than 50 per cent of its
shares when a hostile takeover bid closes today.
Mr Bill Purdy, Arnotts' chairman, said the board had been assured that
family shareholders who own 20 per cent of the stock would not accept
Campbell's offer price of ADollars 9.50 a share.
Mr Purdy said he was convinced that other family shareholders, who own a
further 6 per cent of the stock, would also refuse the offer.
He said that discussions with financial institutions had been 'encouraging.'
Campbell, which owned 33 per cent of Arnotts before the bid, said it
received acceptances for 5m shares yesterday, increasing its stake to just
under 39 per cent.
The higher shareholding entitles Campbell to increase its representation on
Arnotts' board from two to three under a 1985 shareholding agreement between
the two companies.
However, a New South Wales court ruled recently that the agreement required
Campbell to acquire more than 85.1 per cent of Arnotts before it could take
control of the board.
Campbell has said the offer will not be increased, and has dismissed
suggestions it will launch a higher offer after the existing bid closes.
However, most analysts expect a second offer later this year.
The bid, which values Arnotts at ADollars 1.3bn (USDollars 928m), could also
be extended. Arnotts shares, which have traded consistently above the offer
price, closed 2 cents higher at ADollars 9.52 on the Australian Stock
Exchange.
MR Michael Nugent, chief executive of Goodman Fielder, the Australasian food
group, said there was 'no basis' to market rumours that the group was likely
to be the target of a hostile takeover bid.
'It is just idle talk as far as we are concerned. There is no basis for it
at all,' Mr Nugent said. He said the group attributed the speculation to
increased interest in food stocks.

RESTRUCTURING and debt redemption charges caused a Dollars 230m
fourth-quarter loss at Du Pont, the leading US chemicals group.
For the whole of 1992, Du Pont saw its underlying income before charges
slump to Dollars 975m from Dollars 1.4bn in 1991. The company, however,
suffered a full-year net loss of Dollars 3.9bn, or Dollars 5.85 per share,
after recording Dollars 5.1bn of special charges related to changes in
accounting standards concerning employee benefits and income taxes.
Du Pont, which is engaged in a sweeping two-year reorganisation that
involves asset sales, management changes and redundancies, said the
full-year 1992 results included Dollars 463m of charges related to
restructuring.
This charge also took in cost reduction programmes and payments made in
relation to the recall of Benlate, a fungicide.
Full-year after-tax operating income - excluding the impact of accounting
charges - was Dollars 326m for the chemicals division, up from Dollars 300m
in 1991. The fibres division had Dollars 582m of such income, up from
Dollars 561m in 1991.
The polymers business earned Dollars 415m, up from Dollars 249m, and the
Conoco petroleum business saw profits drop to Dollars 480m from Dollars 854m
in 1991. Diversified businesses earned Dollars 241m against Dollars 197m in
1991.
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 1992 were Dollars 9.3bn, down from
Dollars 10bn. Revenues for the whole of 1992 were Dollars 37.8bn, 2 per cent
higher than 1991 after adjustments were made to reflect a new joint venture
in coal.
Mr Edgar Woolard, Du Pont's chairman, said business conditions in the US
continued to be difficult during 1992. He said there was also a significant
weakening in markets outside the US during the latter part of last year,
particularly in Europe.
Mr Woolard said that once accounting and other non-recurring charges were
stripped out, earnings for the full year were nearly equal to 1991 levels,
despite the poor operating environment.
Union Carbide, the Connecticut-based chemicals group, reported Dollars 17m
of net income in the fourth quarterof 1992, compared with a loss of Dollars
63m in the same quarter of 1991.

<TEXT>
GENERAL Dynamics, the US defence contractor which has been selling off large
pieces of itself, yesterday reported a 5 per cent increase in fourth-quarter
net earnings.
The company said its latest disposal - the proposed sale of its tactical
military aircraft business to Lockheed for Dollars 1.525bn - was expected to
be completed in February and bring in more than Dollars 1bn in additional
cash, net of taxes and transaction costs.
General Dynamics ended 1992 with some Dollars 950m in cash and marketable
securities.
The company's fourth-quarter net earnings totalled Dollars 174m, or Dollars
5.59 a share, compared with Dollars 166m, or Dollars 3.87, in the
corresponding period of last year. The company repurchased some 30 per cent
of its shares outstanding last July.
Earnings from continuing operations, which excludes businesses up for sale,
totalled Dollars 153m, or Dollars 4.92 a share, on sales of Dollars 915m.
This included a tax credit of Dollars 95m and a Dollars 14m after-tax gain
from the sale of securities. Fourth-quarter 1991 earnings from continuing
operations were Dollars 7m, or 16 cents a share.
For the full year, total net earnings were Dollars 815m, or Dollars 21.56 a
share, against Dollars 505m, or Dollars 11.80, in 1991, on revenues of
Dollars 3.4bn, up from Dollars 3.3bn.
The company's funded backlog for continuing operations at the end of 1992
stood at Dollars 7.7bn, down from Dollars 8.7bn at the end of 1991.
The company's nuclear submarines operations earned Dollars 25m in the fourth
quarter, up from Dollars 21 a year ago, while armoured vehicles made Dollars
40m, compared with Dollars 26m. Space launch systems lost Dollars 13m,
against a loss of Dollars 21m in 1991.

<TEXT>
PHILIP Morris, the large tobacco, food and beer manufacturer, yesterday
reported a 17.5 per cent increase in after-tax profits last year, before the
effect of accounting changes, to Dollars 4.93bn.
The result was scored on a 4.7 per cent rise in operating revenues, at
Dollars 59.1bn.
In the fourth quarter alone, Philip Morris posted after-tax earnings of
Dollars 1.2bn. This compared with Dollars 767m last time, but the previous
year's figure was depressed by a Dollars 455m charge to cover restructuring
in the food division.
Operating revenue in the final quarter rose from Dollars 13.7bn in 1991 to
Dollars 14.9bn last year - an 8.9 per cent improvement.
Philip Morris's earnings per share last year stood at Dollars 5.45, up by 20
per cent over the 1991 (again, before accounting-related charges).
The company had already signalled that it expected a rise of one-fifth in
earnings per share, and the shares edged ahead only Dollars  1/8 on the news
to Dollars 73 5/8 before the close.
Mr Michael Miles, Philip Morris's chairman, said the group was 'optimistic'
about prospects for 1993. He based this view on 'our growth and productivity
initiatives, increasing volume momentum, and a narrowing of price gaps in a
number of our key categories'.
Philip Morris surprised the stock market at the time of its third-quarter
results when it revealed that US cigarette shipments, in volume terms, had
fallen slightly, and were expected to dip further in the fourth quarter.
Yesterday, it said that cigarette volume for the full-year was down by 0.5
per cent, mainly due the previously-announced stock adjustments in domestic
shipments and lower level of Russian exports.

MCI Communications, the second-largest US long-distance telecommunications
carrier, yesterday reported a 17 per cent increase in fourth-quarter
earnings amid strong revenue and traffic growth.
The company reported earnings of Dollars 160m, or 60 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 137m, or 52 cents, in the same period of last year. Revenues
rose 13 per cent to Dollars 2.76bn from Dollars 2.44bn, while traffic was up
14 per cent.
For the full year, MCI reported earnings of Dollars 589m, or Dollars 2.21 a
share, against Dollars 522m, or Dollars 2.01, in 1991, while revenues were
Dollars 10.56bn, up 11 per cent compared with 1991's Dollars 9.49bn.
The fourth-quarter figures included revenue, less expenses, of Dollars 56m
from a previously-announced intelligent network licensing agreement with
Stentor of Canada. The company recorded one-time costs of Dollars 47m due to
a business reorganisation announced last year.
Mr Daniel Akerson, president, said factors contributing to the 25-year-old
company's first year with revenues over Dollars 10bn included its Friends
and Family programme - an innovative scheme which cuts the price of
residential calls and now has more than 10m customers  - as well as major
contracts reached with clients such as the Federal Aviation Authority.
The company said that in 1993 in would focus on developing its 800 toll-free
services, expansion of its data products, extending its international reach
and developing new technologies such as personal communications services.

<TEXT>
TIME WARNER, the US media group, has announced plans to build in Orlando,
Florida, the most ambitious interactive cable-based home entertainment and
communications network yet attempted in the US on a commercial basis.
The company, which runs the second-largest cable television business in the
US, said it would eventually integrate this new operation, which it calls a
'full service network,' into its other cable markets across America.
The move is an important step in the battle over which industry - cable
television or local telephone companies - will be the main conduit providing
multi-media services to the home.
Mr Gerald Levin, chairman, said that the move 'clearly establishes cable's
technology as the primary pathway for information and entertainment'.
Mr Joseph Collins, chairman of Time Warner Cable, said the full service
network being introduced in Orlando would allow consumers to call up movies
on demand, as well as interactive games and video shopping. It would also
give access to distance learning.
The company has also applied for an experimental licence to test personal
communications services - a kind of mobile telephone system, similar to
cellular telephony - in the Orlando area and also planned to offer customers
access to long-distance telephone service providers.
This is a direct threat to local telephone companies, which derive a large
proportion of their revenues from access charges to link local customers to
long-distance telecommunications groups.
Orlando is one of Time Warner's main cable television markets, with some
500,000 subscribers. The service will operate initially in an area with some
4,000 residential customers.

PEOPLES JEWELLERS, Canada's biggest jewellery chain which is in bankruptcy
protection, is seeking an outside equity infusion as part of its general
restructuring programme.
Peoples, controlled by the Gerstein family of Toronto, had to write off its
CDollars 133m (Dollars 104m) investment in Zale of the US at the end of 1992
and reported a heavy loss. Zale has been operating under Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection.
The restructuring plan has a deadline of February 26, under an agreement
with its principal secured creditor, the Bank of Novia Scotia.

RESTRUCTURING and debt redemption charges caused a Dollars 230m
fourth-quarter loss at Du Pont, the leading US chemicals group.
For the whole of 1992, Du Pont saw its underlying income before charges
slump to Dollars 975m from Dollars 1.4bn in 1991. The company, however,
suffered a full-year net loss of Dollars 3.9bn, or Dollars 5.85 per share,
after recording Dollars 5.1bn of special charges related to changes in
accounting standards concerning employee benefits and income taxes.
Du Pont, which is engaged in a sweeping two-year reorganisation that
involves asset sales, management changes and redundancies, said the
full-year 1992 results included Dollars 463m of charges related to
restructuring.
This charge also took in cost reduction programmes and payments made in
relation to the recall of Benlate, a fungicide.
Full-year after-tax operating income - excluding the impact of accounting
charges - was Dollars 326m for the chemicals division, up from Dollars 300m
in 1991. The fibres division had Dollars 582m of such income, up from
Dollars 561m in 1991.
The polymers business earned Dollars 415m, up from Dollars 249m, and the
Conoco petroleum business saw profits drop to Dollars 480m from Dollars 854m
in 1991. Diversified businesses earned Dollars 241m against Dollars 197m in
1991.
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 1992 were Dollars 9.3bn, down from
Dollars 10bn. Revenues for the whole of 1992 were Dollars 37.8bn, 2 per cent
higher than 1991 after adjustments were made to reflect a new joint venture
in coal.
Mr Edgar Woolard, Du Pont's chairman, said business conditions in the US
continued to be difficult during 1992. He said there was also a significant
weakening in markets outside the US during the latter part of last year,
particularly in Europe.
Mr Woolard said that once accounting and other non-recurring charges were
stripped out, earnings for the full year were nearly equal to 1991 levels,
despite the poor operating environment.
He added that significant gains in the polymers and diversified businesses
helped to offset the downturn in petroleum earnings.
Looking ahead, the Du Pont chairman said cost reduction and restructuring
efforts - including recently announced plans to control employee health care
expenses - were improving the company's global competitive position.
He added that prospects in 1993 would depend largely on the rate of
worldwide economic recovery and continued progress in cutting costs.
On Wall Street, Du Pont's share price before the close was Dollars 46, down
by Dollars  1/8 . Union Carbide, the Connecticut-based chemicals group,
reported Dollars 17m of net income in the fourth quarter of 1992, compared
with a loss of Dollars 63m in the same quarter of 1991. Net profits for the
whole of 1992 were Dollars 107m, against a loss of Dollars 135m in 1991.

Boeing dip 6%
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BOEING, the US aircraft manufacturer which this week announced a sharp cut
in its production programme, also reported a 6 per cent drop in
fourth-quarter earnings, but a 4 per cent increase for 1992 as a whole.
The company reported net earnings before accounting changes of Dollars 377m,
or Dollars 1.11 a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with Dollars 403m,
or Dollars 1.17, in the corresponding period of 1991. Sales were Dollars
7.5bn, against Dollars 7.8bn.
For 1992, it reported earnings of Dollars 1.635bn, or Dollars 4.81 a share,
compared with Dollars 1.567bn, or Dollars 4.56, in 1991. Sales rose from
Dollars 29.3bn to Dollars 30.2bn.
Mr Frank Schrontz, chairman, said Boeing expected 1993 sales to drop to
around Dollars 26bn, with commercial aircraft deliveries dropping to about
340 units, against 441 in 1992.
Mr Schrontz said the increase in 1992 net earnings before an accounting
change was mainly attributable to increased commercial aircraft sales and an
improved operating performance, particularly in Boeing's space and defence
business. The latter returned to profitability, with operating earnings of
Dollars 204m on sales of Dollars 5.4bn.
However, these factors were partially offset by higher research and
development expense, particularly for the company's 777 airliner, lower
interest income and a higher tax rate.

PHILIP Morris, the large tobacco, food and beer manufacturer, yesterday
reported a 17.5 per cent increase in after-tax profits last year, before the
effect of accounting changes, to Dollars 4.93bn.
The result was scored on a 4.7 per cent rise in operating revenues, at
Dollars 59.1bn.
In the fourth quarter alone, Philip Morris posted after-tax earnings of
Dollars 1.2bn. This compared with Dollars 767m last time, but the previous
year's figure was depressed by a Dollars 455m charge to cover restructuring
in the food division.
Operating revenue in the final quarter rose from Dollars 13.7bn in 1991 to
Dollars 14.9bn last year - an 8.9 per cent improvement.
Philip Morris's earnings per share last year stood at Dollars 5.45, up by 20
per cent over the 1991 (again, before accounting-related charges).
The company had already signalled that it expected a rise of one-fifth in
earnings per share, and the shares edged ahead only Dollars  1/8 on the news

Philip Morris surprised the stock market at the time of its third-quarter

Yesterday, it said that cigarette volume for the full-year was down by 0.5
per cent, mainly due the previously-announced stock adjustments in domestic
shipments and lower level of Russian exports.
Within this aggregate figure, domestic shipments fell 2.9 per cent, and
Philip Morris's US market share declined by 1.1 percentage points, to 42.3
per cent.
However, operating profit for the domestic tobacco business was up by 8.6
per cent at Dollars 5.2bn, on a 3.6 per cent increase in revenues, at
Dollars 12bn.
Operating profit from the international tobacco business also advanced
strongly, by 19.1 per cent to Dollars 2bn, on revenues up by 11.6 per cent
at Dollars 13.7bn.
Operating profits from the food businesses overall showed a 10.6 per cent
advance at Dollars 3.3bn, with sales improving by a more modest 3.1 per
cent, at Dollars 29bn.
The Miller Brewing Company, however, turned in a 13.6 per cent decline in
operating profit, at Dollars 260m, on sales 2 per cent lower at Dollars 4bn.

<TEXT>
ROYAL LePage, Canada's leading residential and commercial real estate
brokerage, a sister company of troubled Royal Trustco, suffered a heavy loss
for 1992 and has eliminated its 10 cents-a-share quarterly dividend
completely.
LePage, publicly traded and a household name across Canada, is 53 per cent
controlled by the Edper Bronfman group, which is also seeking a buyer for
Royal Trustco, the country's second-biggest trust company.
LePage has been hit by the recession and property market collapse in Canada.
Commissions are under heavy pressure and the company has been losing market
share to national franchise groups.
LePage posted a 1992 loss of CDollars 16.3m, or Dollars 1.04 a share,
against a profit of CDollars 800,000, or 5 cents, in 1991. Revenues slipped
1 per cent to CDollars 481m.
The company had already cut its dividend last summer, and Trilon Financial,
the Bronfman holding company which controls LePage, has been taking its
dividends in stock for two years.

FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Westinghouse chief resigns after
two and a half years

<TEXT>
MR PAUL Lego yesterday announced he was quitting Westinghouse Electric after
only two and a half years as chairman and chief executive of the troubled
conglomerate, but insisted he had not faced boardroom pressure to leave.
His retirement follows criticism of Westinghouse's management over the past
year by shareholder activists.
Westinghouse has elected Mr Richard Morrow, former chairman of the oil
company Amoco, as chairman while Mr Gary Clark, president of special
operations, will become president and acting chief executive officer. Mr
Morrow has been on the Westinghouse board since 1986.
The board is to look for a new permanent chief executive, and said it would
consider candidates from both inside and outside the company.
Mr Lego he had decided that this was an appropriate time to leave because
last November he had put into place a recovery plan for the group, which has
been struggling for two years with serious property losses in its financial
services business.
The recovery plan, which was welcomed by shareholder activists as a big step
in the right direction, involves Westinghouse getting out of financial
services, cutting its dividend, taking a Dollars 1.13bn after-tax charge and
selling off several businesses to bolster its balance sheet.
Westinghouse shares were little changed on the news.

<TEXT>
DONNAY Industrie, the Belgian sporting goods group, yesterday went into
liquidation after struggling for months to stem its losses and to solve its
financial problems.
The company, which is best known for its tennis racquets and its sponsorship
contract with Mr Andre Agassi, the US tennis star, has a troubled financial
history.
Donnay went out of business in 1988, only to be rescued from the receivers
by Bernard Tapie Finance, the holding company controlled by Mr Bernard
Tapie, the controversial French industrialist then making his name in
financial circles by buying up bankrupt businesses. Mr Tapie later extended
his sporting goods interests by buying Adidas, the German company.
Donnay was restructured under Mr Tapie's ownership. He sold its industrial
interests in 1991 to Carbon Valley of Italy, and then sold the rest of the
company in the same year as part of his divestment programme.
The Donnay trademark is owned by the Walloon regional government.
Despite rationalisation and reorganisation, Donnay has remained in the red
in an intensely competitive international market.

<TEXT>
BSN, France's largest food group, yesterday announced an underlying 5 per
cent increase in net profits last year, a sharp slowdown on its 1991
earnings growth rate.
Net profits were just over FFr3.6bn (Dollars 676m), which represents a
decline on total net profits of FFr3.9bn in the previous year, but an
increase after stripping out the one-off capital gain made by the sale of
BSN's champagne businesses in 1991.
Published turnover rose by 7.2 per cent from FFr66.1bn to FFr70.8bn, but
underlying group sales rose by only 2.8 per cent, after adjusting for
exchange rate changes and the impact of acquisitions, including France Plats
Cuisines, the prepared food business, Pycasa, the Spanish frozen food
business, W&amp;R Jacob, the Irish biscuit producer and Italaquae, the Italian
mineral water supplier.
BSN's operating profits rose by 7 per cent last year, as did cash-flow,
which reached FFr7.4bn, or FFr3.7bn after industrial investments. Its dairy
products branch continued to be the main source of sales, up from FFr23.8bn
to FFr26.1bn over the same period, an adjusted rise of 4.8 per cent, the
strongest growth of any of BSN's divisions.

FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Mercedes-Benz car output set to
fall 5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRODUCTION of Mercedes- Benz cars is expected to fall by around 5 per cent
this year to 505,000, the lowest since 1984.
Car output fell to just under 530,000 last year from 578,000 in 1990 and a
peak of 598,000 in 1987.
Mr Helmut Werner, chief executive-elect of Mercedes-Benz, the automotive
subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial corporation,
forecast a small rise in car sales, however, to 540,000 this year from
530,000 in 1992, helped by the launch of a replacement for its ageing 190
saloon range in the summer.
Car output for the whole of 1993 will be depressed by the urgent need to
reduce excess stocks. Mr Gerhard Liener, Daimler-Benz finance director, said
late last year that Mercedes-Benz had excess stocks of around 35,000 cars
worldwide.
To cut stocks the German luxury car maker has eliminated 25 production days
at its plants since mid-December through extended holidays and short-time
working.
Production of commercial vehicles fell to 277,000 last year from a peak of
296,000 in 1991 and Mr Werner forecast a further fall this year to 260,000.
He said that 1993 would be 'an especially difficult year' financially
despite forecasting a modest rise in turnover to DM68bn (Dollars 43bn) from
DM66bn in 1992.
Mr Werner warned that total west European new car sales this year would fall
by around 7 per cent, due mostly to a drop of up to 15 per cent in sales in
Germany, the single biggest market in Europe. Registrations of new
commercial vehicles in Germany could fall this year by up to 17 per cent, he
said.
Correction: Mercedes-Benz is to produce a 'people carrier' later in the
1990s and not a 'people's car' as incorrectly stated yesterday.

FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Ercros halts plan to close
fertiliser units
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ERCROS, the Spanish chemical conglomerate controlled by the Kuwait
Investment Office, has cancelled a plan to introduce large cuts in its
Fesa-Enfersa fertiliser unit aimed at aiding the unit's disposal, writes Tom
Burns in Madrid.
The decision to rescind the closure of five of the 12 fertiliser plants
followed a judicial decision on Tuesday that rejected an attempt by the
KIO's new management to bring fraud and gross negligence charges against its
former senior executives in Spain.
Grupo Torras, the KIO's Spanish investment arm which owns Ercros, did not
explain its change of mind, but analysts saw it as a response to government
pressure and to the growing protests that the cutbacks had provoked.
Significantly, the decision to retain all the fertiliser units and to
withdraw 1,900 redundancies - half the workforce - was announced by the
employment minister to union leaders.
The debt-laden fertiliser unit accounted for half of Ecros' losses of
Pta16.4bn (Dollars 146.7m) in 1991, three times higher than forecast. Ercros
was put into receivership last summer, and Torras had hoped to rescue it
through the disposal of Fesa-Enfersa.

<TEXT>
REMY-COINTREAU, one of France's leading drinks groups, issued a profits
warning for 1992 because of the sluggish economic environment and the impact
of high French interest rates, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. Remy, which
has extensive interests in champagne as well as its signature Remy-Martin
and Cointreau spirits brands, suffered a 7.5 per cent fall in turnover to
FFr4.39bn (Dollars 823m) in the nine months to December 31.
The company said that it had experienced a recovery in demand during the
third quarter, but this had failed to compensate for the reduction in sales
during the first half.
It did not disclose details of its profit performance in the first nine
months, nor of its probable performance for the full year to March 31.
However, the company confirmed that it anticipated a reduction on its
FFr271m net profits of the previous year.

FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Royal Life regular premiums down 26%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Life, the life assurance subsidiary of Royal Insurance, yesterday
announced a 26 per cent fall in regular premium sales for 1992.
The company blamed this decline to Pounds 56m on lower sales of
mortgage-related products as a result of the depressed residential housing
market.
Total sales were up by 34 per cent from Pounds 293m to Pounds 392m, but the
increase was accounted for by the company's newly-launched single premium
with-profits bond, which raised Pounds 144m.
Total single premiums, including the with-profits bond, rose by 55 per cent
to Pounds 336m.
Mr David Parry, managing director of Royal Life, said he was 'very
encouraged' by the 1992 new premium figures, and added that a 'major
restructuring' within the company had been completed. The share price
remained unchanged on the day at 285p.

Worthington Group suffered a decline in profits to Pounds 305,000 in the
first half, because of difficulties within the button wholesaling business
and the trimmings operation.
On increased sales of Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 6.11m) in the six months to
September 30, pre-tax profits fell 39 per cent from a previous Pounds
496,000.
In order to consolidate the contribution from Hulme Holmberg and Atorp,
which were acquired during the period, the merger method of accounting has
been used. Consequently the comparable results have been restated.
The directors said that moves made to address the problems were unlikely to
make a significant impact until the next financial year.
Earnings per share fell to 1.3p (1.9p).
The interim dividend has been raised to 0.5p (0.3p) with a view to bringing
payments closer to the traditional split of one-third to two-thirds.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Osprey Communications, the advertising and marketing services group,
reported pre-tax profits ahead of expectations at Pounds 90,000 for the six
months to November 30.
The outcome was on turnover of Pounds 10.9m and compared with profits of
Pounds 314,000 on turnover of Pounds 13.1m last time and a loss of Pounds
336,000 on income of Pounds 25.6m at the 1992 year end.
Mr F John French, chairman and chief executive, said the result reflected
increased gross margins and tightly controlled overheads.
Cash flow had been positive for the period, he said, and the company had
repaid part of its term loan. However, bank facilities remained almost fully
committed.
Earnings per share worked through at 0.43p (1.47p). There is no interim
dividend (last time's interim of 0.65p was the sole payment for the year).

FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: All eyes on complicated reshuffle -
Machinations in the Anglo family
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH AND KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO FAR it is unclear why the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa is
reshuffling its world-wide assets again.
All that is known for certain is that Charter Consolidated, the UK
industrial conglomerate, is deep in negotiations to sell most of its 38.4
per cent shareholding in Johnson Matthey, a stake acquired in 1979 during
another Anglo assets shuffle.
As far as most of the investment community is concerned, both Charter and JM
are part of Anglo's extended 'family', a family controlled via a convoluted
chain of minority holdings and the careful selection of directors.
There is also a widespread belief that Anglo wishes to continue its
influence over both JM and its US competitor, Engelhard. The question is how
might this be achieved.
The complex manoeuvres, outlined below and suggested by some analysts as the
answer, says a great deal about the way in which Anglo is perceived to
operate.
According to the analysts, Charter might start the ball rolling by selling
most of its 29.9 per cent Johnson Matthey stake (just under the level which
would automatically trigger a bid under UK takeover rules) back to
Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company, from whence it came 14 years
ago.
This would cost JCI about Pounds 276m, which would have to be raised outside
South Africa because of restrictions on foreign exchange.
To raise the necessary cash offshore, JCI might sell its shareholdings in
the Anglo 'family' diamond trading companies.
The latest balance sheet values these assets at R582m (roughly Pounds 127m).
But, even with the diamond market in recession, a good case could be made
for their sale at well above book value.
The obvious buyer of these shareholdings would be De Beers, which controls
80 per cent of the world's rough (uncut) diamond business.
However, De Beers is not exactly flush with cash, because of the state of
its market, whereas Minorco, the Luxembourg-quoted overseas investment arm
of the Anglo clan, has more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 0.6bn) readily
available.
De Beers could raise some money by selling some Minorco shares back for
cancellation.
More money might be switched into De Beers if Minorco bought the former's
shareholding in Anglo American Corporation of South America.
This would be a logical purchase of assets because Minorco is being
transformed into an operating company with 'hands on' control of its mining
interests.
Meanwhile, Charter would use the money from the Johnson Matthey sale, plus
its present cash pile, to buy back its own shares from Minorco for
cancellation. It would then be entirely divorced from Anglo and its
influence.
Mr Michael Coulson, analyst at Credit Lyonnaise Laing, suggests that, if
something of this sort happened, Minorco would benefit the most.
'Minorco would sell its holding in Charter at well above net asset value,
while it would buy back its own shares at a considerable discount to asset
value. It would boost Minorco's assets per share and its earnings per
share.' At the same time, 'Charter might think gaining its indepen-dence was
worth the price.'
After all this, Minorco would still have plenty of cash to act as Anglo's
spearhead as the group moves back into the Zambian copper industry, which
that country plans to privatise, he suggests.
In case anyone needs reminding, it would be inappropriate for Minorco to
take the simple route and buy the JM stake itself.
Minorco already has a direct shareholding in Engelhard and anti-trust
authorities both in the US and the European Community would certainly object
to it having such a huge influence over both platinum marketing groups.
Also (as the chart shows) Anglo's influence extends to Rustenberg, the
world's leading platinum producer. Platinum is widely employed as a catalyst
in the oil and chemical industries and its use in catalysts to cut pollution
from car exhausts is growing very fast.
Mr Rob Weinberg, analyst at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, says it is
possible that anti-trust pressures have reached the stage where Anglo may
have to let either JM or Engelhard move outside the group's influence.
Anglo bought its Engelhard shareholding because of friendship between Mr
Charlie Engelhard and Mr Harry Oppenheimer, whose family company is still
reputed to influence any important decision within Anglo.
'If it comes to a choice, I believe Engelhard will re-main with Anglo while
there is an Oppenheimer on the Anglo board,' says Mr Weinberg.
While it is tempting to believe that a few elegantly-groomed executives at
Oppenheimer and Co and Anglo pull the strings which set the potential asset
reshuffle in motion, many analysts believe that the impetus came from Mr
Jeff Herbert, the former British Leyland executive who was appointed
Charter's managing director in 1988.
He is known to be uncomfortable about the way Anglo exerts its influence at
long range and is not happy that that influence has forced Charter to keep
about 40 per cent of its assets in a passive investment (Johnson Matthey).
It is also said that he positively dislikes the executives who until
recently were managing Minorco.
Mr Richard Stuart, analyst with Martin and Co, suggests: 'Herbert is forcing
Anglo's and Minorco's hands. He has called their bluff. He has thrown down
the gauntlet and said he has a bid that is in the interests of all
shareholders and challenged them to say no.'
Other observers think it is also relevant that two of Minorco's three
managing directors departed this month as part of a radical board shake-up
which might have been sparked by a massive row - perhaps about the treatment
of the Johnson Matthey stake.
There have been previous Anglo 'family' quarrels.
When Minorco was given Anglo's approval for a dramatic change in style in
1988, its first move was to bid for Consolidated Gold Fields, perceived in
Johannesburg to be another family member.
Gold Fields refused to play ball, mounted a spectacular and often vitriolic
defence and Minorco not only lost the battle but is still nursing its
wounds.
Anglo must sincerely be hoping that there will be no repetition of that
fiasco caused by the JM share sale. However, it would certainly provide some
entertainment in these dull winter days for the rest of us.

FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Margins boost as Securiguard rises to
Pounds 5.74m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECURIGUARD, the security and cleaning company, yesterday reported a 14 per
cent rise in pre-tax profits. However, Mr Alan Baldwin, chairman, said the
US economy was showing only 'glimmers' of life and in the UK there was as
yet no sign of an upturn.
Pre-tax profits in the year to end-November rose from Pounds 5.02m to Pounds
5.74m on sales up 2 per cent at Pounds 165.11m.
Earnings per share rose 2p to 19p and the final dividend is 5.9p, giving a
total of 9.4p, up 10 per cent.
Net debt fell by Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 9.6m, leaving the company with
gearing of about 200 per cent, but interest covered 5.5 times by trading
profits, suggesting that the group has restored some order to its balance
sheet. The dividend is more than twice covered by earnings.
Margins in the largest cleaning and security divisions suffered, but the
smaller communications division, which includes the overnight parcel
service, enjoyed an increase in profitability.
While the performance of the cleaning division improved, the US operation
was adversely affected by the economic slowdown, particularly in New York
where Securiguard has a large presence. The division as a whole made Pounds
2.8m operating profits from sales of Pounds 65.26m.
The security division was hit by poor sales in the first half when the
company said it missed a trend towards cheaper contracts. In the second
half, that mistake was rectified, Mr Baldwin said. Overall the division's
trading profits fell 18 per cent to Pounds 3.45m.
The security division's sales in the same period of 1991 were bolstered by
the effects of the Gulf war and in the last period profits were hit by the
cost of moving headquarters.
City Link, the overnight parcels delivery business, had a record summer. The
personnel division returned a reduced trading loss, down from Pounds 703,000
to Pounds 552,000.

FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Volex seeks Pounds 17.5m to fund expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLEX GROUP, the electrical interconnection products company, has launched a
Pounds 17.5m rights issue to fund a further acquisition in the US, the
group's capital expenditure requirements and to pay off its Pounds 8.2m
borrowings.
Furthermore, Mr Howard Poulson, chief executive, forecast that group pre-tax
profits would double from Pounds 3.68m to Pounds 7.25m in the year to March
31 1993. Volex shares rose 24p to 440p on the day.
The group has acquired Component Manufacturing Services (CMS), along with an
option - for a nominal Dollars 1 - to buy a 40.3 per cent stake in Signmax,
CMS's Irish affiliate, for a total Dollars 4.7m (Pounds 3.1m). Within the
next two years Volex will also acquire a North Carolina site, currently
leased by CMS, for Dollars 720,000.
CMS makes moulded cable assemblies in North Carolina and Massachusetts. It
made operating losses of Dollars 2.1m on sales of Dollars 15.8m in the year
to September 26.
It will be merged with Volex Interconnect Systems, itself a merger between
Cable Products and Icontec, acquired in January and July 1992 for Pounds
14.6m and Pounds 4.31m respectively.
Some 60 per cent of CMS's output is in the instrumentation and medical
electronics market and will complement the west coast medical business of
Mayor, the 60 per cent-owned and Singapore-based data and power cord
manufacturer bought in October for Pounds 6.5m. The balance - in computers -
will bring two or three new OEM accounts, including IBM, to which VIS
already supplies data cables.
Mr Poulson said CMS would be the last buy in the US for some time, and that
the group's focus had now shifted to Europe, in particular eastern Europe
and especially cable assemblies.
In the year to March 1993, capital expenditure will reach Pounds 7.5m,
mainly at the power cable assemblies operations at Pencon in Lancashire and
Mayor in Wales. Some Pounds 7m has been pencilled in for the following year.
In the cash call, 5.27m new shares will be issued on a 1-for-4 basis at 345p
per share. The issue is underwritten by SG Warburg.

FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Aukett plunges into red with Pounds 3.88m
loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUKETT Associates, the London and Glasgow-based architect, made its first
trading loss in its 20-year history and reported a pre-tax deficit of Pounds
3.88m for the year ended September 1992. Last time there were profits of
Pounds 360,000.
Turnover plunged to Pounds 8.53m (Pounds 16.05m) as the depressed state of
the property sector knocked fee income. In addition, the group absorbed
Pounds 2.74m in redundancy charges, bad debt provisions, and property
write-downs, on top of high interest charges.
There is no final dividend. Aukett passed the interim pay-out, and Mr Gerry
Deighton, chairman, said dividends were likely to resume only in the 1993-94
year. Losses per share were 20.77p (0.32p).
Mr Deighton said the group would sell its profitable Nathanial Lichfield
subsidiary, bought for Pounds 1.5m in 1989, to management for Pounds 1m
because it was the only means it had of reducing borrowings. Aukett would
write off Pounds 2.4m in goodwill leading to a net loss of Pounds 2m from
the transaction.
Results from DY Davies, the USM-quoted architect, also reflected the
depressed state of the sector as the group's pre-tax losses increased from
Pounds 426,000 to Pounds 484,000 in the half year ended October 31.
Losses per share were 8.3p (5.4p). There is no interim dividend.

FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: SeaCon sees earnings per share rise

SEA CONTAINERS, the Bermuda-based cargo equipment and ferry group, has
forecast an increase in earnings per share from Dollars 1.95 to between
Dollars 2.10 and Dollars 2.25 for 1992.
In addition, the group is pressing ahead with plans to sell a second Dollars
25m tranche of senior subordinated debentures as part of an overall plan to
sell Dollars 125m as it raises funds to expand its container and high-speed
ferry operations.
Mr James Sherwood, chairman, said the group's fourth quarter results would
show a modest profit against Dollars 0.40 loss per share last time.
He noted that 1991 earnings included a Dollars 0.62 per share contribution
from an Dollars 6.2m out-of-court settlement with British Rail.
SeaCon reported pre-tax profits of Dollars 28.5m (Dollars 27.6m) in the
September quarter.

FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Crown in talks with banks after French bar
disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXECUTIVES of Crown Communications, the troubled radio company, were last
night meeting their bankers following the rejection of plans to sell RFM,
its loss-making French radio station.
The Conseil Superieur de l'Audiovisuel ( CSA ) decided to block the sale to
a consortium which included NRJ, another French pop station, because of
irregularities concerning RFM's relationship with Crown.
The sale was an important part of Crown's strategy for reducing debt and it
is not clear how ANZ and Bank of Scotland, the company's bankers, will react
to the development.
The sale price was expected to be less than Pounds 4m, despite the fact that
the French station's radio masthead was in the Crown books at Pounds 12m.
The CSA decision is not expected to affect the restructuring of the main
Crown broadcasting company LBC, the London station.
Completion of that deal, in which members of the family of Dame Shirely
Porter, the controversial Conservative politician will take a majority stake
is believed to be imminent.
Under the deal LBC would float free of Crown and the banks would receive
equity in place of debt.
It is now much less certain what will happen to Crown.
The CSA said it had taken its decision because Crown had broken French law
by secretly raising its holding in RFM above the legal maximum of 25 per
cent.
The CSA said in Paris yesterday that Crown had been ' very dishonest' in its
handling of the affair, leaving it with no option but to ban the rescue
plan.
Crown's stake in RFM, the authority said, now stood at 70 per cent. The CSA
criticised the company for failing to disclose the full extent of its
investment and for failing to fulfil a commitment to sell 21 per cent of RFM
to the station staff.
The collapse of the rescue plan leaves RFM in a precarious position and
there was speculation that it might have to go into administration.
In October the French courts appointed a 'provisional director' to supervise
the setting up of a new board.
The station, which has the slogan 'Tous les tops, toute la Pop sans les
flops ' ( All the tops, all the hits and none of the flops), has performed
badly in terms of both audience and advertising revenue.
Neither Mr Christopher Chataway, chairman of Crown and chairman of the Civil
Aviation Authority, nor Mr David Haynes, chief executive of Crown, were
available for comment last night.
Meanwhile merchant bank Guinness Mahon, which is putting together a bid for
the LBC licence, which will be advertised in March, has opened talked with
another possible bidder Independent Television News.

FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Allied Textiles eases to Pounds 12.7m but
core strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED Textile Companies, the Yorkshire-based textile manufacturer and
processor, saw pre-tax profits ease from Pounds 13.2m to Pounds 12.7m in the
year to September 30.
However, the group lifted its final dividend to 8.1p (7.9p) for a total
pay-out up at 12.6p (12.3p), covered 2.4 times by earnings of 30.8p (31.7p)
per share.
The contribution from textile activities rose to Pounds 8.64m (Pounds 8.53m)
in an economic climate that the company described as continuing to be
'unsettled.'
Mr John Corrin, chief executive, explained that order books had been down at
two weeks for the past nine months. They would have to rise to six weeks
before the company would think of increasing its workforce.
The textiles profits were struck after Pounds 800,000 of restructuring costs
at four sites, said Mr Corrin.
Mr Corrin ascribed the buoyancy of the textile results to 'quality products,
quality customers and that about 50 per cent of our products go overseas.'
He explained that direct exports accounted for 23 per cent of output, but
that this was bumped up by sales to customers who bought Allied goods on the
dockside, already documented, cleared and in containers ready to be shipped.
He added that the spread of Allied's textile businesses gave it more
protection than other companies enjoyed.
Group turnover grew to Pounds 129m (Pounds 112m), boosted by about Pounds
10m from the Pounds 4.2m acquisitions in France and Belgium. On a
like-for-like basis it was up 5 per cent.
In the UK, the turnover from wool processing was Pounds 22m, carpets Pounds
29m, synthetic operations Pounds 39m, spinning and weaving Pounds 27m, and
knitwear Pounds 3m.
The restructuring, across all divisions, was 'continuing', said Mr Corrin.
Income from financial activities amounted to Pounds 4.06m, down from Pounds
4.63m. Within that, property sales made Pounds 1.33m (Pounds 71,000),
property rental net of operating profits - where the investment properties
are used to shadow tax - came to Pounds 1.7m, traded investments to Pounds
200,000, and cash on deposit amounted to Pounds 2m.
Allied has Pounds 27m cash and Mr Corrin is keen to increase from the
contribution from Europe. Long-term borrowings were up at Pounds 11m (Pounds
6m) after the French and Belgian buys - the group borrows in foreign
currency to avoid exchange rate risks.
COMMENT
Allied divides its watchers. Some see it as secretive - yesterday it held
its first analysts' meeting - and others see it as quiet and canny, saying
it takes time and effort to understand. Certainly, it carefully chooses its
friends in the City. While some are suspicious of the variability of the
profits from financial activities, all agree that the textile results are
impressive. The management has an impressive record for picking up
undermanaged or otherwise distressed businesses, mending them, putting money
in and waiting for the benefits to accrue. It is not afraid to use its cash
in recession. Forecasts are about Pounds 14m pre-tax for the current year,
giving earnings of about 33p and a p/e of about 13.7, which stands at a
small discount to the sector.

FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Pittencrief enters saga of Aberdeen
Petroleum via 17% stake purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMPLICATED saga of Aberdeen Petroleum took another twist yesterday when
Pittencrief, the acquisitive communications and natural resources company,
announced a deal to acquire a 16.6 per cent stake in the Scotland-based
group.
Pittencrief said it had agreed to acquire 8.6m Aberdeen shares at 12.5p each
from a private investor, Mr DJ Hughes.
The Pounds 1.1m consideration would be satisfied by the issue of 335,000 new
Pittencrief shares. Aberdeen closed last night 1p up at 12p, while
Pittencrief fell 5p to 314p.
Mr David Hooker, managing director of Aberdeen, said that Pittencrief's
purchase had come as a surprise. He gave a cautious welcome to the new
investor and said he expected to discuss the 'investment in more detail
shortly' with Pittencrief.
Mr Douglas Sinclair, finance director, refused to comment on whether
Pittencrief intended to launch a bid or play the white knight in Aberdeen's
attempt to fend off hostile proposals from US-based Bellwether. The stake
was seen as an attractive investment.
Analysts speculated that Pittencrief, which has been reportedly seeking oil
and gas assets, had one of two intentions: to bid for Aberdeen or profit
from Bellwether's approach.

FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Richmond Oil &amp; Gas slides Pounds 386,000
into the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RICHMOND Oil &amp; Gas, the struggling natural resources company which lost its
main asset to creditors last summer, plunged into the red with losses of
Pounds 386,000 for the six months to September 30.
The pre-tax return, struck on sales 74 per cent lower at Pounds 1.5m,
compared with a profit of Pounds 23,000 last year. Mr Robert Fox, chairman
and chief executive, said the depressed results reflected the loss of the
Richmond Ranch properties in June.
Stripping out the return from discontinued activities, Richmond incurred
losses before tax and exceptionals of Pounds 781,000 on sales of just Pounds
2,000. There was an exceptional gain of Pounds 130,000 due to a surplus on
asset disposals, including the sale of an equipment supply business and some
oil and gas interests.
Mr David Wilkinson, a director, said liquidity remained tight. However, the
group had cut costs by about Pounds 900,000, including a reduction in
workforce from 200 to 10.
Richmond retained an interest in just 10 producing wells, Mr Wilkinson said.
However, revenue was expected 'shortly' from other assets on which well
tests were being carried out.
An expanded drilling programme was planned in the Panhandle properties in
Texas for the latter part of 1993. Mr Wilkinson said this would be funded by
the cash flow from successful wells drilled by March 31.
Richmond also announced that it had found an investment partner for its
Siberian joint venture. However, the deal had not yet been concluded.
The group said it had completed its drilling programme on the San Juan
Basin, which is up for sale. It expected at least Dollars 5m for its San
Juan interest.
Earlier this year, the SFO launched an inquiry into aspects surrounding
Richmond's 1989 flotation.

<TEXT>
British Fittings Group, the loss-making valves, tubes and non-ferrous metals
distributor, announced the sale yesterday of Astbury &amp; Madeley, its brass
rod operation, and the closure of British Fittings (Non-Ferrous Metals).
Mr Cecil Buckett, finance director, said the group was refocusing on its
core businesses.
The sale price for Astbury had not been settled, while the company's
year-end results would reflect extraordinary provisions for the closure of
the metals operation.

FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: British Helicopters completes Pounds 32.5m
buy-out and refinancing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH International Heli-copters, the helicopter operator which was owned
by Mr Robert Maxwell and has been in administration since soon after his
death in 1991, yesterday completed a Pounds 32.5m management buy-out and
refinancing.
The disposal to management was expected before Christ-mas but ran into
regulatory delays. It is the last trading company in the Maxwell private
group of companies to be sold by the administrators.
The buy-out involved Pounds 12.5m of equity and Pounds 20m of bank debt. CHC
Helicopter Corporation of Canada has taken a 40 per cent stake via a Pounds
6m equity investment. CHC, one of the largest helicopter operators in the
world, wanted full control of BIH but was blocked by the Civil Aviation
Authority.
Two venture capital companies, Brown Shipley Venture Managers and Legal &amp;
General Ventures, have each taken a 20 per cent stake. The companies'
management and employees hold the remaining 20 per cent.
BIH, which Mr Maxwell bought from British Airways just prior to its
privatisation in 1986, operates 20 helicopters in the North Sea oil and gas
industry as well as a scheduled service between Penzance and the Scilly
Isles. It employs nearly 400 people.
Mr Stewart Birt, managing director, said the company would now be able to
seek new contracts in the North Sea as well as bid for contracts coming up
for renewal.
'The company is much healthier now than it has been for a very long time,'
he said.

FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Sea Containers expects an increase to
Dollars 2.25 in earnings per share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEA CONTAINERS, the Bermuda-based cargo equipment and ferry group, has
forecast an increase in earnings per share from Dollars 1.95 to between
Dollars 2.10 and Dollars 2.25 in the year ended December 31 1992.
In addition, the group is pressing ahead with plans to sell a second Dollars
25m tranche of senior subordinated debentures as part of an overall plan to
sell Dollars 125m as it raises funds to expand its container and high-speed
ferry operations.
Mr James Sherwood, chairman, said the group's fourth quarter results would
show a modest profit against Dollars 0.40 loss per share in the same period
in 1991.
SeaCon reported pre-tax profits of Dollars 28.5m (Dollars 27.6m) in the
September quarter.
He noted that 1991 earnings included a Dollars 0.62 per share contribution
from an Dollars 6.2m out-of-court settlement with British Rail.
SeaCon entered litigation with BR over a dispute regarding reciprocal travel
arrangements after the container group acquired Sealink in 1984.
Mr Sherwood said that the group expected earnings this year would be higher
than last year's 'in view of our rapidly expanding marine container leasing
business and imp-roved ferry fleet deploy-ment'.
Improving market conditions for high-yield bonds in the US had allowed the
group to proceed with the total debenture sale, after poorer conditions
limited the sale to Dollars 100m on November 19 last year.

FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Bid for RHM was considered by board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TATE &amp; Lyle seriously considered making a bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall, the
milling and baking group recently bought by Tomkins for Pounds 935m.
Mr Neil Shaw, chairman, replying to a question at Tate's annual meeting,
said it had decided not to go outside its core business, where further
opportunities remained for global expansion. RHM would not have been value
for money as more would have had to be spent to extend a new leg overseas.
A diabetic shareholder asked when the new sweetener Splenda would be on the
market after the disappointment of delayed regulatory approval in the US.
Although it was already for sale in Canada, he was told the best estimate
for its debut in the UK was two to three years.
Another questioner expressed concern about group borrowings of nearly Pounds
900m, before cash and deposits, and gearing of nearly 90 per cent on net
assets of Pounds 720.6m. He asked whether the group would benefit from UK
base rate cuts.
Mr Paul Lewis, finance director, said that with most of the debt in US
dollars, the average interest rate paid had already come down to 7 per cent.
The group was very cash generative and interest payments were covered five
times by operating profit. Lower UK rates would reduce the return on
sterling deposits.

FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: US workers lobby Tate meeting - Union
claims that dispute at Staley has soured relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A US TRADE union told shareholders attending Tate &amp; Lyle's annual meeting in
London yesterday that a dispute at a factory in Illinois was 'souring' the
business.
Leaflets handed out at the entrance to the Barbican Centre, where the
concert hall stalls were packed for the meeting, claimed that demoralised
workers were less productive and that the dispute was giving the sugar and
starch group 'a bad name.'
'Labour relations problems at AE Staley are bad business for you,' declared
the leaflet, produced by the Allied Industrial Workers. It represents 760
hourly-paid workers at the Decatur factory, where management wants to reduce
high costs through flexible working on shifts and in teams, incurring some
job cuts.
Mr Ed Feigen, a shareholder representing the union at the meeting, accused
the local management of showing 'no willingness to negotiate' and of seeking
to provoke a strike so that workers could be replaced.
'Is it possible for Staley to get its employees to be more productive and
efficient if they are treated like the enemy?', he asked. He urged the main
board to intervene.
Mr Neil Shaw, Tate's chairman, replied: 'The need to be competitive is the
most fundamental requirement. Without that we don't have jobs.' He had
'absolute confidence' in the local management.
Mr Larry Pillard, Staley's chief executive officer, said: 'Staley operates
nine other plants where it has an excellent employee relationship.
'At Decatur, they have developed a set of working practices that are simply
out of date and not competitive with practices in other parts of Staley or
the rest of the industry. Changes have to be made.'
He said he believed in 'employee partnership' and denied that a lock-out was
being sought.
Shareholder reaction ranged from a muttered 'hmph, load of nonsense' to a
sympathetic request for the management to bring in a peace maker.
After the meeting Mr Dave Watts, union branch leader, said he hoped
shareholders would press the board to seek a 'common sense solution'.
He also refuted a statement made at the meeting that the dispute was not
about money, claiming that cuts in benefits would cost workers Dollars 3 an
hour out of average pay of Dollars 13.40.
Staley has offered a 10 per cent pay increase over three years and says
workers have been involved in 'designing shifts' at the three other corn
plants, only one of which is unionised. It denied accusations of 'union
bashing'.
Tate acquired Staley in 1988 for Dollars 1.48bn - funded mainly by Dollars
800m debt, of which nearly half has been paid off, and a rights issue. Last
year its profit contribution, before interest, fell by more than Pounds 30m
to about Pounds 65m.
Declining US performance lay behind Tate's first profits fall for 14 years -
it made Pounds 189.5m (Pounds 230.8m) pre-tax on Pounds 3.37bn sales.
One of Mr Shaw's main themes was that with the global sugar market growing
by 2 to 2.5 per cent a year and starch by 5 to 6 per cent, 'we have no need
to do anything other than continue to be more and more efficient.'

FT  28 JAN 93 / George Soros buys Berkeley Group stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Berkeley Group jumped by 13p to 341p yesterday after it was
revealed that Mr George Soros, the Hungarian-born Wall Street money manager,
had built up a 3.19 per cent stake in the Surrey-based housebuilder.
The Quantum Fund, an investment vehicle set up in the Netherlands Antilles
by Mr Soros and advised by the New York-based Soros Fund Management, has
acquired 1.84m shares in Berkeley, while Mr Soros and Lupa Family Partners
have acquired an additional 114,000 shares. Soros Fund Management, which has
a portfolio of more than Dollars 7bn, made more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds
660m) profit speculating against sterling on 'Black Wednesday'.
The holding was revealed after it reached 3 per cent on Monday, triggering
the disclosure requirements of the 1985 Companies Act. No reason was given
for the investments. Berkeley already has a number of large institutional
and other investors including SAAD Investments, a Saudi family investment
group with a 10.37 per cent stake.
Berkeley mostly builds up-market houses and has managed to weather the
recession considerably better than most housebuilders having liquidated its
land bank in late 1988. In the six months to October 31 it raised pre-tax
profits by 27 per cent to Pounds 6.92m and increased its interim dividend by
10 per cent.
Yesterday Mr Tony Pidgley, chief executive, said the investment was a
surprise. 'We take it as a compliment, they are successful investors.'

trade cut the retail and distribution group's interim profits from Pounds
50.1m to Pounds 40.2m. Smith's shares fell 15p to 440p.
Group sales rose 7.1 per cent to Pounds 1.07bn in the six months to November
28. The group benefited from an unchanged pension credit of Pounds 4.6m, but
interest charges rose from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 3.5m. Earnings per share
fell from 14.5p to 10.8p, and the interim dividend was unchanged at 4.3p.
Sir Simon Hornby, chairman, said: 'We still cannot see any clear signs of an
upturn.' If there were a recovery this year, he added, it was likely to be
'slow and uneven'.
Smith's share of losses from Do It All, a chain of do-it-yourself shops
owned equally with Boots, the retail and pharmaceutical group, was Pounds
8.4m compared with a loss of Pounds 900,000 in the corresponding period the
previous year. Boots shares fell 8p to 517p.
Sir Simon said Do It All had held its share of a fiercely competitive
market. There had been less blanket price-cutting in the industry in recent
weeks, although there was still a lot of 'price activity'. He was confident
the chain would recover once the housing market picked up and that Do It All
was 'not going to be a cash gobbler'. He said that, after Smith and Boots
had each put Pounds 5m into the chain in December, with Smith already having
subscribed Pounds 24m in April, no further cash would be needed this
financial year.
In the other UK retail chains, trading profits fell from Pounds 35.6m to
Pounds 30.6m. A 2 per cent drop in sales in November, with customers slow to
start their Christmas shopping, had cost Pounds 3m in profits. Redundancy
costs of Pounds 1m and another Pounds 1m spent on new technology also
contributed to the profit fall.
Sir Simon said Christmas and New Year sales were up 6.6 per cent on the
previous year, although they were down until the last two weeks of that
period.
Falling demand for recorded music meant the Our Price chain made a small
loss, he said. Virgin Retail, of which Smith owns 50 per cent, made a Pounds
100,000 loss.
The group's distribution division raised trading profits 7.3 per cent to
Pounds 16.2m. Smith's US retail operations, which were expanded through
acquisition last year, saw trading profits more than double from Pounds 1.9m
to Pounds 4.2m.

FT  28 JAN 93 / KLM in talks on accord with three European airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM, LONDON

<TEXT>
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is considering launching formal negotiations on
strategic co-operation with Swissair, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and
Austrian Airlines.
The partnership talks are the latest example of the growing trend of
consolidation in the airline industry with carriers scrambling to forge
alliances to position themselves in the newly-liberalised European aviation
market.
The Dutch carrier, whose merger talks with British Airways ended in failure
11 months ago, confirmed that the four European airlines had already had
informal discussions and would now be looking into starting official
negotiations.
KLM declined to say whether it would be seeking an equity link with the
other three airlines, and it refused all further comment on the potential
deal.
SAS said the four carriers had decided to study 'whether official
negotiations on some form of strategic co-operation could lead to a
successful result'.
Swissair, SAS and Austrian Airlines are already grouped in a loose
partnership called the European Quality Alliance, which focuses on
co-operation in marketing activities and flight timetables.
Although Austrian Airlines is smaller, KLM, Swissair and SAS are roughly the
same size and have close similarities in their approach to the airline
business.
In recent months, there have also been signs that SAS and Swissair are
increasingly keen to strengthen their relationship.
Before entering into negotiations with BA, KLM had held talks with SAS on
joining the partners in the European Quality Alliance. These contacts have
now been revived, especially as there appears to be little chance of KLM and
BA resurrecting partnership talks.
The UK flag-carrier is now concentrating on winning US government approval
for its partnership deal and equity investment in USAir, the sixth largest
US carrier.
In Europe, BA has also acquired large stakes in a German and a French
regional airline as well as taking over Dan-Air, the financially troubled UK
carrier, since the breakdown of its talks with KLM. It has also bought 25
per cent of Qantas, the Australian carrier.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Investor interest low at Pounds 2.5bn gilt auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT could face difficulty in funding its heavy public sector
borrowing requirement next year following a poor response to yesterday's big
auction of gilt-edged stock.
Investor interest in the Bank of England's Pounds 2.5bn gilts auction was
the lowest for five years and there were signs that the central bank
accepted bids at a discount to the market price to be sure of selling the
full amount on offer.
However, the Bank said it was satisfied with the outcome of the auction of 8
1/2 per cent Treasury stock due 2007, and later issued three further
tranches of existing gilts worth Pounds 550m.
The low interest could partly be explained by muted demand from marketmakers
in the gilt-edged market, who were still smarting from Tuesday's unexpected
cut in the base rate.
Many, who had gone short of stock in anticipation of the auction, had to buy
back stock at higher prices after the one point cut in the base rate
prompted a sharp rise in gilts prices.
Mr John Shepperd, economist at SG Warburg, said yesterday's response to the
auction implied that the government may have created difficulties for itself
as a result of the timing of the base rate cut. 'The timing reduced the
gilt-edged marketmakers' confidence in the whole process of auctions, which
have been the backbone of the funding system recently,' he said.
The cover, or the amount by which demand exceeds supply, on the auction was
1.18 times, the lowest cover since the Bank of England resumed its auctions
in April 1991, but above the lowest-ever 1.07 times recorded in January
1988.
Another indication that the auction had not been a resounding success was a
much longer 'tail' - the difference between the average accepted price and
the lowest accepted price - of   7/32 . This compares with tails of just
1/32 or  1/16 in previous auctions.
'If you are allowing some investors to take the stock at such a discount,
then you are really very keen to get the stock away,' said Mr Michael Burke,
an economist at Yamaichi.
Economists believe the government is about fully-funded for the current
fiscal year following yesterday's auction, and that any surplus will be put
towards the 1993-94 requirement which they estimate at Pounds 55bn.

FT  28 JAN 93 / Greenspan sees 'hopeful signs of solid growth' in US economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALAN GREENSPAN, the Federal Reserve chairman, yesterday said the pace of
US economic growth was becoming firmer, and signalled that he would
co-operate with the Clinton administration in promoting a sustainable
recovery.
The Fed saw more hopeful signs of a solid recovery and would 'continue
playing a constructive role' in supporting growth, he said under questioning
from congressional Democrats.
However, while appearing to rule out any tightening of monetary policy in
the foreseeable future, he gave no indication that the Fed would cut
interest rates further in response to a White House deficit reduction plan.
President Bill Clinton said yesterday he was unsure whether he could meet
his goal of cutting the deficit by Dollars 145bn (Pounds 95bn) within four
years without having to raise taxes.
He would lay out an economic plan in his State of the Union address on
February 17.
Mr Greenspan said activity had been increasing at a 'firmer pace of late'.
The head winds that had retarded growth had slackened somewhat, but 'this is
not to say that we have clear sailing ahead'.
Households and businesses were still 'struggling to redress structural
imbalances unparalleled in the postwar period' and slow growth abroad was
acting as a drag on exports and output.
Job growth had been abnormally slow because of structural changes in the US
economy, including a 'dramatic improvement in productivity' since early
1991. Much of this reflected efficiency gains following heavy investment in
new computer technology.
While this augured well for long-run growth and international
competitiveness, it implied 'continuing adjustments in the workforce'.
Mr Greenspan was testifying before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress,
his first appearance on Capitol Hill since Mr Clinton's election victory.
Democrats on the committee criticised him for cutting interest rates too
slowly and demanded that he support fully White House and congressional
efforts to revive the economy.
Mr Greenspan said co-operation was 'accelerating' between the Fed and the
administration. The traditional weekly breakfast meeting between the Fed
chairman and the Treasury secretary had been reinstated after a lapse during
the Bush years. Mr George Stephanopoulos, the White House spokesman,
confirmed that the Fed and the White House were trying to co-operate more
fully. He said Mr Clinton and Mr Greenspan 'share the same goals', which
included a recognition of the need for more jobs.
Mr Greenspan expressed support for tough and credible action to reduce the
budget deficit. There was no risk of the economy being weakened by too
ambitious a package of cuts. If long-term interest rates were to fall,
specific actions affecting spending and revenue totals had to be agreed.
However, Mr Greenspan refused to promise lower interest rates in response to
a tightening of fiscal policy. He said low inflation was a 'precondition'
for sustainable growth. The US had to avoid the 'stop-go' cycles of the
past.

FT  28 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is difficult to see yesterday's gilts auction as anything but
disappointing. The scant cover hardly bodes well, especially following the
modest level of government funding in recent months. Expectations were
hardly high following Tuesday's cut in interest rates. Market-makers caught
with short positions had to cover themselves immediately. They scaled back
their auction bids as a result, but investors might equally be forgiven for
being worried about lending to a government capable of such unpredictable
behaviour. After all, the rate cut appears a politically-inspired, hasty
decision taken without much thought to the exchange rate.
The pull of lower short-term rates has so far been strong enough to keep
even long-dated gilts on an even keel, but the pressure of government
funding on institutional cash flow has hardly been felt. This week might
give some taste of things to come; in addition to yesterday's Pounds 2.5bn
auction - and tap issues amounting to Pounds 550m announced in the afternoon
 -institutions have to pay over Pounds 1bn in instalments on earlier
purchases of gilt-edged stock.
Even that may not unsettle the market while it believes Mr Lamont will pull
a rabbit from his hat on budget day. Following the latest rate cut, the
chancellor looks less likely to deliver the kind of tight package which
might curb the PSBR. Some relaxation of the full funding rule is possible.
If Mr Lamont is worried about the response to yesterday's auction, he may be
all the more inclined to act.

FT  28 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: WH Smith
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The problems of the Do It All home improvement chain are turning into a war
of attrition for joint venturers WH Smith and Boots. While the ferocity of
last summer's price fight has abated, there are signs that Texas and B&amp;Q are
keeping up the pressure on poorly placed Do It All. What is even more
worrying is that the parents now seem less convinced that they have found an
answer. No further new money will come from the top to move to better sites
or convert shops to the much-vaunted new format, so it is difficult to see
Do It All improving much unless the housing market turns up decisively. Do
It All fits more naturally with Boots' operations and a single parent might
be prepared to take tough decisions. The cost of leaving the sorry episode
behind might be worth bearing - always supposing that WH Smith can persuade
Boots to take the body away.
None of this would matter if the previously rock-solid high street chains
were still going strong. Video and recorded music sales are very important
to the group, yet the declining teenage audience seems to be turning to
other pursuits. The demise of the singles market and the high price of
compact discs may have caused a structural shift away from recorded music
which minor price cuts will not reverse. There is also the vague threat of
VAT on books and newspapers, which must tempt a cash-hungry chancellor. WH
Smith has suffered from its safe-but-dull image as the market has sought out
recovery stories. It would be doubly unfortunate if the group merely proves
to be dull.

FT  28 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: At sea in a leaky punt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tuesday's UK rate cut has dealt an unkind blow to Ireland. With sterling
weak as a result, the Irish authorities are struggling to keep the punt
within the ERM. Even short term rates of 100 per cent, subsidies to
exporters and an illiquid money market cannot keep speculators at bay. The
punt fell through its floor against the Belgian Franc and the Dutch guilder
yesterday. Assuming the prospect of further rate cuts keeps sterling weak,
Ireland may soon have no option but to desert the ERM, but that need not
mean a crisis which would also engulf the the French franc.
The unfortunate aspect of the punt's weakness is that it coincides with a
market perception that the Bundesbank is again suffering doubts over the
wisdom of lower rates. Neither Germany's budget nor inflation nor wages are
sufficiently under control to warrant any substantial monetary easing. A
discount rate cut seems unlikely before late February or early March. So the
D-Mark is strong, and the Irish problem can be seen as a trigger for strains
which were already waiting to re-emerge in the ERM.
The pressure could spread to Denmark whose unemployment rate has reached
nearly 12 per cent. But it is difficult to over-estimate French
determination to stay the course, notwithstanding the approaching election.
The Bundesbank recognises as much. It has already trimmed its money market
repurchase rate to take pressure off the franc and would surely be prepared
to do so again. There will not, however, be much of a system left if other
currencies keep dropping out. If the Bundesbank is too niggardly, Europe may
enter an era not of monetary union, but of competitive devaluation and
deepening economic gloom.

FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Workers from the New World uptight - Tate &amp;
Lyle faces a stormy AGM because of a dispute in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COULD Britain's Tate &amp; Lyle, which acquired AE Staley, the Illinois-based
corn syrup producer, for Dollars 1.48bn five years ago, face a stormy annual
meeting today in London? Some of its US workers are threatening just that.
They are representatives of Local (branch) 837 of the Allied Industrial
Workers, which counts 800 Staley employees - mainly process-workers,
technicians and mechanical operatives - at the Decatur plant among its
members. Last September, the union's three-year employment agreement with
the company expired, and management's proposed new contract is encountering
stiff opposition.
The fight is not, in itself, about money. The company is offering about 10
per cent, spread over three years, for the average employee, which squares
with labour demands.
What has distressed the union are Staley's demands for changes in working
practices - including the subcontracting of some work, a restructuring of
holiday rights, insurance concessions, 'flexibility' on assigning shifts,
erosion of union seniority rights, and changes to the grievance procedure.
Management says these concessions are needed to keep the plant competitive.
As with so many labour disputes, the contract battle seems to have exhumed
other festering concerns. Union officials, for example, claim that Staley
has fared increasingly badly in terms of safety standards and environmental
issues since Tate took over.
They point to one employee - a 44-year-old maintainence worker called James
Beals - who died after being overcome by toxic fumes while repairing a
processing tank, and to a Dollars 1.6m fine levied by the federal
Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration against Staley in 1991. Staley
replies that it has spent Dollars 10m on safety matters alone since 1990.
Another bone of contention is a pipeline, built recently, between the Staley
corn mills and those of Archer-Daniels-Midland, the big neighbouring
agribusiness which holds a 6 per cent stake in Tate.
The pipeline has never been used, but employees believe that starch slurry
could be shipped through this, making it easier for Staley to operate if it
faced a strike or lock-out. (Staley/Tate says the pipeline is designed to
transfer surplus slurry between the two companies and was not built with an
eye to a labour dispute.)
The present state of play is stalemate. Management and union last met in the
late-autumn, and nothing further is planned. Staley has imposed some aspects
of its proposed contract, although these would be adjusted for any final
contract. 'Collective bargaining never began - it was always dictatorial,'
says Dave Watts, president of the local, who is leading a delegation to
today's AGM in London.
But what makes the Staley dispute noteworthy is the strategy being adopted
by the union - typifying the way the wind is blowing in the organised labour
movement at present.
It is important to realise that Decatur, in terms of US geography, is a
near-neighbour of Peoria. Here, a bruising five-and-half-month strike at
Caterpillar, the earth-moving equipment company, collapsed last year when
management threatened to replace the strikers. With workers' resolve
apparently waning in face of this pressure, the powerful United Auto Workers
union called off the strike, and the company imposed its desired terms.
The Staley local, painfully aware of the Caterpillar strikers' humiliation,
made a conscious decision to tread more delicately. Realising that it is
neither large nor wealthy, it eschewed the strike weapon and, after
consulting various labour academics, has called in Ray Rogers, a New
York-based labour activist, to advise.
Mr Rogers, who operates from Greenwich Village, has a reputation for
applying hard-line, but less conventional, pressures. These may range from
an attack on a corporation's financial links - thus dragging banks and
insurance companies into a dispute - to spotlighting its environmental
practices.
Mr Rogers counts labour campaigns at JP Stevens, the textile company,
American Airlines and International Paper among his trophies. He is
currently working for the Newspaper Guild in its battle with Mort Zuckerman,
new owner of the New York Daily News.
His approach at Staley has been true to form. Local mail shots, for example,
have urged a public boycott of First of America Bank Corporation, a sizeable
Midwest bank, which has cross-directorships with both Staley and
Caterpillar.
This prompted Mr Robert Powers, Staley's chairman and a Tate director, to
resign from the bank's board earlier this month. Mr Rogers says he has only
begun. 'We will continue to go after First of America, but there will be
another target, a major financial target - a bank or insurance company - of
our own.'
Other leaflets and publicity materials have made much of the safety issues,
including Mr Beals' death, and a second line of attack is threatened, namely
consumer pressure. Here, the likely target would appear to be Tate's Domino
Sugar, which is a household name and is stocked on the shelves of any US
supermarket.
This business has labour problems of its own. Its New York City plant, a
prominent feature on the Brooklyn waterfront, has faced a 15-week-old strike
by the Longshoremen's union. Again, the dispute is principally over
work-rule concessions, and workers continue to strike after voting last
weekend against revised proposals. Tate, meanwhile, has been shipping sugar
into the north-east from Maryland and Louisiana instead.
And there are clearly attempts to step up the attack outside the US, both
through British unions, and, perhaps, investors in Tate. Mr Rogers claims
that a trawl is being done of pension fund shareholders with ethical
investment guidelines who might be susceptible to pressure.
Meanwhile, the Tate annual meeting looms large on the calendar. Mr Rogers
says that eight union members have shares and would be entitled to attend.
'We'll take the fight wherever necessary,' adds Dave Watts.
Whether any of this rattles Tate's cage, an ocean away from Decatur, is
another matter. But with its members still getting paid, local 873 thinks it
has a better chance than it would on the picket-lines, in the
post-Caterpillar world.

ED BRENNAN, chairman of Sears, Roebuck, was struggling to explain how the
retailing and financial services giant could overhaul its lossmaking
catalogue business. 'Trying to outline the catalogue strategy in three
simple sentences is tough,' he admitted wearily.
That was a year ago. This week, Sears' revised strategy could be summed up
in three words: catalogue is axed.
Over the next 12 months, the Chicago-based group will close down the
division on which the company's fortunes were founded, and snuff out a
product that for much of the 20th century has symbolised 'middle America'.
Even today, the Sears catalogue - a 1,600-page tome produced twice a year -
circulates to 14m households and produces annual sales of Dollars 3.3bn.
The decision will cost 3,400 full-time and 16,500 part-time jobs, and lead
to a Dollars 800m restructuring charge.
It will be accompanied by the closure of 113 smaller Sears department
stores; the disposal of 35 specialist fashion shops; and a host of detailed
moves designed to streamline other parts of the retail business.
In total, 52,000 jobs will go (16,000 full-time and 36,000 part-time); about
12 per cent of the group's revenue base will be shed; and a Dollars 1.7bn
charge incurred to fund the overhaul.
But, radical though these measures appear, a big question remains: can Sears
really become a competitive force in today's US retail environment, or has
the cost-base become so unwieldy, and its image so tired, that
increasingly-aggressive competitors have an unassailable advantage?
Sears' problems have been well-aired - not least by dissatisfied
shareholders, who have pushed for measures ranging from the demerger of the
financial services subsidiaries to annual election of all directors.
The common perception is that Sears is a US behemoth, which allowed its
number one position in the US retail sector to slip away in the 1980s.
Instead of focusing on the retail interests, critics claim, Sears
diversified into financial services. It added brokerage and mortgage
operations to its Allstate insurance business. With management's attention
diverted, core retail operations became bureaucratic and uncompetitive.
No one could accuse Sears of ignoring these attacks. Over the past five
years, it has announced numerous revamps and restructurings. Since the
beginning of 1991, for example, around 48,000 jobs have been shed (although,
prior to this week's announcement, Sears still employed 350,000).
A 'power-format' strategy has been fed into many of the 850-plus department
stores. This has involved dividing store space between seven distinct
merchandise areas - appliances, home furnishings, women's fashions and so on
 -and reorganising the group's unwieldy buyer system.
Even on the catalogue front, there were strenuous efforts to streamline
distribution and update sales techniques.
But by mid-1992, few signs of improved performance from the merchandise
division had emerged. Frustration resurfaced at the annual meeting in May,
and since then the pace of change has accelerated.
First, Sears added new board directors, including Mr Michael Miles, chairman
of Philip Morris. Then, in September, it announced it would divest much of
its financial services empire, a move still scheduled for mid-1993.
A month later, the company called in Mr Arthur Martinez, formerly finance
director at Saks Fifth Avenue, to run its retail operations. (Previously, Mr
Brennan had held this position, along with the roles of chairman and overall
chief executive for the group.)
There is no doubt that this week's announcement - the first major
development under the Martinez regime - represents the most significant
restructuring yet at Sears.
Shutting down the catalogue operation is an emotional wrench, but it also
staunches annual losses of around Dollars 135m to Dollars 175m. The stores
which are closing are among the least profitable in the group. Overall,
Sears claims these moves should add Dollars 300m annually to its bottom
line.
At least some shareholders are pleased. The powerful California Public
Employees Retirement System (Calpers), one of the most prominent critics in
the past, said the latest cuts appeared to signal 'a more focused approach,
and should give the group a more spritely image.'
That said, the numbers still need to be seen in perspective. In 1991, Sears
made a net profit of just Dollars 90m from its US merchandise operations, on
sales of Dollars 24.8bn. (Credit operations then earned Dollars 394m, taking
the merchandise group profit total to Dollars 486m.)
Some analysts question whether all the latest cost-savings will fall
directly to the bottom line; even if they do, the return on sales is
scarcely going to be stellar.
Moreover, given the emphasis in the US on 'value' shopping - led by the
discount store operators and the ultra low-cost warehouse clubs - it is
questionable whether Sears' cost base, albeit reduced, permits it to compete
effectively.
In 1991, for example, Sears' selling, general and administrative expenses
per dollar of sales was around 29 cents. At Wal-Mart and K mart, the two
biggest discount store operators, the figures were 15.2 cents and 21.2 cents
respectively. Although Sears offers back-up services, which inflate its
expenses base, and the mix of goods sold is different, even Mr Brennan
concedes the discrepancy is too wide.
Finally, analysts need convincing the 'new' Sears can post sustained sales
growth. Domestic same-store sales gains did improve last autumn, and in
December alone the company reported an 8.2 per cent advance.
However, pundits point out this was partly due to heavy promotional
activity, and the sale gains probably came at cost of some profits in the
Brand Central (electronics) and home-furnishings departments.
The gain, moreover, was merely in line with progress made by other big store
chains.
In short, Sears' latest restructuring is being interpreted as a necessary
step, rather than one which spells a rebirth.
'It will help them to perform better, to a minimally acceptable standard,'
says Ms Dorothy Lakner, at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. 'But whether it fundamentally
improves their position longer-term remains to be seen'.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Time Warner to build multi-media
cable network
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TIME WARNER, the US media group, yesterday announced plans to build in
Orlando, Florida, the most ambitious inter-active cable-based home
entertainment and communications network yet attempted in the US on a
commercial basis.
The company, which runs the second-largest cable television business in the
US, said it would eventually integrate this new operation, which it calls a
'full service network,' into its other cable markets across America.
The move is an important step in the gathering battle over which industry -
cable television or local telephone companies - will be the main conduit
providing multi-media services to the home.
Mr Gerald Levin, chairman of the group, said that the move 'clearly
establishes cable's technology as the primary pathway for information and
entertainment.'
Mr Joseph Collins, chairman of Time Warner Cable, said the full service
network being introduced in Orlando would allow consumers to call up movies
on demand, as well as interactive games and full-motion video shopping. It
would also give access to distance learning.
The company has also applied for an experimental licence to test personal
communications services - a kind of mobile telephone system, similar to
cellular telephony - in the Orlando area and also planned to offer customers
access to long-distance telephone service providers.
This is a direct threat to local telephone companies, which derive a large
proportion of their revenues from access charges to link local customers to
long-distance telecommunications groups.
Orlando is one of Time Warner's main cable television markets, with some
500,000 subscribers. The service will operate initially in an area with some
4,000 residential customers.
Mr Levin said the network would be in operation for demonstrations by the
end of 1993, and would start serving residential customers early next year.
The move draws on experience gained in a well-publicised experiment in the
Queens area of New York city over the past year, where Time Warner has been
delivering 150 television channels to customers.
Cable TV broadcasts into the home using coaxial cable, which until now has
been limited both by the the amount of information it can handle and
problems in delivering an individual service to customers. Time Warner said
it had overcome these problems by installing fibre-optic trunks to small
neighbourhoods of a few hundred homes, by advanced information switching
techniques, and by digital video compression technology.

<TEXT>
SHARES in Compaq Computer hit a 52-week high yesterday after the company
reported a 34 per cent rise in fourth-quarter net income on sales which
surged 63 per cent, writes Karen Zagor. Compaq shares climbed Dollars 1 3/4
to Dollars 56 5/8 at close of trading in New York.
Net income for the three months to end-December was Dollars 89.5m, or
Dollars 1.10 a share, on sales of Dollars 1.42bn, against net earnings of
Dollars 66.6m, or 77 cents, on sales of Dollars 873.4m a year earlier. For
the whole of 1992, Compaq's net income climbed 63 per cent to Dollars
213.2m, or Dollars 2.52, from Dollars 130.9m, or Dollars 1.49, in 1991.
Sales were Dollars 4.1bn, against Dollars 3.27bn.
*****
WARNER LAMBERT, the pharmaceuticals company, reported a 14 per cent increase
in underlying fourth-quarter earnings to Dollars 137m, or Dollars 1.02
cents, from Dollars 121m, or 90 cents, a year ago. Sales rose to Dollars
1.47bn from Dollars 1.34bn, writes Karen Zagor. In the 1991 quarter, Warner
Lambert recorded an after-tax charge of Dollars 418m, or Dollars 3.11, which
led to a net loss of Dollars 297.1m, or Dollars 2.21.
For the whole of 1992, net income was Dollars 643.7m, or Dollars 4.78, on
sales of Dollars 5.6bn. In 1991, after-tax charges of Dollars 524m brought
net income down to Dollars 34.8m, or 26 cents, on sales of Dollars 5.06bn.
Excluding charges, Warner-Lambert said earnings rose 15 per cent in the
year.
*****
SOUTHWEST AIRLINES, the low-cost Dallas-based airline, returned
fourth-quarter profits of Dollars 27.1m after-tax, up from Dollars 8.84m in
the same period a year earlier, writes Nikki Tait.
For the whole of 1992, Southwest's net profits were Dollars 103.5m, against
Dollars 26.9m in 1991.
*****
THE EQUITABLE, the large but troubled US life insurance company, plans to
boost its capital 'substantially' by transferring its wholly-owned Equitable
Capital investment management subsidiary to Alliance Capital, a fund
management business in which it has a 55 per cent interest, writes Nikki
Tait.
In return, the Equitable will get 6.25m newly-issued units in Alliance,
valued at up to Dollars 250m, and will increase its ownership of Alliance to
around 65 per cent.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Boeing declines 6% to Dollars
377m in fourth quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOEING, the US aircraft manufacturer which yesterday announced a sharp cut
in its production programme, also reported a 6 per cent drop in
fourth-quarter earnings, but a 4 per cent increase for 1992 as a whole.
The company's shares, which have fallen sharply this month because of its
deteriorating aircraft delivery outlook, closed down Dollars 1 3/8 at
Dollars 35 1/2 after yesterday's news.
Boeing reported net earnings before accounting changes of Dollars 377m, or
Dollars 1.11 a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with Dollars 403m, or
Dollars 1.17 a share, in the same period of 1991. Sales were Dollars 7.5bn,
against Dollars 7.8bn.
For 1992, it reported earnings of Dollars 1.635bn, or Dollars 4.81 a share,
compared with Dollars 1.567, or Dollars 4.56 a share, in 1991. Sales rose
from Dollars 29.3bn to Dollars 30.2bn.
Mr Frank Schrontz, the chairman, said it expected 1993 sales to drop to
around Dollars 26bn, with commercial aircraft deliveries dropping to about
340 units, against 441 in 1992.
Mr Schrontz said the increase in 1992 net earnings before an accounting
change was mainly attributable to increased commercial aircraft sales and an
improved operating performance, particularly in Boeing's space and defence
business.
The latter returned to profitability, with operating earnings of Dollars
204m on sales of Dollars 5.4bn.
However, these factors were partially offset by higher research and
development expense, particularly for the company's 777 airliner, lower
interest income and a higher tax rate.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Boeing jobs at risk after sharp cut in 747 production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE recession in the world's aviation industry was underscored yesterday
when Boeing, the largest commercial aircraft manufacturer, announced a sharp
cut in production and Pratt &amp; Whitney, a leading engine supplier, said it
would slash employment by a quarter over the coming two years.
The production cuts will affect component suppliers worldwide, including
Lucas and Smiths Industries of the UK.
Output of the 747 will be reduced from five aircraft a month to three a
month in the second quarter of 1994. Production of all Boeing's models will
drop from 32.5 a month to 21 a month over the same period.
Boeing said it had yet to determine the impact of the cuts on employment but
it was expected to be 'significant'. The company cut some 7,600 jobs in
1992.
The cuts at Boeing include the 747, its biggest and most profitable product
and its only model to have avoided production slowdowns over the past year.
Boeing also announced fourth quarter net earnings before accounting changes
of Dollars 377m, or Dollars 1.11 a share, down from earnings of Dollars
403m, or Dollars 1.17 a share. Sales were Dollars 7.5bn, against Dollars
7.8bn in the fourth quarter of last year.
United Technologies, the parent of Pratt &amp; Whitney, yesterday unveiled a
fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 333m, or Dollars 2.77 a share, on sales of
Dollars 5.7bn after taking pre-tax charges of Dollars 701m or Dollars 3.45 a
share. That compares with a loss of Dollars 1.22bn, or Dollars 10.33 a
share, in the same period of 1991.
The charge - against the operations of Pratt &amp; Whitney, as well as United
Technology's flight systems division and general corporate expenses -
includes Dollars 447m for credit and other exposures to the airline
industry, Dollars 169m for contract matters, and Dollars 85m for additional
restructuring.
Pratt &amp; Whitney, which lost some Dollars 500m last year, said it planned to
cut employment to no more than 30,000 by the end of 1994, from 40,664 at the
start of this year.
Boeing insisted its cuts were not tied to any particular customer. However,
Japan Airlines, one of the biggest 747 customers, indicated earlier this
month that it would delay taking delivery of some of the aircraft and
analysts said two US carriers, Northwest and United Airlines, wanted a
stretched delivery time-table.

NEC, the Japanese electronics group, has withdrawn from the manufacture of
VCRs in a move that highlights the harsh trading environment faced by
Japanese consumer electronics manufacturers.
The decision by NEC Home Electronics, NEC's wholly-owned subsidiary, to
retreat from VCR production comes as the demand in Japan for audio-visual
products has been particularly sluggish.
NEC will continue to supply VCRs manufactured by Sanyo on an original
equipment basis.
However, it will not distribute to mass sales discount stores where price
erosion can occur. Instead, it will restrict distribution to its 6,000
affiliated retailers in Japan.
The drop in the domestic market for VCRs is a growing problem for Japanese
consumer electronics manufacturers which are faced with a penetration rate
in Japan and the US of more than 80 per cent. VCR shipments in Japan have
fallen from a peak of 7.15m to an estimated 4.3m last year and are expected
to decline to 7.2m in 1993.

NEC, the Japanese electronics group, has withdrawn from the manufacture of
VCRs in a move that highlights the increasingly harsh trading environment
faced by Japanese consumer electronics manufacturers.
The decision by NEC Home Electronics, NEC's wholly-owned subsidiary, to
retreat from VCR production comes as the demand in Japan for audio-visual
products has been particularly sluggish.
'We decided to withdraw from manufacturing VCRs as it is no longer
profitable due to the fierce competition,' an NEC representative said.
To keep up in the market it is necessary to include more and more functions
on machines while prices continue to fall due to the popularity of mass
market discount shops. 'I believe there are hardly any companies making
profits from VCRs,' the NEC representative said.
NEC will continue to supply VCRs manufactured by Sanyo on an original
equipment basis. However, it will not distribute to mass sales discount
stores where price erosion can occur. Instead, it will restrict distribution
to its 6,000 affiliated retailers throughout Japan.
The drop in the domestic market for VCRs is a growing headache for Japanese
consumer electronics manufacturers which are faced with a penetration rate
in Japan and the US of more than 80 per cent. VCR shipments in Japan have
fallen from a peak of 7.15m to an estimated 4.3m last year and are expected
to decline further to 7.2m in 1993.
While NEC does not play a leading role in the Japanese VCR market, with
between 5 and 6 per cent of market share according to the company, other
major manufacturers of VCRs such as JVC and Matsushita, have also been
forced by the fall in demand to cut back production. Last spring, JVC
reduced its VCR shipments by 20 per cent.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Top cards at American Express
fail to deal a winner - Alan Friedman finds investors unimpressed by the
enhanced role for the US company's chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE most eloquent judgment concerning the surprise announcement that Mr
James Robinson had survived as chairman of American Express and succeeded in
having his protege installed as chief executive came from Wall Street.
On Monday, with investors widely expecting Mr Robinson to leave the troubled
financial services and travel group, the company's share price continued to
rise sharply.
It was widely known in the New York financial world that the American
Express board was divided by internecine politics as Mr Robinson fought to
save himself and have Mr Harvey Golub, the president, named as chief
executive.
It was also learned yesterday that Sir Colin Marshall, chief executive of
British Airways, was contacted by the search committee about the job, having
previously been canvassed about a move to another position at American
Express more than 18 months ago.
Then, late on Monday it was announced that Mr Golub would take over as chief
executive and that Mr Robinson would not only stay on as chairman but would
also take over as chairman and chief executive of the lossmaking Shearson
Lehman investment banking and brokerage unit.
The American Express share price promptly went into a free-fall, and by the
close in New York yesterday had dropped by Dollars 1 3/4 , a decline of
nearly 7 per cent, wiping more than Dollars 800m off the company's market
capitalisation. Trading volume stood at 6.3m shares, more than three times
the average level.
The consensus view among analysts is that the 57-year-old Mr Robinson, who
is blamed by many for presiding over a sloppy management and substantial
credit losses at the group's card division, should have left the company.
But a handful of the normally-available Wall Street analysts who follow
American Express agreed to comment only if they were not named. 'This is a
travesty. The entire market was hoping that Mr Robinson would go. That is
what we were led to believe in December,' said one analyst at a leading New
York securities firm.
'The market has not been pleased with Mr Robinson's stewardship of the
company and had been hoping he would go. His job now is to make Shearson run
again and focus on costs,' said Mr Guy Moszkowski, a leading analyst at
Sanford Bernstein, a research company.
The group's 1992 net earnings, which fell by 44.7 per cent to Dollars 436m,
in part because of a Dollars 116m loss from Shearson Lehman, illustrated the
financial problems at American Express.
The core Travel Related Services (TRS) division, for example, saw its 1992
net profit tumble to Dollars 243m from Dollars 396m in 1991. Admittedly, the
decline was affected by special charges. But the depth of problems at TRS
and the need to cut staff and make provisions is more apparent when one
considers that TRS made a profit of Dollars 956m in 1990, meaning its most
recent earnings have collapsed by 75.6 per cent in two years.
Analysts like Mr Moszkowski say it could take until 1996 before TRS returns
to its 1990 level of profitability.
Analysts say investors had felt an enormous sense of relief about American
Express ever since it emerged in early December that Mr Robinson had been
asked by the American Express board to search for a successor as chief
executive.
Although Mr Robinson denied he was being forced out, executives at American
Express say he fought 'a battle royal' to hang on to both his job as
chairman and his prestige. 'What he did was to take care of himself,' said
an American Express executive.
Mr Golub, who was named by Mr Robinson as president only 18 months ago, is
respected for his technical skills, but is not considered a man of great
vision.
The big loser in the American Express shake-up is Mr Howard Clark, the
former group finance director who was installed as chairman and chief
executive of Shearson two years ago. Mr Robinson yesterday took both of
those jobs, banishing Mr Clark to the ill-defined role of vice-chairman of
Shearson.
Mr Robinson declined to be interviewed yesterday, but in his official
statement on Monday he said his primary mission would now be to work at
Shearson Lehman. He even hinted at possibly making a public offer of
Shearson stock. No one, meanwhile, is willing to predict how long he will
stay on as chairman of American Express. The company and its investors are
still reeling from Monday's shake-up.

FT  27 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the celebrated arrival of the European market, investors should
perhaps be wary of companies with names prefixed by 'Euro'. First came
Eurotunnel, now Euro Disney - businesses with high-flown ambitions, grand
financing needs and unfathomable investment prospects.
Euro Disney's news yesterday of poor attendance figures and a FFr492m
first-quarter net loss was considerably worse than forecast. A profit is
unlikely until at least 1995. The cost-cutting programme and marketing
campaign may confound the worst sceptics, but even if successful, the
immediate benefits to ordinary shareholders are uncertain. Any uplift is
likely to be sapped by Walt Disney's management fees and royalties. This
could cause financing problems for phase two of the project, especially
since the stagnant French property market will prevent the easy realisation
of development profits. Shareholders who have seen their shares fall well
below the offer price are unlikely to stump up fresh funds. But, barring a
turnround, Walt Disney may have to forego some of its fees.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Euro Disney posts loss of
FFr492m in quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EURO DISNEY, which has been plagued by problems since the opening of its
EuroDisneyland theme park outside Paris last spring, yesterday disclosed
that it made a net loss of FFr492m (Dollars 92.4m) in the first quarter of
the current financial year.
The results, announced little more than a week after the resignation of Mr
Robert Fitzpatrick as chairman, were worse than analysts expected and
confirmed fears that Euro Disney will make a sizeable loss this year. The
company's shares rose FFr2.70 to FFr67.20 yesterday.
Euro Disney had budgeted for a seasonal fall in attendance at EuroDisneyland
during the period from October to December. But the actual number of
visitors is believed to have been even lower than its original estimates,
despite a busy Christmas period.
The shortfall also affected revenue from merchandise sales and hotels, one
of which has been closed since the autumn. As a result, overall revenue
reached FFr944m during the quarter.
Although Euro Disney refuses to give specific figures, it has admitted that
the total number of visitors for the first year will be below its original
11m target. Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, leisure analyst at Morgan Stanley
in London, said the company would be 'hard pushed to reach 10m'.

THE share price of American Express, the US travel and financial services
group, fell sharply yesterday as Wall Street reacted with displeasure to the
news that Mr James Robinson had managed both to salvage his job as chairman
and to have himself named chairman and chief executive of Shearson Lehman,
the troubled investment bank and brokerage subsidiary.
Mr Robinson has been harshly criticised by Wall Street analysts for credit
losses, lower profits and pressure on the company's share price.
In early trading yesterday the price dropped by Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 23
1/2 , more than 8 per cent, before closing at Dollars 24.
Mr Robinson announced plans to step down as chief executive last month.
Instead the company announced on Monday that Mr Robinson would stay on as
chairman and that he would take over from Mr Howard Clark as chairman and
chief executive of American Express's Shearson Lehman banking and brokerage
subsidiary.
Mr Harvey Golub, the 53-year-old president of American Express, was named to
take over as group chief executive.
Sir Colin Marshall, the British Airways chief executive, had been a leading
outside candidate for the job and was contacted by the American Express
search committee, according to executives at the company.
Analysts were equally disappointed at losses reported for 1992 by Shearson,
as well as by the near halving of American Express group net profits for
1992, to Dollars 436m.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Fuzzy future of American TV: The Big Three television
networks are facing a prolonged period of change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Larry Tisch and David Letterman made for rather an odd couple - perched
alongside one another recently on director's chairs in a room on the 19th
floor of 'Black Rock', the Manhattan headquarters of CBS Television. Mr
Tisch, the diminutive billionaire investor who controls CBS, was informing
the world that he had just poached Mr Letterman, the tall, sandy-haired
comedian and chat show host, from rival NBC for a salary reported to be
about Dollars 14m a year.
In doing so he won a high stakes battle between two of America's four
national networks. The competition between CBS, which under Mr Tisch has
strengthened its management and become the top-rated network in terms of
audience share, and NBC, which has fallen into the ratings cellar and seen
its profitability tumble, comes at a critical time for the networks.
Recession and declining advertising revenues have taken a toll over the past
two years. Cost-cutting has become the new religion as the industry
undergoes a bout of soul-searching, strategic rethinking and management
reshuffling.
The growth of the cable television industry, as well as that of Mr Rupert
Murdoch's profitable and expanding Fox network, have also combined to pose a
new threat to the traditional Big Three networks - ABC, CBS and NBC. A
decade ago the networks held 85 per cent of the market of 93m
television-watching American homes. Today that share has dropped to little
more than 61 per cent, largely because of inroads made by cable television
and Fox.
Mr David Weston, a senior vice-president and general counsel at ABC
Television, says his superiors at Capital Cities, the media company that
owns ABC, 'have a deep concern that we need to realign our cost structure.
One cannot spend the same amount of money on a third of a market that
reaches 60 per cent of US homes as one did on a market that captured nearly
90 per cent of the viewers.'
The American television industry is at a crossroads, according to Mr Weston,
who says that the current uncertainty stems from the fact that the networks
have been slow to react to the growth of cable.
That the industry is in the middle of profound change is evident from
estimates of operating profits of Dollars 200m made last year by Time
Warner's Home Box Office (HBO) cable programming subsidiary - more than any
single network earned. HBO is in a partnership with ABC to develop new
programming for the network's lacklustre Saturday evening line-up, something
that might have been unthinkable a few years ago, when the networks viewed
cable as the enemy.
Mr Michael Fuchs, chairman of HBO, has presided over a steady average
profits growth of 10 per cent a year for the past eight years. HBO is no
longer just a cable programmer; it has diversified and is now among the
biggest outside suppliers of shows for Fox. But Mr Fuchs says that while he
foresees an increasing number of alliances between the networks and cable,
even more radical change is on the horizon. 'At the end of this decade it's
not going to be cable and broadcast any more - it's going to be television.
It is not even inconceivable that a cable company might own a network,' he
predicts.
Clearly the old structure of American television is breaking down. The
ownership of all three networks has changed hands since 1986 and the need to
share costs has led to co-operative programming ventures involving cable,
networks and Hollywood studios.
The current turmoil, which was partly driven by a decline in advertising
revenues in 1990-91 and partly by the view of network executives that they
must change their target audiences to compete with cable, has manifest
itself differently at each network.
CBS experienced a slump in morale a few years ago amid harsh staff cuts on
the news side and made a Dollars 405m loss in 1991 when it spent too much on
sporting events. But the new management installed by Mr Tisch has received
plaudits for its successful new programming, and is estimated to have turned
a small profit in 1992.
Ms Jessica Reif, entertainment analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co, the New York
investment bank, says that hiring Mr Letterman for the late night-slot could
prove a highly lucrative move, taking viewers from NBC's popular Tonight
Show and thus worsening NBC's position as the network with the lowest
audience share.
NBC's management is the most widely criticised in recent television history.
Observers fault its senior executives, who include Mr Robert Wright, the
network president who came from General Electric, the company that owns NBC
and is widely believed in the industry to be willing to sell it if the right
buyer offers Dollars 3bn to Dollars 4bn.
Mr Wright's background includes years in the plastics business; his most
recent job was running GE's financial services business. 'The GE people are
deal-makers who know about widgets, but they are not very good at managing
creative talent,' according to a senior executive at a rival network who
asked not to be named. Mr Wright could not be reached for comment.
The picture at ABC, which is presently offering buy-outs to many executives
as part of its cost-cutting programme, is somewhat better. The network,
which has the second highest prime-time ratings, is generally deemed by Wall
Street analysts to be the best-run of the Big Three. Ms Reif of Oppenheimer
is forecasting a 1992 operating profit for ABC of Dollars 114m, the highest
of any network.
The financial position of the Big Three has been further complicated by Fox,
which has come a long way since it was launched six years ago by Mr Barry
Diller, who resigned last year as Mr Murdoch took over day-to-day operations
as chief executive of both the Hollywood studio and the television network.
Observers have been puzzled by a string of recent executive departures and
reshuffles at Fox, but Mr Murdoch insists there was no turmoil at the
network and says that some of the personnel changes had been planned before
Mr Diller's departure.
Mr Murdoch, who says Fox's revenues in the year to next June will rise to
more than Dollars 600m from Dollars 440m last year, praises the bigger
networks for 'stringent' cost reductions. He seeks, however, to distinguish
his own attitude toward the cable industry from that of other networks by
saying his rivals have considered cable the enemy, whereas Fox wants 'to be
friendly with them'.
In fairness, Fox is not the only network with links to cable. ABC owns 80
per cent of ESPN, the lucrative cable sports channel, and has other cable
interests. And NBC has CNBC, a cable financial news channel.
The growth of cable over the past year has slowed, however, and newly
approved federal legislation could help the networks by forcing cable
operators to pay local stations for the right to carry their signals. The
networks could also gain when the Federal Communications Commission finally
responds this spring to a recent court order requiring that it clarify the
muddled financial-syndication (fin-syn) rules that ban networks from moving
into the syndication market and other areas.
'The networks are likely to be less regulated, even unshackled,' predicts Ms
Reif. She adds that in the near term networks should also benefit from the
US economic recovery and signs of a modest improvement in advertising.
Mr Weston of ABC says it is unrealistic to expect any of the Big Three to
achieve double-digit growth in advertising revenues again. The exception is
Fox, which has prospered as a start-up operation with new programming that
includes comedies and tabloid shows which have more appeal to young viewers
than more standard network fare.
In broader terms, the likely future of US television could be radically
different in as little as five years. Digital compression technology means
that cable operators such as Tele-Communications Inc, the nation's biggest,
could offer 500 channels of programming within two or three years.
The implication of the continued proliferation of viewer choice is more
cost-sharing, joint ventures and perhaps even mergers between cable and
network television companies. The only certainty in American television,
therefore, is the prospect of change.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Management: The toddler begins to show promise - How AT&amp;T
and NCR bucked the trend of failed computer marriages to form a successful
partnership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was not love at first sight, but a match based on the sheer wealth of the
rudely aggressive suitor. Many onlookers pronounced with relish that it
would all end in tears.
Yet after 18 months of married life, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's
Dollars 7.5bn (Pounds 4.9bn) takeover of NCR, the US computer company, seems
to be shaping up rather better than the Jeremiahs predicted.
NCR and AT&amp;T's much smaller computer business have combined their product
lines and sales forces relatively smoothly, and without any evidently
serious loss of customers. And whereas AT&amp;T's old computer business lost
money for years, the merged entity is modestly profitable.
Nor is there any of the rancour which critics feared could linger between
the two companies in the wake of AT&amp;T's hostile bid.
However, these are still very early days and the combined business has a
long way to go to justify the Dollars 7.5bn paid by AT&amp;T or the strategic
thinking behind the takeover - that the convergence of computer and
telecommunications technology will give a competitive advantage to a company
which successfully combines both skills in-house.
Still, the progress so far does point up some lessons for the management of
computer sector mergers, which in the past have proved difficult to execute,
either because of differences of technology, making it hard to put customer
bases together, or of corporate culture.
Four main factors have helped overcome such potential difficulties: the way
in which AT&amp;T approached the takeover; the technological similarities
between the two companies; the compatibility of their product mixes and
customer bases; and the execution of the merger.
Arguably most important was AT&amp;T's decision from the outset of the bid that,
although it would be acquiring NCR, it wanted NCR to be in the driving seat
as the computer operations of the two companies were merged.
There were very good reasons for this. NCR, the fifth largest computer
manufacturer in the US, was a large and reasonably successful business.
Founded as National Cash Register in Dayton, Ohio, in the late 19th century,
it had expanded far beyond its origins in retail sales tills into general
business information systems, though its slowness to move from
electro-mechanical to electronic equipment in the 1960s and 1970s had left
it in the second rank of computer companies.
However, at the time of the bid, NCR had just started introducing a new
product range which correctly anticipated a move by the industry towards
open systems, which allow computers made by different manufacturers to
operate together, rather than proprietary products, which lock the customer
into one company's products.
By contrast, AT&amp;T's computer operations were only founded in the mid-1980s,
were much smaller and were awash in red ink. AT&amp;T essentially handed this
business to NCR and said: 'Take what you want, discard the rest, but make
sure you keep customers happy and are profitable.'
Charles Exley, the NCR chief executive who headed the fight against AT&amp;T,
left the company when the bid was successful but his place was taken by
another NCR executive, Gilbert Williamson, the former president. AT&amp;T's
clear-cut approach to the post-merger power structure meant, he says, that
there was no waste of energies discussing 'who's going to sit in the corner
office'.
NCR only took on about 2,000 of AT&amp;T's 7,500 computer staff and AT&amp;T formed
a special unit responsible for redeploying the discarded employees elsewhere
in the group.
As a result, NCR did not become bogged down in politicking or administrative
minutiae and could remain externally focused, concentrating on the critical
tasks of combining product offerings and reassuring customers that they
would continue to be served properly.
In so doing, it was helped by the fact that both companies were pursuing the
same technological strategy of open systems based on Unix, the computer
operating system devised by AT&amp;T, with microprocessors manufacturered by
Intel.
The two companies shared a belief that the future of the industry lies in
what Williamson likes to call the 'new way of computing'. Apart from a
commitment to open systems, this involves computer power being distributed
by networks across an enterprise, using many small desktop machines, rather
than being centralised in a mainframe computer.
Transition teams, involving people from both companies, began integrating
the product range the moment the takeover was clinched, and three months
before the deal was legally consummated.
They found there was a lot less overlap than many had expected. Take, for
example, network interface boards, the peripherals which allow a computer to
connect to local and wide-area networks. There was only one serious conflict
among 36 products made by the two entities.
Nor was integration of the sales force too difficult, since the two
companies had different areas of strength. NCR was particularly well placed
internationally (some 60 per cent of its revenues came from outside the US)
and in finance, retailing and state and local government.
AT&amp;T was essentially North American and better represented in
telecommunications, transport, manufacturing and the federal government.
Culturally, too, the two businesses were a relatively good fit. Both were
members of the eastern business establishment, but both had been through big
shake-ups in the recent past. AT&amp;T, once a slow-moving, paternalistic
bureaucracy, was turned into a more profit-oriented operation through a
restructuring in the late 1980s.
Since the merger, AT&amp;T headquarters has largely left the computer business
to run itself, though NCR has been exposed to AT&amp;T's business methods by
representation on the parent company's management committee and numerous
cross-business initiatives.
But while the combined business is reporting profits, these are modest and
are partly dependent on NCR's two large non-hardware businesses - computer
services and business forms.
Moreover, while NCR is faring reasonably well in a depressed computer
market, it still seems less dynamic than some of its most direct US
competitors, such as Hewlett-Packard, which has been enjoying double-digit
revenue growth.
Nor is it clear how strongly NCR will grow when the US and European markets
recover. Its areas of greatest strength, cash registers and banks' automated
teller machines, are mature although the link-up with AT&amp;T will help it
introduce more sophisticated offerings, such as an ATM which identifies
customers by voice, rather than the numbers punched on a keyboard.
Significant growth is likely to depend on gaining market share in the
ferociously competitive general business computer market, and on using the
AT&amp;T link to provide both innovative products and distinctive ways of
solving clients' computer networking and communications problems.
NCR now has one of the industry's broadest product lines, which is
compatible across the range and fully dedicated to open systems. Elton
White, the company's president, reckons AT&amp;T has given the company much
stronger networking products.
However, open systems by definition allow customers to pick and choose
equipment from the cheapest manufacturers or those who are fastest to market
with new products, and neither AT&amp;T nor NCR have traditionally been known
for strength in these areas.
Moreover, some of the greatest profit opportunities in computer networking
come from providing software. Many industry analysts feel NCR still lacks
muscle here, though company officials argue that AT&amp;T's celebrated Bell
Laboratories may add to their strength.
Even less certain is how far AT&amp;T's telecommunications businesses and NCR
will take advantage of the convergence of the two industries. Williamson
says six cross-business initiatives set up after the merger have produced
some early results, and he is enthusiastic about the potential. He insists
that this depth of co-operation could not have taken place in an alliance
between two separate businesses.
The proof will come in the form of new products. The company is promising to
unveil the first 'computing telecommunications' product next year and Lee
Hoevel, who heads the technology and development division, says NCR can
spend three to five years just 'strip mining' inside Bell Laboratories,
'going after ore that is already there, buried by a small layer of dirt of
disuse'.
'As mergers go, so far so good,' says Bob Allen, chairman of AT&amp;T. 'We've
done better than most people expected, but the jury's still out. It's
probably going to be five years before people can look back and say this
made sense.'
An article on AT&amp;T's wider strategy appeared on the Features pages
yesterday.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Annual subsidy of Pounds 1.25bn
needed to keep open pits earmarked for closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL would need an annual subsidy of up to Pounds 1.25bn if it were
to keep open all 31 pits earmarked for closure, according to figures drawn
up by the corporation for the trade and industry committee, Michael Smith
writes.
The estimate, published yesterday in a 311-page book of evidence to the
committee, assumes that the pits' annual output of 33m tonnes would not be
sold and so would have to be stockpiled.
British Coal says the subsidy would fall to Pounds 170m at 1992-93 prices if
the output of all 31 pits could be sold to the electricity supply market at
Pounds 1.30 a gigajoule, well below expected contract prices. However it
says sales of that size would be inconceivable without changes in the
market.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Akers to quit as IBM's chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Machines, the troubled US computer group, said
yesterday Mr John Akers would step down as chief executive. The company also
said its quarterly dividend would be slashed from Dollars 1.21 to 54 cents,
the first time it has cut its payout to shareholders.
In an unprecedented move, IBM said the search for a new chief executive
would be conducted outside the company as well as within the ranks of its
senior executives.
The management shake-up and dividend cut reflect the severity of IBM's
difficulties and rising pressure from shareholders. Last week, it reported a
net loss for 1992 of Dollars 4.9bn (Pounds 3.2bn) on sales of Dollars 64bn,
the largest annual loss in US history, after taking restructuring charges of
Dollars 11.6bn to cover the cost of drastic cuts in manufacturing and 40,000
job losses.
Wall Street reacted positively to IBM's announcement, but analysts said the
long-term health of the company remained in question. They expect additional
large-scale write-offs. The share price, which has fallen more than Dollars
100 since July, surged yesterday to almost Dollars 53 when trading opened,
but ended at Dollars 49 1/8 .
The management changes were widely seen as a signal that IBM was prepared to
take radical measures to return the company to profitability as quickly as
possible. The dividend cut, although a disappointment to shareholders, had
been expected after last week's earnings announcement.
Mr Akers, who is 58 and had been expected to retire at the end of 1994,
proposed at a meeting of IBM's board in New York on Monday that a search for
a replacement be accelerated, IBM said.
'It is the right time in IBM's business transformation to identify new
leadership,' Mr Akers said in a statement. He will remain chairman, at least
for the time being. Underscoring the dramatic cultural changes that have
shaken IBM under Mr Akers, he is the first chief executive of the company to
retire early and the first for whom the board may seek an outside
replacement.
Moreover, IBM's non-executive directors have gained considerable power over
IBM's executives in recent days. It was not immediately clear if they forced
Mr Akers' resignation, as their counterparts recently did with the General
Motors and American Express chief executives.
Mr Akers has clearly been under increasing pressure from institutional
investors and has been heavily criticised by industry commentators. It was
also apparent that IBM's board wanted to prevent a prolonged controversy
over the leadership.
The selection of a new chief executive will be made by a new committee of
outside directors chaired by Mr James Burke, former chairman of Johnson and
Johnson and a long-time IBM board member. In the past such appointments have
been made by executive directors.
In other top management changes, Mr Frank Metz Jr, IBM's chief financial
officer, who is 59, will retire a year earlier than expected. He will be
succeeded by Mr Paul Rizzo, a former IBM vice-chairman. Mr Jack Kuehler, 60,
will relinquish the title of IBM president, and becomes a board
vice-chairman.

The departure of Mr John Akers from the helm of IBM may be a shock, but it
is not a revolution. Mr Akers is still expected to pick an insider to
succeed him. Further pain may be necessary before the company fully accepts
its reduced role in a cost-efficient world where computers are commodities.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Akers' departure marks desperate battle for change: Big Blue
is a prisoner of its history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Akers, whose announcement of his impending resignation as chief
executive of International Business Machines shocked the business world, had
hoped to lead the world's largest computer manufacturer through the Dollars
100bn (Pounds 65.7bn) annual revenues barrier. Instead, he has written a
less exalted page in business history. Mr Akers, 58, is the first IBM chief
executive to leave his post before the statutory retirement age of 60 and
the first to go because of the company's deteriorating performance.
His resignation after an eight-year tenure is the most dramatic evidence
that IBM is serious about solving the problems that have reduced it to a
shadow of its former credibility and influence. Only two months ago Mr
Akers' position seemed secure, when he claimed to enjoy the unanimous
support of the IBM board.
Last week, however, IBM announced the greatest annual loss - Dollars 4.9bn -
in US business history. It was the computer giant's second year of losses in
succession, with no suggestion that waves of expensive restructuring
initiated by Mr Akers would lead to improved performance this year.
In December, he had already announced that 25,000 jobs would go and that
factories would close in 1993 at a cost of Dollars 6bn.
Yesterday, the board cut the quarterly dividend from Dollars 1.54 to Dollars
0.54, and Mr Akers' fate was sealed. Wall Street responded enthusiastically
to the news: 'The investment community was looking for a change in
management,' said one broker. 'They are looking for someone who can cut
costs quickly.'
Although many wondered how long Mr Akers could resist the pressure for his
departure, his resignation was unexpected. That was chiefly because of his
publicly expressed determination to oversee the company's recovery and the
lack of any alternative stratagem that could return IBM to profitability
more rapidly.
'I do not know how to put somebody in who could do better from inside or
outside the company,' Mr James Burke, former head of Johnson &amp; Johnson and
one of four outside directors on the IBM board, said last year. Mr Burke
chairs the committee that will select Mr Akers' successor.
Increasingly, observers have detected signs of desperation at IBM's Armonk,
New York State, headquarters. Last month Mr Akers recalled two former
vice-chairmen, Mr Paul Rizzo and Mr Kaspar Cassani, both retired, to help
the company through the crisis. Now Mr Rizzo, who retired from IBM in 1987,
is replacing Mr Frank Metz, who is also leaving before retirement age, as
chief financial officer.
Mr Akers, a former Navy pilot who combines a brusque business exterior with
considerable personal charm, is shouldering the blame for difficulties that
analysts believe are as much the responsibility of his predecessors, Mr
Frank Cary and Mr John Opel, as his own.
IBM is a prisoner of its history, tied to areas of the computer market that
are neither the fastest growing nor the most technologically interesting.
Mainframe computers, a sector IBM dominates and on which it used to make
huge profits, are in decline. The company is the market leader in personal
computers, but the slim profit margins there are insufficient to support its
sprawling bureaucracy.
Mr Akers' plan was to transform IBM from a ponderous manufacturing megalith
to a loose confederation of lean, fast-moving business units close to
customers and the market, with an emphasis on the rapidly growing software
and services sector.
Yesterday, Mr Akers said that the strategy would remain unchanged. IBM would
continue to redirect investment toward growth sectors of the computer market
and make its individual business units increasing autonomous. Few are
offering alternative strategies. One that has gained some currency is to
break the company up into its constituent businesses.
IBM's outside directors now have 90 days to find an individual to carry
through the company's transformation. In a departure from tradition, the
board has said that outside candidates will be considered for the job. 'With
two executive positions open at IBM - the chief executive and president -
the probability is high that at least one will be filled from external
sources,' said Mr John Jones of Salomon Brothers in San Francisco.
A chief executive from outside IBM's culture would be at an advantage in
pushing through necessary but unpopular measures such as involuntary
redundancy - which was prohibited in IBM's glory days.
Speculation about who will replace Mr Akers ran wild yesterday, according to
company employees. With most now expecting an outsider to be appointed, the
future of several of the company's senior executives was in question.
Before yesterday's announcement, individuals regarded as serious candidates
from within IBM included Mr Robert LaBant, 47, vice-president and general
manager of IBM North America and Mr Ned Lautenbach 48, a senior executive at
IBM World Trade. There was also increasing speculation that Mr James
Cannavino, 48, senior vice-president and general manager of IBM's personal
systems division, might be elevated to president, replacing Mr Jack Kuehler,
60, who yesterday relinquished that title and became vice-chairman. Mr
Kuehler had been expected to retire in October.
The management changes at IBM are not expected to be confined to the top
level. 'That would be akin to President Clinton retaining the cabinet and
top officials from the Bush administration,' said Mr Richard Shaffer,
president of Technologic Partners, an industry consulting group. 'The
problems at IBM run very deep,' he said. 'Changing the man at the top will
not solve its problems. With Akers gone, IBM is still a huge company that is
difficult to manage. With Akers gone, IBM still has the problems created by
a world economy in which buyers are postponing purchases of mainframe
computers.'
Widespread management changes now seem inevitable. 'It is going to be ugly,
but it has to happen,' Mr Shaffer predicted.

UNITED BISCUITS last night announced a management shake-up at Keebler, its
Chicago-based subsidiary which is one of the largest cookie and snacks
manufacturers in the US.
A terse release said that Mr Tom Garvin, who has been president and chief
executive of Keebler for the past 15 years, had 'agreed to resign to pursue
other interests'. He will be succeeded immediately by Mr Brian Chadbourne,
previously managing director of McVitie's Group, UB's European biscuit
division.
At McVitie's, Mr Hartwig Conzelmann, formerly director of central and
southern European operations, will step into Mr Chadbourne's shoes, also
with immediate effect.
Mr Chadbourne and Mr David Hearn, who heads KP Foods, UB's European salty
snacks division are also joining the United Biscuits board.
The upheavals at Keebler follow a sharp deterioration in its performance
last year. In the first half of 1992, trading profit fell from Pounds 29.7m,
to Pounds 12.1m, on sales of Pounds 508.8m (Pounds 512.5m).
UB, which suffered a 17 per cent fall in group pre-tax profits as a result,
blamed unfavourable market conditions and tough price competition.
The problems cookie company prompted a review of all Keebler's operations.
There have been suggestions that it would be kept on a tighter leash in
future. This appears to have galled Mr Garvin, a feisty native from
Chicago's south side.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Brown joins Scottish pressure for
Rosyth inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GORDON BROWN, the shadow chancellor, joined Scottish industrial lobbyists
yesterday in urging an inquiry into allegations of Ministry of Defence bias
against the Rosyth naval dockyard in favour of Devonport.
His demand follows reports that the Scottish yard was poorly advised by the
MoD on refurbishment so as to prejudice its chances in a crucial battle with
Devonport over warship and nuclear sub-marine refitting contracts.
With a decision on the contracts imminent, campaigners for Rosyth -
Scotland's largest single employer - are lobbying parliament today prior to
a series of protests and demonstrations in Scotland. They say that failure
to win the submarine contract would cost the Scottish economy 18,000 jobs
and up to Pounds 10bn.
Yesterday, Mr Brown demanded an inquiry into the bias allegations within the
MoD alongside independent investigations by the defence and Scottish select
committees of the Commons.
Labour MPs are also questioning the links between Mr George Allin, a leading
MoD civil servant in charge of the refitting department, and Brown and Root,
the US engineering company that holds a 30 per cent stake in Devonport's
management company.
The MoD has pointed out that while Mr Allin worked on secondment for the US
company, he had also worked at the Rosyth dockyard for three years in the
early 1980s.
An initial contract expected to lead to a Pounds 100m computer order for the
British Army has been awarded to a consortium led by Bull Information
Systems, UK subsidiary of Groupe Bull of France, David White writes.
Bull won the Pounds 1m trials contract against two other consortia, one led
by Hewlett-Packard and including British Telecommunications, the other
headed by the computer services company EDS-Scicon.
The Unicom system will provide the Army with an integrated computer network
for the administration of personnel, training, pay, catering, stores and
equipment.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Survey of Ukraine (7): A rash of difficulties - Profile:
Western investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Tambrands, the US tampon company, first began to make their cotton
products in Ukraine, back in 1989, tampons were as unfamiliar to Ukrainian
women as a market economy. Today, billboards featuring slightly plumper
gymnasts than might appear in a western magazine advertise tampons on the
streets of Kiev and television viewers are blitzed with commercials.
But if Tambrands, the first Fortune 500 company to begin manufacturing in
Ukraine, has found a ready market, it has also encountered a rash of
difficulties since it began producing tampons with 36 employees at a plant
20 kilometres outside Kiev on March 8, International Women's Day.
Four hundred employees now produce 14m tampons a month at a brightly-lit,
spotless plant in the town of Boryspil. Seventy per cent of production is
sold within Ukraine, but the plant also exports to eastern Europe and the
UK. Tambrands plans to increase production to about 250m tampons a year,
still only about 2 per cent of the potential market.
Mr Terry Manniex, the British plant director, has been pleasantly surprised
by the high quality of the Ukrainian workforce, recruited locally and
attracted by an average wage of 18,000 coupons a month, more than double
what they could earn in Ukrainian factories. Tambrands is using part of its
locally-generated funds to build 104 high-quality apartments for its
workforce.
'I am very surprised that there are not more companies producing here,' Mr
Manniex says. 'The skills of the local people are excellent.'
But the management of Tambrands Ukraine has been faced with a double-headed
problem: the challenges of doing business in a crumbling post-Soviet economy
and the additional obstacles created by governmental mis-management, both of
which combine to make it difficult for the plant to do more than cover its
running costs and service its debts.
'It is difficult to operate in this country', says Mr Manniex, who is
scheduled to leave later this month when the factory will be turned over
completely to Ukrainian management. 'Every day there are little surprises.'
Tambrands Ukraine started out in 1989 as Femtech, a joint venture formed by
Tambrands' wholly-owned British subsidiary, Tambrands Ltd, and GPU, the
Ukrainian pharmacy monopoly. The arrangement floundered when GPU was
disbanded by the Ukrainian government and Tambrands was forced to buy out
its Ukrainian partner and replace the joint venture with a western-owned
company, Tambrands Ukraine.
Tambrands, like all other western investors in Ukraine, initially enjoyed a
two-year tax holiday. This has now run out and the company has been
subjected to the same irrational and fluctuating taxation system which has
crippled many Ukrainian enterprises.
The plant is also vulnerable to an erratic supply of electricity and water
and has had painstakingly to educate Ukrainian producers in order to obtain
the quality product Tambrands requires.
A further reason why more western companies have not been tempted to set up
manufacturing operations in Ukraine may be the sort of difficulties which
the political convulsions in the former Soviet Union have created for
Tambrands.
Ukrainian government officials say that when Vnesheconombank, the Soviet
bank for foreign economic activity, retaliated against Ukraine's declaration
of independence by freezing all Ukrainian accounts, Ukraine lost more than
Dollars 1bn. Some Dollars lm of this belonged to Tambrands.
More damaging still for Tambrands has been the disintegration of the rouble
zone. The initial concept behind stepping up production in Ukraine was to
buy all inputs domestically, using the proceeds from the sale of finished
tampons.
Since Ukraine's withdrawal from the rouble zone last autumn, this scheme has
fallen apart because Tambrands' suppliers of cotton in Uzbekistan will not
accept Ukrainian coupons as payment. This has forced Tambrands to experiment
with the same complex barter arrangements which take up so much of the
energy of Ukrainian enterprises.
The difficulties of producing in Ukraine have made just-in-time delivery a
distant dream for Tambrands. Instead, as Mr Roman Luchkiv, the 31-year-old
Ukrainian who will take over from Mr Manniex, explains, they have built a
special warehouse where 74 tonnes of cotton are stored to cushion the
factory against fluctuations in supply.
But there could be a light at the end of the tunnel if the Ukrainian
government pulls off its ambitious market reform programme. Mr Manniex
welcomes a plan by Mr Leonid Kuchma, prime minister, to make the Ukrainian
currency at least internally convertible in the fourth quarter of 1993.
'The main success for us would be if the coupon becomes convertible,' Mr
Manniex says. 'Then we are home and dry.'

A BOMB threat, a walk-out of MPs and an inconclusive vote marred the
election of presidents in the new Czech and Slovak republics yesterday,
writes Patrick Blum in Prague.
In Prague a bomb threat caused parliament to be evacuated as Czech deputies
were about to vote. Later Czech television said former Czechoslovak
president Vaclav Havel had won with at least 109 votes in the 200-seat
assembly.
Earlier, deputies staged a walk-out after an attack on Mr Havel by
right-wing opponents who accused him of responsibility for a crime wave
following his amnesty of prisoners during his 1990-92 presidency.
Meanwhile in Bratislava, none of the candidates for the Slovak presidency
won enough parliamentary votes to be elected. Deputies are to vote again
today after what are likely to be hectic talks between parties to try to put
together the necessary 90 votes needed for a candidate's election in the
150-seat Slovak assembly.
The inconclusive first round is a setback for Mr Vladimir Meciar, prime
minister and leader of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), who
had strongly backed Mr Roman Kovac, a former member of the Slovak Communist
party and current deputy prime minister, for the job.
Mr Kovac received the support of only 69 of the HZDS's 74 deputies.

<TEXT>
Lower Italian inflation figures made a cut in official interest rates likely
in the near term, according to the industrial employers' federation
Confindustria, Reuter reports from Rome.
'We expect a reduction in the discount rate relatively soon,' said Mr
Innocenzo Cipolletta, head of research.
Italian inflation fell to 4.3 to 4.4 per cent year-on-year in January from
4.8 per cent in December, according to data from the city of Bologna. The
figures are unofficial but are taken as an accurate guide to consumer
inflation. Official figures are released early next month. The discount rate
now stands at 12 per cent.
Meanwhile, the Italian budget minister, Mr Franco Reviglio, said yesterday
that the forecast of 1.5 per cent GDP growth for 1993 was unrealistic and
that the government now expected growth of between 0.5-0.9 per cent this
year.
'A GDP growth of 1.5 per cent, as forecast, is now unrealistic. Today we
expect a GDP growth for 1993 of between 0.5 and 0.9 per cent,' Mr Reviglio
told journalists.
'Every one point fall in GDP adds L10 trillion lire to the budget deficit,'
he added. The 1993 budget deficit target is L150 trillion.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Italy faces threat of big rise in unemployment: The
worsening jobs outlook has jumped to the top of the political agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT has jumped to the top of the Italian political agenda with
warnings from the Bank of Italy and Prime Minister Giuliano Amato of big
rises to come.
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro took the unprecedented step of writing to the
prime minister urging him to tackle unemployment, which had reached levels
'an industrial democracy could not tolerate in the long term'. Then
yesterday the theme was taken up by Mr Bruno Trentin, head of the CGIL, the
largest trade union confederation.
Figures vary of the number of jobs at risk. According to Censis, the social
research institute, at least 700,000 jobs may go this year. The government
has talked of 500,000 potential job losses.
Concern is increasingly evident in the near daily worker protests over job
cuts. Last week brought a two-hour stoppage in all Pirelli plants, a march
through Naples by employees of the troubled state aerospace group Alenia,
and a rally in Rome by 5,000 workers of Enichem, the lossmaking state
chemicals group.
The unemployment rate is estimated at 11.2 per cent. Although this is
similar to that of Britain and nearly a point higher than France, economists
say Italian unemployment is increasing rapidly.
Industrial production is falling sharply (down 3.7 per cent this month
compared to January 1992). Public and private sector companies are
struggling to remain competitive amid a growing burden of debt. Hard
decisions about job cuts in steel, defence and chemicals have yet to be
made. Added to this, civil service recruitment is frozen and the public
administration is about to be overhauled.
The latest figures for heavy industry show that in October employment was
6.8 per cent down on the same period in 1991. At the same time, the services
sector has ceased to play its traditional role, absorbing excess labour from
industry: employment here is stagnant. The real unemployment picture,
however, is obscured by the employers' ability to lay off workers for up two
years on near-full pay largely subsidised by the government. Use of this
lay-off facility increased 10.9 per cent in 1992 and now embraces 327,000
workers.
Many of those industrial concerns in the north of the country resorted to
this mechanism in mid-1991 at the onset of the economic downturn, and the
time limit will be up this year. In early 1991, the government introduced a
variant to subsidised lay-offs - funding a job mobility scheme. Those on
this waiting list, held open for two years, also are excluded from the
unemployment figures. On February 7, the first 70,000 on this scheme who
have not found jobs become formally unemployed and then have no formal
support from the state.
But the most disturbing aspect of the figures is both the high proportion of
youth unemployment and the disproportionate number of jobless in the south.
Those aged between 14 (the school-leaving age) and 29 represent on average
29 per cent of the total unemployed. In the south of Italy, youth
unemployment represents 42 per cent of the total against 15 per cent in the
centre and north.
Last week, the government announced that close to L50,000bn (Dollars 36bn)
was available, part in unspent previous budget allocations, to stimulate and
sustain employment. Of this L10,000bn was earmarked for public works,
L10,000bn for transport, and L10,000bn for the south.
But yesterday the CGIL's Mr Trentin dismissed this kind of assistance as
being of limited use in promoting real economic growth and sustaining real
jobs. He warned that entire regions in Italy risked being de-industrialised
and said it was essential for the government, unions and employers to
consider measures which brought longer-term economic benefit.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Old problems dog Nigeria's new team: IMF looks to a budget
which revives reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Own Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Chief Ernest Shonekan was landed with one of Africa's toughest jobs he
promptly called in some old friends.
Inaugurated on January 1 as the chairman of Nigeria's transitional council,
responsible for day-to-day administration under the military government, he
had less than a month to preside over the preparation of the 1993 budget.
Along with other Harvard Business School graduates in Nigeria, Chief
Shonekan had helped to prepare an annual pre-budget policy paper for the
past several years. This time it was the real thing. Three weeks later a
reworked civil service draft was ready. The result, due to be delivered in
Abuja today, is a critical test for Nigeria.
Unless the budget revives a lapsed economic reform programme, paves the way
for the renewed agreement with the International Monetary Fund, sets in
train further rescheduling of Nigeria's Dollars 29bn (Pounds 18.9bn)
external debt, and helps restore creditor confidence, the country's
prospects remain bleak.
It is a formidable task. In the seven months to the installation in August
of an elected government, Chief Shonekan and his team will be trying to
impose fiscal and monetary discipline which has been lacking during much of
the military regime's past seven years.
But the men in key posts offer a combination of business experience and
technical expertise which could improve the country's economic performance -
provided they get the backing from President Ibrahim Babangida.
Chief Shonekan himself, one of the country's most respected businessmen, has
been seconded from the chairmanship of United Africa Company Nigeria, the
Unilever subsidiary. He has brought with him Mr Isaac Aluko-Olukon, one of
his closest advisers who is a leading economist.
Mr Oladele Olashoro, who has the finance portfolio, is a former head of
First Bank of Nigeria, one of the big three clearing banks. Mr Philip
Asiodu, the new oil minister, ran the State-owned Nigerian National
Petroleum Company (NNPC) in the 1970s and had a distinguished career as a
senior civil servant.
Capable as the team is, it faces strong resistance from senior military
officers and from civil servants to reductions and controls on government
expenditure. Recent indicators show how necessary they are.
During the first nine months of 1992 net domestic credit grew by 22.3 per
cent, compared with 11.7 per cent in the same period in 1991, according to
World Bank figures, reflecting a sharp increase in net credit to the federal
government of 38 per cent.
Inflation more than doubled, from 23 per cent at end 1991 to 51.3 per cent
at end-August 1992 (year-on-year basis).
Alongside cuts in spending, and improvements in the taxation system (the
federal government derives 80 per cent of its revenues from oil exports),
western donors will be watching for action on oil products subsidies.
Some of the business community in Nigeria regard the removal of the subsidy
as essential to the credibility of the transitional council. They argue that
it would save the government approximately N80bn (Pounds 2.56bn) a year,
enough to wipe out most of last year's budget deficit.
Proceeds, they argue, could be used to provide public transport.
Opponents of a drastic cut in the subsidy believe that this would only solve
half of the problem. The lack of accountability in Nigeria's public finances
would make it difficult for the transitional council to ensure that the
saving from the subsidy was spent on economic development.
Since controls on government spending are very weak, the additional income
could well go on military purposes and on uneconomic industrial projects.
Above all, there are fears that a cut in the petroleum subsidy would lead to
riots. Nigerians not only cherish their access to the cheapest petrol in the
world; they faced a sharp rise in other consumer prices since the 40 per
cent devaluation of the naira in March 1992.
Observers will be cautious about making any assessment of today's budget
based solely on the figures presented to the National Assembly, however. In
recent years budgeted and actual figures have not tallied, and official
statistics have been unreliable.
The Central Bank of Nigeria has recently published its 1991 annual report,
for example, which states that instead of the government surplus of N100m
for 1991 which was announced in last year's budget speech, there was a
budget deficit in 1991 of N35.3bn.
This deficit is about 12.5 per cent of GDP, well above IMF guidelines. The
surplus in the 1992 budget looks likely to result in a deficit even larger
than in 1991, according to local bankers.
The real test of the new government, say observers, will not be the budget
but how it puts it into practice.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration is 'actively reviewing' US policy towards Angola,
and diplomats believe it could soon establish full diplomatic relations with
the Luanda government for the first time since the civil war that followed
independence from Portugal in 1975.
Mr Venacio da Moura, Angola's foreign minister, is expected to meet senior
State Department officials in Washington this week, although the precise
level of the meeting has not yet been arranged.
Under the Bush administration, US patience with its long-time ally, the
Unita resistance movement led by Mr Jonas Savimbi, was already wearing thin.
US officials were irritated by Mr Savimbi's refusal to accept the results of
last year's elections, which they viewed as broadly fair.
Democrats in Congress have never been as convinced as Republicans that Mr
Savimbi was a heroic fighter against communism, and the new administration
is expected to have few qualms about abandoning Unita.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Singapore may relax policies on savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR LEE KUAN YEW, Singapore's senior minister, has said Singapore might relax
some of its rigid policies on savings in order to allow entrepreneurs to
start businesses and make more wide-ranging investments.
'There is merit in the view that the government should not over-protect
people and give them opportunities to take risks and enrich themselves,' Mr
Lee said.
Several economists and academics have said that Singapore is saving too much
and not properly utilising its considerable capital reserves.
The Central Provident Fund (CPF), a compulsory social security scheme funded
by employers and employees, has accumulated funds in excess of SDollars 50bn
(Pounds 19.6bn) while Singapore's foreign exchange reserves are officially
put at USDollars 40bn (Pounds 26bn).
Savings stand at 47 per cent of GDP, one of the highest savings rates in the
world. Mr Lee said that, while the government could not allow people to
squander their savings, he agreed with suggestions that some CPF funds could
be released. Mr Lee has been urging Singaporeans to become more adventurous
and invest overseas.

SALVAGE tugboats yesterday were reported to have extinguished the fire that
had burned for five days on the Danish supertanker Maersk Navigator, AP
writes from Singapore. The ship had been involved in a collision at the
northerly entrance to the Strait of Malacca last Thursday.
Foam sprayed by the tugs smothered the blazing crude oil gushing from the
255,000 tonne tanker, according to a statement issued by AP Moller, owner of
the ship.
A terse message from the Dutch salvage company Smit Tak, hired by Moller,
said: 'Foam attack was successful and now cooling. All resources standing by
in case of a flare-up. Preparing for oil pollution control.'
Pollution experts flying over the stricken ship said it was spilling oil
more slowly.
However, a 35-mile-long, mile-wide slick has drifted to within 10 miles of
the coral-ringed southern coast of India's Great Nicobar Island.
'Our coastguards are on full alert. We are closely watching the slick,' the
Indian environment minister Kamal Nath said.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Seoul cuts rates to boost investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACK BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA yesterday cut the central bank's rediscount rates in an attempt
to revive the sluggish economy.
Government officials hope that the interest rate reductions will encourage
companies to increase investments and pull the economy out of its slowest
growth period since 1981.
The Bank of Korea, the central bank, recently estimated that the economy
grew by 4 per cent last year against 8.4 per cent in 1991.
The slowdown was primarily caused by the government's strict monetary policy
to cool the overheated economy and reduce inflation.
But the measures proved to be more effective than officials had expected,
curbing growth far below the target figure of 7 per cent.
The government wants to achieve a growth rate of at least 6 per cent this
year.
The reduction in the rediscount rates, which is what the central bank
charges on loans to other banks, is the sharpest since 1982.
They include lowering the rediscount rate on commercial bills by two
percentage points to 5 per cent, while rates on trade bills were cut by one
percentage point to 6 per cent.
This will result in the commercial banks' general lending rates being
lowered by 1.5 to 2 percentage points from the current range of 10 to 12.5
per cent.
The finance ministry estimates that lower interest rates will raise the
profitability of Korean companies this year by cutting financial costs by
more than Won 3,000bn (Pounds 2.47bn) and reducing their interest payments
to 5.4 per cent of sales from 6.2 per cent last year. But a cut of one to
three percentage points for deposit rates, which were also announced
yesterday, are likely to decrease bank profits this year as the gap between
deposit and lending rates is reduced.
The government predicts that the interest rate cuts will add one percentage
point to economic growth this year and 1.5 percentage points annually over
the next five years if companies use the money for industrial investments.
But some warned businesses may be tempted to use the funds instead for
property speculation, as Seoul recently eased restrictions on property
purchases by large companies.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE government is under mounting pressure to stimulate the stagnant
economy, after a clutch of official figures published yesterday which show
that consumer confidence is still deeply depressed.
Government figures show that household spending in November rose by just 0.2
per cent from a year before, after adjusting for inflation.
Household spending rose by 0.5 per cent in the first 10 months of last year,
compared with the same period in 1991, as consumers slashed spending on
furniture, household appliances, electronics and gifts, according to figures
from the Management and Co-ordination Agency.
Prospects for an economic recovery largely hinge on a revival in
consumption, which accounts for about 57 per cent of gross national product.
The continued weakness of consumer sentiment is fuelling pressure on the
Bank of Japan to cut official interest rates and on the government to pledge
to cut income taxes this year.
Mr Tsuneo Wakai, chairman of the Federation of Bankers' Associations, added
his weight to recent calls by other employers' leaders for an income tax
cut.
Ministers emerging from a regular cabinet meeting acknowledged the mounting
pressure for further moves to resuscitate the economy.
Mr Hajime Funada, the head of the economic planning agency, said cuts in
housing-related taxes were being considered alongside a straight income tax
cut. Mr Yoshiro Mori, the trade and industry minister, said the Bank of
Japan was seriously considering a further cut in interest rates.
However, the Finance Ministry is still holding out against a tax cut which
would lead to a rise in government borrowing.
The ruling Liberal Democratic party yesterday agreed to a Finance Ministry
medium-term plan which envisages the government's dependence on bonds
falling from 11.2 per cent of the budget this year to 4.9 per cent in 1995.
The economy is likely to remain depressed for the first half of the year,
according to the economic planning agency's index of leading indicators
which forecast the state of the economy three to six months ahead.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Yeltsin redefines relations with India: An old debt that is
stunting a mutually beneficial relationship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin arrives in India tonight for a three-day
visit that will define Russia's future relationship with India.
At the top of his agenda will be the resolution of a long-standing dispute
over India's Rs380bn (Pounds 8.5bn) debt to the former Soviet Union. Neither
country has been able to arrive at an acceptable settlement after the
rouble's rapid collapse from its previously fixed rate. However, Russia
needs the money, and would like to retain its biggest customer for military
equipment, and India wants to ensure an uninterrupted supply of arms,
including the sensitive high-technology weapons it cannot secure from the
west.
Mr Yeltsin, who is accompanied by a high-powered delegation, assured India
on Monday that Russia would respect a 1991 contract for the sale of three
cryogenic rocket engines, despite concerns expressed by the US. 'If some
agreement is signed we should follow it, we cannot stop it,' Mr Yeltsin
said.
For more than 40 years India has been dependent on the former Soviet Union
for its defence equipment. It was one of the largest beneficiaries of the
former Kremlin policy of supplying arms to developing countries with little
means of paying for them.
The country also enjoyed a special trade arrangement with Moscow which
allowed military equipment to be procured on soft credit and against payment
in rupees - which are not convertible currency.
'In the changed scenario, India and Russia have a chance to forge a new,
more equal relationship,' a senior Indian diplomat said. 'It seems absurd
that an old debt can be allowed to stand in the way.'
Realising the potential for trade in India, Russia has shown interest in a
joint venture co-producing spares for MiG-21 fighter aircraft. These would
be marketed to countries flying 6,800 of the Russian-made aircraft.
At least 10 bilateral agreements - including a new treaty of friendship and
co-operation to update the existing one signed 20 years ago - are to be
signed during the forthcoming summit.
However, the planned exclusion of clauses on military aid, in the event of
an armed attack on either country, has drawn criticism from Indian Foreign
Ministry officials. 'These are the clauses that made the 1971 pact
meaningful,' one diplomat said. 'A friendship treaty makes no sense with
India and Russia no longer sharing the same geopolitical and strategic
perceptions.'
In addition, a hefty defence package including proposals for the
co-production of military hardware, the joint development of Light Combat
Aircraft (LCA) and the updating of MiG-21Ms, is due to be agreed. A Dollars
400m (Pounds 263.1m) Indo-Russian arms deal was also signed after Defence
Minister Sharad Pawar's visit to Moscow last September.
Reports yesterday suggested that Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, Russian first deputy
prime minister, and Mr Manmohan Singh, Indian finance minister, might have
worked out a deal on the debt issue. Indian Commerce Ministry officials said
it was for Mr Yeltsin and Prime Minister Narasimha Rao to announce the
details of the compromise, but the Russian news agency Tass reported that
the maximum concession Moscow could make on India's dues was up to 28 per
cent of an amount pegged by Russian officials at Dollars 15bn.
India agreed last week to pay 45 per cent of its debt pegged at Rs380bn,
amounting to about Rs180bn.
Mr Shumeiko, who ranks number two in the Russian cabinet and is co-chairman
of the joint Indo-Russian commission on trade and economic co-operation,
returned to Moscow yesterday after preparing the ground for Mr Yeltsin's
visit. The abundance of skilled manpower, management expertise and cost
effective technology in India, together with Russia's vast industrial base,
offered huge potential for the two countries to set up joint ventures, he
said.

FT  27 JAN 93 / UK wary over US remarks on UN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday expressed reservations over remarks by the new US
secretary of state, Mr Warren Christopher, suggesting it might be desirable
at some time to raise the number of permanent members on the UN Security
Council.
British Prime Minister John Major hinted on his tour of India that he did
not see a case for early council changes: 'I wouldn't wish to do anything to
make it less effective.' Mr Major, who is anxious to form a good
relationship with President Bill Clinton, added: 'These are matters that
will have to be discussed if there is a general will for them to be
discussed. But they are not new ideas. They've been around for some time.'
In a wide-ranging discussion with State Department staff in Washington on
Monday, it was put to Mr Christopher that '. . . the permanent members of
the Security Council. . . reflect the realities of world power in 1945. Is
it time for a change? Should the Security Council be expanded? And do you
think any further nations should be offered a seat on the permanent
membership of the Security Council?'
He replied: 'Yes, I think it's time for some reorganisation of the UN to
bring it into keeping with modern realities. During the campaign, President
Clinton said that he could envisage the addition of Germany and Japan to the
permanent members of the Security Council at the UN. And I suspect we'll see
some developments in that direction.
'But, at the same time, I would want to acknowledge the complexity of that
decision. I'm sure we've all been in organisations, and when you begin to
make changes, there are other people who feel they are entitled to a seat at
the table. So, I wouldn't want to underestimate the complexity of making
that change, but I think it is time to bring the UN. . . into tune with 1993
realities rather than, as you say, with 1946 realities.'

ISRAELI Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin yesterday attacked a call by Mr Boutros
Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary-general, for the Security
Council to take 'whatever measures are required' to force Israel to reverse
the mass expulsion of Palestinians to Lebanon.
In the latest of a series of tough statements on the issue - which threatens
the progress of Middle East peace talks - Mr Rabin said Mr Boutros Ghali's
call was 'an example of double standards. . . an almost unprecedented demand
from the Security Council to act against Israel, something I cannot recall.'
Mr Rabin has refused to overturn the expulsions, saying they were a
justified response to a wave of killings by Islamic fundamentalists.
But the Palestine Liberation Organisation says it will not resume peace
negotiations until they are reversed. Mr Rabin said he hoped the US would
veto any move in the Security Council to impose sanctions against Israel, as
it has always done in the past.
Mr William Harrop, the US ambassador in Tel Aviv, said the Clinton
administration was 'most unlikely' to allow the imposition of sanctions. But
he said Washington wanted a prior solution to the issue.
Mr Nayef Hawatmeh, a radical Palestinian leader, said yesterday the US,
Israel and Egypt were discussing a proposal for a phased return of the
deportees over 24 months.
Arab foreign ministers agreed yesterday to urge the UN Security Council to
impose sanctions on Israel if it refuses to let the deportees return home,
Reuter reports from Cairo. The statement, due to be issued later yesterday,
also called on the Security Council to appoint an international force to
protect Palestinians living in the Israeli-occupied territories.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Iraqis face humanitarian crisis, says Oxfam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'ORDINARY Iraqis are still facing a humanitarian crisis,' according to a
team of aid workers that has just returned from Iraq.
The team, from the British-based charity Oxfam, spent two weeks in Iraq
visiting Baghdad, the south and the north.
They were especially concerned by the lack of sewage treatment and clean
water supplies in the south (where many urban areas are ankle deep in 70 per
cent raw sewage) and by the lack of heating oil in the north, where oak
forests are being felled for firewood in the absence of other fuel.
The shortage of textbooks, blackboards and other educational aids throughout
the country was another big area of concern.
At a press conference in London yesterday Mr David Jones, Oxfam's associate
director who led the team, urged the UN and Iraq to resume negotiations on
oil sales to finance the purchase of food and other humanitarian supplies
not subject to UN sanctions.
He also called for the sanctions regime to be re-examined to allow more
exemptions, notably for educational supplies, the lack of which was
'stunting the mental development of a generation of Iraqi children'.

BRITAIN yesterday called on Japan to hasten moves to allow more foreign
competition in its financial markets, the most difficult to penetrate among
the world's leading economies, according to a British official.
A team of officials from the UK, led by Sir Nigel Wicks, the second
permanent secretary at the Treasury in charge of international affairs,
concentrated on persuading the Japanese to open the insurance, pension fund
management and government bond markets particularly.
Sir Nigel praised the progress made in the last year to deregulate interest
rates and the authorities' commitment to continue with liberalisation in the
face of the severe downturn in the financial sector.
However, he added: 'It is surprising when we see the sophistication of the
economy, the strength and size of the financial houses in both banking and
securities that they take such a long time to liberalise.
'Of all the G7 economies, no financial market is so difficult for foreign
finance houses to penetrate as Japan's,' Sir Nigel said.
There were encouraging signs that the Japanese government was planning
gradually to open up the insurance market to competition.
But Sir Nigel said his Japanese counterparts had been unable to justify
their unwillingness to open further the government bond market and pension
fund management.
About 60 per cent of Japanese government bonds are auctioned, with the rest
sold through a tender system, closed to foreign finance houses. The British
team called for all government bonds to be sold by auction.

SUN LIFE Assurance, the UK life company, is planning a joint venture in
India to market unit-linked life assurance - the first move into the Indian
life industry by a foreign company in recent years.
The venture is expected to be launched this year in partnership with the
Life Insurance Company of India (LIC), the state insurance monopoly.
Mr Peter Grant, Sun Life's chairman, won informal approval for the venture
this week from the Indian Finance Ministry. He is visiting India as a member
of a delegation of senior British businessmen who have accompanied Mr John
Major, the prime minister, on an official visit.
Life insurance has been a state monopoly in India since the industry was
nationalised in the 1960s. LIC has to lend most of its premium income to the
government and its managerial freedom is limited.
Nevertheless, in line with the Indian government's economic deregulation
programme, LIC is being encouraged to develop new products and services.
Sun Life plans to take a 20-30 per cent stake in the new venture and to
supply expertise in marketing and managing unit-linked schemes, in which
insurance is combined with saving.
The remaining 70-80 per cent would be held mainly by LIC, possibly with
other Indian partners.
Mr Major was yesterday the chief guest at celebrations marking India's
Republic Day, which passed off with great pomp and without incident. The
British prime minister has made promoting British business the main purpose
of his trip.
Local businessmen urged him to help the Indian government embark on the
privatisation of state-owned industries.
He is likely to offer UK expertise on selling formerly loss-making
nationalised industries when he addresses businessmen in Bombay today.

FT  27 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Big Three may act over car imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Big Three US car makers yesterday threatened to file 'unfair trade'
cases in order to get stiff dumping duties imposed on all Japanese cars.
Mr Steve Harris, a Chrysler spokesman, said the companies had long been
monitoring the pricing practices of Japanese companies. However, a final
decision on whether to go ahead had not yet been taken.
'At the very least, the situation is unfair,' he said. 'If we determine that
it is also a violation of US laws, we will take appropriate action.'
The New York Times reported yesterday that the car makers had already
decided to bring dumping action against all car imports. Mr Harris said they
were 'not looking closely' at filing cases against European producers.
Since the election of President Bill Clinton, the Big Three have been
considering various strategies which they believe are now possible in a more
receptive climate. They were the only industry group received by the
president in Little Rock during the transition.
At the time industry officials said they wanted to ensure that the president
fulfilled his campaign promise to raise import tariffs on Japanese mini-vans
and sport utility vehicles. But clearly wider action against imports was
under consideration.
Company spokesmen yesterday were emphasising the 'chronic' US motor trade
imbalance with Japan. They said even US-produced Japanese cars contained
only 40-50 per cent US parts - the equivalent of another Dollars 1bn (Pounds
649m) in imports.
'The Japanese have to address this problem,' said Mr Al Chambers, director
of corporate communications for Ford Motor Company.
'The fact that they maintain these imbalances year after year means they are
not acting like good trading partners.'
The car companies could have much to gain from dumping suits, according to
Mr Jim Bovard, a trade expert and author of The Fair Trade Fraud. Although
the suits will cost the car companies millions of dollars, it is easy to
prove dumping in the US.
'Almost everything is dumping,' he said. 'Normal business practices are
considered unfair dumping.' Whereas foreign companies are assigned an 8 per
cent profit margin in the calculations, 'the Big Three have lost lots of
money and that's legal'.
Sales of US-made cars and light trucks are running above last year's levels.

FT  27 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Clinton inherits thick file of trade
problems - Some of the main issues confronting the new administration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is expected today to levy steep tariffs on allegedly dumped steel
products, the first action on an agenda jammed with potential trade
conflicts which now awaits the attention of the Clinton administration.
If trade history repeats itself, the tariffs, postponed from yesterday, will
result in a series of bilateral 'suspension agreements' and a new round of
'voluntary' steel quotas - with price floors as a new twist.
They may also provoke new enthusiasm for a multilateral agreement to limit
government subsidies and lower trade barriers to steel around the world.
As part of a US administration which talks of providing its own subsidies to
assist the development of new technologies, Mr Mickey Kantor, the new US
trade representative, may find it much less difficult to wrap up agreement
than did his more ideological predecessors.
The same may not be true for the Uruguay Round talks. Evidently briefed by
some of the American farm groups, who are dissatisfied with the US-EC farm
deal, Mr Kantor indicated 'concern' about the much-trumpeted Blair House
deal. That deal was supposed to sweep away obstacles to successful
conclusion of the Round.
It is widely believed that agreement has been reached to reopen the draft
Uruguay Round text prepared by Mr Arthur Dunkel, director general of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), for changes necessary to get
a deal through Congress.
The US has insisted on amendments to the texts dealing with intellectual
property, anti-dumping, subsidies, standards, technical barriers to trade,
and the proposed multilateral trading organisation.
Some progress has been made in talks on lowering tariffs on manufactured
goods, at which the US has reportedly agreed to cut its tariff 'spikes' in
exchange for negotiations to reduce several tariffs to zero (ie on paper,
wood products and nonferrous metals).
US officials believe a deal cannot be achieved before March 2, the deadline
for informing Congress that the administration intends to proceed towards a
Gatt deal. However, there have been talks between trade officials and
Congress about extending the deadline (for the second and last time) by
between one and six months.
Mr Kantor has offered to meet the Senate finance committee over the EC
utilities directive, which gives advantages to local companies in bidding
for government procurement contracts for telecommunications and heavy
electrical equipment. He may soon ask industry to suggest a sanctions list
totalling about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 649m).
Then he may turn his attention to the US-Japan semiconductor agreement,
which set as its goal a 20 per cent Japanese market opening to foreign
semiconductors by the end of 1992. The final figures will not be available
until March, but initial findings suggest that Japanese companies have
fallen 4 percentage points short on the pact.
Mr Kantor told the finance committee that by law he is probably free to
impose sanctions, but he also stressed that the 20 per cent was a goal, or
'expectation', rather than a commitment.
The US motor industry has already put in its bid for favours from the
Clinton administration. It would like tighter 'voluntary' restraints on
Japanese imports and even restrictions on the number of vehicles produced in
the US by Japanese subsidiaries. The latter request is unlikely to win
support, but the administration may agree to reclassify Japanese minivans as
trucks rather than cars, which would raise their tariff levels from 2.5 per
cent to 25 per cent.
The toughest decisions have already been taken over the North American Free
Trade Agreement.
President Clinton has said he must have side agreements covering labour
standards as well as the environment and import surges. Without these Nafta
will never get through Congress.
The administration must still decide how far it can push Mexico on internal
standards without interfering with its national sovereignty, thus setting a
precedent it may later regret.
Mr Kantor will soon have to advise the president on whether to continue the
generalised system of preferences, which extends duty-free access to the US
for products from developing countries.
It is unlikely that a Democratic president - no matter how centrist - would
slash a programme meant to help poorer countries. But this Democratic
president is under pressure to save the Dollars 500m a year the programme
costs the US Treasury.
President Clinton has said he wants to provide more help to the republics of
the former Soviet Union. His predecessor had been able to have it both ways.
He gave grain credits to Russia and called them 'aid,' but when Moscow
defaulted on repayments, the 'aid' was firmly withdrawn.
The new administration must decide whether to discard the pretence that the
republics can repay anytime soon and make a gift of the surplus grain, which
in any case is fast piling up in storage bins and depressing US prices.

THE leaders of the August 1991 Soviet coup are to be freed from jail but
prevented from leaving the country pending a trial set yesterday for April
14, Leyla Boulton writes from Moscow.
Of the 12, seven have already been released from custody, and the remaining
five were allowed to go home yesterday on the grounds of illness.
An incompetent prosecution of the case, plus growing popular sympathy for
the former Soviet leaders, suggests that the trial may not even go ahead in
the end.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Maastricht budget targets prove elusive: Painful surgery is
needed as big deficits endanger the EC plan for economic and monetary union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Maastricht budget deficit targets agreed by the EC in 1991 to pave the
way to economic and monetary union (Emu) are proving uncomfortably elusive.
With recession and high real interest rates pushing the targets increasingly
out of reach, most EC countries look likely to register budget deficits this
year of more than 4 per cent of GDP, while their overall public debt ratios
will worsen.
Budget deficits are booming partly as an automatic effect of recession,
which reduces tax revenues and increases social security pay-outs.
Countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Italy are still
trying to cut the structural component of their deficits by making economies
in areas like health care and social security.
But three of the four largest EC economies - Germany, France and the UK -
appear recently to have switched away from fiscal austerity in a bid to
combat recession through increasing expenditure.
The Maastricht treaty lays down a number of hurdles to allow countries to
qualify for Emu towards the end of the century. Overall government debt
should not exceed 60 per cent of GDP, while annual budget deficits should
not be more than 3 per cent of GDP.
The treaty also sets targets permitting Emu membership only for countries
registering good performances on inflation and long-term interest rates.
The treaty could allow Emu membership for countries which did not precisely
achieve the fiscal targets. But Germany has indicated that only those
members which precisely fulfil the targets would be allowed to join.
Ironically, Germany itself is being blamed for a good deal of the overshoot.
Increasing German budget deficits caused by reunification have been the main
reason behind high Bundesbank interest rates - and these have spread
recession throughout the EC.
'We are all living in bad times,' says Mr Jean-Paul Betbeze, chief economist
at Credit Lyonnais in Paris. 'They have shocks in Germany. And because they
are trying to solve this selfishly, we are all bogged down.'
Credit Lyonnais is forecasting a French budget deficit of FFr220bn (Pounds
26.73bn) this year - nearly 3 per cent of GDP - based on an assumption of
1.2 per cent growth in the French economy.
However, other economists are still more gloomy. The UK merchant bank SG
Warburg, forecasting nil growth for the whole of the EC this year, believes
the French deficit will be much higher at FFr325bn - 4.5 per cent of GDP.
Mr George Magnus, international economist at Warburg, says countries will
need 'painful fiscal surgery' as well as a return to much higher growth
rates to stay on track for the targets by 1996.
Long-term interest rates - which remain high in Europe despite cuts in
short-term rates - are a key impediment to necessary budget restructuring,
Mr Magnus says.
Mr Robin Hubbard, chief economist at Paribas Capital Markets in London, is
forecasting a French budget deficit of FFr270bn this year.
Governments' inability to stick to a credible Maastricht convergence path
'shows that the Maastricht targets were a bit of a nonsense,' he says. 'The
Maastricht targets were laid down at German insistence. But the country that
looks like missing all of them at the moment is Germany.'
Mr Hans-Peter Frohlich, senior economist at the Cologne-based Institut der
deutschen Wirtschaft (IdW), the free market research body, says, 'Germany's
chances (of meeting the fiscal targets) are worse than six months ago.'
The IdW calculates Germany's overall budget deficit is currently about 5.5
per cent of GDP, including some spending which is not at present in the
consolidated government accounts.
Economists generally agree that the German government's package of spending
cuts and revenue increases unveiled last week make little change to the
sources of Germany's structural budget deficits.
Indicating lack of longer term success in budget consolidation, the Bonn
government is forecasting that the federal budget deficit will more than
double by 1995 and 1996 compared with previous optimistic forecasts in June
1992.
Experts at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in
Paris admit that their relatively sanguine forecasts published last month
for 1993 budget deficits have now been overtaken by events.
The forecasts were based on assumptions of German 1993 growth of 1.2 per
cent, whereas the Bonn Economics Ministry has now officially stated it
expects zero growth for unified Germany this year.
As a rough rule, the OECD believes that, for every 1 percentage point fall
in economic growth, budget deficits throughout the EC rise by 0.4 to 0.5
percentage points. This indicates that, by the end of the year, there will
be still more red ink for governments to mop up.
The Maastricht fiscal targets are designed to be met in 1996 or, failing
that, 1998 as a condition for moving to a single currency. Returning to the
Maastricht convergence path later this decade is not impossible. But it will
require painful fiscal policy changes, combined with a return to much higher
EC growth rates than are likely for 1993 and 1994.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Rouble in sharp fall against Dollars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE rouble plunged 15 per cent yesterday to a record low of Rbs568 against
the dollar amid concern over Russia's loose monetary policy. A record
Dollars 84.83m changed hands on Moscow's tiny Inter-bank Currency Exchange
in a longer than usual session of over an hour.
The fall increases pressure on the Russian central bank and the government
to agree on common action to strengthen the currency.
The central bank spent about Dollars 40m intervening in the currency
exchange yesterday. Demand for foreign currency at the auction, which is
held twice a week, was double the amount on offer when trading opened. This
forced the central bank to drive the rate down to Rbs568 from an opening
level of Rbs493, and even then to provide half the hard currency sold in
order to meet demand.
At the start of the year the rouble traded at 417 to the dollar. A central
bank official said the bank's only chance of stabilising the exchange rate
would be sharply to increase interest rates although he could not say
whether this would happen. Its equivalent of the discount rate is still at
80 per cent a year, although inflation has now reached 10 per cent a week.

FRANCE produced a record FFr30.55bn (Pounds 3.71bn) trade surplus last year,
a sharp turnround from the FFr29.55bn deficit in 1991, thanks to a gain in
market share by industrial exporters and a slowdown in demand for imports,
writes William Dawkins in Paris.
Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, said the result was the fruit of
French companies' rigorous control of wages and other costs, which had
improved their competitiveness by 10 per cent over the past five years. The
result, the biggest reversal in nearly 13 years of trade deficits, is good
news at time when the Socialist government is threatened by electoral
defeat.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Pensions case at EC court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE oral hearings in the Coloroll Pension Trustees' equal pension rights
case took place at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg yesterday,
writes Robert Rice, Legal Correspondent.
The court must decide whether equality is required only for pension benefits
earned by service since May 17, 1990, the date of the Barber judgment, or
for benefits which were earned by service before that date.
The difference in the cost of these interpretations to British pension
schemes has been estimated at Pounds 40bn.
In the Barber case the court ruled that EC equal pay rules were applicable
to pension claims, but only from the date of that judgment. This restriction
was enshrined as a protocol in the Maastricht treaty.
The Coloroll case will now be considered by an advocate general of the
court. The court's final judgment is not expected until July.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Spain vetoes KIO charges

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MADRID court yesterday refused an application by Grupo Torras, the Spanish
investment arm of the Kuwait Investment Office, to bring criminal charges
against seven former senior executives who had masterminded the KIO's now
troubled investment drive in Spain. Judge Miguel Moreiras of Madrid's senior
monetary court ruled that the action did not contain 'a single indication'
that fiscal crimes had been committed.
The judge's decision constituted a sharp reversal for a new Kuwaiti team,
headed by Mr Mahmoud al-Nouri, which took over the management of both the
KIO and Torras midway through last year. In a series of controversial
decisions the new management cut off funds to Torras companies and put the
holding's big chemical conglomerate, Ercros, into receivership last July.
Accusing the former management of an 'apparent misappropriation' of funds,
the new team put Torras itself into receivership last month citing losses of
Dollars 4bn.
Torras lawyers had filed a criminal lawsuit two weeks ago alleging a series
of irregularities, including fraud, tax evasion, falsifying public deeds and
price manipulation.
The lawsuit accused Sheikh Fahad al-Sabah, the KIO's former chairman and a
cousin of the Emir of Kuwait, as well as Mr Fouad Jaffar, the KIO's former
general manager, Mr Javier de la Rosa, former deputy chairman of Torras, and
four other former senior managers of causing 'fraudulent losses for the
company well in excess of Pta100bn (Pounds 577m)'. The judge said that Sheik
Fahad, as chairman of the KIO, had express authority from Kuwait's Finance
Ministry to manage the office's investments abroad as he saw fit and that
the office's Spanish executives had at all times informed the KIO, 'up to
the last detail', of investments and disposals conducted by Torras.
The ruling seemingly upheld the claims of Mr de la Rosa and others included
in the lawsuit that the new KIO management was seeking to settle political
scores rather than run the assets under its control.

CROATIAN forces yesterday pressed forward in their drive to secure control
of strategic Serb-held territory in the republic despite a reprimand from
the United Nations Security Council.
President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia offered to withdraw his army if Serb
militia handed over heavy artillery seized from United Nations-supervised
arms depots in Croatia's four UN-monitored zones.
He said: 'We must install civilian power and normalise life in the region.
Our military forces will withdraw from the regions they have liberated in so
far as the Serb paramilitary forces are disarmed and give up the heavy
weapons they seized,' said Croatian radio.
Mr Tudjman also said Croatian police would replace all military forces in
the region, a move likely to be fiercely opposed by Serb militias who have
refused to disband under the year-old UN peace plan.
After two French peacekeepers were killed on Monday, near the Adriatic port
of Zadar, France announced it was sending a naval task force led by the
aircraft carrier Clemenceau into the Adriatic Sea.
Clashes between Serb and Croatian fighters yesterday appeared confined to
the area around the vital Maslenica bridge, which joins Croatia's heartland
with the southern Dalmatian coast.
But a UN spokesperson cited 'disturbing reports of unusual Croatian troop
movements' south of Knin, the centre of Krajina, outside the area of
conflict. With the Croatian army in control of the damaged and vital
Maslenica bridge since Monday, Serbs in Belgrade continued to sign up to
fight to defend Krajina, the self-proclaimed Serb state which stretches from
the Dalmatian hinterland to Croatia's border with Serbia.
Western diplomats fear the fighting could spread. At least 10,000 people
were killed in 1991 when Serb fighters, backed by the Yugoslav Army, took up
arms against Croatian independence.
A UN ceasefire last January froze the Serbo-Croat conflict although the
Croatian government was increasingly frustrated by Krajina's Serbs who have
virtually severed the republic.
The Security Council on Monday condemned Croatian attacks on Serb-held
territory in the UN zone and demanded that Serbs return heavy weapons to UN
supervision.
Meanwhile, Mr Vitaly Churkin, a Russian deputy foreign minister, flies to
Croatia today to urge the end of what the Moscow has described as
'irresponsible terrorist action' by Croatian fighters.
Judy Dempsey adds from Berlin: Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister,
said he hoped any decision by the Security Council on whether to enforce a
no-fly zone over Bosnia-Hercegovina, would not break the ruling coalition.
But his remarks, which imply more a warning than a hope, coincided with
deepening divisions within the coalition about Germany's participation in
surveillance flights by Nato AWACS aircraft if the UN decides on
implementing the no-fly zone.
Earlier this week, Mr Manfred Worner, the Nato secretary general, warned
that any Nato operation could be undermined if German crews did not
participate.
The US, acknowledging that five oil barge groups on the Danube river appear
to be heading towards Serbia in violation of UN sanctions, said yesterday it
was up to Romania and Bulgaria to do whatever is needed to force compliance,
Reuter reports from Washington.
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the US and the UN sanctions
committee had told both governments they had authority under UN resolution
787 to stop suspected vessels.

   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Ukrainian cabinet yesterday approved a tough economic reform programme
which seeks to steer Ukraine towards a market economy over the next year.
The plan, supported by both the conservative and progressive wings of the
government, suggests that the Ukrainian prime minister, Mr Leonid Kuchma,
has succeeded in converting his government to reform.
The programme includes a stabilisation policy to reduce the budget deficit
from 36 per cent of gross domestic product to 6 per cent. It also aims to
bring inflation down to 3 or 4 per cent a month by the end of 1993. To do
that the government has pledged to cut social welfare payments and subsidies
to the state sector.
The plan also calls for comprehensive structural reform including rapid
privatisation of small-scale enterprises and the transformation of large
state concerns into joint stock companies.
The programme is likely to further anger Ukraine's ex- communist dominated
parliament. The hardline parliament has already called for the repeal of
government decrees liberalising prices, privatising land and capping wages
at state enterprises.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Vaclav Havel, the former Czechoslovak president and playwright, last
night became the new Czech Republic's first president.
The election came in a secret ballot after a chaotic day in the Czech
parliament.
A bomb threat caused the parliament to be evacuated as the Czech Republic's
deputies were preparing to vote.
Earlier, deputies staged a mass walkout following a scathing attack on Mr
Havel by right-wing opponents. They had accused him of responsibility for a
crime wave of civil war proportions following his amnesty of prisoners
during his 1990-92 presidency.
Mr Havel, who has been the most popular Czech politician since the fall of
the communist regime in 1989, won 109 votes from the 200-member parliament
in the ballot.
In Bratislava, the Slovak parliament was also voting to elect a president
yesterday, but none of the four candidates running won enough parliamentary
votes to be elected.
Deputies are to vote again today after what are likely to be hectic talks
between parties to try to put together the necessary 90 votes needed for a
candidate's election in the 150-seat assembly.
The inconclusive first round is a setback for Mr Vladimir Meciar, prime
minister and leader of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), who
had backed Mr Roman Kovac, a former candidate member of the Slovak Communist
party and deputy prime minister.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE collapse of the rouble against the dollar on Moscow's narrow inter-bank
market yesterday underlines the wider problems caused by shortage of
capital, the need for positive interest rates to attract capital, and the
importance of concentrating investment in specific regions of Russia where
pro-market reformers are in power.
This was the conclusion of discussion on 'local power and economic change in
Russia' conducted by Professor Philip Hanson of Birmingham University at the
Royal Institute of International Affairs yesterday. 'The size of the
country, the lack of a consensus on reform, the lack of a functioning legal
system or the means of coercion means that local power is crucial to the
outcome of economic reforms,' he said.
His views on the importance of the local factor, in a country which has
disintegrated into 82 administrative regional units ranging from big cities
like Moscow and St Petersburg to obscure ethnic and geographical outposts,
were reinforced by Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, architect of the still-born
'500-day reform programme' rejected by former President Mikhail Gorbachev.
To prevent the 'chaotic, individualistic disintegration of Russia
accompanied by frustration and violence' Moscow should concentrate on
re-establishing monetary discipline and control of banking, credit and
monetary policy accompanied by maximum devolution of other powers.
'Devolution is preferable to disintegration. It recognises the reality that,
for the first time in its history, Russia has to keep itself together
without force applied through a centralised bureaucracy,' he told a meeting
at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Mr Yavlinsky is currently working with the EBRD and the International
Finance Corporation on fostering privatisation in Nizhny Novgorod, one of
the reformist areas receptive to market reforms which, if successful, could
serve as models for wider emulation. 'Micro-projects of the Nizhny Novgorod
type provide an example of civilised decentralisation and the basis of new
types of linkages to replace the authoritarian, top-down structures under
which Russia has been ruled since Peter the Great,' he argued.
But with the disintegrating Russian economy now on the brink of
hyper-inflation the monetary authorities must raise real interest rates to
positive levels to encourage higher savings and more rational investment.
Russia must also push ahead with privatisation of key sectors like land,
energy, gold and diamonds in order to raise the efficiency of key productive
sectors and ensure the irreversibility of reform. 'At the moment everything
is still nominally state-owned, so those who oppose reform only have to take
over the state to get all their power back again,' Mr Yavlinsky warned.
The Soviet coup leaders are to be freed from jail but prevented from leaving
the country pending a trial set yesterday for April 14, Leyla Boulton writes
from Moscow.
Of the 12, seven have already been released from custody, and the remaining
five were allowed to go home yesterday on the grounds of illness. An
incompetent prosecution of the case, plus growing popular sympathy for the
former Soviet leaders, suggests that the trial may not even go ahead in the
end.

Contingency plans are being made to withdraw British troops from the former
Yugoslavia although the government has no immediate intention to pull out,
Baroness Chalker, Britain's overseas development minister, said yesterday,
writes Sheila Jones. 'Like any good army we have to be prepared for any
eventuality,' Lady Chalker said. 'There is real and perfectly understandable
worry about troops and aid workers. I believe we should be seeking to
continue as long as we reasonably can.' Britain's 2,400 troops, helping to
guard UN aid convoys, would continue to play a humanitarian role so long as
it was safe to do so and would not be drawn into fighting.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE produced a record FFr30.55bn (Pounds 3.71bn) trade surplus last year,
a sharp turnaround from the FFr29.55bn deficit in 1991, thanks to a gain in
market share by industrial exporters and a slowdown in demand for imports.
Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, said the result was the fruit of
French companies' rigorous control of wages and other costs, which had
improved their competitiveness by 10 per cent over the past five years.
They would continue to gain market share, up by nearly a percentage point to
7.4 per cent in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
over the past three years, despite the recent declines in some European
currencies, he predicted.
The result, the biggest reversal of nearly 13 years of French trade
deficits, is vital good economic news when the Socialist government is
facing electoral defeat partly because of its inability to reduce record
unemployment of 10.5 per cent.
The news helped strengthen the franc against the D-Mark yesterday, a further
sign that it may be recovering from the recent waves of speculative selling
of the French currency.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Geneva talks risk being victim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE international consensus so laboriously built up on the former
Yugoslavia, and which has invested the Geneva peace talks with the required
weight and authority, risks being one of the many victims of the renewed
Serbo-Croat fighting in the enclave of Krajina.
All the main powers have so far backed the diplomatic negotiations on
Bosnia-Hercegovina, chaired by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, as the best way
to reach a settlement, but the past few days have revealed cracks in the
common front.
The Croat offensive to reclaim some former territory occupied by the Serbs
in the 1991 war has simultaneously deprived the Geneva talks of their
momentum, led countries such as France and Britain, with peace-keeping
forces in Croatia and Bosnia, to re-examine their role, and reawakened old
alliances like those between Russia and Serbia.
Confusion has been compounded by the agonising reappraisal of US policy
towards the former Yugoslavia, and Bosnia in particular, by President Bill
Clinton's new administration. If, as widely reported, Washington is leaning
towards lifting the embargo on arms deliveries to the Bosnian Moslems,
currently applied against all the warring factions in Bosnia, such a step
has become more controversial following the Croatian attack in Krajina.
Traditionally sensitive about what it has always seen as the western powers'
bias against the Serbs, Russia has become more outspoken in its demands for
a more even-handed approach. Moscow's warning that it might ask for UN
sanctions against Croatia shows how the wind is blowing.
The least that can be said is that Russia will oppose a selective lifting of
the arms embargo which would favour the Bosnian Moslems in their civil war
against the Bosnian Serbs, as long as punitive action was not taken by the
international community against the Croats.
Mr Vance is doing his utmost to persuade the new US secretary of state, Mr
Warren Christopher, that the lifting of the arms embargo, let alone direct
military intervention, would be a recipe for disaster and lead to worse
fighting.
Not even the two powers which have contributed most to the UN protection
force in Croatia and Bosnia, France and Britain, are entirely on the same
wavelength. Both governments have said their forces (5,000 French and 2,400
British) are there only in a peacekeeping role. But the loss of several
soldiers' lives has led both governments to send naval task forces,
including aircraft carriers, to the Adriatic.
The French government has come under pressure from public opinion to
reconsider its opposition to military intervention in Bosnia, following the
killing of 11 French soldiers since the UN started operations there. By
contrast, British public opinion appears to favour withdrawal of British
forces from Bosnia, following the death of one British soldier.
The co-chairmen of the Geneva conference believe the Croatian and Serbian
leaders will still try to limit the fighting. But their mediation efforts
will have to show results rapidly if the peace process is not to collapse.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EXCESSIVE wage rises or any other avoidable increases in inflationary
pressure will rule out cuts in German interest rates, Mr Helmut Schlesinger,
president of the Bundesbank, threatened yesterday.
In an unusually direct criticism of trade union ambitions, he singled out
this year's 26 per cent pay claim for eastern German metal workers in a
renewed attack on the danger of inflation.
It would be impossible to offset such an increase with rate cuts, however
big they might be, he said in Leipzig, Saxony.
Any increase in inflationary tendencies 'which can still be avoided' would
rule out interest rate reductions, he warned in a speech at the installation
of Mr Olaf Sievert as president of the central bank of Saxony and Thuringia.
He was speaking after local IG Metall union leaders rejected a 9 per cent
pay offer for members in Saxony. The union insisted on a 26 per cent rise,
agreed in 1991 as part of a package assuring eastern members of pay parity
with the west by 1994. The issue will now go to arbitration.
Mr Schlesinger's speech coincided with figures from Baden-Wurttemberg
showing a jump in inflation this month to 4.2 per cent a year, compared with
3.5 per cent in December.
Mr Schlesinger's choice of words suggest that while this month's increase in
value added tax and persistently rising rents - due to a national housing
shortage - could be regarded as 'unavoidable', inflationary pay increases,
either in the east or west, could not.
An over-generous award to Saxony's engineers would almost certainly be
followed by similar deals for their colleagues in other eastern states and
increased pressure for equal treatment for other workers in the former GDR.

A key question is whether the court's landmark May 17, 1990 ruling ordering
equal pension rights in the European Community applies to benefits earned
before the judgment was issued.
The court will hear detailed arguments over the next few months. The
Advocate General is then expected to issue a report. A final judgment is
expected around mid-year.
The new case joins suits from four parties in Britain, Germany and the
Netherlands. One involves pensioners from Britain's Coloroll Group, which
has gone into receivership.
In the 1990 judgment, Barber vs Guardian Royal Exchange, the court ruled
that a provision of the Treaty of Rome outlawing sex discrimination in pay
schemes applied to pensions.
It limited the degree to which the ruling could be retroactive, but in
technical language that was not clear.
EC leaders tried to clarify the situation by adding a protocol to the
Maastricht treaty saying the Barber ruling would apply only to benefits tied
to an employee's service after May 17, 1990.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Banking watchdog's role will cover small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANKING ombudsman scheme is to be extended to cover complaints from
small businesses, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced yesterday as
he disclosed that a survey had cleared banks of failing to pass on cuts in
base rates.
The Bank of England survey, which found that average loan margins had
'hardly changed' since June 1991 although fees had risen by 5 per cent, was
welcomed by banks but criticised by the Labour party and some small business
groups.
The Bank survey found that 61 per cent of small business loans linked to
base rates fell exactly in line with the 4.5 percentage point cut over the
period. Margins widened on 30 per cent of loans, and narrowed on 9 per cent
of them.
The chancellor has agreed with the British Bankers' Association to extend
the ombudsman scheme to cover complaints of maladministration from
incorporated business with a turnover below Pounds 1m. Banks initially
resisted this. Mr Lamont welcomed the confirmation of cuts in loan margins,
but said the extension of the scheme - which until now has covered only
personal customers and non-incorporated businesses - would provide 'an
independent view'.
Sir Nicholas Goodison, president of the BBA and chairman of TSB Group, said
the inquiry had been 'worth doing' and had laid to rest accusations against
the banks which led Mr Lamont to call for an inquiry.
Sir Nicholas said banks had been concerned that Mr Laurence Shurman, the
banking ombudsman, would be asked to adjudicate on matters of 'commercial
judgment' such as loan margins, but they were happy at the final terms of
reference.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, who said that the largest four banks
had increased charges by Pounds 1.5bn in 3 1/2 years, said the chancellor
had proved to be a 'pushover for the banking establishment'.
Mr Brown said the report offered 'no comfort at all to thousands hit by bank
charges, high margins and overcharging'.
The banking ombudsman, funded by the banks, last year received 10,109
complaints - 60 per cent up on 1991. The ombudsman's council said it hoped
for 'an early start' to the changes.
Mr Derek Wanless, chief executive of National Westminster Bank, said the
bank had strengthened its internal complaints procedure, and he did not
think the ombudsman would face a wave of complaints.
Mr Stan Mendham, of the Forum of Small Business lobby group, said the
inquiry had 'let the banks off the hook' because loan margins and fees were
less important than restrictions in credit levels and availability.

FT  27 JAN 93 / UK base rates cut to 15-year low: One-point reduction lifts
shares but leaves sterling sharply lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, PETER NORMAN and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK INTEREST rates were cut by a full percentage point to their lowest level
for more than 15 years yesterday in an unexpected move to help economic
recovery.
The cut to 6 per cent, which took senior ministers and the markets by
surprise, was swiftly followed by announcements from banks and building
societies that they would cut mortgage rates by just over  1/2 a percentage
point.
Share prices moved sharply higher, but the pound weakened significantly
after the announcement. The move was generally welcomed by industry, which
expressed the hope that it would bring down borrowing costs for thousands of
struggling businesses.
But the base rate cut drew a less than euphoric response from Conservative
MPs at Westminster. Hopes that it would give a boost to the outlook for
recovery were tempered by fears that it reflected an element of panic in
Downing Street or the prospect of more bad news on the economy.
Cabinet ministers had expected Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to wait
until nearer to the Budget on March 16 before lowering borrowing costs. They
speculated that Mr John Major had been the active force in bringing the cut
forward.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, found himself in the
embarrassing position of being unware of the announcement when asked about
it some hours afterwards in a television interview.
Mr Lamont said Britain now had the lowest interest rates in Europe and that
prospects were becoming 'better and better'.
Speaking in New Delhi, the prime minister said the cut in interest rates was
necessary to boost economic confidence and return Britain to 'a secure
pattern of growth'.
The London stock market saw the biggest daily rise since September 18, two
days after the UK left the European exchange rate mechanism, as investors
reasoned that lower borrowing costs would at last bring recovery from the
longest recession since the 1940s. The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares
rose 63.8, to close at 2,835.7, within a whisker of the all-time high
recorded on January 4 this year. Investor satisfaction at the move spilled
over to the gilts market where prices gained up to 1 point.
However, the foreign exchange markets took a dim view of the fourth
one-point cut in interest rates since Britain left the ERM. After heavy
selling of sterling for other currencies, the pound closed in London at
DM2.424, down 2 3/4 pfennigs on the day. Against the dollar it closed just
over 2 cents lower at Dollars 1.538. In New York it closed at DM2.4264 and
at Dollars 1.5445.
The cut in commercial banks' base rates from 7 per cent to 6 per cent came
shortly after the Bank of England reduced the rate at which it lends to the
banking system by the unusual device of announcing a minimum lending rate
just before 10am. The Bank's move, which came ahead of today's auction of
Pounds 2.5bn of medium-dated gilt-edged stock, infuriated many gilt
marketmakers. Because of the subsequent rise in gilt prices, they face
losses estimated at Pounds 25m in their auction operations.
The decision to take short-term UK interest rates more than 3 points below
Germany's internationally important Lombard rate came after a string of
bleak economic indicators, including a sharp rise in unemployment, a fall in
manufacturing output and sluggish broad money growth.
In a Treasury statement, Mr Lamont said the cut in rates was 'appropriate'
given Britain's economic background. The government believed the move was
'consistent with the necessary restraining influence on inflation'.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, welcomed the cut but said it did not
add up to an economic strategy to deal with rising unemployment and falling
investment.
'The government will have to do far more in employment and industry measures
to ensure sustainable recovery and the reversal of national economic
decline,' he said.
The Liberal Democrats welcomed the cut but said it was 'foolish' to imagine
it would end the recession.
Tory backbench MPs meanwhile again warned Mr Lamont against tax increases in
the Budget. They said that lower interest rates should not be the precursor
to higher taxes.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Mercedes changes gear on way to less luxurious future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MERCEDES-BENZ, one of the world's leading luxury carmakers, is to produce a
people's car.
Yesterday's announcement by the company that it was planning a small city
car is part of a radical overhaul to its range foreseen during the 1990s.
Other models to be developed include a 'people carrier' or multi-purpose
vehicle and a four-wheel drive leisure/utility model.
Mr Helmut Werner, chief executive-elect of the automotive subsidiary of
Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial corporation, said Mercedes-Benz's
current models had been 'over-engineered' and warned that future ranges
could be 'priced out' of the market if such 'over-engineering' was allowed
to continue through the 1990s.
He heralded sharp price changes for future models, implicitly accepting they
must compete more closely with Japanese-made luxury cars.
Mercedes-Benz is also to be drastically reorganised with a reduction in
management layers from six to four, a substantial cut in the 7,200-strong
central staff in Stuttgart and the introduction of decentralised
'performance centres'.
The company will accelerate plans to assemble passenger vehicles outside
Germany and to search for partners in the development of components.
Mr Werner said Mercedes would be transformed from a traditional maker of
exclusive luxury cars into an 'exclusive full-line manufacturer offering
high-quality vehicles in all segments of the market'.
The company has plans for:
A 'people carrier' or multi-purpose vehicle to rival products such as
Renault's Espace and Chrysler's Voyager. It will be produced in Spain and
launched in late 1994 or early 1995;
A four-wheel drive vehicle to rival Land Rover's Range Rover and Discovery,
Chrysler's Grand Cherokee and the Mitsubishi Pajero/Montero/Shogun;
A small city car to be introduced during the second half of the 1990s. This
could be similar in size to the Twingo recently launched by Renault.

<TEXT>
COMMENTS BY leading politicians advocating government support for the
market, and renewed hopes of an imminent cut in the official discount rate,
prompted short-covering and shares rose for the first time in three trading
days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average gained 205.18 at 16,492.63, its first rise of more than
200 points since December 18.
The index fluctuated between 16,216.11 and 16,535.47, jumping near the end
of the session before losing some gains on profit-taking.
Volume increased to 200m shares from 175m. Advances led falls by 572 to 364,
with 187 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
improved 5.85 to 1,255.91, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 2.17
to 1,016.24.
Calls by Mr Yoshiro Mori, the minister of international trade and industry,
for government support for the weak stock market boosted sentiment, along
with comments by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, who hinted at the
possibility of public support for the land purchasing organisation set up
today for the country's ailing banks.
Some retail issues held by Shuwa, the troubled stock and land speculator,
gained ground. The stocks recently met heavy selling on reports that Shuwa,
which is squeezed for cash, was looking for buyers of the stocks. Isetan,
the department store, rebounded Y110 to Y1,920, Nagasakiya rose Y47 to Y805
and Matsuzakaya Y42 to Y992.
Oil issues were in favour on an overnight surge in the oil sector on Wall
Street, due to growing expectations of output reductions by Opec members.
Nippon Housing Loan, burdened with mounting bad loans, fell Y13 to Y266 on
reports of a Y60bn annual loss.
On the over-the-counter market, NMB Semiconductor, affiliate of Minebea,
lost Y100,000 to Y658,000, falling by its daily limit for the third
consecutive session. Minebea and Nippon Steel are in negotiations over the
transfer of NMB, and the Japan Securities Dealers Association is
investigating possible insider trading of NMB shares prior to the
announcement.
In Osaka, the OSE average firmed 45.72 to 17,805.77 in volume of 44.3m
shares. Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets were mixed yesterday.
HONG KONG returned from the long holiday weekend, but after some early
buying prices gave up much of the advance to leave the Hang Seng index a net
9.34 up at 5,923.73, after touching 5,970. Turnover of HKDollars 2.09bn was
down from last Thursday's HKDollars 2.34bn.
HSBC was the most active stock, rising HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 62 in line
with sharp advances in London in recent days.
AWT World Transport said its public offer of 38.15m shares at HKDollars 1.02
each was more than 81 times oversubscribed.
AUSTRALIAN shares held on to early gains to close slightly higher in
scattered trade which was hampered by the Australia Day holiday. But the
crossing of two large portfolios in London brought sharp movements in
transport leader Brambles. The All Ordinaries index added 5.8 at 1,529.2.
Brambles rose 8 cents to ADollars 16.20 in early trade but fell back to
close 12 cents down at ADollars 16 after broker Ord Minnett sold 3.65m
shares at ADollars 15.80. Minnett also sold a portfolio valued at ADollars
2.3m, while BZW sold two portfolios, each valued at ADollars 70m, in London
overnight. The London portfolio trade boosted local turnover to 110.9m
shares.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index rose 8.50 to 1,605.28, just below
the record 1,607.12 set on March 27, 1990. Volume was 43.8m shares.
MANILA was lower after last week's rally and the composite index fell 22.83
to 1,317.31.
Brokers said the market had already discounted President Fidel Ramos's
announcement of his determination to break up the monopoly of phone giant
Philippine Long Distance Telephone. PLDT shares ended 25 pesos lower at 865
pesos
The state-run National Development Company is to auction 89.7 per cent of
International Corporate Bank in April after acquiring 40 per cent of the
equity from American Express Bank. The remaining 10 pct of the bank, known
as Interbank, will be sold immediately after to small Filipino investors.
SEOUL was easier, with the widely expected announcement of interest rate
cuts already discounted.
The composite index shed 5.11 to 702.50 in heavy trade.
KUALA LUMPUR was mixed in thin trading with the market lacking a clear
direction. The composite index edged up 0.41 to 626.34.
TAIWAN is to offer stakes in state-owned enterprises to foreign investors
during the next six months as the government pushes ahead with its faltering
privatisation programme.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Growing pessimism on pound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CURRENCY dealers yesterday took a pessimistic view about the immediate
future for sterling after the UK unexpectedly cut base rates by 1 percentage
point to 6 per cent, writes James Blitz.
The pound fell more than 3 pfennigs against the D-Mark in the morning,
dropping through an important technical support level of DM2.4350 in the
wake of the Bank of England's move.
The currency bottomed out at DM2.4200 before closing at DM2.4250, almost 3
pfennigs down on the day. Its loss against the dollar was mitigated by the
US currency's weakness, but the pound ended in London at Dollars 1.5380,
more than 2 cents off on the day. In New York it closed at Dollars 1.5445.
Dealers said there had been heavy selling of sterling by both banks and
institutions, with few operators coming into the market to buy the currency
back. There were signs that investment funds were not completely short of
sterling, and that selling potential remained.
The view that the pound may now test DM2.40 - and perhaps the historic low
of DM2.3693 set on October 5 last year - seemed to be widely held in the
London market.
Mr Mark Austin, an economist at Midland Global Markets, said there was
already a strong expectation of another cut in rates before or at the March
Budget. 'Yesterday's move has changed people's perceptions about UK economic
policy and we will see sterling lower from here,' he added.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America, commented
that the rate cut had actually raised concern about the UK economy. 'There
is still no real evidence that the UK economy is recovering,' he said.
However, the bearishness about the pound was also due to changing
perceptions about the Bundesbank's intentions on short-term rates.
Until the beginning of this week, there had been speculation that the
Bundesbank might ease policy at its council meeting on February 4. But
difficulties over the public sector wage talks in Germany has raised fears
that the Bundesbank may not ease policy until February 18.
The rise in the inflation rate in the German state of Baden-Wurttemberg by
1.2 per cent in December - slightly worse than the market had anticipated -
added to the bearishness over German policy. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank president, compounded the gloom by saying that an increase in
inflation would prevent a Bundesbank rate cut.
In spite of these worries, the dollar gained nearly  1/2 pfennig against the
D-Mark to DM1.5770. The French franc firmed to FFr3.382 per D-Mark after a
previous close of FFr3.385. In New York the US unit receded to DM1.5712.
However, the sight of three-month French francs at 12 1/8 per cent yesterday
led one dealer to claim that tensions in the European exchange rate
mechanism were bubbling below the surface.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Money Markets: More cuts expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING cash and futures markets were yesterday discounting another easing
in UK monetary policy by the summer, after the Bank of England signalled a
cut in base rates from 7 per cent to 6 per cent, writes James Blitz.
Sterling money market dealers were surprised by both the scale and timing of
yesterday's move. Instead of signalling a base rate reduction to dealers in
the course of its operations, the Bank had to take the unusual step of
posting a minimum lending rate at the start of the day.
Few dealers had been planning to offer bills to the Bank at rates below 7
per cent base rate; and the lack of bills in the market, the product of
substantial cash shortages in recent days, would have made the subtle
signalling of policy technically difficult to accomplish.
Although UK base rates are now at their lowest since 1977, dealers were
betting on more cuts this year.
There was a sloping yield curve in the cash market last night, with
three-month money ending at 6 1/4 per cent and the one-year rate at 6 per
cent.
Futures dealers appeared initially uncertain whether any more cuts would
come before the March UK Budget. The March contract finished at 94.08, a
level that prices three-month money at 5.92 per cent.
However, dealers in the June contract clearly believed that there will be a
50 basis-point reduction in rates by the summer. The contract closed at
94.37, pricing three-month money in June at 5.63 per cent.
One institution was willing to bet that base rates would fall substantially
further this year. A dealer was reported to have bought an option to lend
Pounds 250m for three months in September at 5 per cent.
The tone of trading in the cash market should now improve. Few dealers
expect a policy-easing immediately, and bills should be sold more readily to
the Bank. The overnight rate closed yesterday at 6 1/2 per cent, in spite of
a big shortage of Pounds 1.4bn.
One dealer suggested yesterday that, with base rate at such a low level, it
will be harder to push wholesale cash rates down. He said depositors in the
retail sector were moving out of cash deposits into gilts. This makes the
banks increasingly reliant on wholesale trading to fund their books, and
creates a greater demand for funds.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee prices tumble further on
New York fund selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON COFFEE prices tumbled further yesterday following the dramatic fall
in the New York market overnight as commodity funds liquidated their
positions.
But there were signs of an end to the decline, which has dismayed delegates
from producer countries in London this week for talks on renewing an
international coffee agreement.
The London March robusta contract opened nearly Dollars 50 a tonne down,
before recovering to close at Dollars 840 a tonne, down Dollars 15. The
nearby New York arabica contract fell by 6.75 cents to 56.05 cents on
Monday, with 22,000 lots traded.
Yesterday it touched a low of 54.10 cents in early trading, but began to
recover in the afternoon. Last August the New York market fell below 50
cents, but then began an advance which culminated in a closing peak of 81.55
cents on December 21, when London reached Dollars 1,081 a tonne.
'This market is not trading on fundamentals, but is being moved by the
weight of money wielded by the funds,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with
GNI, the London futures broker yesterday.
'I think we have seen the bottom today - but with volatility like this it
would be a brave man who takes a position,' he added.
The volatility of the market was such that the London Clearing House took
the unusual step of making a margin call during trading hours. This requires
market players to cover any paper losses showing on their positions.
'The market has taken such a battering that it's very jumpy,' said one
London trader. But he pointed out that, while the London market was down, it
had closed at the day's high. 'This indicates that the liquidation is coming
to an end.'
The fund liquidation in New York fed on itself, sparking chart-based selling
and forcing players out of the market. In such conditions, progress or lack
of it at the International Coffee Organisation talks over the next fortnight
becomes a side issue.
ICO delegates have got off to a slow start, according to the Reuter news
agency. The ICO has until the end of March to reach a new agreement.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Consolidating for the futures -
The merging two big US commodities exchanges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US futures exchanges have been tilting at a variety of windmills in the
1990s, fussing like mature matrons as more agile upstarts steal away their
global dominance. Electronic trading, competition from over-the-counter
derivatives markets and blossoming overseas exchanges have all been blamed
for the fading lustre of New York and Chicago markets.
The big US exchanges, however, have also been concerned about the monster
within - increasingly bureaucratic and expensive structures and fundamental
changes in how futures are traded.
The Chicago Board of Trade's plan, announced on Monday, to acquire New
York's big metals market, the Commodity Exchange (Comex), is a bold step to
fight those internal monsters and, if futures pundits are correct, it may be
the first of many such mergers.
'I believe unambiguously that this industry will consolidate, just like
we've seen in the airline business, the communications industry,' said Mr
Richard Sandor, CBoT board member and managing director of Kidder, Peabody.
It was too costly, he said, for 11 US futures exchanges to operate
independently.
In Europe, where the trend toward national exchanges is growing, there is
also some consolidation. Germany's Deutsche Terminborse and France's Matif
announced two weeks ago that they would join forces, recognising cost
savings and substantial increase in competitive clout.
Member approval of the CBoT's Comex takeover, particularly on the Comex
side, is far from certain. The exchange's leadership will have to convince
independent floor traders that the financial advantages of the partnership
will compensate Comex members for their loss of voting representation on the
exchange.
Regulatory approval of the merger may come more easily. Mr William Albrecht,
acting chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures
industry watchdog, said his staff would examine the proposal when it arrived
in Washington. 'Personally,' he said, 'I am quite receptive to actions which
simplify and standardise clearing functions. Such actions contribute to more
efficiency in the markets.'
The CBoT will pay nothing for the Comex, and a fund set up to buy out Comex
memberships after the merger will be financed by the New York exchange's
current and future income. Executives at both exchanges said they were
confident that the affiliation would boost volume and profits at Comex.
The exchange, which is free of debt, has assets of Dollars 18m and cash on
hand of Dollars 12m. However, its life-blood - volume - has slipped
substantially, and without a marketing and research transfusion, could face
extended volume and seat value erosion.
Comex's main products, silver and gold futures, have been battered both by
the recession and the absence of inflation. With only one financial contract
 -the newly launched Eurotop 100 stock index future - it also suffers the
general malaise of US commodity exchanges. While commodity trading has
always been cyclical, the shift in futures business to managed funds has
consolidated trade and cut down on the profits available to locals (dealers
operating on their own account). As pickings in agricultural pits get
slimmer, more and more traders cross over to more profitable opportunities
in financial markets, further starving the commodities arena of capital.
The New York exchange's futures volume dropped to 10.7m contracts last year
from 12.6m in 1991. At the same time the London Metal Exchange has thrived,
building turnover to 24.7m contracts last year from 17m in 1991.
The CBoT, while remaining the world's largest futures exchange, has not been
immune to the trend toward slumping commodities volume. Its turnover last
year was up 7.6 per cent to 150m contracts but its agricultural futures
volume stalled. Attempts at offering new non-financial products have also
lagged. Despite thriving Treasury markets, CBoT membership values and member
profitability have also been on a decline. A study of member profitability,
commissioned by Mr Thomas Donovan, the exchange's president, recently
confirmed that member incomes were down. Particularly big losers were the
independent soyabean futures traders, whose profits were off 40 per cent
last year when measured in 1982 dollars.
Chicago exchanges, sensing the trend, have spent the last year working at
cost-cutting consolidations. New York Exchanges, engaged in long-running
squabbles, have been unable to follow. When asked on Monday why Comex did
not affiliate with a New York partner, Ms Donna Redel, the exchange's
chairman, said none had offered. Comex had agreed to consolidate trade
clearing operations with the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, but Ms Redel
said that agreement had not been acted upon and would be voided if the new
partnership with the CBoT was approved.
In an interview, Ms Redel urged other New York exchanges to follow Comex's
lead and join with Chicago. No such discussions are in process, but CBoT
officials said they would welcome other partners.
Mr Patrick Arbor, the CBoT chairman, said his exchange would continue to
support Comex's part in a consortium of New York exchanges that plan to
build a new headquarters complex and trading floor in Manhattan.
In effect, the Chicago/New York merger will draw Comex into the joint
efforts of the big Chicago exchanges. Mr Arbor said the CBoT intended to
list Comex contracts on Globex, the after-hours electronic trading system
jointly owned by the CBoT, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and Reuters
Holdings. Mr Leo Melamed, chairman of Globex Corporation, applauded the
proposed merger.
The CBoT and the CME are slowly working toward joint clearing operations,
and have merged overseas marketing functions. Comex will benefit from these
joint efforts as well.
The CME has been relatively low-key about the merger announcement, declining
to issue formal comment. Informally officials are taking a wait-and-see
attitude. The CME's volume was up 24 per cent this year, and seat prices are
at all-time highs. Its commodity volume comprises only 5 per cent of overall
turnover. With such strong results, CME executives feel they are on a better
footing than the CBoT.
The CBoT is still attempting to weave another, much larger alliance with the
London International Financial Futures Exchange. Negotiations appear to have
stalled, however, and CBoT officials did not mention that proposed
partnership Monday, when announcing the Comex merger plan.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: London traders sceptical about
US merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Metal Exchange might have to change its strategy for the US
market if the proposed merger of the Chicago Board of Trade and New York's
Commodity Exchange is consummated, said Mr David King, the LME's chief
executive, yesterday.
'It would be a very strong partnership because the CBoT already is the most
powerful and largest futures exchange. If the merger goes through the goal
posts will have been moved in the US and the LME would have to work harder
to increase its penetration of the market there.'
However, Mr King, like some LME traders, pointed out that Comex previously
had merger talks with the New York Metal Exchange, which came to nothing.
'There have been so many false alarms in the past that I will believe it
only when they finally sign the merger documents,' said one trader.
The LME believes it can look forward to substantial growth in the US because
that country accounts for about 25 per cent of the world's non-ferrous base
metals activity but only 15 per cent of LME business. 'So, in the absence of
other factors, there is obvious scope for business growth,' Mr King pointed
out.
At present the only competition the LME faces in the US is from the Comex
copper contract and, when the first LME-authorised warehouses in the States
started operating a year ago, copper was excluded so as not to challenge
this contract. Comex's is a dollar contract whereas copper is traded in
sterling in the LME 'ring' and the situation occasionally presents arbitrage
opportunities to LME traders.
However, recent turbulence in the currency markets caused a change of heart
among London-based traders so the LME copper contract will next July switch
to dollars. This move increased pressure from some members for the LME to
establish copper warehouses in the US, which they see as an important step
towards winning more North American copper hedging business away from Comex.
Mr King was scheduled to outline the LME's reconsidered policy about US
copper warehouses when world industry representatives gather at American
Metal Market's 'copper week' in New York in mid-February. He may have to
rewrite his script.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Banana exporters 'devastated'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATIN AMERICAN banana exporters will be 'devastated' by the decision in
December by the European Community to set tariffs on banana imports from the
region, a meeting of the Union of Banana Exporting Countries has concluded.
The union claims 174,000 workers will lose their jobs as a result of the EC
decision, which fixed a 2m tonne quota for Latin American exporters at a
reduced duty of Ecu100 (Pounds 80) a tonne, and a hefty Ecu850 tariff -
about 170 per cent - on exports above that level.
A study presented by the union says the new EC banana regime, forged to
protect traditional Caribbean exporters to the EC and at the same time to
move towards a tariff-based system of regulating imports, will pull 33,600
hectares (83,000 acres) out of banana production, 12 per cent of the total
area planted, in its seven member countries - Colombia, Costa Rica,
Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama and Venezuela.
Mr Enrique Betancourt, executive director of the union, says export volumes
will fall by 30 per cent from the 1992 level of 2.6m tonnes.
He makes no mention, however, of the fact that banana exports to the EC from
Latin America surged rapidly between 1989 and 1992 as exporters positioned
themselves for expected liberalisation of the EC banana market on creation
of the single market on January 1 1993. Exports surged by 20 per cent over
that period, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES will call for timber trade rules to be extended to
non-tropical countries at today's meeting in Quito, Ecuador to negotiate a
new timber treaty.
The 1985 International Tropical Timber Agreement expires in 1994, and its 50
signatories, which include countries with more than 90 per cent of the
world's remaining tropical rainforests as well as most of the non-tropical
forests, have been divided about the form of a new treaty.
The Malaysian and Indonesian governments have indicated that they will press
for new rules, which will cover how fast forests can be cut down, to apply
to all forests. Developing countries have also called for the new treaty to
cover pricing of timber. At the previous meeting in Japan in November,
developed countries including the US, Canada and the European Community were
highly reluctant to adopt the new proposals.
The UK government's position in the negotiations is that to widen the treaty
would be to lose its focus on preserving rainforests. Mr Michael James of
the UK Timber Trade Federation, which advises the UK government on the
discussions, said yesterday: 'The agreement would change character
considerably if extended and there could be administrative problems - the
organisation is already overstretched'.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argentine company denies threat
to Falklands squid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S LEADING commercial fishing company says the illex squid -
life-blood of the Falkland Islands economy - is under no threat from
overfishing. 'The illex is underexploited, not overexploited,' according to
Mr Mario Olaciregui, president of the Harengus fishing group.
Although he lacks scientific data to support his claim, Mr Olaciregui says
the first of his six squid boats began fishing on Thursday, just as the
season opened, and found the vessel was quickly overloaded.
'There is enough illex for everyone,' he insists. 'This is based on
empirical observation.' Harengus has fished for squid for years, catching
12,000 to 15,000 tonnes a year. It has found that squid availability varies
very little.
Mr Olaciregui adds that the illex market is limited to Japan, South Korea,
Spain and Italy, so demand is reasonably stable.
In December, Argentina announced that it would offer licences for foreign
ships to fish for illex squid in its waters - in direct competition with the
Falkand Islands, which in 1987 set up a highly lucrative licensing regime.
The islanders say the illex is a delicate resource, which if overfished
could be eliminated. Mr John Barton, Falklands director of fisheries, said
yesterday: 'Fishing pressure is already very high and we firmly believe that
a moderate increase in fishing effort will lead to a collapse of the stock.'
Last year, the Falkands reported licence revenues of Pounds 25m, some 80 per
cent of which came from illex licences. Mr Barton says that Argentina's
offer of cheaper licences has lured away most of the islands' Asian clients,
undermining its revenues.

GOLD held early gains on the London bullion market and pushed above initial
resistance at Dollars 331 a troy ounce in late trade, but was expected to
find Dollars 332 a much tougher barrier. Dealers said the market had rallied
on stop-loss buying by weak shorts and some covering ahead of today's
European options expiry. The dollar's soft tone and a report that China's
central bank had bought a large portion of the huge Dutch gold sales in 1992
were also supportive. Chinese buying lifted the COPPER market out of its
recent neutral range on the LME. The trend was aided by option buying and
talk that there was likely to be a strike at Enami's Ventanas smelter after
today's strike vote. The rise took three-month metal above resistance around
Dollars 2,250 a tonne, with final business at Dollars 2,258, up Dollars 30.
The London COCOA market was depressed partly by chart-based selling in New
York, although the weakness of sterling and signs of industry demand helped
to limit losses.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts rally sharply following surprise
base rate cut
</HEADLINE>

UK GOVERNMENT bond prices rallied strongly in the wake of yesterday's
surprise cut in base rates. Dealers said they had been expecting a cut
before the Budget on March 16, but yesterday's move had beaten their
expectations by a few weeks.
Dealers said another base rate cut was possible before the Budget.
The sharp price rise sparked by the rate cut caused a scramble among the
market-makers who rushed to cover the short positions which they had taken
out ahead of today's gilt auction. However, traders said the Pounds 2.5bn
auction of 8 1/2 per cent Treasury stock due 2007 should still proceed
smoothly.
The prospect of a large supply of long-dated paper coming to the market held
the gain at the longer end to just under a point, while the shorter end rose
over a point, causing the yield curve to steepen further.
The Liffe March gilt future ended at 101.02, up one point on the day but off
the day's high of 101.23. Volume in the futures market was high at 60,650
lots.
ITALIAN government bond prices jumped over half a point following the UK
base rate cut, which raised hopes of an imminent cut of at least half a
point in Italy's discount rate.
These hopes were further fanned by data from the city of Bologna, which
showed Italian inflation fell to 4.3 to 4.4 per cent year-on-year in January
from 4.8 per cent in December, and by a fall in yields on three-month paper
and in average rates at the Bank of Italy's repo.
Dealers said buying interest in Italian government bonds was gaining
momentum, because Italy's interest rates had fallen far slower than the UK's
since last September when both countries' currencies left the European
exchange rate mechanism. Italy's discount rate currently stands at 12 per
cent.
The Liffe March Italian contract rose 0.56 point to 95.82, on volume of
15,333 contracts, off the day's high of 96.02, while the benchmark 12 per
cent bond due 2002 rose 0.61 point to 95.87.
GERMAN government bond prices were hit late in the day by a warning from the
Bundesbank president, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, that an increase in
inflationary trends would rule out a cut in interest rates, particularly
when those trends could be prevented.
The Liffe March bund contract came off the day's high of 92.97 to end at
92.71, up 3 basis points on the day in above-average volume of 73,889 lots.
Earlier in the day, DM3bn worth of 10-year bonds from the Treuhand
privatisation agency was sold via a consortium of both German and foreign
banks. The paper carries a 7 1/8 per cent coupon and a launch price of
100.50 to yield 7.05 per cent. In late grey market trade, it was quoted at
99.74/80.
A second amount will be auctioned today and a third amount will be allocated
to the central bank for market intervention. Dealers expect the bond to
total DM8bn.
PROFIT-taking following Monday's big rally, strong economic figures and weak
demand for the two-year issue, left longer-dated US Treasury securities
lower yesterday.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  23/32 at
104 1/2 , yielding 7.248 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was down  1/32 at 100 19/32 , to yield 4.282 per cent.
Supply pressures exerted their influence on the market early yesterday, with
dealers marking down prices ahead of the afternoon auction by the Treasury
of Dollars 15.25bn in two-year notes.
Prices tumbled further after the sale, which was completed at a yield of
4.28 per cent, higher than expected because of unexpectedly poor demand for
the two-year notes.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Finland reopens global offering with
Dollars 1bn, five-year deal
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO large offerings yesterday for the Republic of Finland and the Canadian
Province of Alberta benefited from strong demand for dollar securities.
International investors' appetite for dollar bonds has been sharpened by
relatively controlled supply in the Eurobond market and a rally in the US
Treasury market.
Finland reopened its Dollars 2bn global bond offering launched last
November, adding a further Dollars 1bn of five-year bonds. The issue,
arranged by Nomura, JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch, is due to be priced today
to yield between 63 and 65 basis points more than the five-year Treasury.
The outstanding bonds are trading at a 62 basis point yield spread, having
tightened substantially from an initial launch spread of 82 basis points, as
fears over Finland's credit abated somewhat.
Finland, which is rated Aa2 by Moody's and AA by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US
ratings agencies, has a borrowing programme close to FM60bn (Dollars 11.3bn)
in 1993, which will be split between the international and domestic markets.
However, some traders are sceptical about the domestic market's ability to
absorb large amounts of debt and expect more than half the country's funding
needs to be met in the international market.
Alberta launched a Dollars 500m issue of 10-year bonds, arranged by JP
Morgan, which were priced to yield 47 basis points more than the comparable
US Treasury.
The pricing was set at the tight end of the indicated range, reflecting
strong demand for the paper.
A deal for Empresas ICA, Mexico's largest construction company, also met
enthusiastic demand.
The issue, arranged by Lehman Brothers, was increased to Dollars 225m,
reflecting strong appetite for higher-yielding debt. The bonds were priced
to yield 415 basis points over the five-year US Treasury.
Bayerische Landesanstalt fur Aufbaufinanzierung (LfA), a Munich-based bank
wholly-owned by the Free State of Bavaria, is set to make its debut offering
in the Eurobond market, writes David Waller in Frankfurt. The Dollars 250m
five-year issue, arranged by the Swiss Bank Corporation, is expected to have
a coupon of around 6 per cent.
The LfA, rated triple-A by Moody's in December 1991, is Bavaria's
fifth-largest bank. Its statutory task is to promote trade and industry in
Bavaria, and it also finances Bavarian companies' investments in eastern
Europe. Last year, it raised DM3.2bn (Dollars 2.1bn), primarily in the
German capital markets, but in future it intends to make more use of the
Euromarkets.
The state of Bavaria is fully liable for the LfA's liabilities.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Bank to resume Ecu issuance
programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England plans to sell Ecu500m of three-year notes next month,
resuming its Ecu issuance programme after the turbulence seen in the last
months of 1992.
The announcement is the second recent sign of commitment to the Ecu market.
On Friday, the French Treasury said it would hold an auction of between
Ecu500 and Ecu700m of 10-year government Ecu bonds tomorrow.
The Bank was forced to cancel its October tender of three-year Ecu Treasury
notes last year because of tensions in the European financial markets.
However, tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism have recently
eased. The first tender is scheduled for February 2, when the Bank plans to
sell Ecu500m of notes due January 23, 1996.
The Bank sold Ecu2bn of three-year Ecu notes in 1992.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Equity Issues: Growing foreign, domestic
demand for French equity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE success of last week's sale of shares in Rhone-Poulenc, the French
state-controlled chemicals company, is good news for whoever wins the
country's legislative elections in March, since privatisation is an
increasingly attractive way for both the left and the right to fund the
public debt.
Although the Rhone-Poulenc offer was relatively small and
attractively-priced - 6m shares at FFr500 (Dollars 93) apiece - the healthy
oversubscription of the domestic, international and US tranches indicate
there is demand at home and abroad for French equity. There is a possibility
that a further 405,000 Rhone-Poulenc shares will be made available to
satisfy demand from US and international investors.
Further sales are unlikely before the elections. However, if the opinion
polls are right and a conservative alliance of the RPR and UDF parties
headed by the ex-finance minister Mr Edouard Balladur takes power, investors
can expect a marked acceleration. If the incumbent socialist government
clings to power, investors should still expect further offerings in
state-owned companies, albeit at a slower pace.
A deterioration in the economy and a growing budget deficit have forced the
present government to abandon its 'ni-ni' (neither privatisation nor
nationalisation) policy. The main impact of weak economic growth has been on
fiscal revenue. According to official estimates, there has been a revenue
shortfall of FFr180bn (Dollars 33.9bn) over the past two years and it is set
to worsen. Economists at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew believe the government's budget
deficit forecast of FFr165bn for 1993 is too optimistic. They estimate a
deficit of FFr300bn.
At 4 per cent of GDP, the deficit is small in an international context, but
nevertheless it was an overriding factor in the government's decision to
sell shares in the oil companies, Total and Elf, the local lender Credit
Local, the aluminium and packaging group Pechiney, and most recently,
Rhone-Poulenc.
Mr Balladur has unfinished business on the privatisation front. As finance
minister in the late 1980s, he was only 40 per cent through his FFr300bn
privatisation programme when he was blown off course by the global stock
market crash of October 1987.
Mr Balladur has said he would want to raise around FFr30bn from
privatisations in 1993 and up to FFr60bn next year. But analysts say that to
ensure a warm reception, especially from domestic individual investors, he
would have to increase the incentives for investing in equities.
One way would be to lighten the tax burden on the Plans d'Epargne en
Actions, the French equivalent of personal equity plans, but at the cost of
penalising the more popular money-market Sicavs or investment funds. Plans
to reform the French pension system by setting up private pension funds
would also help.
Observers say any delay in implementing such measures could mean Mr Balladur
would only be able to raise about FFr15bn this year. He would also have to
read correctly the mood of the stock market, something the current
government has been successful at, if he wants to achieve his targets.
Mr Balladur is likely to resume his privatisation programme with the big
insurance companies, UAP and Gan for example. The banks would also be given
priority if the Bundesbank kicks off a round of interest rate cuts across
Europe, which would increase investors' appetite for interest rate-sensitive
stocks.
Elf Aquitaine is also a likely target, and its chairman, Mr Loik Le
Floch-Prigent, has been reported as saying it is no longer necessary for the
state to have 50 per cent in Elf in order to retain control.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Phelps Dodge rises to Dollars
307.9m
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHELPS Dodge the world's second-largest copper producer, posted earnings of
Dollars 307.9m in 1992, or Dollars 4.37 a share before special accounting
charges. This compares with Dollars 272.9m, or Dollars 3.93, for the same
period last year.
Sales for the year rose to Dollars 2.6bn from Dollars 2.4bn in 1991.
The previously-announced sale of a 20 per cent interest in the LaCandelaria
copper project in Chile increased company's 1992 earnings by Dollars 36.4m,
or 52 cents a share.
For the fourth quarter, excluding special charges, earnings were Dollars
67m, or 95 cents, up from Dollars 75.2m, or Dollars 1.08, in the 1991 fourth
quarter. Fourth-quarter sales were Dollars 653.4m, up from Dollars 613.3m in
1991. Strong demand for carbon black helped lift fourth-quarter sales.
The earnings gain came in spite of soft copper prices and a first-quarter
closure of its Tyrone, New Mexico concentrator.
Mr Douglas Yearly, chairman, said low mining costs and an improving
operating environment increased profits.
Net operating cash flow was Dollars 431m for the year.
The company said it had entered into forward pricing agreements for 1993
that provided for a minimum average annual price of 95 cents per pound for
475m pounds of copper cathode, approximately 45 per cent of the company's
anticipated 1993 production.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Doubts on future of equities
study
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHADOW was cast yesterday over the future of Market 2000, the Securities
and Exchange Commission's potentially ground-breaking study of US equities
trading, when Mr William Heyman, the head of market regulation at the SEC
and the man in charge of the study, announced his resignation.
Mr Heyman, who joined the SEC in February 1991, said he would leave the
agency on March 18, primarily because he felt that, with a new Democratic
administration taking over the reins of government in Washington, it was
time to move on.
Mr Heyman was a prominent Republican and fund-raiser for President George
Bush.
The departure of Mr Heyman could cause problems for the Market 2000 study,
which is scheduled for publication in May or June and will include important
recommendations for updating the regulation of equities markets.
Although the SEC says that the bulk of the work on the study has been
finished, the absence of the man responsible for its completion could cause
complications.
Mr Heyman, however, believes that any delay in the release of the study will
not be caused by his departure, but by changes within the SEC, in Congress
and in the government.
He said: 'I would like to have stayed to finish Market 2000, but I concluded
that it would come behind everything else that is done here.'

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Goodyear expects record sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOODYEAR, the Ohio-based tyre manufacturer, expects sales for 1992 in excess
of Dollars 11.7bn, the highest in its 94-year history, when results are
released on February 9. However, special accounting charges and early debt
retirement will leave the company with a reported full-year loss of about
Dollars 660m.
Mr Stanley Gault, chairman, said that Goodyear's net income before the
special accounting charges should be in the Dollars 360m to Dollars 370m
range, and earnings per share should exceed Dollars 5. Comparable 1991
figures were Dollars 74m, or Dollars 1.24.
However, his projections for 1992 included an undisclosed fourth-quarter
gain on the sale of polyester operations, an undisclosed loss on the pending
sale of the company's rubber roofing business, and an after-tax charge of
Dollars 38m for staff reductions.
The company said it had reduced debt to Dollars 1.9bn at the end of 1992,
from Dollars 3.7bn in mid-1991, as a result of improved cash-flow, the sale
of assets, and a 1991 stock sale.
Mr Gault gave a cautiously optimistic outlook for 1993, saying the US tyre
replacement market was expected to advance beyond 1992's record 197m units,
and that Goodyear should continue to outperform the industry.
'With these growth expectations for US operations and encouraging plans for
solid progress from other regions, Goodyear associates are looking toward a
third consecutive year of growth,' he said.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Top cards at American Express
fail to deal a winner - Alan Friedman finds investors unimpressed by the
enhanced role for the US company's chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE most eloquent judgment concerning the surprise announcement that Mr
James Robinson had survived as chairman of American Express and succeeded in
having his protege installed as chief executive came from Wall Street.
On Monday, with investors widely expecting Mr Robinson to leave the troubled
financial services and travel group, the company's share price continued to
rise sharply.
It was widely known in the New York financial world that the American
Express board was divided by internecine politics as Mr Robinson fought to
save himself and have Mr Harvey Golub, the president, named as chief
executive.
It was also learned yesterday that Sir Colin Marshall, chief executive of
British Airways, was contacted by the search committee about the job, having
previously been canvassed about a move to another position at American
Express more than 18 months ago.
Then, late on Monday it was announced that Mr Golub would take over as chief
executive and that Mr Robinson would not only stay on as chairman but would
also take over as chairman and chief executive of the lossmaking Shearson
Lehman investment banking and brokerage unit.
The American Express share price promptly went into a free-fall, and by the
close in New York yesterday had dropped by Dollars 1 3/4 , a decline of
nearly 7 per cent, wiping more than Dollars 800m off the company's market
capitalisation. Trading volume stood at 6.3m shares, more than three times
the average level.
The consensus view among analysts is that the 57-year-old Mr Robinson, who
is blamed by many for presiding over a sloppy management and substantial
credit losses at the group's card division, should have left the company.
But a handful of the normally-available Wall Street analysts who follow
American Express agreed to comment only if they were not named. 'This is a
travesty. The entire market was hoping that Mr Robinson would go. That is
what we were led to believe in December,' said one analyst at a leading New
York securities firm.
'The market has not been pleased with Mr Robinson's stewardship of the
company and had been hoping he would go. His job now is to make Shearson run
again and focus on costs,' said Mr Guy Moszkowski, a leading analyst at
Sanford Bernstein, a research company.
The group's 1992 net earnings, which fell by 44.7 per cent to Dollars 436m,
in part because of a Dollars 116m loss from Shearson Lehman, illustrated the
financial problems at American Express.
The core Travel Related Services (TRS) division, for example, saw its 1992
net profit tumble to Dollars 243m from Dollars 396m in 1991. Admittedly, the
decline was affected by special charges. But the depth of problems at TRS
and the need to cut staff and make provisions is more apparent when one
considers that TRS made a profit of Dollars 956m in 1990, meaning its most
recent earnings have collapsed by 75.6 per cent in two years.
Analysts like Mr Moszkowski say it could take until 1996 before TRS returns
to its 1990 level of profitability.
Analysts say investors had felt an enormous sense of relief about American
Express ever since it emerged in early December that Mr Robinson had been
asked by the American Express board to search for a successor as chief
executive.
Although Mr Robinson denied he was being forced out, executives at American
Express say he fought 'a battle royal' to hang on to both his job as
chairman and his prestige. 'What he did was to take care of himself,' said
an American Express executive.
Mr Golub, who was named by Mr Robinson as president only 18 months ago, is
respected for his technical skills, but is not considered a man of great
vision.
The big loser in the American Express shake-up is Mr Howard Clark, the
former group finance director who was installed as chairman and chief
executive of Shearson two years ago. Mr Robinson yesterday took both of
those jobs, banishing Mr Clark to the ill-defined role of vice-chairman of
Shearson.
Mr Robinson declined to be interviewed yesterday, but in his official
statement on Monday he said his primary mission would now be to work at
Shearson Lehman. He even hinted at possibly making a public offer of
Shearson stock. No one, meanwhile, is willing to predict how long he will
stay on as chairman of American Express. The company and its investors are
still reeling from Monday's shake-up.

NEC, the Japanese electronics group, has withdrawn from the manufacture of
VCRs in a move that highlights the harsh trading environment faced by
Japanese consumer electronics manufacturers.
The decision by NEC Home Electronics, NEC's wholly-owned subsidiary, to
retreat from VCR production comes as the demand in Japan for audio-visual
products has been particularly sluggish.
NEC will continue to supply VCRs manufactured by Sanyo on an original
equipment basis.
However, it will not distribute to mass sales discount stores where price
erosion can occur. Instead, it will restrict distribution to its 6,000
affiliated retailers in Japan.
The drop in the domestic market for VCRs is a growing problem for Japanese
consumer electronics manufacturers which are faced with a penetration rate
in Japan and the US of more than 80 per cent. VCR shipments in Japan have
fallen from a peak of 7.15m to an estimated 4.3m last year and are expected
to decline to 7.2m in 1993.
