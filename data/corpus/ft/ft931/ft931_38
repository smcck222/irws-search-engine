FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Gardiner sells Spanish offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gardiner Group, the distributor of security and surveillance equipment, is
selling its loss-making Spanish subsidiary to its management for a nominal
sum.
The company also announced that the investigation into mis-statement of
stock, announced last November, was not yet complete but the preliminary
review had found that there had been improvements in the present financial
controls which were now 'generally satisfactory'.
The sale of Alarm Parts, which distributes security and surveillance
equipment, should result in an extraordinary charge of Pounds 2m at the year
end, of which Pounds 300,000 relates to goodwill previously written off
against reserves.
Alarm reported trading losses of about Pounds 610,000 in the year to the end
of October last. Net liabilities at that date were Pounds 400,000. As part
of the sale an intercompany loan of Pounds 2.1m has been written off.

Mr Samuel Heath, chairman, reminded shareholders that business collapsed in

the period rose from Pounds 72,000 to Pounds 95,000. Earnings per share came

<TEXT>
Net asset value of the Hong Kong Investment Trust doubled to 44.41p per
ordinary share at the half year to December 31 from 22.4p a year earlier,
making HKI the top performing ordinary share in the investment trust sector
in terms of net asset value.
At the June year end the asset value was 36.1p. The board said that the
increase in total assets reflected investment manager's outperformance of
the Hang Seng Index as well as sterling's devaluation.
Dividend and interest income rose from Pounds 95,254 to Pounds 298,582 and
net revenue after tax came to Pounds 179,406 (Pounds 31,925 losses) in the
period. Earnings per share were 0.9p (0.16p losses).
An interim dividend of 0.75p has been declared which, the board said is not
comparable to the previous year as the scheme of reorganisation changed the
revenue profile of the company and no interim dividend was paid.

PRINCEDALE Group, the USM-quoted marketing and design agency, stayed in the
black in the second half to record its first annual profit since 1988.
In the year ended September 30 1992 the group turned in a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 389,000, against a loss of Pounds 431,000. Mr Stephen Bennett,
chairman, described that as encouraging particularly as the market place was
difficult.
All three remaining operating units made a positive contribution. Turnover
fell from Pounds 15.3m to Pounds 12.8m because of the sale of companies.
There were exceptional charges of Pounds 163,000 (Pounds 116,000) and a
significantly reduced net interest payable of Pounds 68,000 (Pounds
192,000).
Earnings per share were 0.08p (losses 0.11p).

FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Sanderson Murray Pounds 1.5m buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SANDERSON Murray &amp; Elder, the north-of-England motor distributor, is to buy
a Pounds 1.47m site in Manchester to house its two Ford dealerships in the
city, and sell its small Lancaster Rover dealership.
SME said yesterday the sale of the Lancaster dealership, was 'in line with
SME's strategy of concentrating on building a group of larger volume
dealerships'.
It was bought as part of the package of three dealerships acquired from Avis
in 1990, when entrepreneur Tony Bramall returned to the motor trade and took
SME out of textiles.
SME said in September that its Manchester dealerships, bought for Pounds 2m
in 1991, had not performed well in the six months to June 30, contributing
to a fall in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 765,000 to Pounds 633,000,
in spite of higher turnover of Pounds 51.1m (Pounds 27.5m).
Ms Del Barratt, of house brokers Albert E Sharp, said the Manchester sites
were poorly located and equipped, and the move would enable SME to reduce
overheads and improve the truck and car dealerships' performance. She
forecast 1992 profits of Pounds 1.35m (Pounds 1.55m), rising to Pounds 1.75m
this year.
SME said the deal was conditional on the group achieving the Pounds 900,000
sale of its Rover dealership to Coltread.

FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Lionheart buys Devon woodworking business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIONHEART, the Knutsford-based home improvements, DIY, paint brushes, house
wares and retail systems group, has bought The Carpenter's Workshop, a
woodworking business in Barnstaple, Devon, from the receiver.
It wants the extra capacity to make a range of home and bathroom products
that look and feel like rain-forest hardwoods - and weigh as much - but are
made from polystyrene waste, notably discarded beakers from McDonald's, the
hamburger chain.
Lionheart hopes to have them on sale in retail DIY sheds in the autumn, when
their environmental friendliness will be a principal selling point.
Unlike some wood substitutes, the new material can be extruded through dies
into complicated profiles.
Compressing the waste during processing increases its density and weight.
Mr Paul Lever, executive chairman of Lionheart, said yesterday the
development would cost about Pounds 300,000.
He added: 'Last year was awful. Not only did sales volume fall throughout
our industry, but we were squeezed by the price war between the DIY sheds.
Manufacturers and suppliers were caught in the middle.'
Lionheart was urged to rescue The Carpenter's Workshop by Homebase and Marks
and Spencer, two of the protagonists in the retail war. The price is
believed to have been about Pounds 250,000.
Mr Lever also revealed that Newell, the US company which is the biggest
paint brush maker in the world, has increased its holding in Lionheart from
13 to 20 per cent. The next largest shareholder is Equitable Life, with
nearly 7 per cent; about a fifth of the shares are in private hands.

FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Excalibur shares fall as first half loss
revealed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXCALIBUR shares tumbled 19 per cent to 8 1/2 p as the jewellery and
engineering company revealed interim losses at the midway stage and halved
the interim dividend to 0.2p.
The pre-tax loss for the six months to October 31 was Pounds 183,000,
against a profit of Pounds 905,000 last time. Sales fell 8 per cent to
Pounds 30.3m.
Analysts, surprised by the extent of the reversal at the operating level
from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 654,000, reduced forecasts for the full year from
less than Pounds 2m pre-tax to break-even.
Mr Michael Griffiths, chairman, said he had been disappointed by the effect
of a decline in jewellery on the other businesses. 'With the exception of
jewellery . . . our businesses were within Pounds 8,000 of budget,' he said.
The jewellery division, operating in a market which Excalibur estimates has
declined by 60 per cent in two years, suffered operating losses of more than
Pounds 1m, against a small profit last year. Margins had fallen by about 50
per cent in the face of price-cutting and stock-dumping by competitors.
Action had been taken to stem losses, and about 37 per cent of the
100-strong workforce had been made redundant, Mr Griffiths said. However,
the division was unlikely to return to profit in the full year. Mr Griffiths
said retailers were likely to remain cautious, even when economic recovery
began.
The giftware operation was also adversely affected by the downturn in
consumer spending. Profits were significantly down on the previous year.
The engineering division offered a slightly better return with a small
increase in operating profits from aerospace. Industrial products
experienced mixed fortunes, with the off-road vehicle business continuing to
incur losses.
Mr Griffiths said engineering order books were about the same, if not
slightly better. Yet margins continued to be under pressure.
Interest charges were 23 per cent lower at Pounds 837,000. However, gearing
at 83 per cent was higher than last year's 69 per cent following the Pounds
600,000 purchase of a small business to add to the industrial product
division.
Mr Griffiths said the group had generated some Pounds 2m more than expected
from cash flow. This contributed to capital expenditure of Pounds 1m in the
first half.
Losses per share were 0.6p, compared with earnings of 0.8p last year.
COMMENT
With any other company investors might well be preparing for the worst.
However, Excalibur appears to have secured its future with the recent debt
restructuring to provide long-term finance. Add to that the purchase of
shares by all directors over the course of the past year, and Excalibur
might not be so easy to write off. The betting appears to be on something
significant to release value in what is seen to be a respected engineering
company: perhaps the sale of the giftware division. This would allow
swingeing rationalisation of the jewellery operation and improve the debt
position. When this happens, it might be worth taking a closer look at
Excalibur. The value seems to be there, but it might be a bit too early to
bet on it.

FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Thames in TV and film joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAMES TELEVISION is joining forces with International Artistes to
co-produce a wide range of television and film projects for the world
markets.
Thames is investing a 'substantial' but undisclosed sum in the deal, which
is an indication of the way television in the UK is moving closer to the US
model.
'Television production is a mixture of talent and business. This partnership
of the combined reputations of Thames and International Artistes will be a
major creative force in an expanding broadcast industry,' Mr Richard Dunn,
chief executive of Thames said yester-day.
Now that Thames is no longer an ITV broadcaster it is free to do business
with ITV, Sky, Channel 4, the BBC and others in a way that could not have
happened before.
The new partnership has already begun pre-production work on seven projects
in the entertainment area including a controversial drama on the mystery
surrounding the death of the 'King' of Rock'n Roll, Elvis Presley.
The partnership's early comedy output will feature comedians Ronnie Corbett
and Max Boyce.
Ronnie Corbett will play the press secretary of one of the younger members
of the Royal Family in an, as yet untitled, situation comedy.
Feature films are also planned including the movie debut of Hale &amp; Pace.
Recently Mr Dunn forecast that despite losing its ITV franchise Thames
should have a turnover this year of Pounds 100m for its continuing
businesses, particularly independent programme production.
Meanwhile Thames says it is still talking with a wide range of potential
investors in its Channel 5 consortium despite its application being rejected
last month by the Indepen-dent Television Commission. The plan is to present
the ITC with a properly-funded project as quickly as possi-ble.
As well as companies such as Time Warner it is believed that CanWest, the
Canadian international broadcaster which pulled out of the project last
year, has shown renewed interest.
Seeking a judicial review of the ITC's decision has not yet been formally
ruled out.

The trust had investments in 157 companies operating in 13 markets at the
end of October. It hopes to launch a savings scheme for small investors this
year.
In accordance with policy, the trust is not paying an interim dividend. The
shares fell 1p to 222p yesterday.

FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Ashcroft steps down as managing director of
Survival Aids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN ASHCROFT, the former Coloroll chairman, is stepping down as managing
director of Survival Aids, the outdoor clothing company, which was his first
acquisition following Coloroll's collapse with debts of about Pounds 350m.
Mr Hugh Lapham, former operations director for B&amp;Q, replaces him next
Monday. He has already begun work at the Cumbria-based business on a
consultancy basis.
Confirming the management change yesterday Mr Ashcroft, who remains
chairman, said it was always his intention to appoint a full-time managing
director in 1993, after spending two years in the driving seat.
He said the business, the retail branch network of which he has extended
from three shops to 14, covering Glasgow to Bristol, now needed somebody
with good retail expertise to take it forward. The departure of Mr Colin
Corlett, the finance director, was also a factor in the decision to bring in
a full-time managing director.
Late last year, some suppliers to Survival Aids were complaining about late
payment. Yesterday, Mr Ashcroft said he had not been happy with Survival
Aids' payment situation and was nervous about trading prospects for this
year.
He disclosed that he and two other key shareholders, who together have a 72
per cent stake, had made a further investment, bringing the total to Pounds
1m.
'I suggested we strengthen the management team and put in more money,' said
Mr Ashcroft. 'I felt the business would benefit from having a stronger
balance sheet and a better cash position.'
Since acquiring Survival Aids, Mr Ashcroft has bought two other companies,
which he declined to name.

FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Waterglade cuts debt to Bank of America
with asset sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATERGLADE International Holdings has agreed a financial restructuring that
involves Bank of America, its largest bank, taking control of the property
company's biggest asset.
In return for Waterglade's shopping complex in Havant, Hampshire, which has
a book value of Pounds 16.2m, Bank of America has extinguished all but
Pounds 1.7m of debt. This balance will be paid over a two-year period.
Mr David Cunningham, chairman, said the deal was crucial to the rescue. The
company 'was heading for the iceberg and now there is a good chance it can
be stabilised,' he said.
As a result of the deal, the group's debt falls from Pounds 41.49m to Pounds
25.3m.
Net assets at the last balance sheet date were Pounds 3.3m and the group
yesterday reported an attributable loss of Pounds 765,000 in the six months
to September 30.
Mr Cunningham said the full market value was not wholly reflected in the
books as all the properties had been moved into current assets and were held
at cost.
Waterglade will now embark upon a capital reorganisation.
The chairman said debts with some other banks are still to be tidied up. The
company would then provide a platform for the building of stakes in other
property companies that are in difficulty.
Waterglade's remaining assets include property in London and Wales with a
book value of Pounds 27m and rent role currently at Pounds 1.9m.
The interim pre-tax deficit was Pounds 954,000, compared with Pounds 3.33m
in 1991, and the loss per share worked through at 5.9p (12.6p).

FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Institutions' confidence rises - Surveys
show that equities expected to remain stable or rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSTITUTIONAL investors are expressing overwhelming confidence in the stock
market, according to two surveys published yesterday.
Godwins, the actuarial consulting company, in its monthly survey of
investment attitudes, has found that 98 per cent of investment managers
surveyed expected UK equities to either remain stable or rise during the
next 12 months.
Minet Consultancy, the independent financial advisers, found that its own
Investor Confidence index at the end of December 1992 was the highest since
the index was first compiled in December 1987.
The index had surged 60 per cent to a peak of 152.5 from the previous figure
of 95.1 at the end of September.
The Minet index is compiled from an analysis of the liquidity positions of
12 large life insurance and pension fund managers.
The average cash holding of the firms surveyed fell to 2.96 per cent at the
end of December, compared with 4.74 per cent three months earlier. The range
of cash holdings, not including those who normally hold very little cash,
ranged from 0.9 per cent at Abbey Life to Legal &amp; General's 5.8 per cent.
Mr Ian Chalmers of Minet, who compiles the index, said that while
institutions had been responsible for driving up the market, their present
low liquidity levels meant that future gains in stock prices were likely to
have to come from private investors.
One source of fresh funds into the stock market could be the equity
investment products with capital protection features now being marketed
aggressively by building societies to their own depositors, Mr Chalmers
said.
The Godwins 'Cityscope' survey found that overall, institutions were far
more optimistic about the economy's prospects over the next 12 months than
they were even a month ago.
Two-thirds of those surveyed said they expected conditions to improve, up
from 44 per cent in December, while 85 per cent said they expected the
prospects for corporate earnings to improve over the next year, up from 71
per cent.
In foreign markets, UK institutions were showing less confidence in the US
stock markets, with 74 per cent of those surveyed expecting a rise from
present levels. In December the figure had been 85 per cent. But Europe was
looking more attractive with 82 per cent of those surveyed expecting
equities prices to rise, compared with 70 per cent.

FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Principality improves to Pounds 17m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of building societies maintaining profitability despite the
depressed housing market was reinforced yesterday as the Principality
Building Society announced a 13 per cent rise in annual pre-tax profits from
Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 17m.
The Principality, the 24th largest society by asset size, is the first to
announce profits for the year ending December 31 1992. Its pre-tax outcome
was helped by bad debt provisions being held at Pounds 1.6m, against Pounds
1.5m in 1991.
Mr John Mitchell, chief executive, said the low bad debt charge on a
mortgage book of Pounds 890.6m (Pounds 823.1m) reflected the fact that the
society assessed lending risk centrally rather than through its 49 branches.
Mr Mitchell said the result was due to prudent management. It did not simply
have a better bad debt record because it carries out little lending in the
depressed housing market of south-east England.
Peter Alan, the society's estate agent subsidiary, recorded a profit for the
second year running. The number of the society's borrowers in arrears fell
by 14 per cent, while repossessed properties fell by 15 per cent.
The society's profit after tax as a percentage of total assets rose slightly
to 1.07 per cent (1.06 per cent). Mr Mitchell said it had maintained a level
of profitability over five years unmatched by any of the top 20 societies.
Mr John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew,
said the society's 'excellent' results were an indicator of the resilience
in society profits that was likely to be seen in the coming reporting
season.
The society's total assets rose to Pounds 1.12bn (Pounds 1.03bn), while its
ratio of gross capital to assets strengthened to 7.35 per cent from 6.69 per
cent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The way is open for Kelt Energy, the USM-dealt oil and gas group controlled
by French entrepreneur Mr Hubert Perrodo, to pay dividends as a capital
restructuring, agreed in October, came into effect.
As a result of resolutions passed at an extraordinary meeting in October,
the deficit on the profit and loss is reduced by Pounds 63m and
'substantially eliminated', Kelt said. Reserves were also cut by Pounds

FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Minorco's stance may hinder JCI plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS BY Johannesburg Consolidated Investment, the South African mining
company, to buy a 29.9 per cent stake in Johnson Matthey, the precious
metals group, may not go unchallenged.
Charter Consolidated, the UK industrial conglomerate, owns a 38.4 per cent
stake worth about Pounds 350m in Johnson Matthey. It has been discussing
selling to JCI a 29.9 per cent stake to avoid triggering a full bid for JM,
and would have sold the rest of its shares in the market.
However, Minorco, the European-based investment arm of Anglo-American which
holds a 36 per cent stake in Charter, yesterday pointed out that any such
transaction would require the approval of Charter shareholders.
Minorco said it had supported Charter's plans to seek ways of realising its
investment in JM, but would examine any proposals put to it by Charter to
ensure that any disposal was in the best interests of all shareholders.
Analysts took that as suggesting that Minorco would want Charter to obtain
the best price for its JM stake, regardless of whether the sale led to a
takeover bid. JCI would be acceptable to JM because it is thought to have no
intention of bidding for the entire company.
If the sale of the JM shares does go ahead, Charter could use the proceeds
to repurchase Minorco's stake in the company. Charter would have preferred
to announce both deals simultaneously, but accepts that the leaking of the
disposal story means that it is only likely to be able to proceed in stages.
JM's shares rose last week on speculation that Charter had been approached
by a company wanting to buy its entire interest. Yesterday they closed 8p
higher at 506p, while Charter shed 6p to 692p.

FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Stakis dismisses Robertson reports
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STAKIS, the Glasgow-based hotels, casinos and nursing homes group which
announces its results for 1992 on Thursday, yesterday dismissed weekend
reports that Sir Lewis Robertson, chairman, was to announce his retirement.
'It has not been considered by the board,' the company said, calling the
reports speculation.
Sir Lewis came in as chairman of Stakis in 1991 when the company faced a
financial and management crisis. It is expected to announce that it has
moved a pre tax loss last year of Pounds 47m to around break even.
It is also expected to announce a one-for-three rights issue and the sale of
its nursing homes subsidiary, Ashbourne Homes.

FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: St Andrew shows 10.3% rise in net asset
value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ST ANDREW Trust, which is the subject of a bid from Ecclesiastical Insurance
Office, reported a 10.3 per cent rise in net asset value, from 226.1p to
249.5p, in 1992.
It also announced a second interim dividend of 4.85p per share in lieu of a
final. This maintains the total at 7.55p from earnings of 7.42p (7.12p).
The EIO offer is a technical one designed to meet EC regulations.
Acceptances passed the 50 per cent mark last week but EIO does not want more
than 75 per cent because that would jeopardise St Andrew's investment trust
status; those who accept will receive the higher of 237p or 93 per cent of
St Andrew's formula asset value.
About 65 per cent of the portfolio is in the UK; the remainder is split
between the US (14 per cent), the Pacific Basin (12 per cent) and
continental Europe (8 per cent).
Mr David Ross Stewart, chairman, said 'although it is still too early to
assume a rapid acceleration towards global economic recovery, there are some
encouraging signs.'

FT  26 JAN 93 / Golub takes over from Robinson at American Express
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR HARVEY Golub, president of American Express, the large US travel and
financial services group, was yesterday named by the board of directors as
the new chief executive, replacing Mr James Robinson, the group's embattled
chairman and chief executive.
The 53-year-old Mr Golub, a low-key manager who is respected mainly for his
technical skills, was Mr Robinson's hand-picked heir.
Mr Robinson, however, managed unexpectedly to retain his position as
chairman of American Express and - in a surprising development - was also
named chairman and chief executive of Shearson Lehman Brothers, the
investment banking and brokerage subsidiary. In doing so the 57-year-old Mr
Robinson replaced Mr Howard Clark, Jr, the previous chairman and chief
executive he had installed at Shearson at the height of its losses two years
ago and who was instead named vice chairman of Shearson.
Shortly after the management upheaval was announced last night, American
Express also disclosed that its fourth-quarter 1992 net profits before
accounting charges had crashed by 65.4 per cent to Dollars 82m,
incorporating a net loss of Dollars 166m from Shearson in the quarter.
American Express also unveiled that its full-year 1992 net profit before
accounting charges had slumped to Dollars 436m from Dollars 789m in 1991,
with Shearson suffering a Dollars 116m loss for the whole of 1992.
Mr Golub, who said yesterday that 'Jim and I will continue to work together
as a team', has been Mr Robinson's chosen candidate since the American
Express board last autumn asked him to form a search committee to seek his
own successor.
Mr Robinson last month denied that he was being forced out of the chief
executive's job because of losses at the company's credit card business,
reduced profits and pressure on the stock price.
Analysts said they were struck yesterday by Mr Robinson's ability to survive
at American Express, both as chairman and in his new job running a
subsidiary that previously reported to him.
Mr Robinson said yesterday his prime mission was to work at Shearson Lehman;
he did not rule out the sale of Shearson stock in a public offer.

FT  26 JAN 93 / VW may be last to run from the Japanese bear: Christopher
Parkes analyses change at Europe's leading carmaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen's withdrawal last week from Swatch-Mobil, a development project
for a high-fashion fun car, illustrates two topical points about Europe's
leading motor manufacturer: this is no time for either extravagance or
frivolity.
The fact that VW, which is to invest an average DM9bn (Pounds 3.7bn)
annually for the next five years in its vehicles operations, baulked at
paying a mere DM50m a year to continue work on a promising micro-car in
collaboration with the Swiss watch industry, showed how closely costs are
being scrutinised.
It provided few clues, however, to VW's responses to the bigger questions
being asked: how the group will reverse increasing operating losses in the
core Volkswagen division (DM1bn last year), reinstate itself in the US
market where it has less than 1 per cent of market share, correct its German
plants' relative cost disadvantages estimated at Dollars 1,000 (Pounds 660)
a car vis-a-vis the Japanese, compete effectively while the D-Mark is stuck
at unhelpful exchange rates, deal with the domestic demand slump, and at the
same time face up to the Japanese threat.
All German motor makers face similar long and short-term issues, but VW is
the only one not yet to present something resembling a coherent response.
The new chairman, Mr Ferdinand Piech, was widely expected to correct this
after the extended Christmas holiday.
However, little has emerged apart from shuffling and fudge. A supervisory
board meeting resulted in modest cuts and unclear postponements in the
group's medium-term investment plan. The personnel director, responsible for
this year's 5 per cent pay award (compared with less than 4 per cent in
other sectors) was moved sideways.
Mr Piech's admirers had looked forward to the announcement of a grand design
comprising sweeping job cuts - in the cumbersome management hierarchy, on
the board as well as the shop floor - and plans, at least in outline, for an
overhaul of manufacturing methods.
By most estimates, VW's German manufacturing operations are carrying 50,000
surplus workers. Its flagship Wolfsburg works is regarded as a white
elephant and a quality-control disaster zone. Annual sales per employee of
DM286,000 in 1991 compared poorly with DM476,000 at Adam Opel, the General
Motors' subsidiary, and Ford-Werke's DM466,000.
Mr Piech is acting more slowly than was anticipated of a man who came from
Audi proclaiming: 'How can I be patient while Japanese manufacturers' costs
are 30 per cent better than those in Germany?' A little patience is
necessary, however, while VW's new chief comes to terms with Mr Franz
Steinkuhler, head of the powerful IG Metall metalworkers' union.
Not only does VW management have to negotiate pay and conditions deals with
Mr Steinkuhler's team, it also has to live with him as a senior member of
the supervisory board. In a boardroom alliance with representatives of the
Lower Saxony government - a Social Democrat/Green coalition that controls 20
per cent of VW shares - the union boss represents a formidable opponent to
radical change, especially job losses.
According to Mr Louis R Hughes, former head of Opel, General Motors' German
subsidiary, the German industry workforce should be cut by half - 450,000 -
during the next few years. Even the most modest estimates say 200,000
workers must go to retain competitiveness.
The main reason for change is the build-up of low-cost Japanese capacity in
European transplant works, which are expected to be capable of producing up
to 2m cars a year by the end of the century (compared with 5.3m from German
manufacturers). About 750,000 will be aimed at the market segments where
Germany is most strongly represented.
There is a further, potent force at work: recession, which has paradoxically
presented indigenous manufacturers with an opportunity. It gives management
a chance to hasten changes in political and popular attitudes. That is
essential if structural adjustments are to happen with the minimum
disruption.
Job cut plans, announced by almost all German vehicle makers a year ago,
have been accelerated. Short-time working is in operation in most plants,
and VW and Opel have sought to drive home the none-too-subtle message to the
workforce with extraordinarily grim forecasts of falls in German and
European demand for cars this year of up to 20 per cent and 10 per cent
respectively.
These measures will have compounded the shock effects of recent investment
decisions - BMW to open its first foreign plant in the US, Mercedes'
cancellation of a DM1bn truck plant in eastern Germany and Audi's choice of
Hungary instead of eastern Germany for an engine parts works.
In that climate, negotiations to postpone a further one-hour cut in western
engineers' working week and to water down a deal to give their eastern
colleagues full-pay parity by next year have more than a fair chance of
success.
If the employers win, it could signal the start of the adjustment in
attitudes demanded by Mr David Herman, fresh from Saab as successor to Mr
Hughes. Shocked by 10 per cent absenteeism at Opel, where 3,500 production
workers fail to turn up every day, he said it was time to start thinking and
acting in global terms. 'In terms of productivity, labour costs, working
hours and absenteeism, the German economy has fallen steadily behind its
most important competitors for the past six years,' he added.
Opel, like Ford-Werke, has drawn heavily on its parent's experiences with
the Japanese back home in adjusting its German cost base and manufacturing
methods. As part of its reward, and part of the price VW has paid for its
lack of attention to domestic matters, it has won market leadership in
eastern Germany. Not so long ago, Germans used to enjoy their jokes about
the Opel. It was a car for proles: 'Jeder Popel braucht sein Opel.'
Mr Hughes made his own joke about the German car industry as he prepared to
leave Opel last summer. It concerned two hunters confronted by an angry
bear. One quickly pulled on his running shoes. The other laughed: 'That's no
use, the bear can easily outrun a man.' 'That's not the point,' his pal
replied. 'The main thing is that I can outrun you.' German motor industry
executives still like to tell it, even though few find it funny any more.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Sir Peter Parker resigns from Horace Clarkson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR PETER PARKER, the former chairman of British Rail, has resigned as
deputy chairman of Horace Clarkson, the shipping and insurance group,
following a dispute at Holman Wade, one of the group's Lloyd's insurance
broking subsidiaries which specialises in selling stop-loss policies to
Lloyd's Names.
Clarkson shares fell by 10p to 68p on the news, which ends an association
between Sir Peter and Clarkson of more than 20 years. Sir Peter had
supported a bid by Mr Michael Wade, chairman of Holman Wade, to head a
management buy-out of the broker, which he had originally sold to Clarkson
in 1980.
After the proposed MBO was rejected, the Clarkson board insisted on radical
cuts in costs, which neither Mr Wade nor Sir Peter were prepared to accept.
According to Mr Michael Beckett, a chairman-designate at Clarkson: 'The
offer Michael Wade and other made to us was not acceptable and both felt
they were better off elsewhere.
'It is our duty to shareholders not to give away assets. Holman Wade is a
business badly affected by the turndown at Lloyd's, though there has not
been a haemorrhage,' said Mr Beckett.
Describing the dispute as 'a disagreement in principle', Sir Peter said last
night that he believed the board's decision would lead to a 'reduction in
service to members of Lloyd's' He had supported the MBO wholeheartedly.
Holman Wade has been a leader in broking so-called 'stop-loss' insurance
policies and 'estate protection plans' (EPP) at the Lloyd's of London
insurance market.
Stop-loss policies cover are a form of reinsurance for Lloyd's Names - the
individuals whose assets support underwriting at Lloyd's - covering a
tranche of losses above an agreed level.
Estate protection plans insure the estates of Lloyd's Names, assuming
liabilities after the deaths of Names.
As Lloyd's losses climbed, amounting to at least Pounds 4bn between 1988 and
1990, claims on stop-loss and EPP plans have soared. This has lead to a
shrinkage in the stop-loss market, making it more difficult for Holman Wade
to buy policies for Names.
Mr Beckett said that Clarkson no longer intends to sell Holman Wade and that
Mr Pat Barr, a director of Clarkson, has been appointed chairman.

FT  26 JAN 93 / NFC to sell waste management arm for over Pounds 100m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NFC, the transport and logistics company, is about to sell its waste
management division to Wessex Waste Management, the joint venture between
Waste Management of the US and Wessex Water.
The sale is expected to be finalised later this week. None of the parties
would comment on the transaction, but it is understood the sale price is
slightly more than Pounds 100m.
NFC's shares gained 10p to 271p, prompted by a circular from NatWest
Securities saying the sale was 'imminent'. Mr Robert Miller-Bakewell, the
circular's author, said the purchase was at a 'full price' but below NFC's
original target of Pounds 160m.
The deal would make Wessex Waste Management one of the UK's top five waste
specialists, behind companies such as Cleanaway and Biffa. WWM has recently
considered several potential acquisitions and wants to lift annual turnover
to improve margins.
WWM, which trades under the name UK Waste, was set up in 1991. Following the
acquisition of Wimpey's waste division, it has raised annual turnover to
about Pounds 45m. If the NFC deal is approved, the enlarged group's turnover
would approach Pounds 80m, compared with Pounds 90m at Biffa, which is owned
by water company Severn Trent.
NFC's waste division, which is highly regarded, was started in 1962. It is
one of the top 10 companies in the UK and especially strong in the north
west. In the year ending September 1991, the division made operating profits
of Pounds 3.72m on turnover of Pounds 29.8m.
Following a review of strategy two years ago, NFC has regularly said the
division is not core to its main businesses of transport, logistics and home
services. Another non-core business, Pickfords Travel, was sold last year to
Airtours for Pounds 16m.
NFC is also keen to expand its logistics business and last year spent Pounds
75m on acquisitions in the US and Europe. This pushed year-end gearing to 55
per cent, which some analysts said was high and could hold back growth.
According to one observer, NFC is selling because waste management is
becoming dominated by large specialists who can afford heavy capital
expenditure. 'Waste is long term and capital hungry so there are better
places for NFC's money,' he said.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Eagle Star and BBL unite against surveyors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EAGLE STAR, the insurance subsidiary of BAT Industries, and Banque Bruxelles
Lambert (BBL), the Belgian Bank, are to take legal action against two firms
of chartered surveyors after yesterday reaching agreement in a long-running
legal dispute over mortgage indemnity insurance.
Eagle Star will pay a maximum of Pounds 87.5m to settle the dispute with
BBL, which lodged an insurance claim on policies covering commercial
property loans after borrowers, including Land &amp; Property Trust, defaulted
during 1990.
BBL said total loans of some Pounds 308m had been extended to three separate
property developers affecting six properties. The bank said its exposure via
banking syndicates amounted to 46 per cent of this amount (or about Pounds
142m). The total value of losses on the loans including rolled-up interest
is understood to be about Pounds 220m.
The value of the settlement will depend on the outcome of separate legal
action which the insurer and bank will take against chartered surveyors
Lewis &amp; Tucker and John D Wood Commercial, alleging that valuations provided
for the six properties were negligent.
BBL will receive Pounds 70m now plus the first Pounds 35m of any cash
recovered from the valuers in the joint action. Proceeds from other monies
recovered will be shared between the two companies. Mr Michael Heath,
executive director, said Eagle Star 'was gratified' by the settlement which
reduces uncertainty about company's exposure to property-related insurances.

FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas to axe jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MCDONNELL Douglas, the US aerospace and defence group headed by chairman Mr
John McDonnell, has announced plans to cut 4,000 jobs from its workforce
because of slowing demand for commercial jet aircraft.
The job cuts, which will be achieved through attrition and lay-offs, will
all come at Douglas Aircraft, the group's commercial aircraft manufacturing
unit based in Long Beach, California.
Mr John Thom, a spokesman for McDonnell Douglas, explained: 'We'll be
building fewer aircraft, so we'll need fewer people.' The cuts will leave
the commercial aircraft division with a total workforce of about 15,000
people.
The measures are being taken because of depressed orders from the airline
industry. The drop in demand has forced the company this year to reduce
planned production of its MD-80 aircraft by about half and production of its
MD-11 jet by almost a third.
The job and production cuts will not affect McDonnell Douglas's military
aircraft division, which was split from the commercial aircraft business in
a restructuring last year.
The announcement of the latest job cuts came the day after McDonnell Douglas
reported a sharp drop in 1992 profits.
However, the company, was upbeat last week about the long-term outlook for
earnings, predicting that the C-17 military transport aircraft would become
profitable this year, that its wide-body MD-11 jetliner would generate a
positive cash-flow, that margins on core businesses would rise, and that the
group's debt would be cut by Dollars 1bn in 1993 through asset sales and use
of existing cash reserves.

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NERVOUSNESS over the future of Royal Trust, Canada's second biggest trust
company, has ignited another crisis of confidence in the business empire
controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family.
Share prices of companies in the Bronfman orbit, especially those related to
Royal Trust, have tumbled to their lowest levels in at least a year,
following RT's announcement that it was seeking an equity injection from an
outside investor, preferably a large financial institution.
RT's shares closed at CDollars 2.11 on the Toronto Stock Exchange last
Friday, a 31 per cent drop over two days.
RT traded at almost CDollars 20 in 1989.
Among Bronfman holding companies, Edper slumped by 32 per cent last Thursday
and Friday to CDollars 2.25. Hees International, the group's merchant
banking arm, was down 11 per cent to CDollars 6.88, while Trilon Financial,
which has a 44 per cent interest in Royal Trust, slipped 25 per cent to
CDollars 3.15.
A Bronfman spokesman described the sell-off as an inevitable reaction to the
troubles at RT and at Bramalea, a Bronfman-controlled property developer
which filed for bankruptcy protection last month.
However, he said that other parts of the group, which included natural
resource, life insurance and consumer products companies, were 'very
healthy', with healthy lines of credit.
RT's business consists mainly of mortgage lending, fiduciary services and a
variety of banking functions. It has taken several writedowns on its UK and
North American assets over the past three years and is expected to set aside
a further large amount from fourth-quarter 1992 earnings. It suffered a
nine-month loss of CDollars 227m (USDollars 189m).
Analysts said investors were uncertain whether a buyer would willingly step
forward for RT. Royal Bank of Canada, the country's largest financial
institution, is among those in discussions with the Bronfman group. Trilon
has said that it would contribute CDollars 100m in new equity.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Observer: Big Blue puts on speed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a time when it seemed that IBM could do anything. But can it
persuade the stuffy old codgers of the All England Tennis Club to install
one of its new-fangled IBM 'speedometers' on Wimbledon's centre court in
time for this year's tournament?
Its latest invention, which comes complete with IBM logo, is designed to
record the speed of a player's serve. Its introduction at the current
Australian Open in Melbourne is proving popular with the public and
controversial with the players.
World number one Jim Courier, who fought its introduction at last year's US
Open, thinks it's a stupid idea. 'It creates a situation where you say 'Gee]
I hit that one 200kph. Let's see if I can hit this one 202?'
'What's the point? If I hit a 140kph slice serve into the corner, that's
just as effective.' Crass or not, the media and public have been lapping up
the new statistics, noting avidly that the fastest gun in Melbourne's
Flinders Park centre has been German ace, Michael Stich, with 203kph. Monica
Seles leads the women with 167kph.
Wimbledon guards its on-court signage jealously, unlike most international
sports events. Rolex for timekeeping, Slazenger for equipment and Robinsons
for drinks have for many years been the only three branded products seen on
court.
Maybe something will go right for IBM this year and it will become the
fourth.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Observer: Tough choice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps Sir John Harvey-Jones, ex-boss of ICI and troubleshooter
extraordinaire, will allow the TV cameras to chronicle his next big decision
 -helping choose the next editor of The Economist weekly newspaper, which he
chairs. It would give an interesting insight into his ability to pick
winners.
Admittedly, Observer may be a little biased since The Economist is
half-owned by the Financial Times. But it has been a fertile breeding ground
for future highflyers. Not being tied by Fleet Street's restrictive
practices, successive editors have had the pick of the bright young things
coming out of university.
Sunday Times editor, Andrew Neil, ex-Times editor Simon Jenkins and Sarah
Hogg, head of the prime minister's policy unit, all made their mark at the
magazine before moving on and up. Meanwhile, Rupert Pennant-Rea is not the
first editor to be rewarded with a big job. His predecessor, Andrew Knight,
went on to head the Daily Telegraph before being poached by Rupert Murdoch
to be his right-hand man. Knight's predecessor, Sir Alastair Burnet, left to
edit the Daily Express.
Although The Economist has railed at the continuing influence of Britain's
ruling class, the choice of the next editor will be made by the very same.
The four trustees, including NatWest chairman Lord Alexander and former CBI
president Sir Campbell Fraser, can veto the decision. However, it would be
unusual if they did. It's up to Sir John and fellow directors such as
Cadbury Schweppes' boss, Dominic Cadbury, and Sir Evelyn de Rothschild to
find an editorial genius with untapped management skills.
Past form suggests that a thirtysomething stands the best chance. Walter
Bagehot was only 34 when he was made editor and Geoffrey Crowther had just
turned 31. But given its current success - circulation has topped 500,000 -
it would be surprising if the directors chose an editor not steeped in the
magazine's culture.

<TEXT>
PAKISTANI security forces in the southern province of Sindh were last night
investigating two bomb blasts in the city of Hyderabad, north of Karachi,
which left 24 people dead and at least 60 injured.
The blasts are seen as a setback to the government of Mr Nawaz Sharif in its
efforts to restore order in Sindh, whose capital, Karachi, is Pakistan's
commercial centre.
The government sent troops to the province last summer, after a crime wave
shattered business confidence. Since then there has been a marked
improvement in security.
Mr Muzaffar Hussain Shah, Sindh's chief minister, said the blasts were
'meant to sabotage efforts by the federal and provincial governments to
restore peace'. He did not attribute responsibility for the blasts.

over the next 10 days to help police the border with Afghanistan, Reuter
reports from Moscow.
Interfax news agency quoted the chairman of the Tajik parliament, Mr Imamali
Rakhmonov, as saying four battalions, each of 500 men, would be dispatched
to reinforce some 3,000 Russian troops already stationed on the 1,200-mile

Mr Bernard Kouchner, the French health and humanitarian action minister,
yesterday urged all citizens who had been operated on or received a blood
transfusion in the last 10-15 years to get themselves tested for Aids and
hepatitis, Reuter reports from Paris.
France is still recovering from its worst modern health scandal, in which
more than 1,200 haemophiliacs were infected with Aids after receiving
transfusions from contaminated blood stocks in the mid-1980s.
Mr Kouchner also said he did not intend to run for parliament in elections
this March.
Mr Kouchner told France 2 television he wanted time out to work for the
world's oppressed.
Asked about his role in the elections, which opinion polls predict will give
the conservative opposition a decisive win, he said he would take part in
the government's campaign but nothing more.

FT  25 JAN 93 / The greatest years may lie ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is fashionable to argue that the US is a superpower in relative decline.
Since the publication in 1987 of historian Paul Kennedy's The Rise and Fall
of Great Powers, a succession of pundits has compared the US's position
today with that of Britain in the late 19th century. Distracted by global
military and diplomatic responsibilities, the argument runs, the US has
neglected its economy and ignored festering social problems. The result, as
with Britain a century earlier, is a prolonged decline in economic
competitiveness that now threatens the US's ability to provide global
leadership.
In his inaugural address, President Bill Clinton seemed to accept much of
this 'declinist' thesis. Speaking metaphorically he said the US was in 'the
depth of winter'. He spoke of drift and deadlock, of stagnant wages, of
shaken confidence and of increasing inequality. It was time, he claimed, to
'force the spring' and heal a fractured economy and society.
Hardly anybody doubts that there is a lot wrong with contemporary America.
Lack of access to healthcare, appalling inner-city poverty, racial
discrimination and levels of crime far above those in other industrialised
countries are all signs of a seriously malfunctioning society. But the
broader 'declining superpower' thesis is less compelling.
The US has lost economic ground relative to other industrialised countries
since 1945, when it produced about half of world output. But this is less a
reflection of US decline than of the distorting impact of the second world
war, which boosted the US economy while devastating those of Europe and
Japan. Once allowance is made for an initial catch-up, the evidence for
continuing US decline is, at best, mixed.
Surprisingly, the US share of the industrial output of the 24 rich members
of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is larger
today than in 1970. If allowance is made for 'purchasing power parities'
(differences in domestic costs), Japan was the only country to advance
relative to the US during the 1980s. And OECD calculations suggest Japan's
per capita gross domestic product was only about 80 per cent of the US's by
the end of the decade. After adjusting for internal purchasing power, the
leading European countries failed to make any headway relative to the US in
the 1980s; (west) Germany, the most prosperous, ended the decade with living
standards about 15 per cent lower than in the US.
The US, like other advanced countries, has experienced slower productivity
growth since the early 1970s. But it has retained a large absolute
advantage. This is true even in manufacturing industry, although Japan and
Germany are challenging its dominance in particular sectors.
America retains many other socio-economic advantages. It is still easily the
least crowded of the large developed economies, with a population density
less than 10 per cent of Japan's. This means it can continue to reap the
economic benefits of relatively liberal immigration policies. It has a
younger population than Japan or most European countries, meaning that it
faces less acute fiscal challenges as a result of population ageing. It is
better endowed with raw materials and physical capital than most of its
competitors. And it has the world's most extensive (and arguably best)
system of higher education, which partly compensates for flaws in US high
schools.
Perhaps the least appreciated US advantage is the fact that it has the
lowest per capita tax burden of any OECD country, bar Turkey. This means
that the supposedly intractable fiscal problems are not really intractable.
If it chooses, the Clinton administration can reduce the budget deficit,
increase investment and tackle social problems without imposing tax burdens
higher than those already faced by most citizens of most advanced
democracies. There is a lot of fiscal wiggle room, even if this is not often
apparent to US politicians.
So why is there so much fear of decline? It partly reflects a confusion
between growing inequality and economic decline. Many families have lost
ground because the benefits of economic growth have accrued mainly to the
top 30 per cent of the population. This in turn reflects the tighter link
between pay and productivity (which reflects education) in an increasingly
competitive global economy.
'Declinism' may also be partly media- driven: for 12 years academics and
journalists (many of whom are Democrat sympathisers) had an incentive to
denigrate the US as a way of discrediting Republican presidents. With their
man in the White House, it would not be surprising if the mood now grew more
upbeat.
Rather than comparing the US with Britain at the end of the 19th century, it
might make more sense to compare it with Britain in 1815 after the victory
over Napoleonic France. The US, after all, has just won a lengthy and
debilitating war against communism. This sapped its economic strength and
distorted its national goals, just as did Britain's long struggle for
supremacy with France.
With a new, energetic president, and with the same party controlling both
White House and Congress, the US now has a chance to flower economically,
politically and socially. The next 50 years could be its heyday rather than
a period of painful decline.

FT  25 JAN 93 / A revolutionary idea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most important single fact about the election of President Clinton, as
far as the rest of the world is concerned, is that the new US administration
intends to give its top priorities to domestic issues. This clear message of
Mr Clinton's election campaign was underlined in his inaugural address last
Wednesday, which contained only the scantest allusions to foreign policy,
and no specific reference at all to America's European allies.
Some sceptics question whether things will really pan out like that. But it
would be prudent for the rest of the world, starting with the Europeans, to
take Mr Clinton at his word. For the probability is not merely that Mr
Clinton means what he says, but that his preferences are consistent with the
undertow of forces operating in the world today.
There is no doubt that Clinton would prefer to give foreign policy a lower
profile than it had under George Bush, or indeed most recent presidents. The
question is whether international events, the expectations of other people,
and America's undeniable position as the only remaining superpower, will
permit him to rearrange America's traditional priorities.
Take the flare-up of the conflict with Iraq, with which George Bush signed
off his presidency. Before the handover, Mr Clinton showed no hesitation in
endorsing the actions of the outgoing president. After his inauguration, he
vowed to continue the Bush policy. 'We are going to stay with our policy,'
he said. 'It is an American policy.'
Maybe the crisis (and President Bush) gave him no choice, unless he wanted
to be blackened as a wimp. But the bottom line is that the Clinton
presidency has started out looking like a strange continuation of the Bush
presidency, with a military engagement by the US in the Middle East, but
without a credible endgame strategy.
The temptation to play on the world stage may prove permanently seductive,
sceptics claim, if only as an elevated form of escape from intractable
domestic problems. It will always be easier to bomb Saddam just one more
time, than to do anything, however small, about the budget deficit.
Finally, the international community will demand global leadership and no
one else can provide it. This is the greatest challenge to Clinton's chosen
priorities, according to Leslie Gelb of the New York Times. 'Today, there is
no alternative to Washington's leadership and no substitute to US military
power,' he says. 'If Mr Clinton fails to lead in Somalia, Bosnia, Iraq, etc,
no other country can or will.'
The trouble with these arguments, is not that they draw too much on
nostalgia and wishful thinking (though of course they do), but that they
take too little account of changes in the real world.
The 1991 Gulf war appeared to exemplify the ultimate paradigm of American
political leadership and high-tech military power, at the head of a
broad-based international coalition, under the aegis of a truly United
Nations, in the service of a new world order. The reality is less
comfortable. There is no new world order, especially not in the Gulf; the US
does not have the resources, military or financial, to sustain its old
international pre-eminence; it does not have any master geostrategic plan,
in the follow-up to the cold war, with which to exercise its leadership; and
the real world is much too turbulent and unpredictable to admit such a
master plan.
Even under President Bush, who was strongly focused on foreign policy, the
US was starting to abdicate its leadership role from some of the most
pressing problem areas. The marines were sent to Somalia, and bombs and
missiles launched at Iraq; but the US has stood right back from the civil
war in what was Yugoslavia, and it is doing much less than western Europe to
help the struggling countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
Some nostalgics cite the case of Nato, which has no obvious purpose in the
post-cold war world, but which nevertheless seems to be getting a second
wind. Last year allied governments, including France, agreed Nato could play
new roles in peacekeeping; right now Nato headquarter units are helping
humanitarian aid in Bosnia; and France and Germany have agreed their new
Euro-Corps could fight under Nato orders. All this looks like a modest new
lease of life for an Atlantic alliance which is the creature of American
leadership.
These innovations, no doubt valuable in their way, do not reverse the tide
of history, however. Nato's central purpose, to deter a massive attack by
the Soviet Union, has disappeared and cannot be replaced by a little
peacekeeping on the side. Even under Bush, the US planned to cut its forces
in Europe by two-thirds; under Clinton, the cut must surely be deeper. No
European government wants the US to go home; the fact remains that the end
of the cold war leaves a gaping hole in the heart of Nato and western
strategy, it weakens the cement of western unity, and removes much of the
need for US leadership.
If Mr Clinton is as bright as they say, he will heed the advice of Leslie
Gelb, and try to persuade other countries to share the burdens of strategy.
But the price of shared burdens would be shared leadership; it is not yet
clear that the US or its allies are ready for such a revolutionary idea.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Monday Interview: Mr Fix-it's central role - Bob Phillis,
next deputy director-general of the BBC, talks to Raymond Snoddy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A puppet of Bob Phillis appeared on Spitting Image, the satirical television
programme that savagely lampoons the rich and famous, from the royal family
to government ministers.
It is, however, an accurate measure of the fame of Mr Phillis that the
puppet only appeared once in a crowd scene and has languished in his cellar
ever since. It was made in honour of his 40th birthday when he was managing
director of Central, the ITV company responsible for Spitting Image.
It may now be time to take the puppet back upstairs. Mr Phillis, now 47, has
been playing an increasingly significant role in British broadcasting for
more than 10 years and is to play an even bigger one.
He will be the next deputy director-general of the BBC, even though he left
school at 15 to become an apprentice in the printing industry, knew nothing
of Oxford or Cambridge, where BBC top executives are normally educated, and
has never made a programme in his life.
'People say to me: 'Bob you are not a programme maker,' ' he says. 'I'm not.
I have never produced or directed a programme, but by God I believe it is
part of my role to facilitate the environment in which programme makers can
do their best work.'
Mr Phillis is central to the plans of Mr John Birt, the new BBC
director-general, to try to make the corporation more efficient and
accountable, and to persuade the government to renew both its Royal Charter
and its universal licence fee.
Apart from deputising for Mr Birt across the whole organisation, Mr Phillis
will be responsible for a BBC directorate being created to handle resources,
engineering and services. His job will also involve merging and running, for
the immediate future, BBC World Service Radio, which has just celebrated its
60th anniversary, and the more recent World Service Television.
Were Mr Phillis to be joining a First Division football team, he would be
the calm, genial sort of solid, midfield player who holds the line when the
defence is about to crumble and who can feed the star attackers with
accurate passes.
But he possesses a more fearsome reputation. People have noticed that, where
Mr Phillis goes, job losses can follow. In his two years as chief executive
of ITN, staff numbers were cut from 1,100 to 650. There are fears that his
arrival will mean similar cuts at the BBC.
'I do bridle at the notion of hatchet man,' he says. 'I have been lucky to
have been asked to be managing director or chief executive of companies
going through change, and some of that change has been painful. But it has
not been change for change's sake; it has been to sustain, or preserve or
facilitate.' ITN would not have survived without urgent action to tackle
costs in the wake of a Pounds 10m overspend which came to light just as he
was arriving, he emphasises.
Ironically, Mr Phillis will go to the BBC in the wake of a much larger and
much more embarrassing overspend. The BBC admits to being Pounds 38m over
budget at BBC Television in 1991-92, although the corporation managed to
balance its books overall through cost savings. This year the BBC says its
'best guess' is that there could be a Pounds 21m overspend if economies are
not implemented.
'How can you deploy the argument of openness and accountability and value
for money if ever this overspend repeats itself? So we have to make sure it
doesn't,' says Mr Phillis, who will join the BBC in two months. He first
wants to see through the completion of a change of ownership at ITN. A
consortium including Carlton Communications, Central and Reuters will
replace the previous ITN structure - a wholly owned subsidiary of all the
ITV companies.
Mr Phillis denies there is an agenda at the BBC to cut specific numbers of
staff jobs. But there is an agenda to improve efficiency.
'Unless the BBC is shown to be operating effectively and efficiently, and
applying licence payers' money to what it does best, then it is properly
going to be open to scrutiny and criticism,' he says.
The journey to the heart of one of Britain's most significant institutions
has been an unusual one - from a council estate in Croydon, south London. In
retrospect, each step has equipped Mr Phillis to be a Mr Fix-it of
broadcasting organisations.
An interest in the communications industry and a fascination for pictures
have linked his working life. 'When I was 15, I was staring into an
illuminated glass screen, looking at images, looking at pictures and
changing them, retouching them,' he says.
His parents thought the greatest job security lay in Bob becoming a member
of Slade, the society of lithographic artists, designers and process
workers. He studied in his own time, won a scholarship to Nottingham
University to study industrial economics as a 20-year-old 'mature student',
and was supported by his wife Jean with the help of a weekly collection at
his union branch.
'I have no regrets that I left school at 15,' he says. 'If I had stayed on
at school I would probably have gone to university to read history.' He
retains an interest in history, particularly of the first world war, and is
a member of the Western Front Association, visiting battlefields like the
Somme where the grandfather he was named after died.
The first brush with the world of television came when he was pitching, as
managing director of Sun Printers, for the printing contract for TV Times,
the ITV listing magazine. Instead, he accepted the managing directorship of
Independent Television Publications, the ITV company that published the
magazine. It was still print, but it was print about television.
In 1981 he accepted, after some misgivings, the managing directorship of the
restructured Midlands ITV franchise created out of Lord Grade's ATV, which
was to be a dual region with studios in Nottingham and Birmingham.
'The franchise had been awarded to a company that didn't have a name, that
wasn't financed, didn't have a chief executive, didn't have a site for its
second studio (in Nottingham), and which had to get rid of 49 per cent of
its shares. I'm absolutely certain three or four industry figures were
approached before me,' says Mr Phillis.
Somehow the money was raised to get Central on the air. Mr Phillis says he
is proud of the innovative programmes broadcast by his team there.
In November 1986, Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Communications, the
expanding television services and programming company, poached him at just
the right moment. Central's board had just turned down Mr Phillis's plans to
take Central into satellite television. He left and became group managing
director of Carlton, working on plans to bid for an ITV franchise. They
eventually proved successful when the company won the London franchise and
took over from Thames Television. After four years, Mr Phillis moved to ITN
as chief executive.
He denies reports of a rift with Mr Green and says he moved because he
realised his job satisfaction lay in a different direction.
'Carlton is a great conglomerate but what gives me a buzz, a rush of
adrenaline, is television,' he says.
Mr Green believes his former colleague played an important role at Carlton
in helping to manage the transition from a small to a medium-sized company.
'I think he is well equipped to understand the problems of the BBC and
provide a commercial view and an understanding of the marketplace,' Mr Green
says.
For Mr Phillis the BBC looks like his ultimate destination rather than
another staging post. The BBC Royal Charter runs out at the end of 1996 and
Mr Phillis has signed a five-year contract. After that he says he does not
know what will happen to him. Already, however, there is speculation that he
could follow Mr Birt.
One letter of congratulation on his new job gave him particular pleasure. It
was from Mr John Orford, the journeyman printer who looked after the young
apprentice. It simply asked: who would have believed that 'the lithe, fit
young man who cycled to work each day' would go so far?

FT  25 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Worries on sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The week starts with uncertainty hanging over the immediate direction of
both the dollar and sterling, writes James Blitz
At the end of last week, the US currency dipped below the DM1.60 level
against the D-Mark, with some dealers wondering whether its five pfennig
fall since the start of this year is more than just a technical correction.
There is lingering uncertainty about the scale of the economic upturn in the
US, and some dealers continue to think that US interest rates, which are
currently at about 3 per cent, may be lowered again by the US Federal
Reserve.
Wednesday's testimony by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Chairman,
before the Joint Economic Committee will be closely scrutinised for any
policy indications it gives.
Tomorrow's consumer confidence figures from the Conference Board and this
week's jobless figures, out on Thursday, should also give further clues as
go whether the pick-up in the US economy can be sustained.
Sterling will also be in the spotlight, with strong speculation that the
Bank of England might cut base rates this week to give a new impetus to
economic growth.
The pound was trading below DM2.45 against the D-Mark for most of Friday,
and there is a growing belief in the market that it may go as low as DM2.40.
Today's CBI Quarterly Industrial Trends Survey will add further light to
last week's gloomy unemployment figures for December. The December current
account and trade balance, due out on Friday, may have a particularly
significant impact on the pound as far as foreign investors are concerned.
The French franc has performed very strongly in the last two weeks, and has
been trading more than 5 centimes above its ERM floor against the D-Mark.
There is strong speculation that the Bank of France will cut its main
lending rates when it intervenes in the market today and Thursday.

FT  25 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Stronger D-Mark sector rises from the
Ecu market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OUT of the ashes of the Ecu market, a stronger and larger D-Mark Eurobond
market has risen.
Given the importance of the D-Mark as a currency, the slow development of
the D-Mark sector of the Eurobond market had been an anomaly, resulting in
part from antiquated market practices. The liberalisation of Bundesbank
rules last August helped to modernise the market, leaving it well positioned
for an autumn windfall.
The turmoil in the foreign exchange market in September left many European
countries, already facing problems funding their budget deficits, with
depleted foreign currency reserves.
The D-Mark sector proved 'the best watering hole for sovereign borrowers to
refill their tanks', according to Dresdner Bank. Sweden's DM2.5bn financing
in October helped to jump-start the market by proving that large, liquid
D-Mark issues can attract international institutional investors.
Since then, the pace of growth has increased. The volume of D-Mark Eurobonds
in the first three weeks of this year has reached DM14.5bn, representing 27
per cent of supply last year.
Although this level of activity is not likely to be maintained, volume is
expected to run at record levels this year. The heavy supply so far has been
easily absorbed by the market, which has not suffered from a widening of
Eurobond spreads relative to bunds.
In part, the market has benefited from the availability of strong credits in
large size, which helped attract new institutional investors.
The liquidity of the market has improved a lot but it still lags the dollar
market. Many banks and securities houses have shifted idle Ecu bond dealers
on to D-Mark Eurobond trading, while some German banks, such as Dresdner,
have stepped up trading activity.
Consequently,the investor base has broadened sufficiently to keep pace with
the market's growth. As well as attracting international institutions, the
market has succeeded in attracting a new layer of domestic investors.
'Both the Finland and Italy deals (launched earlier this year) offered yield
spreads over bunds, and also over Schuldscheine (domestic bonds) and
mortgage bonds,' said one German banker.
As a result, domestic institutions, such as insurance companies, have
started to buy large Eurobond issues as a more liquid alternative to
domestic paper. More business is likely to be channelled through the growing
D-Mark medium-term note market.
At the same time, the turmoil in the financial markets last September sent
international investors rushing towards the safe haven of D-Marks.
'The dynamics of the market are totally different now,' said Mr Charles
Berman, director of capital markets at Salomon Brothers. Investors face a
reduced choice of markets since there is no longer a sizeable Ecu market and
the convergence play on higher-yielding European markets has largely
disappeared.
In fact, the development of the market is likely to be halted by the supply
side, rather than lack of demand.
The swaps market affords little opportunity for borrowers without a need for
D-Marks to swap into other currencies. With interest rates widely believed
to be set to fall, there is a lack of counterparties willing to pay
fixed-rate D-Marks.
While many sovereign and supranational borrowers hold some funds in D-Marks,
relatively few companies need to borrow D-Marks. But sovereign and state
borrowers are expected to return to the market soon.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Risk and Reward: Traditional split in derivatives is less
clear-cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE traditional split between the two sides of the derivatives business  -
the exchange-traded and over-the-counter markets - is becoming less
clear-cut.
Broadly, when derivative instruments are standardised and traded in heavy
bulk, they are listed on futures exchanges, which offer greater transparency
and reduce credit risk. But products which are tailor-made to suit specific
requirements are traded over-the-counter, directly between counterparties.
In Europe, the two sides are generally seen as complimentary. Frequently,
the same banks which are active in the OTC market are often exchange
members. Since they use the exchanges to offset risk undertaken in writing
OTC business, the argument goes, the growth of the OTC market fuels volume
on the exchange.
'It can be argued that short-term interest rate futures are competitors to
the over-the-counter FRA (forward-rate agreement) market. But when we launch
a new contract, it does not take FRA volume away,' according to Mr Roger
Barton, head of product development at Liffe.
In the US, the futures exchanges have adopted a more competitive stance
towards the OTC market, partly a result of their history of turf battles.
There is logic behind attempts to win business from the OTC market. For
example, the largest component of the Dollars 4,000bn swaps market is dollar
interest-rate swaps. These are heavily traded using standardised
documentation, and no longer require specialist knowledge. Yet the Chicago
Board of Trade's three and five-year swap futures, launched in 1991, proved
a flop. One explanation is that the banks involved in the swaps market have
an interest in trading over-the-counter, since the additional transparency
provided by exchanges could cause bid/offer spreads to narrow.
Another possibility is that the development of the swaps market was
facilitated by the existence of exchange-traded products for hedging, such
as the Eurodollar contract, which can now be traded out to five years, so
that a separate swap futures contract was just not needed.
In any case, the division between liquid, standardised markets and
structured products is an over-simplification of the exchange/OTC split. The
foreign exchange market is the most obvious anomaly: the most actively
traded market in the world is barely traded on stock exchanges.
However, counterparty risk in the foreign exchange market is of very short
duration. Clearly, the need for exchange-traded contracts is greater when an
exchange would provide a substantial reduction in credit risk.
If credit risk is, as some traders believe, the key element, there is a
strong argument for shifting at least some business on to exchanges. The
decline in the credit-worthiness of banks and securities houses has made it
increasingly difficult for some of them to do business, as demonstrated by
the current spate of US firms attempting to set up separately capitalised,
highly rated derivatives units.
The CBOT is preparing to take advantage of such credit concerns by offering
a so-called Hybrid Instrument Transaction System later this year, which will
comprise a range of standardised products to be traded on a screen-based
system, as well as clearing facilities.
Other exchanges, notably the Chicago Board Options Exchange, are also
becoming more ambitious in the complexity of the products they offer.

FT  25 JAN 93 / US Money and Credit: President gets easy ride in first week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE bond market has given the new president an easy ride, bidding down the
yield on the long bond to below 7.3 per cent in the week of his
inauguration.
Apart from the obvious point that investors cannot react to President
Clinton's economic policy until he comes up with one, the main reason why
the markets have treated him so gently is that they have been preoccupied
with other matters - chiefly, the size and structure of the next quarterly
refunding round.
Explaining the background to the refunding question is relatively simple.
The new Democratic administration is considering whether it should reduce
the size of future long bond auctions and increase the issuance of
shorter-dated maturities proportionally, in order to cut the cost of funding
the federal deficit.
Saving money on paying for the deficit is crucial to any attempt to cut the
size of the shortfall in the federal budget. Interest servicing costs in the
last fiscal year exceeded Dollars 200bn, more than two-thirds of the
deficit. Analysts estimate that by switching from longer to shorter-dated
maturities, the government could save several billion dollars a year on debt
payments.
A lot is at stake, and the fact that the new occupants of the Treasury are
seriously considering changing the borrowing mix has obsessed the bond
market. If dealers and investors can guess correctly about the outcome of
the deliberations, then they can either make, or more pertinently, avoid
losing, a considerable amount of money.
The short sellers, in particular, are keeping a close eye on the situation -
none want to be caught with sizeable short positions if the Treasury
announces plans to reduce long bond auctions. Such a move would inevitably
push prices sharply higher as the market moved to discount the news, leaving
short sellers badly squeezed.
Above all, the refunding question has made the market nervous, leading to
greater than normal volatility. Last week, for example, a rumour that the
new Treasury secretary, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, was about to call a press
conference to deny there would be any reductions in long bond issuance left
longer-dated securities noticeably weaker.
However, within a few hours, prices had recovered strongly after Ms Laura
Tyson, an economic adviser to the Clinton administration, said the structure
of the borrowing mix was a subject under review.
If the government does choose to alter the shape of its financing, it will
not come without a cost. Economists warn that issuing more shorter-dated
paper will push up yields at short end of the market, which means the
Treasury only saves money if the increase in short-term rates is smaller
than the decline in long-term rates caused by the initial shift away from
the long end.
Moreover, shortening the maturity of the federal debt assumes the
relationship between short and long rates will remain the same for some
time.
This is a dangerous assumption. If the yield curve were to flatten
dramatically, with short-term rates rising sharply, the government could end
up worse off than before.
Also, any narrowing of the spread between long and short rates would hurt
bank profits, which could squeeze the supply of credit to the economy.
The Treasury is not due to announce details of the next quarterly refunding
round until February 3, so the market has another week or so to stew over
the matter.
While opinion on Wall Street is divided over whether the authorities will
cut the size of the long bond auctions, those analysts who expect a shift in
the borrowing mix believe the change will probably not be introduced until
the second refunding programme, due in May.

FT  25 JAN 93 / UK Gilts: Fears about funding help dampen sentiment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICES rose for most classes of gilts on the back of hopes of lower base
rates. However, fears about funding, particularly related to this
Wednesday's auction by the Bank of England of Pounds 2.5bn of 14-year stock,
held back the consequent drop in yields.
The fall in yields was most marked at the short end of the yield curve, on
account of the pressure which the government is coming under to cut base
rates from their current 7 per cent.
That was triggered by depressing economic data released last week which
indicated the recession of nearly three years may have a lot longer to run.
A poor performance by the car industry was a factor in a 0.5 per cent fall
in manufacturing output in November compared with the previous month, while
a sharp rise in the jobless total last month pushed unemployment to its
highest level for almost six years.
The jobless total rose a seasonally adjusted 60,800 in December, the biggest
monthly increase since July 1991, pushing the overall figure close to 3m.
Meanwhile, average earnings across the economy rose by an underlying 5 per
cent in the year to November, slightly below the October figure, which was
revised upwards to 5.25 per cent. That demonstrated, according to many
economists, the lack of inflationary pressures in the economy.
While a sharp fall in sterling last week against the D-Mark did little to
lift investor sentiment, a still more powerful drag on the market was the
auction of Pounds 2.5bn of 8.5 per cent Treasury stock due in 2007. With
many investors weighing up whether to take positions at the auction, demand
for gilts in this section of the yield curve was virtually non existent.
There was also some confusion in the gilt market on the back of projections
that, according to estimates based on the rise in notes and coins in
circulation during the first three weeks of January, the year on year rise
for the M0 money supply for January could turn out at above 4 per cent.
According to Mr Nigel Richardson, economist at the UK office of Japanese
bank Yamaichi, that was a worrying feature for the market given that this
figure would breach the Treasury's target for M0 growth. Year-on-year M0
growth in both November and December last year was 3 per cent. A figure of
above 4 per cent, coming after two months in which the numbers were
relatively large, might indicate a rise in inflation was around the corner.
Nonetheless, the notion that base rates were almost certain to come down
ahead of the March 16 Budget pulled down yields 'in an effect that dribbled
along the yield curve', according to Mr John Shepperd, an economist at S. G.
Warburg Securities. 'Even with this sentiment a key question for the market
is whether investors can absorb the large amount of supply coming via the
auction without a drop in prices,' he said.
The economic indicators last week demonstrated a crying need for a cut in
base rates, said Mr Simon Briscoe, a bond analyst at Greenwell Montagu. 'The
question is whether the government will do it almost immediately or whether
it will wait for the Bundesbank to cut rates, which may not be until
mid-February.'
However, some gilt commentators were more cautious, arguing that Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, may want to wait until he sees a
date for the economy related to what was happening in January before taking
action on base rates. That would be in keeping with his approach in the past
of not wishing to be hurried into action on this score, in spite of evidence
that any full recovery from the recession might be some time into the
future.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Japanese Bonds: Yields fall on hopes of a reduction in
discount rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES of an imminent cut in the official discount rate buoyed Japanese
government bonds last week, pushing yields down to their lowest levels for
nearly five years.
Worries over sluggish money supply and weak share prices prompted the
expectation of a credit easing by the Bank of Japan. The yield on the No 145
10-year benchmark bond fell to 4.335 per cent last Friday, its lowest since
April 1988. At the short end, the return on three-month certificates of
deposit declined to 3.7 per cent, matching the low of last December.
Low bank lending has been one of the leading factors behind the contraction
in money supply. Last month, the money supply fell by 0.5 per cent from the
previous year, posting its fourth consecutive monthly decline.
The Tokyo stock market, suffering from low trading volume, remains
vulnerable to even light selling. The leading Nikkei index closed below the
psychological resistance line of 16,500 last Friday, helping to harden
speculation of a February crash ahead of the March year-end book closing by
Japanese companies.
The weakness triggered renewed anticipation for monetary easing in support
for share prices.
Meanwhile, the weakness of the Tokyo stock market has led to a shift in
funds by institutional investors into the fixed income market. The bond
market received a lift in sentiment through the Ministry of Finance's Y100bn
purchase of 10 and 20-year bonds at the beginning of last week.
The move was the first outright bond purchase operated directly on the
secondary market, as until now, the government has bought bonds through
private placements. Bond market participants expect the operation to bolster
Japan's faltering money supply, while lowering market rates and subsequently
bank lending rates.
The decision was seen as an attempt by the ministry to increase the
circulation of funds at a time when a sharp rise in postal savings is
becoming a controversy among policy makers. Mr Marshall Gittler, bond
analyst at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, said: 'The Ministry of Finance is trying
to recycle postal funds into the financial system.'
The finance ministry plans a Y100bn purchase of government bonds every
month. 'The Ministry of Finance has become a large institutional buyer which
can be counted on to support the bond market,' said Mr Eric Miller, bond
trader at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo.
While the monthly purchase may support sentiment, oversupply in the bond
market is expected to dampen the current rally. An increasing number of
Japanese companies, facing redemptions of equity-linked bonds, are expected
to tap the corporate straight bond market for funds this year.
An income tax cut to lift the economy, which could be implemented this
summer will push up the supply of debt. Economists expect the cut to be as
large as Y5,000bn-Y6,000bn. To finance tax cuts on this scale, the
government will need to issue some Y2,000bn to Y3,000bn in deficit bonds,
which will mean extra supply.
The Ministry of Finance remains opposed to the issue of deficit bonds, but
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and leading business organisations,
including the Keidanren, have built a consensus in favour of deficit
spending.
Ms Tomoko Fujii, economist at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, expects the rally
to last for three to four months, with the yield falling on the bench market
to 4.1 per cent. However, a rise in government borrowing plus the demand for
funds by Japanese companies, are likely to push up bond yields thus
steepening the yield curve.

FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: DAF plan for recovery endorsed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO management consul-tancies are understood to have endorsed the main
elements of a recovery plan drawn up by DAF, the beleaguered Dutch truck
maker, opening the way for substantial extra financial aid backed by the
Dutch and Belgian governments.
Following a meeting of DAF's supervisory board at the weekend, the company's
13,000 employees in the Netherlands, Belgium and at its Leyland DAF truck
and van-making subsidiary in the UK are expected to be told tomorrow how
they will be affected by further cost-cutting and job losses.
At the same time, DAF is expected to indicate what progress it is making to
secure further financing in talks with its banks and the Dutch and Belgium
governments. These could lead to any of the parties taking or expanding
equity stakes. Leading shareholders include ABN-AMRO Bank with 8.2 per cent
and the Dutch insurance groups ING and Aegon with 10.6 per cent and 6.4 per
cent respectively.
In spite of industry rumours that DAF is considering plant closures, the
immediate measures are understood to concentrate on further squeezing costs.
DAF has cut its work force by 4,000 people since the end of 1989, and had
intended to reduce this to under 12,000 people by the end of this year even
before the latest recovery plan.
The hope is that further belt-tightening, combined with fresh finance, will
allow DAF to survive until it can be bailed out by recovery in European, and
particularly UK, commercial vehicle markets. It expects this to emerge in
the second half of this year.
Tomorrow is unlikely to resolve the uncertainty surrounding the company's
plans to invest about Pounds 250m (Dollars 375m) in a successor to the
Leyland DAF vans built by 2,000 employees at the former Freight Rover van
plant in Birmingham.
DAF, in which British Aerospace holds a 10.9 per cent stake, is under strong
pressure from Renault, its partner in the project, to make a firm
manufacturing commitment. But DAF's financial crisis, following three years
of heavy losses, has led Renault to make contingency plans against DAF
withdrawing.
Mr Koos Andriessen, the Dutch minister of economic affairs, has indicated
his willingness to try to arrange up to 'several hundred millions of
guilders' of additional help for DAF from the banks and Dutch and Belgian
governments.
Belgium's Flemish regional government is willing to provide extra help now
that the reports from the two consultancies, Arthur D. Little and Coopers &amp;
Lybrand Dijker Van Dien, are known to be sympathetic to DAF's plans.
Such funding would be additional to the Fl 190m (Dollars 110m) in
state-backed loans DAF secured in December but which it quickly acknowledged
would not be enough in the face of a bigger-than-expected net loss for
1992-93.
This is now expected to be higher than the F1 100m net loss forecast at last
year's half-way stage, particularly as some provision for tomorrow's cuts
will have to be included. Cumulative losses exceed Fl 700m.

Mr Dale Hanson, Calpers' chief executive, said the fund began its 1993
shareholder advocacy programme last September. But until now, it had not
named the companies from which it was seeking changes in governance. Seven
companies have reached deals with Calpers. These are: Boise Cascade,
Champion International, MacFrugals Bargain Closeouts, Polaroid, Sears, Time
Warner, and Westinghouse. Talks are continuing with Advanced Micro Devices,
Chrysler, IBM, Pennzoil and Sizzler.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRADESCO, Brazil's largest private bank, posted profits of Dollars 289m for
1992, a 77 per cent increase over 1991.
The improvement was partly due to a 25 per cent reduction in provisions for
bad debts to Dollars 116m for the year.
Loan operations accounted for 28 per cent of the results while a substantial
proportion came from subsidiaries, mostly from Bradesco Seguros, the bank's
insurance unit.
'The Brazilian insurance market continued growing in 1992, and Bradesco is
the market leader,' explained Mr Alcides Lopes Tapias, vice-president.
The bank benefited from Brazil's increase in exports. It handled Dollars
6.4bn of exchange operations for shipments abroad, representing 16.7 per
cent of the market. The bank enjoyed a 25 per cent increase in this area.
Mr Tapias said Bradesco pushed ahead with cost cutting.

FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: Ilva names Nakamura managing
director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ILVA, the heavily loss-making Italian state steel group, has appointed Mr
Hayao Nakamura, a Nippon Steel executive, as its new managing director
following Friday's resignation of Mr Giovanni Gambardella.
The appointment of a foreigner to such a senior public-sector post is
unprecedented in Italy. It reflects the deep difficulties in which Ilva,
which lost L1,750bn (Dollars 1.1bn) in the first eleven months of 1992, now
finds itself.
In 1991, Ilva reported a loss before minority interests of L498bn, after
putting aside L411bn in extraordinary gains in a special restructuring fund.
Mr Nakamura, currently the representative in Italy of Nippon Steel, is one
of just a handful of Japanese executives with a close knowledge of the
Italian market, especially the state sector. He was closely involved in the
mid-1970s in the extension of the Taranto integrated steel plant, Italy's
biggest, and also worked with Ilva on its Novi Ligure rolled coils facility.
One of his first tasks will be to prepare a restructuring plan for the
group, which has been devastated by the fall in European steel prices and
extremely heavy debts, believed to have reached L8,300bn last year.
Last November, IRI, the state holding company which controls Ilva, called on
its management to propose a new restructuring plan by mid-1993. The surprise
resignation of Mr Gambardella and other senior board members, coming just a
day before IRI examined Ilva's 1992 accounts, may have been linked to the
fact that its financial performance was found to have deteriorated beyond
even the worse expectations.
Ilva's new management have only limited room for manoeuvre. After embarking
on a highly aggressive expansion drive under Mr Gambardella in the late
1980s, Ilva, which rose from the ashes of the loss-making Finsider state
steel group, was forced to trim its sails in the face of high debts and
increasingly difficult market conditions.

FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: Chile proposes reform of capital
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHILE will today send a draft bill to Congress aimed at implementing the
'deepest and most complete reform to the domestic capital markets' since the
early 1980s.
The reforms aim to widen the investment horizons of private pension funds
and insurance companies, which manage Dollars 15bn-worth of funds, almost 45
per cent of Chilean gross domestic product.
The legislation, which has been two years in the making, is long overdue.
Private pension funds, known as AFPs, are growing at Dollars 200m a month
and have often complained about the dearth of investment options in Chile.
Under the proposed legislation, AFPs will be allowed to diversify their
equity portfolios and invest in new instruments such as securitised bonds
and the closed-end Entrepreneurial Development Funds.
They will be allowed to invest in shares and corporate bonds abroad.
At present, their foreign investment is restricted to AAA rated bank debt
and gilt-edged securities.
Mr Alejandro Foxley, the Chilean finance minister, told a news conference
the reforms had become imperative because pension funds were accruing so
quickly. Government projections estimate AFPs will be handling domestic
savings worth 90 per cent of GDP by the turn of the century.
Mr Foxley expects Congress will approve the capital market reforms within
two to three months.
Senior advisers to the finance ministry say US companies are particularly
interested in launching the securitisation business in Chile.
The reforms have called upon some elements of US trustee legislation in the
introduction revenue bonds for the finance of large infrastructure projects.
Under this scheme, the money raised by bond issuers is managed by a trustee
which disburses funds as the project develops.
The finance ministry sees revenue bonds as an important vehicle for
substituting foreign finance for big projects. Endesa, the biggest
privatised utility in Chile, is said to be planning a Dollars 70m issue to
help finance its Dollars 450m Pangue hydroelectric dam.
Insurance companies will be allowed to invest up to 15 per cent of their
funds in foreign equity and bonds and in the derivatives markets at home and
abroad.

FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: Benetton may float clothing arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BENETTON, the Italian clothing group, may float its new Sportsystem sports
goods and clothing arm on to the stock market. It could happen within the
next two to three years, according to Mr Silvano Storer, a senior group
executive.
The company, which had sales of Dollars 608m last year, expects to be one of
the world's top sports equipment groups by 1995, when sales should reach
Dollars 1bn. At present the sports goods market is dominated by Nike,
Reebok, Adidas and Mizuno of Japan.
Benetton has identified sports as the next big growth area in retailing.'
Sports today are a keystone to leisure time activities and will continue to
gain greater importance in everyone's life', said Mr Gilberto Benetton,
chairman of Benetton Sportsystem.
The forecast came as Benetton displayed together for the first time the 10
brands acquired over the past three years.
The subsidiaries, assembled under the new Benetton Sportsystem holding
company, include Nordica ski boots, Prince tennis racquets and Rollerblade
in-line roller skates.
Sales for the group, which has now achieved its first aim of building up a
portfolio of leading sports brands, would exceed Dollars 700m this year,
said Mr Storer.
The range covers winter and summer sports, but is still under-represented in
footwear and clothing, two activities being developed internally.
A flotation could allow the company, owned by Edizione Holding, the Benetton
family's ultimate holding company, to copy the success of Benetton, which
has around 20 per cent of its shares listed.
The proceeds from a quotation would be used to repay debt.
The remainder could be channelled into further purchases, or, possibly, a
retail sports goods chain akin to that of Benetton in clothing.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ENI, the Italian industrial group, and Petroleos de Venezuela, the
Venezuelan state oil group, have agreed to build a Dollars 360m methanol
plant in Venezuela, with Chemical Bank of the US and Banca Commerciale
Italiana of Italy providing part of the equity for the project.
The industrial partners and the participating banks yesterday signed a total
of Dollars 206m of debt financing facilities for the project. Under the
agreement, a total equity component of Dollars 142m for Supermetanol will be
provided, with Ecofuel and Pequiven each subscribing Dollars 49m, while
Chemical Bank and BCI will each subscribe Dollars 22m.
BCI and Chemical said the Dollars 22m equity component represents a
conversion of Venezuelan state debt which the banks had acquired through the
1989 restructuring of Venezuelan state debt.
The debt finance facilities also include a L145bn (Dollars 99m) export
credit facility, a Dollars 68.4m Euroloan facility, and a Dollars 47m term
financing provided by Corporacion Andina de Fomento.
The Supermetanol project has been set up by Ecofuel, a subsidiary of the ENI
group which manufactures MTBE (a high octane product), and Pequiven, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Venezuelan state oil group. The Supermetanol
plant is expected to have an annual capacity of 670,000 tonnes of methanol,
a component of MTBE.

FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas to axe jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MCDONNELL Douglas, the US aerospace and defence group headed by chairman Mr
John McDonnell, has announced plans to cut 4,000 jobs from its workforce
because of slowing demand for commercial jet aircraft.
The job cuts, which will be achieved through attrition and lay-offs, will
all come at Douglas Aircraft, the group's commercial aircraft manufacturing
unit based in Long Beach, California.
Mr John Thom, a spokesman for McDonnell Douglas, explained: 'We'll be
building fewer aircraft, so we'll need fewer people.' The cuts will leave
the commercial aircraft division with a total workforce of about 15,000
people.
The measures are being taken because of depressed orders from the airline
industry. The drop in demand has forced the company this year to reduce
planned production of its MD-80 aircraft by about half and production of its
MD-11 jet by almost a third.
The job and production cuts will not affect McDonnell Douglas's military
aircraft division, which was split from the commercial aircraft business in
a restructuring last year.
The announcement of the latest job cuts came the day after McDonnell Douglas
reported a sharp drop in 1992 profits.
However, the company, was upbeat last week about the long-term outlook for
earnings, predicting that the C-17 military transport aircraft would become
profitable this year, that its wide-body MD-11 jetliner would generate a
positive cash-flow, that margins on core businesses would rise, and that the
group's debt would be cut by Dollars 1bn in 1993 through asset sales and use
of existing cash reserves.

FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: OMV to reduce dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OMV, the Austrian oil refining and chemicals group warns that it will show a
loss for last year of about Sch300m (Dollars 26.3m) rather than break-even
as the company had anticipated in November.
The company said it would cut its dividend for the full year, proposing a
pay-out of 15 per cent of its share capital, compared with a dividend of
Sch20 per share in 1991.
OMV has introduced further cost-cutting measures on top of the 900 job cuts
made last year. The company said it would cut investment to Sch4bn from
Sch6bn in 1992 as well as continuing to cut staffing levels.
It made a loss of Sch383m in the first nine months of last year, but
expected an improvement in the fourth quarter.

FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: Peugeot aims for larger market
share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PEUGEOT aims to increase its share of a falling European market this year,
after losing ground in its home base of France in 1992, Mr Jacques Calvet,
president, claimed yesterday.
Mr Calvet said that his company would this year have the new models to
launch under both its Peugeot and Citroen brands that it lacked last year
and that therefore its share of the west European car market should rise to
about 13 per cent from the 12.2 per cent of last year.
He gave no indication of the Peugeot results for 1992, after a first half in
which the company reported profits of FFr2.3bn, (Dollars 420m) down from
FFr2.7bn in the same period of 1991.
However, Mr Calvet estimated that overall west European car sales would be 5
per cent lower this year than last year, following an unpromising start this
month.
He was not as pessimistic as the CEA, the European carmaker association,
which was predicting a 7.5 per cent in European car sales this year.
However, Mr Calvet characteristically predicted that the European Commission
would have great difficulty in reaching agreement with Japan on the latter's
car exports to the community.

Mr Barry Giddings has resigned as chief executive of Harrison Industries,
the debt-laden doors and castings supplier, after a boardroom wrangle over
the group's consolidation or expansion as it struggles to return to
profitability.
Harrison announced that Mr Giddings had left 'due to a difference of opinion
over the future strategy of the group', adding 'the company retains the full
support of its bankers and advisers', namely the Bank of Scotland, Hambros
Bank and house brokers Williams de Broe.
Mr Giddings took control of Harrison in December 1991 in a Pounds 14m
reverse take-over. At the time he said he would expand the group's
industrial interests by moving into environmental security and general
engineering; plans he pursued.

The battle for control of Arthur Shaw, the loss-making West Midlands
building materials group quoted on the USM, has moved into the courts.
Mr Gordon Pearson, chairman, told his board that he obtained a High Court
injunction in Birmingham preventing two former directors, Mr Donald Crammond
and Mr Ian Tickler, the ex-chairman, from being re-appointed.
Rebel shareholders have called for an extraordinary meeting to remove Mr
Pearson and replace him with Mr Tickler. They also want Mr Crammond, who was
ousted last August, re-appointed. Shareholders representing 49 per cent of
the equity are said to be supporting the move.
Mr Tickler and his family, which founded Shaw, own 13.4 per cent of the
equity while Mr Pearson holds 15 per cent.

FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: Shute buys 4.9% stake in Anglia
Secure for Pounds 72,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROGER SHUTE, the convalescent ex-chairman of BM Group, the industrial
concern, has taken a stake in a second quoted company. His interest again
sparked a sharp increase in the target's share price.
Anglia Secure Homes, which builds and manages sheltered housing for the
elderly, saw its price rise from 4 1/2 p to 7 1/2 p after it disclosed that
Mr Shute had acquired a 4.9 per cent interest - 1.6m shares costing Pounds
72,000.
This followed the news that he had taken a similar stake in GM Firth, the
steel company, and there is talk of him joining its board as a
non-executive.
In Anglia's case, Mr Shute's interest seems to be speculative. He said the
management was strong and aggressive and he might be seen as a passive
investor in an industry that 'is just about to come out of the bottom of the
cycle'.
Anglia lost Pounds 5.08m in the six months to March last year and Mr James
Bryant, finance director, said losses had continued in the second half.
At the interim stage net borrowings remained almost three times
shareholders' funds of Pounds 10.8m. Mr Bryant said the group had 250 unsold
homes, but on the other hand, its management subsidiary had performed well.
Its bankers remained 'understanding'.
Mr Shute's return to the quoted company scene follows six months of
convalescence from lung disease. He remains president of BM, which he
founded, until July, when the post will be reviewed. He said his paper
losses on BM shares ran to about Pounds 3m.

FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: Two more Lilley businesses sold
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RECEIVERS to Lilley, the Glasgow-based contracting and construction group,
sold two businesses to a management buy-out team over the weekend.
Cowcaddens-based MDW and Meadowline Services were sold to a team led by Mr
Bill Shearer, the managing director, and financed by the Bank of Scotland,
3i and Scottish Enterprise.
Negotiations on the buy-out were completed within a week and the move will
safeguard the jobs of the 265-strong workforce.
Price Waterhouse, the receivers, also confirmed that a number of large
contracts within Lilley's Scottish-based National Contracting Division have
been sold to Amec, the construction group.
Last week the receivers also sold the business and most of the contract
assets of Hatfield Construction to TA Bickerton, an independent builder
based in St Albans, Hertfordshire.
Bickerton is owned by Mr Ken Wilkins, who founded Hatfield Construction and
sold it three years ago to Lilley, which wanted to complement its network in
the south of England. Mr Wilkins said Hatfield had always remained
profitable and would now be restructured as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Bickerton.

THE ASSOCIATION of Investment Trust Companies, the industry trade
association, said it will admit as members offshore closed-end funds and is
seeking tax changes to make them more attractive to investors.
The rule change will allow 15 to 20 new firms to join immediately,
increasing the AITC membership from its current level of 231 members.
Many of these are single country funds which allow investors access to
foreign stock markets which they would have difficulty accessing. Also, some
of the funds are investing in bonds which UK investment trusts are currently
barred from holding in significant quantities.
The AITC said it had barred the firms - which are an increasingly
significant portion of the investment trusts with London Stock Exchange
listings - because the UK definition of a closed-end investment company is
particularly narrow and stops companies from ever repurchasing their own
shares.
An increasing number of closed-end companies are being established offshore
for fiscal or regulatory reasons and many do not entirely meet the UK
definition, the AITC said.
To be eligible for AITC membership, a company must have a London listing,
must be marketable in the UK and will regard EC citizens as a 'substantial
part' of their natural shareholders, the trade organisation said.
Among the tax changes sought by the AITC on behalf of closed-end funds are
an end to the distinction in the way capital gains on stocks and bonds held
in investment trusts are taxed. While the capital gains on equities are
untaxed, the capital gains on bonds are taxed.
The AITC is also calling for the gains earned on futures, options and
warrants held by investment trust to be treated as capital gains and
therefore, untaxed.

FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: Merlin Green asking for split
capital status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERLIN International Green Investment Trust is proposing a restructuring in
an attempt to eliminate the discount to net assets at which its shares
trade.
Under the proposals Merlin will become a split capital trust, with new
classes of zero coupon preference and ordinary shares, and a wind-up date of
2001. The hope is that investors will be attracted by the tax advantages of
the new shares and this, combined with the prospect of a wind-up date when
assets will be repaid, will eliminate the discount.
Its shares traded at an average 23 per cent discount last year; many split
trusts trade at a premium to net assets.
The zeros will pay no income but will have first claim on the assets, and
offer the prospect of capital gain. Based on an illustrative initial value
of 57.5p and redemption value of 112.3p, gross redemption yield will be 8.6
per cent.
Ordinary shares will receive all the income but will only be repaid after
the zeros have been met in full. They are, therefore, a highly-geared
investment. The expected initial dividend yield will be 11.3 per cent gross.
Existing shareholders will be offered units on a one-for-one basis; each
unit will comprise one zero and new ordinary share. Terms of the existing
warrants will be changed so that warrant holders will be entitled to
subscribe for one unit at 100p.
The proposals will need the 75 per cent approval of shareholders and warrant
holders at a meeting on February 16; Merlin already has support from 46.5
per cent of the shares and 20.7 per cent of the warrants.

FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: Better return from small
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENTS in small companies are likely to outperform those in their
larger counterparts, according to two new surveys.
According to stockbrokers Hoare Govett, who compile the Hoare Govett Smaller
Companies Index, prices are expected to rise by 20 per cent in the coming
year, outperforming the anticipated rise in the FTSE index of only 12.4 per
cent.
Meanwhile, accountants Stoy Hayward, who compile their own Private Company
Price Index - which largely consists of smaller companies - found that
prices paid to acquire smaller companies rose steadily relative to earnings
during 1992, a trend expected to continue into 1993.
The average price paid for a private company in the UK was 9.5 times
earnings in the fourth quarter last year, against 8.3 times in the
comparative period of 1991.
At the end of 1992, the Private Company Index stood at a 43 per cent
discount to price/earnings ratio of the FT 500 - the widest level in recent
years - highlighting the differences in sentiment between investors in
leading quoted companies and those in the smaller company sector.
Mr Rick Sopher, corporate finance partner at Stoy Hayward, said current
price anomalies make it very attractive for small private companies to be
acquired by quoted ones. Institutional shareholders, however, have been
unwilling to support the acquisition ambitions of smaller quoted companies,
so they are losing out on the chance to bolster earnings through relatively
low-cost acquisitions.
Meanwhile, research from Hoare Govett shows that the smaller companies
sector in December 1992 turned in the best performance since June 1987. The
Small Companies Index has risen by 28 per cent since last September's Black
Wednesday, well ahead of the 16 per cent rise in the FTSE 100.
Since the beginning of September, the FTSE has fallen 1.5 per cent while the
HGSCI has risen 14.3 per cent.

FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: 'Stronger' Barratt has rating
upgraded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARRATT Developments, Britain's third largest housebuilder, has become the
first company in the construction sector to have its ratings raised by IBCA,
the credit rating agency.
The agency said it had lifted Barratt's long term rating to BB- from B, and
its short term rating from C to B. Despite the change Barratt's rating
remains at speculative grade since BBB- is the lowest investment grade
rating.
IBCA noted that trading in the current year remained very difficult despite
favourable moves in interest rates and more affordable house prices.
However the agency noted that under the chairmanship of its founder, Sir
Lawrie Barratt, who was brought out of retirement to rescue Barratt, the
group had returned to 'a stronger financial position with debt significantly
reduced at year-end and a return to a small pre-tax profit in the UK,
despite continuing difficulties in the Canadian market.'
The agency also noted that problems in the housebuilding and property
sectors in the past three years had been a significant contributor to the
steady downward trend in the debt ratings of both banks and building
societies. But it also pointed out that there were 'some recent indications
from estate agents that the residential housing market has started to
improve.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Economics Notebook: A single bullet can't kill Brazil's
inflationary tiger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the war against inflation in Brazil, a minor battle was won last week.
Agreement by a special session of Congress over a new tax on financial
transactions is forecast to raise Dollars 7.2bn (Pounds 4.7bn) to help plug
the government's budget deficit.
Yet, although helpful, the move will do little to address Brazil's long-term
inflation problem. That will require a shake-up of the government. That only
appears possible when the 1988 constitution comes up for review by Congress
next September.
Inflation in Brazil has been above 20 per cent for 14 months now. The
country has suffered triple-digit annual inflation for 10 years; last year
it stood at 1,149 per cent.
Brazil's inflation contrasts with the rest of Latin America. In the region
as a whole excluding Brazil, average inflation was 21 per cent last year
against 1,203 per cent in 1989.
Insights about why inflation in Brazil is so tenacious are contained in a
working paper from the World Bank's policy research department* which covers
recent hyperinflation in Argentina, Peru and Brazil.
It cites evidence that high inflation degenerated into hyperinflation in
these three countries in the late 1980s not because their chronic budget
deficits somehow got sharply worse. Neither did hyperinflation - at least in
Argentina and Brazil - take off without any prior surge in money supply as
one would expect from examining the 'classic' hyperinflations of Poland,
Austria and Germany in the 1920s and of Bolivia in the early 1980s.
Instead, hyperinflation was the culmination of a variety of factors:
worsening fiscal accounts, a growing tendency to accept high inflation, and
increased financial fragility. This was complicated by limited access to
external finance because of the debt crisis, weak monetary and fiscal
control and the limited availability of non-inflationary domestic financing
to the government.
Financial fragility stemmed from the impact over time of high inflation on
the willingness to hold money. In Brazil, M1 dropped from 14 per cent of
gross domestic product in 1970 to just 3 per cent in the late 1980s. That
meant, for example, that if the central bank had printed money to offset a
shortfall of taxes of 3 per cent of GDP in the late 1980s, it would have
doubled money supply. The authors conclude hyperinflation came about because
of recurrent failed stabilisation attempts which created instability in the
rate of change of inflation.
Furthermore, after the 'new' hyperinflations, 'restoring price stability has
been longer and more costly than in the classical cases'. This was because
it was not clear in the public mind where inflation would settle once
hyperinflation had stopped, experience showing that it fell back to the high
levels prevailing before hyperinflation. The battle to beat inflation thus
had to continue for longer.
Hyperinflations themselves must come to an end because they are
unsustainable. Government revenues collapse, production and most commerce
stop. They can usually be brought down through an orthodox economic
programme which indicates a 'change of regime' - a strong indication to the
public that the factors creating hyperinflation had ceased to exist.
However, in high inflation economies it was much more difficult to
demonstrate that a change of regime had taken place sufficient to bring
price stability.
In Argentina, two stabilisation programmes - the Austral plan in 1985 and
the Primavera plan in 1988 - had initial success in bringing down inflation.
But by mid-1989, inflation was approaching 200 per cent a month. The
so-called Bunge &amp; Born plan ended it, but inflation persisted at about 5 per
cent monthly. A new price explosion in December 1989 prompted the Bonex
plan, aimed at reducing the government's domestic debt.
A further plan was required in April 1991, which along with subsequent
supportive measures has succeeded in pushing price increases down much
closer to international levels.
The plan, named after the economy minister Domingo Cavallo, fixed by law the
exchange rate to the dollar and instituted a fiscal reform that went further
than anything previously announced. The central bank was forbidden by law to
print money, except when backed by hard currency reserves,
The fiscal adjustment was reinforced over time with privatisations,
rationalisation of public spending and better enforcement of tax collection.
The lesson here, say the authors, is that stabilisation efforts -
macroeconomic reforms to bring the budget into line - and structural reforms
 -aimed at improving the allocation of resources within the economy -
strongly complement one another. Together, they send 'a stronger signal
regarding the direction in which the economy is moving,' say the authors.
There are useful lessons in this for Peru and Brazil, the authors say. In
Brazil, they argue that the second inflationary shock plan in January 1991
of the government of President Fernando Collor - who promised to slay the
inflationary tiger with a single bullet - sent just the kind of mixed
signals that Argentina has managed to avoid.
The orthodox message of deepening the fiscal adjustment by dealing with the
finances and debt overhang of the state and local governments was
compromised by accompanying wage and price controls (which had failed in the
past) and by moves to regulate financial markets.
The authors have not had time to address the new policies of President
Itamar Franco who took over the presidency from the deposed Mr Collor last
month. Yet already conflicting signals are being sent. True Mr Franco has
his tax changes, which may help him in his talks over the next few months
with the International Monetary Fund, but he is also talking about expanding
spending in other areas. The message being sent so far is equivocal to say
the least. Expectations that inflation will drop rapidly therefore seem set
to be disappointed.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Westpac recruits executive from US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTPAC, the troubled Australian bank, yesterday appointed a US banker as
chief executive, with a brief to restore the bank to health by cutting costs
and reducing risk-bearing assets.
Mr John Uhrig, chairman, said Mr Robert Joss, 51, a vice-chairman of Wells
Fargo, the Californian investment bank, would take over as managing director
next month.
He replaces Mr Frank Conroy, who resigned last month after resisting
pressure from leading shareholders to speed up a restructuring programme
announced in November.
Mr Joss was one of two candidates shortlisted by Westpac. Mr Lindsay Pyne,
the former managing director of the Bank of New Zealand, was favoured by
some executives because of his knowledge of Australian banking.
Mr Joss said he wanted Westpac to concentrate on its retail business, which
has suffered significant losses as a result of corporate bad debts and
falling property values.
'I think one of the problems with Westpac is that it had lost its focus for
a while, and I will be aiming to sharpen everyone's view and help build
morale,' he said.
The bank's problems climaxed in November when it announced a record loss of
ADollars 1.5bn (Pounds 670m) for the year, after bad debts of ADollars 2.6bn
and an unexpected US tax liability of ADollars 106m. Five directors,
including the then chairman, resigned after a ADollars 1.2bn rights issue
was largely ignored by shareholders.

FT  25 JAN 93 / O&amp;Y set to confront unsecured creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York is heading for a confrontation with a key group of unsecured
creditors in Toronto this afternoon. The outcome could determine whether the
ailing property developer can emerge from the court protection which it
sought last May.
According to lawyers for the lenders, O&amp;Y refused to agree during
last-minute negotiations on Friday to at least one demand by the creditors
for changes to its restructuring plan.
By the end of last week, 22 out of 35 creditor groups had accepted O&amp;Y's
proposals, while eight rejected them. All five remaining meetings are due to
reconvene today after earlier adjournments. The plan covers about CDollars
8.5bn (Pounds 4.33bn) of O&amp;Y's CDollars 13.5bn debt.
The groups which have so far turned down O&amp;Y's proposals are not expected to
imperil the plan as a whole.
But approval by the unsecured group, consisting mainly of North American,
European and Japanese banks, is crucial to the restructuring effort. Unlike
most of the lenders, whose claims are against specific O&amp;Y assets, the
unsecured creditors have claims totalling about CDollars 4bn against the
parent company, Olympia &amp; York Developments.
The key remaining sticking point is understood to be O&amp;Y's demand that
creditors grant every member of the Reichmann family, which owns O&amp;Y, a
sweeping release from future legal claims. According to an O&amp;Y information
circular posted to creditors last month, disputes or litigation later on
'would defeat the intent of the plan'. The lenders have so far insisted that
the releases should be limited to specific transactions.

FT  25 JAN 93 / US groups burn their fingers in financial services: Martin
Dickson and Nikki Tait analyse a series of disposals stemming from heavy
losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A quiet but significant shake-up is taking place in some of the less
glamorous reaches of the US financial services industry as some of America's
top industrial companies withdraw from the area, often with fingers burnt.
The latest example is Xerox, the document processing group, which this week
announced plans to shed its remaining insurance and financial services
businesses, with a fourth-quarter after-tax charge of Dollars 778m (Pounds
500m) to pay for it.
Businesses on the block include Furman Selz, a New York brokerage house,
Crum and Forster, a property-casualty operation; and Xerox Life, a life
insurance and annuity business.
Xerox is not alone. Weyerhaeuser, the forest products group, is selling its
wholesale annuity and mutual funds business to GE Capital, the financial
services arm of the General Electric group. Kodak has announced plans to
sell its equipment leasing business - also to GE Capital - while
Westinghouse Electric says it will quit financial services.
The biggest sale of all involves Sears Roebuck, the retailer, which is
spinning off much of its financial services arm, including a minority stake
in Allstate, one of the largest property-casualty operations in the US.
Several factors lie behind the disposals. The most dramatic is poor
management. Amid the booming financial services markets of the 1980s,
numerous industrial companies expanded into the area, often as a by-product
of their core business.
But some got out of their depth and were ill-prepared for the downturn in
the business cycle in the late 1980s. Westinghouse, for example, ended up
investing in the most speculative type of cheap hotel property. Such
companies are now having to withdraw from financial services to stop the
sector casting a permanent pall over the entire group. Others are cutting
back.
Kodak and Weyerhaeuser are both in the throes of restructurings. Sears has
faced shareholder agitation over the poor performance of its merchandise
operations.
Chrysler, the car group, which sold its consumer finance subsidiary last
November, has a very stretched balance sheet. So too does McDonnell Douglas,
the aerospace group which has been trimming down its finance operations.
But ITT, the conglomerate which this week announced a pre-tax charge of
nearly Dollars 1bn to restructure its finance arm, including heavy expected
losses in unsecured consumer loans, is in a different position. Since
finance and insurance now provide more than 50 per cent of its earnings, it
has no plan to withdraw from these areas but instead wants to refocus on
more profitable areas of growth.
The buyers of the cast-offs are an equally mixed bunch. They include banks,
finance houses and leveraged buy-outs involving managements of the
businesses concerned.
One of the most active is GE Capital. Like many of the operations being
sold, it originated as an adjunct to GE's industrial businesses but took off
in the 1980s with rapid growth in its own right.
Unlike some rivals, its profits growth has remained strong enabling it now
to cherry-pick assets from distressed sellers.
The US insurance industry also accounts for part of the turnover in
financial services operations. Its travails fall into two categories.
For life companies, difficulties have arisen principally on the investment
side. At end-September, the life industry overall held about 18.4 per cent
of assets - some Dollars 300bn - in property or mortgage loans. It needs to
bolster reserves against falling property values and/or delinquent loans.
By contrast, the property-casualty industry has faced an appalling year for
catastrophic events. The New York-based Insurance Services Office, including
a probably outdated figure of Dollars 10.7bn for Hurricane Andrew,
calculates total catastrophe losses in 1992 reached Dollars 18.2bn.
These problems follow some well-publicised insurance company failures - like
that of Executive Life in Los Angeles.
The bottom line is that many insurance operations are being pressed to
strengthen their balance sheets - making them less attractive as peripheral
holdings to non-insurance parent companies, and prompting the sale of
non-core businesses, often in the financial services sector, by insurers
themselves.
On the latter score, Travelers, the Hartford-based composite is probably the
most striking example. It has sold Dillon Read, its investment banking
subsidiary, Keystone, a mutual fund business, and Travelers Mortgage
Services, a home loans operation, to raise capital.
The situation at Aetna has been broadly similar - with 43 per cent of La
Estrella, the Spanish insurer, sold to Banco Hispano Americano for Dollars
100m, and the Dollars 1.21bn sale of its American Reinsurance subsidiary to
Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts, the buy-out specialists, for Dollars 1.4bn.
In the other direction, the Hurricane Andrew losses faced by Allstate - more
than Dollars 1bn - almost certainly compounded the pressures for capital
within Sears, Roebuck. This obliged the company to choose between funding
the required overhaul of its retail business and expanding the financial
services division.
Transamerica, the San Francisco-based financial services group, also cited
conflicting demands on capital as the reason behind its decision to dispose
of its property-casualty operations.
'We face demands for increased capital to support growth in many of our
businesses,' said Mr Frank Herringer, chief executive. In view of this 'we
have elected to focus our resources on our life insurance and finance
businesses'.

FT  25 JAN 93 / JCI may bid for 29.9% of Johnson Matthey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHANNESBURG Consolidated Investments, the South African mining company, has
emerged as a bidder for up to 29.9 per cent of Johnson Matthey, the precious
metals group, held by Charter Consolidated, the UK industrial conglomerate.
Charter, which is advised by the merchant bank Hambros, is trying to sell
38.4 per cent of Johnson Matthey in total.
JCI, which is 40 per cent owned by Anglo-American, the South African holding
company, and 8 per cent by the De Beers group, is a holding company whose
assets include a 32.6 per cent stake in Rustenberg, the world's biggest
platinum producer, with whom Johnson Matthey has a joint venture.
Rustenberg was ruled out as a potential purchaser because of likely
anti-trust regulatory concerns which would follow from its increased control
of the world's platinum supply.
Industry analysts note that the purchase of the stake by JCI has commercial
logic for both parties. JCI already markets its platinum through Johnson
Matthey.
Meanwhile, Johnson Matthey's shares rose last week on speculation that
Charter has been approached by a company seeking to purchase its entire 38.4
per cent block of Johnson Matthey shares.
Any such purchaser would be required to bid for all of Johnson Matthey under
UK Takeover Panel rules.
Sources familiar with the talks said that at least one other potential
purchaser of Charter's Johnson Matthey shares has emerged, but would not say
if that buyer is seeking the entire block or the 8.5 per cent portion which
JCI does not intend to purchase.
A sale of a 29.9 per cent stake to JCI is thought to be acceptable to
Johnson Matthey because JCI is believed to have indicated it has no
intention of bidding for the entire company.
Johnson Matthey's management is reported to be determined to remain
independent.
Meanwhile, analysts believe that Charter may use proceeds of the Johnson
Matthey sale to repurchase the 36 per cent stake in itself currently held by
Minorco, the European-based investment arm of Anglo-American.
Anglo-American's stake in Charter reflected its desire to hold an investment
in the platinum industry.
Without the Johnson Matthey stake, Charter no longer has exposure to that
sector and Anglo-American may be prepared to sever its links with Charter if
a price can be agreed for the Minorco shares.
If it does not repurchase its own shares, analysts said that Charter would
be under pressure to distribute proceeds of the sale to shareholders as a
special dividend.

FT  25 JAN 93 / PM plans further export-drive trips to boost jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR is planning further overseas trips with UK businessmen as part
of efforts to boost exports in an attempt to tackle unemployment at home.
His initiative follows a trip to India, begun at the weekend, which shows
signs of winning business for British industry.
Mr Major is understood to consider such visits, where a delegation of senior
executives travels with the prime minister, as useful in attracting orders.
Privately, Mr Major has talked of a 'new language' between industry and
government.
Senior businessmen have been asked to travel with Mr Major to Japan later
this year, the second such foreign trip he will have undertaken since
becoming prime minister.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
said the programme of economic reform adopted by India offered great
potential for British business.
Stressing the significance of Mr Major's presence, he described a meeting
between Britain's delegation and eight of India's most senior civil servants
as 'unprecedented'.
'That would not have happened - or nothing like it - were it not for the
fact that the prime minister was here.'
Mr Major dismissed as 'misguided' criticism that he should have stayed in
the UK to concentrate on domestic problems. 'Exports abroad mean jobs at
home,' he said.
The prime minister will today oversee the signing of a double taxation
treaty between with India, preventing profits of companies trading in both
countries from being taxed twice.
He has also told businessmen accompanying him that government-supported
export credit insurance to India will be reviewed, possibly by the start of
the next financial year.
The 17-strong team of UK businessmen met Indian counterparts and government
officials yesterday as it emerged that British companies were close to
completing contracts worth more than Pounds 100m for power station projects.
Separately, Cadbury Schweppes, the confectionery, food and soft drinks
group, is to increase its investment in India by about Pounds 6m, reversing
past divestment precipitated by India's now-abandoned regulations on foreign
ownership. Other projects are expected to be announced by British Gas.
But little, if any, headway, appeared to have been made in assuaging UK
companies' fears over exchange convertibility and India's labour laws.
British businessmen have also floated the idea of establishing a new
Anglo-Indian partnership to help regain some of the ground lost in recent
years to US and Japanese competitors.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Employers' optimism grows but fears of staff cuts remain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPTIMISM IN British industry has increased sharply over the past three
months but the outlook for investment and jobs remains bleak, according to
the latest quarterly industrial trends survey from the Confederation of
British Industry.
The survey, to be published today, shows that the number of companies which
are more optimistic about the general business situation than four months
ago exceeds the pessimistic by 11 percentage points.
In the last survey, taken around the time of September's currency crisis,
pessimists out-numbered optimists by 23 points.
The findings set a hopeful tone ahead of other economic indicators due this
week. However, trade data on Thursday are likely to show imports exceeding
exports by more than Pounds 1bn, while money supply figures out today are
unlikely to show a clear recovery trend.
The CBI survey says that companies expect a small rise in output in the
months ahead. Expectations are polled monthly by the CBI and the latest
survey found a positive balance of 2 percentage points in companies
expecting output to rise in the next four months against a balance of minus
7 points in December.
The survey found that the number reporting increased export orders exceeded
those reporting a decrease by 18 percentage points this month. This compares
with a positive balance of just 6 points in October.
On exports, expectations remained optimistic: the balance of companies
positive about export prospects over the coming year was 19 percentage
points against a positive balance of 20 points in October.
The CBI report confirms the growth of business optimism shown in other
recent surveys and this part of its findings will be welcomed by the
government.
However, revival of optimism and exports has not translated into any
willingness to increase staff or investments. This will increase pressure on
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to cut interest rates and craft his March
16 Budget with the aim of helping industry and creating jobs.
The number of companies expecting job cuts exceeds those planning to take on
staff by 35 percentage points: down only slightly from October's negative
balance of 42 points.
Investment intentions show some signs of recovery but remain weak. On
balance, the number of companies planning to cut spending on plant and
machinery in the next 12 months exceeds the number planning an increase by 7
percentage points compared with a negative balance of 18 points in October.
There are signs that more companies have been trying to increase their
prices in January in line with the seasonal trend.

FT  25 JAN 93 / German pay talks break off amid warnings on inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS between the German government and the oTV public sector trade union
broke down at the weekend amid warnings that the inflation rate would
continue to climb, delaying a cut in interest rates, unless wage rises were
kept to just 2.25 per cent.
Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister and the government's chief
negotiator in the pay talks, said inflation could rise above 4 per cent
unless wage rises were controlled.
The union has insisted on a 5 per cent increase, as well as a shorter
working week 'of about 35 hours'.
Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies, head of the oTV, said the government's unwillingness
to compromise, coupled with the unveiling last week of a draft solidarity
pact between the states, central government and unions, which aims to slash
public spending to finance the cost of German unification, could lead to
'conflict'.
Inflation in Germany stands at about 3.8 per cent but had been forecast to
stay at or below 4 per cent this year.
In a letter to Mr Wolfgang Schauble, leader of the ruling Christian
Democratic Union and Christian Social Union parliamentary group, Ms
Wulf-Mathies said the solidarity pact was 'unfair and unbalanced'.
Mr Seiters said each percentage point wage increase would cost the taxpayer
DM4bn (Pounds 1.64bn). Economists also believe the oTV wage demand could
delay moves by the Bundesbank to lower interest rates, which German industry
and the economic institutes are demanding.
The outcome of the pay negotiations, which resume on February 3, will be
watched closely by the unions in the five states of east Germany. Although
the west German unions are committed to wage parity with their eastern
German counterparts by 1994, the consensus among economic institutes is that
individual enterprises will opt for jobs, and not income.
For example, Opel, the car manufacturer, which is building a new plant at
Eisenach in east Germany, has not joined the federal employees' association.
This means it can negotiate separate wage contracts.
'With labour costs 80 per cent higher in east Germany than west Germany,
when productivity and wage levels are taken into account, enterprises will
want to try and attract both foreign and west German investment through
lower wages,' said one economist.

FT  25 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: UK property
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton's days as governor of the Bank of England may be
drawing to a close. But, judging by his musings on the reform of commercial
property leases last week, he is using them to provoke uncharacteristic
controversy. By criticising 'inflationary' upwards-only rent reviews, he
questioned one of the property sector's most cherished practices. He was
right to do so. The UK's antiquated terms for commercial leases desperately
need reforming. But it would be unwise to neglect the risks involved in
over-hasty action.
As property developers never tire of pointing out, investors in bricks and
mortar are primarily interested in security of income. Any reforms that
lessen that security will have to be paid for in higher rents. That in
itself would be inflationary. But lesser security would also discourage
further property development. That is hardly a problem at present, but it
too would be likely to stoke inflationary fires in an economic upswing when
demand outstrips supply.
The market itself seems to be working towards a half-way house. Twenty-five
year leases with frequent break clauses for tenants are becoming common.
These allow rents to be periodically reset to prevailing market prices.
Tenants have greater flexibility, landlords some certainty of long term-term
income. If the market could also develop greater transparency in setting
rents, this might help flatten destructive cyclical swings.

FT  25 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Hafnia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The orderly queue of bidders forming for the various bits of Hafnia is not
as surprising as it looks. With group debt parked in the holding company,
the core Danish insurance operations look attractive. The disaster which
befell Hafnia had more to do with misguided corporate ambition than the
ability of Denmark's second largest insurer to make a decent return on
underwriting and investing. Even allowing that some business will have been
lost since the shares were suspended, the buyer should acquire a decent
market position.
The business should be worth more to a domestic competitor, who could use
the scope for rationalisation and synergies. On that basis Codan - in which
Sun Alliance has a majority stake - looks the most logical buyer. Skandia
might equally be prepared to pay a premium for the chance to repatriate the
15 per cent slice of its share capital held by Hafnia. Potentially
interested parties from outside Scandinavia, such as Allianz, are hardly
short of capital. But the most likely candidates are still digesting prey
from the last round of acquisitions.
It is less clear where a buyer for Hafnia's 34 per cent stake in Baltica
Holding might come from. Like Hafnia, the basic insurance business is sound
enough. But the holding company bears the scars of ill-fated ventures in
property and banking. Having seen the shares fall by some 80 per cent in the
last two years, Suez might just be tempted to add to its 23 per cent stake
and take control on the cheap. But that looks too tidy a solution for
Hafnia's creditors to hope for.

FT  25 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Rank Organisation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by Xerox to move out of financial services raises questions
about its joint venture with the Rank Organisation. Mr Paul Allaire, Xerox
chairman, came from Rank Xerox, and is anxious to focus his company's
business on its traditional document processing strength. He would have a
natural interest in buying out his UK partner in Rank Xerox. As for Rank,
this would be one way of reducing its Pounds 999m debt without affecting the
strategic direction of its managed businesses.
If Rank's share price has risen only modestly, it must be because the market
is aware of the formidable obstacles to such a convenient arrangement. Xerox
is carrying around Dollars 2.5bn of debt. Until it has disposed of its
financial services businesses, it could not afford the price, probably in
excess of Pounds 1bn, the Rank Xerox stake would command. So far it has
announced little more than a statement of intent. The whole process may take
a couple of years. Rank needs to make inroads into its debt rather sooner.
But the transfer of the stake does not need to take place all at once.
Perhaps the two companies should consider a piece-meal approach. Xerox could
either absorb parts of Rank Xerox business with Rank receiving a special
dividend in return. Or the stake could be transferred in more formal
tranches. Either approach would reassure investors worried that Rank's debt
will fall only slowly when trading profits start to improve. Were Xerox to
express an interest, Rank would not need the non-refundable deposit it has
promised to exact from the consortium that has been threatening to bid for
its film and television interests.

FT  25 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Coal not dole
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Conveniently for the government, Friday's report from the mining engineers
John T. Boyd gave structural support to the likely emergency exit route from
the coal fiasco. While the general economic case for closure and selection
of particular pits received backing, several pits could apparently be saved.
Some 15m tonnes of additional domestic coal could be burned if no further
gas-fired plant were ordered, no coal were imported and the electricity
generators' coal stocks were not run down as quickly as planned. That might
save around 12 pits, which, oddly enough, is about the number Boyd thinks
could be made profitable if they were subsidised whilst working practices
are changed.
By making clear that the coal is uneconomic, the report also removes risks
from the generators and regional electricity companies. They can hardly be
expected to bear the extra Pounds 200m cost. With the Treasury strapped for
cash, the subsidy will have to come from consumers.
Since public opposition forced the coal review, the government may be
tempted to make the costs as obvious as possible through a direct levy. To
avoid electricity bills rising, however, it might contrive to reduce the
current nuclear levy without substantially damaging Nuclear Electric. Such
an outcome would suit the generating companies, whose helpful attitude will
have earned them political brownie points, lessening the risk of a
Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry.
The RECs, however, risk squandering political advantage if they continue to
squabble about which of them should buy the extra coal-fired electricity.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Pit rescue plan nearly in place: Treasury ready to borrow to
meet costs of new coal subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY is reconciled to having to meet the cost of a pit rescue plan
through borrowing rather than passing on the bill for coal subsidies to
electricity consumers, it was claimed last night.
As Mr John Major interrupted his tour of India to play down reports of
internal cabinet wrangling over the rescue plan, officials in London
privately confirmed that an outline package is now close to conclusion.
However, the details as to how many pits might be saved, and at what cost,
are still the subject of debate as government business managers attempt to
calculate the minimum that needs to be done to prevent another humiliating
backbench rebellion. The final cost could add more than Pounds 100m to a
1993-94 public sector borrowing requirement already estimated by City
analysts at about Pounds 50bn.
One MP close to the debate estimated last night that, at the very least, 15
of the 31 pits earmarked for closure before the political storm broke last
October would need to be kept open if the government's Commons majority of
21 was to be adequate.
Speaking on BBC radio, the prime minister tacitly acknowledged that the
controversy had sparked a fierce debate at the highest level of government.
But he insisted ministers were united in their determination to create a
'sustainable' coal industry. 'One man's squabble is another man's
discussion,' he said.
Downing Street officials travelling with Mr Major said the main goal now was
'managing transition' to enable as many as possible of the 31 pits under
threat to improve their productivity in such a way as to become competitive
with world markets.
In London, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, also hinted
that a compromise deal was near. He told the BBC: 'If you give British Coal
a significant period of time and subsidise them through the process . . .
they may get to a point where they are competitive.' But he added: 'All
these options have a price tag.'
An important factor in the government's calculations comes later this week
when Mr Hesel-tine is presented with the report by the Commons trade and
industry select committee. The 11 MP members still have two final days of
deliberations before publishing what is being seen as one of the most
influential reports in recent years by a select committee.
The narrow Conservative majority and divisiveness of the pits issue mean Mr
Heseltine will have to adopt at least some of the committee's
recommendations if he is to steer his own proposals, due for publication
next month, through parliament.
Discussions in the select committee tomorrow and disagreements could delay
the report's publication beyond Friday, the expected date.

A 23-year-old Hawaiian, nom de guerre Akebono and otherwise known as Chad
Rowan, is apparently to be promoted to sumo's highest rank, yokozuna or
grand champion, ending a curious debate over whether wrestlers imported from
the US or elsewhere would be forever denied the exalted title.
Having won the latest Tokyo tournament, which finished yesterday, Akebono,
212kg and just over 2 metres tall, was told by serious-faced sumo officials
that a meeting later this week is likely to confirm his promotion. The same
serious-faced sumo officials had last year told another Hawaiian, Konishiki,
a not insignificant 261kg, that an important barrier to his promotion was a
lack of hinkaku.
Getting a precise definition of the all-important hinkaku was difficult, but
it means something like gravitas and something more than mere technique.
Whatever hinkaku is, Chad Rowan has it.

Council, is no stranger to the doings of London's loony left.
As a part-time thriller writer who has a taste for watching Hill Street
Blues, drinking Southern Comfort and smoking Camel Cigarettes, Arden loves
nothing better than investigating a good scandal. In the late 1980s he
reported on an alleged freemasonry racket in Hackney. His weighty tome
opened with the words: 'In the London Borough of Hackney, the buck is in
orbit.'
In Lambeth, it seems, it is in outer space.

FT  25 JAN 93 / The risks of regulating: The governor's supervisory
challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Brian Quinn, the Bank of England director in charge of banking
supervision, once said that the Bank was never praised for the fact that
most UK banks were run prudently and honestly. However, whenever a bank was
in difficulties or found to be corrupt, the Bank was blamed.
At the time, Mr Quinn was feeling bruised from the mauling the Bank received
from press and politicians for its supervision of the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International, the corrupt bank that was closed in mid-1991.
This mauling almost certainly ruled Mr Quinn out as the possible successor
to Mr Eddie George as deputy governor, though as the Bank's senior executive
director he would normally have been a leading contender for the post.
Mr George has not worked in the supervisory department, and therefore
escaped criticism in Lord Justice Bingham's report into the supervision of
BCCI, published last October. But he will face pressure as governor to take
a view on whether bank supervision should be separated into a new specialist
institution outside the Bank.
He seems ambivalent on whether such radical reform is necessary. He chose on
Friday to stress that the priority is to rebuild morale, which was damaged
by the BCCI criticism.
Lord Bingham found the Bank had been somewhat unprofessional, haphazard and
timid. A picture of an insufficiently rigorous approach was also drawn in
the recent report by Department of Trade and Industry inspectors into
National Westminster Bank's involvement in the Blue Arrow affair.
The DTI report was possibly the more revealing of the two, in that it gave a
rare description of the Bank's relationship with a leading UK bank, rather
than an unusually Byzantine foreign one like BCCI.
The report makes no suggestion that the Bank behaved improperly in its
relationship with NatWest. But it lends weight to a widely held criticism of
the Bank's structure: that its semi-official role as the spokesman and
champion of the City makes it reluctant to take stern action against leading
institutions, such as NatWest.
Whether or not it is appropriate for the Bank to play such a public
relations role for the City, this function will be less prominent under Mr
George. He is far less comfortable as a salesman than the current governor,
Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton.
As for taking action, the supervisory department has become less timid. It
is now more methodical in deciding whether it has the right in particular
cases to take punitive action under the 1987 Banking Act against individuals
and institutions. A new legal unit within the supervision department -
established together with an investigations unit in response to the Bingham
report - gives it more reliable guidance on its powers.
There has been a second important change. Once the Bank is convinced it has
the legal right to take punitive action, it has become less hesitant in
doing so. Indeed, there are signs that it is no longer petrified by the
prospect that one day the courts will overturn a decision it has made to
declare an individual or institution unfit to continue in banking. It has
belatedly come to the conclusion that its authority would not be undermined
by such a court judgment.
These developments probably mean that the case for demerging the supervisory
department has become less urgent. On the other hand, the supervision of
other financial institutions is being reviewed by Andrew Large, the chairman
of the Securities and Investments Board, and it is arguable that for him to
ignore the Bank's supervisory role, as he appears to be doing, maintains an
artificial distinction between banks and other financial institutions.
Nonetheless, the debate on whether to separate supervision from the Bank's
main functions will probably be deferred until the evolution of its powers
over monetary policy becomes clearer. If the Bank were given independent
powers to set interest rates, there might be a conflict with its supervisory
responsibilities. This is a view held by the next deputy governor, Mr Rupert
Pennant-Rea. The argument, disputed by some Bank executives, is that a
central bank's responsibility for ensuring banks' soundness might deter it
from raising interest rates to combat inflationary pressures, if it feared
that doing so would seriously damage the bank sector.
On the other hand, no central bank can afford to be completely divorced from
supervision. As the lender of last resort, it needs to be kept abreast of
the health of commercial banks. Its monetary policy role also requires it to
be confident that the payment system is sound.
So if supervision were demerged, the Bank would need to maintain close links
with any new supervisory institution.
Probably the best argument for demerging was hinted at by Mr Quinn. Given
that no supervisor receives public praise for doing the job properly, only
blame when things go wrong, the central bank's reputation is always at risk
of damage if it retains the supervisory function.
If Mr George wants to increase the Bank's standing in monetary affairs both
at home and abroad - and that appears to be his main ambition - he stands
more chance of success if the Bank does not risk contagion from occasional
and inevitable supervisory errors.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Kashmir's plight
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MISERY of Kashmir has tended to be forgotten amid the upsurge in
disputes elsewhere. It should not be. Thousands have died in Indian-held
Kashmir during the insurgency of the past three years. Human rights abuses
are commonplace. The current visit by Mr John Major to India offers an
opportunity to renew pressure for a solution.
India and Pakistan, which have fought two wars over Kashmir, remain at
loggerheads. Britain has suggested three steps, to be pursued
simultaneously: India should foster political dialogue leading to elections
in Indian-held Kashmir and the observance of human rights; Pakistan should
not give assistance to militants in Indian-held Kashmir; and the two
countries should talk to each other.
There is no sign that any of this will happen. Though the Delhi government
has announced that elections will be held in Kashmir, there is little
prospect that they could be, or that they would be meaningful. India
maintains a force of some 400,000 in Kashmir to contain insurgency. Its
cause suffered a severe setback on January 6 when paramilitary troops went
out of control in Sopore and killed over 50 local people.
By insisting that Kashmir is a domestic problem and seeking to solve it by
little other than brute force, India has alienated most Kashmiris. An
attempt at a political solution, with reduced military presence and moves to
win the hearts of Kashmiris, is urgently needed.
Talks need to be held under international auspices - whether Britain, the
Commonwealth or the UN - in order to try to solve the Kashmir issue once and
for all.
Whether or not independence were on the agenda, such discussions would not
be credible to Kashmiris unless they had some form of representation at the
table. It would be most important for the parties not to get bogged down -
as they tend to - in fruitless argument about what happened in 1947, but to
consider the way forward.
India and Pakistan can expect continued pressure from the new US
administration on their nuclear plans. International aid donors will
increasingly look askance at the human rights records if there is no
progress in Kashmir. But the best reason for action is that, as both pursue
radical economic reforms, they need to contract military spending and expand
trade opportunities. A Kashmir solution would offer scope for both, and
bring long-overdue peace to the Kashmiris.

FT  25 JAN 93 / As independent as they feel: The Bank of England's new
bosses may have a few surprises in store for Mr Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In appointing Mr Eddie George as the next governor of the Bank of England,
the government has done a paradoxically risky thing. On the face of it,
there is no risk involved at all. Mr George has worked at the Bank for 30
years, and has been running its day-to-day operations since becoming deputy
governor in 1990. He is a discreet, professional operator, well known to the
civil servants and politicians he will have to deal with during his initial
five-year term.
The appointment is risky, none the less. It has brought about something
Whitehall normally strives to avoid: giving a man with strong and
independent views a pulpit from which he will have little choice but to
express them publicly.
A first faint shadow of the potential tensions to come was evident on Friday
night, at a hastily summoned press conference with Mr George and his
deputy-designate, Rupert Pennant-Rea, editor of The Economist magazine.
As journalists arrived, they were handed a statement from Norman Lamont,
chancellor of the exchequer, welcoming Mr George and setting out his task:
'I have made clear to the new governor that his central responsibility
should be to support the government in our determination to bring about a
lasting reduction in the rate of inflation, the only sound basis on which
sustainable growth and secure jobs can be built.'
The political meat of this statement is contained in the first 18 words: the
Bank's responsibility is to support the government. Only then does the
sentence turn to the substance of current policy, the need for low
inflation.
Intentionally or not, the phrasing of the statement emphasises the
government's view that the Bank plays an essentially subordinate role in
formulating economic policy. The prime minister, Mr John Major, is known to
have turned his back on the arguments advanced by some in his own party that
the only way to achieve long-term price stability is to give the Bank of
England formal independence. Though a commitment to an independent central
bank is also enshrined in the Maastricht treaty, it is not something the
prime minister wishes to consider at the moment.
Mr George is a forceful advocate of the view that low inflation should be
the central aim of economic policy. In the past, he has argued for a central
bank with a high degree of operational independence, with a statutory
obligation to aim for price stability. An elected government should be able
to overrule such a semi-independent Bank, he has told colleagues, but only
in a formal and public way.
On Friday night, he returned to the theme. What counted was not the
institutional mechanism, he said, but the shared commitment to low
inflation, and he welcomed the chancellor's statement.
Then he went on: 'Having said that, I do think that there is a good case for
making the setting of the strategic objective and the operational
responsibility for achieving that objective separate. But that is
essentially a matter for politicians, for government and for parliament to
consider.'
As long as the government remains as committed to low inflation as the new
governor, the debate on this issue is likely to remain a low-key one. Mr
Pennant-Rea, whose magazine has argued for an independent central bank,
promised on Friday that he would continue to advance that view from inside
the Bank.
If the government seeks to diverge from the path towards lower inflation,
however, a cosy theoretical debate about appropriate institutional
structures will become a pressing issue of policy.
Mr Major believes that the political importance of mortgage interest rates
is one argument that rules out an independent central bank. Yet what if the
political imperative to keep mortgage rates low conflicts with the need for
higher interest rates in the face of rising inflation?
This sort of situation - by no means unlikely over the next few years -
would provide the decisive test for Mr George's governorship. In the past,
Bank governors have largely confined themselves to private protests in such
circumstances.
All Mr George's instincts, after 30 years in the Bank, must lie the same
way. He said on Friday: 'If independence has to be in some sense in
opposition to government, in that case I don't think I want it.'
Yet, unlike other recent governors, he will have no choice but to make his
judgment known: the collapse of economic policy after sterling was forced to
leave the exchange rate mechanism in September led the chancellor to ask the
Bank for a public report every quarter on the inflationary outlook.
Given that, said Mr George, 'it will be very difficult for us not to make
known publicly if we actually think that the government's inflation
objective is threatened'.
This is not the only area in which there are seeds of potential conflict. Mr
George is less than enthusiastic about a speedy move to European
integration. He listed, on Friday, the various ways in which European
economies would need to draw closer together before sterling could re-enter
the ERM.
'What we've learnt from the experience of last year,' he said, 'is that it
is critically important that we achieve a very high degree of economic
convergence before it makes sense to lock in a rigid way exchange rates
between countries.'
His endorsement of the decision to join the ERM in 1990 was lukewarm. In
considering such a decision, he said, 'we may not think it is absolutely the
right thing to do from a monetary perspective, but do we want to be left
behind?'
In these ways, Mr George shows himself a loyal but sceptical servant of the
elected government. He clearly has no illusions about the economic
management of the British economy since the second world war: its failures
had created a 'credibility gap'.
Other European central bankers, he said, would have no doubts about the
Bank's commitment to low inflation, but they were bound to have questions
about the government's, given the history of the past four decades.
There is plenty of scope for potential conflict there. In the public eye,
however, the biggest question mark over Mr George's appointment lies not in
his views but in his provenance.
He is only the second governor to come from the Bank's existing staff. The
pressures for an outside appointment must have seemed particularly great,
given the sterling crisis last autumn and the collapse of Bank of Credit and
Commerce International in 1991.
Though, in the end, these issues were not enough to prevent Mr George taking
over, they were enough to bring in an outsider as deputy governor. Mr George
made it clear that such an appointment was the price the Bank had to pay for
having one of its own staff as governor. 'I absolutely recognise the case
for having fresh air brought into the Bank,' he said, in a tone that implied
the case had been made to him fairly forcibly.
Just how much will change in the Bank as the new team takes charge is not
clear. Mr George has a reputation as an extremely hands-on manager, though
he did say he expected to be much less involved in administration.
Mr Pennant-Rea, in turn, was unclear about what his exact responsibilities
would be, though he hopes to be closely involved in the presentation of the
Bank's case to the world. He has some experience of bringing the musings of
a bureaucracy to the public: in the 1980s he was regularly seconded to the
World Bank to turn its annual World Development Report into comprehensible
English.
The Bank will change in subtle ways under the new team. Those who hope for
an immediate radical change in the way the institution works are likely to
be disappointed, however. There had already been a revolution in the Bank,
said Mr George. 'If I could see an area in which there was an immediate need
for further change, I would have been pretty remiss if I hadn't done that
already.'

FT  25 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Untimely truce
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RANIERO Vanni d'Archirafi, the EC's internal market commissioner, has
made a disappointing start in his new job. His apparent offer last week of
an indefinite truce to governments that flout or fail to implement the rules
of the single market is, at best, a public relations blunder. At worst, it
suggests a loss of nerve which could jeopardise the progress achieved to
date towards economic integration.
Mr Vanni d'Archirafi argues that it is better to secure positive acceptance
of single market measures, even if that involves delays, than to provoke a
political confrontation by imposing them. There are only two areas in which
such an approach may be defensible. One is in the initial implementation of
new VAT and excise procedures, the complexity of which has created genuine
confusion in many parts of the EC.
The other is in efforts to win agreement on the free movement of people
across internal frontiers. The Community's legal authority in the matter is
not clear-cut, and much depends on voluntary co-operation between member
states in dealing with problems such as terrorism and drugs. Heavy-handed
coercion from Brussels now could be counter-productive and hand ammunition
to opponents of the Maastricht treaty.
However, there is no case for extending leniency to the rest of the single
market programme, covering goods, services and capital. Its realisation is a
formal treaty commitment, enshrined in the Single European Act and in almost
300 EC directives painstakingly negotiated since 1987. Implementation and
enforcement of these measures are no longer a matter for the political
discretion of Mr Vanni d'Archirafi or anyone else. They are an unambiguous
legal obligation.
Barely half the single market directives have so far been turned into
national law by all 12 parliaments. Any hint that the Commission intends to
relax the pressure now can only encourage further legislative
procrastination and disregard for Community rules. Past experience has shown
that, left to themselves, many governments renege on EC undertakings. It is
not reassuring that Italy, which appointed Mr Vanni d'Archirafi, is one of
the worst offenders.
The Commission needs to make clear that such backtracking will not be
tolerated. Failure to do so now would further weaken its authority, robbing
the single market of impetus, and ultimately threatening the cohesion of the
Community.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Leading Article: The task for Mr George
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW governor and deputy governor of the Bank of England can have no
doubt what the government thinks they are there to do. In announcing the
appointments, Mr Norman Lamont insisted that their responsibility 'should be
to support the government in our determination to bring about a lasting
reduction in the rate of inflation'. So the old lady of Threadneedle Street
is to remain submissive, though ostensibly submissive in a good cause. The
question is how far the new team will accept being neutered.
After the French decision to make the Banque de France independent, the Bank
of England will be the least independent central bank in the Group of Seven
industrial countries, not so much the Old Lady, more the eunuch of
Threadneedle Street. In the international meetings he will attend as
governor, Mr Edward (Eddie) George will have to defend what he has
influenced, but not made. Worse, on past form the policy he will have to
defend will not only be the most political, it will also be among the least
competent.
The government justifies its determination not to grant independence to the
Bank by the political sensitivity of interest rate decisions. Yet that
sensitivity is itself a legacy of past inflation. The high proportion of
owner-occupiers, the dominance of borrowing at variable rates of interest,
the fluctuations in short-term interest rates, all these have been caused by
inflation. Will any politician be prepared to break this vicious circle,
especially when an election looms near? Unfortunately, it seems quite
unlikely.
Mr George and Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea must try to increase the chances. After
they get over initial disagreements - Mr George's greater scepticism about
the exchange rate mechanism, for example and The Economist's support for
Lord Lawson as the next governor - the two men will find happy agreement on
the importance of keeping inflation down.
Thereupon the new team should decide not to be as submissive as the
government wants. To Mr George's ability to speak with authority on central
banking, Mr Pennant-Rea must add a journalist's willingness to be outspoken.
They will need to be precisely that, because there will be little else for
the Bank to deploy, bar influence behind closed doors.
Should the new team have the courage to speak out, it will be effective. A
recently humiliated government will find it impossible to brush aside
warnings from the Bank. What is more, in the Bank's new quarterly assessment
of inflationary trends lies its opportunity. It offers independence in
embyro. The Bank should say precisely what it thinks and let the government,
which must borrow some Pounds 50bn a year for many years to come, cope with
the consequences of ignoring it.
In analysing the appointment that the government had to make, the FT argued
that 'the new governor must be capable of representing and defending the
Bank's policy views both in the UK and abroad; he should be able to
contribute to a national debate on the proper functions and structure of the
Bank; he should be open to new ideas; and he should be able to tackle the
managerial failures of the Bank that have been revealed so starkly in the
case of BCCI'.
The new governor and deputy governor have many of the required qualities
between the two of them. It is now for Mr George to prove that he has not
been too thoroughly house trained during his 30 years at the Bank and has
learned from recent disasters as well. It is for Mr Pennant-Rea to help him
to reach out to the public and shake up the Bank. If they are to succeed,
they must remember that the Bank exists to serve not the interests of the
government of the day, but those of the British people. What the latter need
from their central bank is sound finance and sound money. The new team must
be prepared to risk all for that cause.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Cut base rates to 5% before Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I cannot re-member which, if any, poet said: 'It is always darkest before
the dawn.' As it can always get darker still, this saying, like so many
others, is of no use in informing the sleepless watcher of the night how
long it is before sunrise. The latest economic indicators show that it is
still getting darker.
It is not the headline rise in UK unemployment to 60,000 in December that is
so alarming, but the fact that it is rising by more than 40,000 a month on a
three-monthly and six-monthly average - much worse than in the middle of
1992. It is no use dismissing unemployment as a lagging indicator when more
coincident signals, such as manufacturing output, dropped by  1/2 per cent
in the quarter to November, or an annualised fall of 2 per cent.
The vacancy figures have, it is true, risen slightly; but anyone who watched
this indicator through the 1980s will be careful of relying on it. The
Chambers of Commerce Survey shows more optimism, but that is in comparison
with a nadir of pessimism reached last autumn at the time of Black
Wednesday. There has been a deterioration since the recent Treasury monthly
report, and it now looks more likely that non-oil GDP fell further at the
end of last year rather than bottoming out as Whitehall had hoped.
Even the 1 to 1 1/2 per cent growth rate predicted by the Treasury for 1993
would not have been enough to stop the rise in unemployment. For this to
happen, output would have to rise in line with productive capacity. In the
more optimistic late 1980s the Treasury thought the underlying growth rate
of non-oil GDP was 2 3/4 per cent per annum. The fashionable estimate has
now been trimmed back to 2 per cent - quite a large change when cumulated
over several years.
This downward revision may however be wrong, and not allow enough for the
second round of workforce trimming now hitting the economy. Indeed, output
may have to grow for some time by at least 3 per cent per annum before there
is a real reversal of the unemployment trend.
There is a danger of getting the worst of all worlds in government economic
policy. Unlike the governor-designate of the Bank of England, Mr Eddie
George, who has joined the Europhobic clan by calling last September 16 -
the day when official efforts failed to save ERM membership - White
Wednesday, I still support the European Exchange Rate Mechanism run in the
right way. But so long as the UK is outside, it might as well enjoy its
freedom of action to cut interest rates whenever necessary.
To come to the point, I do not see what is to be gained either by continuing
with slow and small interest rate cuts, or waiting until the Budget. The
economic position justifies a reduction to 5 per cent very soon.
Whether this is done in successive small stages, or in one fell swoop, I
leave to the supposed experts in financial market psychology. The important
thing is that it is done quickly. The prime minister, perhaps because he had
only the chance to introduce one Budget in a great rush while he was
chancellor, overestimates the contribution that budgetary packages can make.
And there is no point in delaying until then.
Is this a U-turn on my part? Tactical yes, strategic no. The same outlook
should lead to different policies in different circumstances. I still think
that the ultimate effect of monetary policy is on inflation, and that
unemployment needs to be tackled by structural policies. Nevertheless, the
wrong macro-economic policy can aggravate fluctuations; and a hysterical
depression atmosphere leads to make-work policies, such as keeping open
uneconomic coalmines, rather than genuine structural reform, which must
tackle wage flexibility at the micro-level.
My main inhibition about interest rate cuts has been the effect on sterling,
and thus on prices. But the exchange rate swings which entrench inflation
are the long ones, such as the fall in sterling against the D-Mark from DM11
in the 1970s to about DM2 1/2 today. The Bank of England worries too much
about the speed of exchange rate movements over a few weeks or months, and
not enough about the trend over longer periods. I can still remember how,
after making it widely known how much it disagreed with the government over
the high rate of sterling in 1980, the Bank of England panicked when the
pound did begin to fall in 1981-83, and insisted several times on braking
action.
Indeed, the policy of waiting to make small cuts is self-defeating even in
tactical terms, because sterling has already weakened in anticipation of
base rate cuts to come. On the other hand, if base rates looked as if they
had reached bottom or nearly so, the markets would begin to anticipate the
next move being upward, as they have over the US dollar.
Finally, so long as the economy is so weak, the government will be inhibited
from cutting spending or raising taxes enough to correct the serious
underlying Budget deficit - and rightly so. The sooner the economy shows
signs of a convincing recovery, the sooner that corrective budgetary action
can be taken, although even that is not likely to be before the second
Budget in December.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Growing clamour for a stronger voice: The balance of power
in Japan is shifting towards those who want their country to play a bigger
international role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Japan's political leadership is considering taking its boldest step yet into
the uncertain post-cold war world. It will soon decide whether to begin a
review of Article Nine of the 1947 constitution, imposed by the US in its
postwar occupation.
Article Nine, known as the peace clause, renounces war and the use of force.
It is at the heart of Japan's troubled postwar identity.
The review, which senior figures in the ruling Liberal Democratic party are
expected to propose today, would involve all the main political parties in
potentially divisive debate about the merits of the constitution.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, has signalled he is opposed to
change, while Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, and several other
powerful cabinet ministers argue that reform is essential if Japan is to
play a wider role in the world.
For traditionalists, including many in the Social Democratic party, the main
opposition party, the clause enshrines Japan's exceptional character as a
state that does not wish to translate its economic power into military
might. To revisionists, it is an anachronism of the cold war era, which
consigns Japan to an unhealthy dependence upon the US.
Since the end of the cold war, Japan has taken several small steps towards
becoming more active in world events, highlighted by the recent dispatch of
troops abroad for the first time since the second world war to serve as
United Nations peacekeepers in Cambodia.
But as yet there seems to be no clear answer to the question: what kind of
international power does Japan want to become?
It is widely accepted that the Yoshida doctrine, which has guided Japan's
foreign policy since the 1950s, is not tenable. The doctrine, named after
Shigeru Yoshida who dominated Japanese politics after the war, has four
components: Japan's main goal should be economic development to match the
west; it should be lightly armed and avoid involvement in international
conflicts; to achieve this it should accept the political leadership and
military protection of the US; Japan's diplomacy should be 'value free' to
allow it to trade with a wide range of states regardless of their political
complexion.
The doctrine has been one of the most durable successes of postwar foreign
policy among the leading powers. While Japan has been politically withdrawn,
it has forged ahead economically.
But the doctrine is being overtaken by events. The bindings of its
relationship with the US are loosening. The Russian military threat, which
brought the US and Japan together, has receded. The US increasingly views
Japan as its arch economic competitor.
For Japan, economic power has brought the need to make choices. For three
decades after the second world war, the aim was to catch up with the west.
Now that it has caught up, it cannot remain a follower; it has to set its
own course.
Several camps are competing to provide Japan with a foreign policy lead:
The traditionalists. The most prominent is Mr Miyazawa. This group has
elevated the pragmatic Yoshida doctrine into a faith, based on the belief
that Japan is a 'special state'. Its history of wartime aggression and, most
importantly, nuclear bombing make it exceptional, the group argues.
Japan should accept as a principle a modest international role under the US
umbrella, say the traditionalists. Japan's sovereignty must always be
compromised, they believe, because it can never become an international
military force, even in the cause of peace.
The traders. Mr Noahiro Amaya, former vice-minister at the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry, has been the most controversial proponent
of Japan as a commercial democracy. Miti is still the bastion of this view.
The traders believe Japan should model itself on the great trading powers of
the 15th and 16th centuries, such as the Netherlands. According to this
view, Japan is the world's merchant, the US is the world's samurai. Japan
should assess diplomatic initiatives against their financial returns.
The new realists. The most famous is former prime minister Mr Yasuhiro
Nakasone. The most influential is Mr Ichiro Ozawa, a young LDP politician
who is expected to become one of the most powerful figures in Japanese
politics in the course of the decade.
The new realists believe that adherence to Article Nine is isolationist
pacificism. Japan's international partners will see it as a free rider,
benefiting from the world's trading system but doing little to protect it.
The realists believe the 1991 Gulf war showed that a cash-based approach to
diplomacy does not work. After much debate, Japan contributed Dollars 13bn
to a war effort that most Japanese did not support. Yet the nation feels it
received only grudging thanks from its international partners, who accused
it of dragging its feet.
The realists argue that the link with the US should be strengthened: Japan
should contribute more to international security through finance, personnel
and technology. Japan's political institutions should be reformed to create
a two-party political system, which would generate open debate on Japan's
foreign policy priorities.
Yet, they say, Japan should not simply follow the US. It should represent an
Asian view of the world, especially on economic issues, where the US and
Europe could learn from the Far East's dynamism.
The nationalists. The end of the cold war has unleashed nationalism in much
of Europe. Such a movement is politically muted in Japan, for fear of
rekindling other countries' fears that it harbours imperial ambitions.
Yet there is an increasingly powerful sense of national pride in Japan,
stemming from the contrast between its economic achievements and social
stability and America's economic and social malaise, symbolised by the
spread of drugs, urban violence and divorce.
The Yoshida doctrine was framed when Japan was vulnerable. Japan's future
foreign policy will reflect its growing national confidence.
The visionaries. Members of this group hold widely differing views, but they
share a belief that Japan should stand for a new kind of world order.
They comprise people like Mr Akio Morita of Sony, who has called for an
international standardisation of employment and social provisions to ensure
fair competition. Others argue that Japan should become the standard bearer
of an international welfare state, focusing on solving transnational issues
such as the environment, Aids and refugee relief.
The balance of power is gradually shifting from the traditionalists and the
traders, who take their lead from the foreign policy of the 1950s and 1960s,
to the new realists, who will articulate Japan's self-confidence.
This change in part reflects the rise of a younger generation of political
leaders, with no memory of Japan's war-time devastation or its postwar
dependence upon the US.
The shift in Japan will pose troubling questions for the US and Europe.
Japan has so far played a limited international role, partly because the
west has been unsure what role it wants Japan to play. Japanese politicians
frequently complain that the west wants Japan to be content as an
international cash dispenser, providing finance for events such as the Gulf
war or reform in Russia, without having an equal voice on policy. This is
symbolised, for the Japanese, by their lack of a permanent seat on the UN
security council.
The accession of the new realists into positions of power in Japan will
bring benefits and costs for the west. Japan will play a more active world
role, but the west will also find it tougher to bargain with.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Letter: A convention for banking that has proved a disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEOFFREY W GARDINER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The claim by Mr Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, to be
innocent of blame for the plight of the banks ('UK bank losses blamed on
government policies', January 19) is not acceptable, for he is guilty of
fostering the Basel (not Basle]) convention.
Lex (January 19) remarks that the banks should have lent to those who had a
sustainable cash flow instead of preferring those who offered security. The
convention encourages banks to seek security, however phoney. Its
risk-weighting provisions allow twice as much lending to secured borrowers
as to the unsecured. Therefore, provided it could maintain the same interest
margin, a bank could double its earnings per share by lending to bad secured
risks rather than to good unsecured borrowers. The provisions probably also
favour large companies against small private companies, because many of the
latter will for tax reasons have their premises, their best security, in a
controlling directors' pension fund.
Although the convention is only now coming into force as an international
agreement, its provisions on capital adequacy were known by 1987 at the
latest. The committee's final recommendations are dated July 1988. Banks'
lending decisions have doubtless been influenced by the convention for at
least five years.
The Basel convention was an example of that most prevalent of late 20th
century diseases, short-sighted do-gooding. It sounded marvellous when
presented by its academic supporters on paper, but has been a disaster in
practice. It should be replaced immediately by a simpler agreement which
sets a capital adequacy ratio of perhaps 6 per cent with no risk-weighting
at all. The capital base should be wholly equity and represented by
realisable assets. There should be no second tier capital because loan
capital is still loan capital, however much subordinated, and can therefore
precipitate an untimely liquidation.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Letter: Aiming for a known target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From G V INGRAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Re your editorial, 'How to target inflation' (January 19), to be really
effective, targets should be simple and easily conveyed, and the
consequences of failing to meet those targets should be known in advance.
This all sounds too simple for governments, but for individuals it is highly
relevant.
A target on earnings could be set with the conditions that, say, monetary
policy will be changed in a specific way if they are breached. The condition
might be that interest rates will be set at 2 per cent above average
earnings figures. This is simplistic, but would be clear to negotiators, etc
 -if they pushed hard for higher earnings, they would know they were
directly contributing to the cause of higher rates. At present, negotiators
and individuals find it all too easy to blame someone else for the problem.
If people knew that higher increases in earnings would lead to higher
interest rates and therefore mortgage rates and so on, they might consider
whether pushing for higher settlements was worthwhile. G V Ingram,

FT  25 JAN 93 / Letter: Much closer to equality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Lady HOWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article, 'Delay for equality in senior jobs forecast' (January
19), David Goodhart reported me as saying that 'it would still take 25 years
for women to achieve equality with men'.
I certainly did say that it would take 25 years to ensure parity between men
and women at work, but the 25 years I referred to was a forecast I had made
in 1975, when I was deputy chairman of the Equal Opportunities Commission.
This forecast, as you will appreciate, brings us up to the year 2000, which
is also the year Business in the Community's Opportunity 2000 has targeted
in its campaign to improve the balance of men and women at all levels in the
workforce.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Letter: Issue taken with minister on meaning of judgment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms MELANIE TETHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, May I take issue with Michael Forsyth's assertion (Letters, January 22)
that the judgment of the European Court of Justice in Rask v ISS
Kantineservice A/S says nothing new about the potential of the EC Acquired
Rights Directive to apply when a service is contracted out.
Mr Forsyth is right to say that the judgment does not alter the principle
that employees only have rights under the directive if the undertaking in
which they work is transferred as a going concern. This is, however, an
altogether too superficial analysis. The real importance of the judgment
lies in the guidelines which the court laid down for determining what
amounts to 'the transfer of an undertaking as a going concern'. Those
guidelines will have a dual significance in the context of contracting-out.
First, the court said that a service which has previously been provided
in-house may amount to 'an undertaking' if it forms an identifiable part of
the employer's operations. Second, the court indicated that, where a service
is sufficiently self-contained, the assignment of operational control over
it to an outside contractor may of itself amount to 'a transfer', even
though the employer retains ultimate responsibility. The latter situation
has traditionally been regarded by the UK courts as involving a mere
contract for the performance of services rather than the transfer of an
undertaking.
Although the court left it to the Danish judge to apply these guidelines to
the facts of the case, it nevertheless made clear its view that there could
be a transfer of an undertaking where an employer contracts out the
management of an in-house service (in the Rask case, a staff canteen).
Every case will, of course, depend on its own particular facts. There can,
however, be little doubt that, if the contracting-out of a staff canteen can
amount to the transfer of an undertaking, the potential of the directive to
apply when services in central and local government are contracted out is
very great indeed. Certainly it can no longer be said, as Mr Forsyth did
(Letters, November 30), that 'there is not normally a transfer of an
undertaking in these circumstances'.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Letter: A freedom that invites objection
</HEADLINE>

   From P W BLOOMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Sir Bryan Hopkin and Sir Douglas Wass (Personal View, January 22) set
out their opposition to the idea of an independent central bank for the UK
in terms that one might expect from civil servants who resent the thought
that power might be better exercised by independent professionals than by
politicians.
Their objections seem not to be that a central bank would not provide a
stable monetary environment for business to work within. Instead they object
to the idea that the setting of monetary policy by a group other than the
government of the day would constrain that government in its activities in
the fields of taxation, spending, borrowing and all the other areas in which
governments like to become involved. Exactly.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Arts: An unembellished voice - William Weaver finds a
reliable guide to Italian singers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINGERS OF ITALIAN OPERA by John Rosselli Cambridge Pounds 29.95, 272 pages
John Rosselli's 1984 study of the economics of Italian opera, The Opera
Industry in Italy from Cimarosa to Verdi, examined the history of Italy's
lyric theatre not from the usual point of view of the composer but from the
impresario's often muddled and makeshift office. Drawing on the
long-neglected Lanari papers in the Biblioteca Nazionale in Florence,
Rosselli drew a picture of an exotic world that, while generating a
multitude of enduring masterpieces (and an even greater multitude of
flashes-in-the-pan), struggled against endless material problems, not to
mention social and political obstacles.
To that book, Rosselli's new volume, Singers of Italian Opera, is the
perfect complement. While few impresarios found biographers and even fewer
were literate enough to write their memoirs, singers' careers have hardly
gone unrecorded. But in a competition for the highest degree of
unreliability, the biographies, autobiographies and hagiographies of Italian
opera singers would surely take first prize.
Scraping away the encrustations of legend, the inventions of hack
journalists, the exaggerations of the singers themselves, Rosselli has
arrived, insofar as possible, at the naked truth. Admittedly, by omitting
false or suspect information, the book can here and there seem
disappointingly bland. Singers' honoraria make less than enthralling
reading; but this is the first time that an opera historian has seriously
tried to make sense of contracts involving (to mention only a few currencies
of the period) Neapolitan ducats, Austrian thalers, Piedmontese lire, gold
Napoleons, and finally US dollars. Establishing comparative buying power is
even more daunting (and to complicate matters, singers were sometimes paid
not in cash but in kind: lodging, firewood, travel expenses).
For many years singers were a part of royal retinues, subject to rulers'
caprice; their careers were often brief, even more often inglorious. Despite
his stern scholarly intentions, Rosselli allows room for a few illustrative
anecdotes which hardly inspire nostalgia or, still less, envy. The chapter
on castrati makes severe demands on the faint-hearted reader, but never has
this delicate subject been expounded with greater clarity and sense.
The modern opera fan frequently thinks of singers as superstars, ignorant,
greedy, causing hard-up opera houses endless headaches and driving ticket
prices through the roof. But, as the reader of this study soon realises,
singers themselves have traditionally been exploited: by their families,
their teachers, their managers, their employers; and for every millionaire
tenor there are dozens of tragic failures. Verdi did not build his Casa di
Riposo without reason. Even the great artists of the golden
turn-of-the-century had to pay the price of gruelling tours and often rough
transatlantic crossings, compared to which jet lag is a trivial irritation.
Rosselli's generous notes constitute an invaluable bibliography, which his
final 'Note on further reading' admirably completes. This dispassionate, but
not detached study of the singer of Italian opera, from the Renaissance to
the almost-present, can be read as a corrective antidote to the flood of
'official', usually gossipy and inaccurate lives, which not even this dam of
fact will be able to staunch.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Arts: Orchestral birthday - London Sinfonietta/Barbican
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For months already the London Sinfonietta has been celebrating its 25th
birthday; but Sunday was the actual anniversary, and the orchestra marked it
one day earlier with an elaborate double concert at the Barbican. A rich
bill of fare, suitable to the occasion: two premieres (world and local),
some hardy Sinfonietta perennials, a staged Stravinsky and a swatch of
Broadway songs to remind us that Broadway-on-CD is now, in these straitened
times, the Sinfonietta's ace in the hole.
Robert Saxton's new Psalm - A Song of Ascents is a trumpet concerto
commissioned by the orchestra for John Wallace, who delivered it eloquently.
Like other recent Saxton, it has visionary aspirations, and here and there
echoes of Jewish intonations. The dissonance-factor is ingratiatingly low.
From a striking start with bells, each of its continuous sections
accelerates eagerly (though with less than the expected thrust, this time
anyway); at last there is a soulful climax, and a small, serene coda.
An intricate solo cadenza midway puzzled me - it tickled the ear, without
explaining quite what it was meant to be doing: perhaps that will emerge on
further hearing. In Oliver Knussen's four delicate, impacted Songs without
Words (first heard last year in New York) there were some teasingly dense
passages which want further acquaintance too, but there was a palpable
sprinkle of magic in each 'song'. A ravishing cello line in the second; an
elegantly melancholy one for cor anglais in the fourth, where the other
seven players slip in, one by one, to extend it with tender discretion.
Edgard Varese's Integrales had opened the first concert with all its
scathing truculence intact, players spread out across the wide Barbican
stage; and Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony no. 1 - in which the Sinfonietta
team is peerless - ended it. (A trick of the acoustics, though, made the
horns domineer uncomfortably.) There was a smoochy performance of Ravel's
two-hand piano concerto by Paul Crossley; and Felicity Palmer revelled
confidently in Berio's evergreen set of Folk Songs: for the next few years,
everybody will want her to sing them.
L'Histoire du Soldat, the staged Stravinsky, turned out disappointingly
flat. Nothing wrong with Elgar Howarth's treatment of the brilliant little
score (he conducted the Varese and Ravel too), nor of course with the
instrumentalists, and Roger McGough's new words served well enough; Jim
Carter's sturdy narrator and John Sessions' nervy soldier did what they
could with what they were given to do. Stephen Langridge's production,
however, gave them next to nothing.
His initial premise, that the role of the devil could be assigned
effectively to six young amateur mimes, was already a grave mistake. Far
worse, indeed quite ruinous, was the use he made - or rather failed to make
 -of the crackling score. Instead of letting it generate all the lively,
inventive movement and byplay that Stravinsky and his collaborator Ramuz
expected for their show, he let the action stop dead, again and again, while
the music proceeded like abstract concert numbers from stage left. Sad, and
boring, a complete waste of an enviable opportunity.
The nine Broadway numbers in the last half of this second concert made more
than fair amends, some old favourites (Cole Porter's 'Begin the Beguine',
the sumptuous original version of Jerome Kern's 'All the Things You Are')
and some fine rediscoveries (some more Kern, two strong Kurt Weill songs).
The conductor John McGlinn, a specialist in this repertoire, had an
excellent quartet of New York show-singers with him to give their
professional all: Jeanne Lehmann, Ann Morrison, Hugh Panaro and George
Dvorsky. They gave unqualified pleasure, and - in the circumstances -
much-needed relief.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Arts: Hampson sings Hamlet - Opera/Monte Carlo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ambroise Thomas's Hamlet (1874), one of the finest products of the
19th-century operatic second rank, has a star role for a lyric baritone of
romantic presence, vocal magnetism and complete command of the French
singing style. In our day it has served as a notable vehicle for Sherrill
Milnes (who also recorded it) and Thomas Allen; the latest important
protagonist is Thomas Hampson, the tall, handsome, greatly gifted American
baritone mainly known up to now for his Mozart and Rossini roles (it is as
the latter's Figaro that next month he makes a belated Covent Garden debut).
His first approach to this operatic Shakespeare adaptation was wisely
planned. It took place, last week, not in one of the big international opera
houses where Mr Hampson has become a regular performer, but at Monte-Carlo.
Here - away from the limelight, in Garnier's small jewel-box of a theatre -
voices never have any need to press for audibility, contact between singers
and audience is close, and the productions are cast and mounted with care
and finesse.
This was, indeed, not a One Man Show but an intelligently devised staging -
by John Cox in the bold-coloured, strikingly modern-accented sets and
costumes of Paul Brown (designer of the much-admired Royal Opera Mitridate)
 -which increased even further my admiration for the whole work. In the
later part of his career Thomas's name became a byword for passe
traditionalism in French opera; Shaw's sallies against Hamlet - 'I really
never saw such a foolish opera' - were sharp-pointed.
At this date there is surely no longer any need to mind operatic Shakespeare
in this pared-down form, with its far-from-conventional Happy End. The
beauty of so much of the opera resides in the fastidiousness and precise
purpose with which Thomas treated Grand Opera conventions. Numbers familiar
out of context (Hamlet's monologues and Drinking Song, Ophelia's florid Mad
Scene) gain miraculously from their surroundings. The distinct tone and
colour of the orchestral writing show how much Thomas learned from Berlioz;
and while there are big public scenes in the Meyerbeer manner, it is the
combination of intimacy and seriousness that keeps them - and, indeed, the
opera - so fresh and so surprising.
Mr Hampson provided a noble centre point. His high baritone, near-tenorial
in clarity and lightness of timbre, is an instrument of the utmost
artistocratic elegance; so are his stage demeanour and his excellently
schooled delivery of French. He has a Lieder-singer's gift of close focus,
which lent a particular eloquence to Thomas's 'To be or not to be' and 'Get
thou to a monastery' (with its wonderful blossoming as a trio). In the
earlier acts he seemed self-absorbed, lacking a degree of emotional
intensity and, with it, a quickness of reaction to the others on stage.
But as the operatic momentum built up, so did the evidence of his
engagement. If Mr Hampson should choose to make Hamlet a mainstay of his
repertory, I predict for him an ever-growing success. I also predict a big
future for the Ophelia, the very young Bulgarian Alexandrina Pendachanska (a
recent WNO Gilda), whose highly individual soprano leggiero - needle-bright
yet full of 'bottom' - is complemented by a heart-breaking innocence of
stage personality.
Stefania Toczyska (Gertrude) and Philippe Duminy (Claudius) both made much
of their well-written roles. Lawrence Foster was the sound, secure, but
sometimes rather unimaginative Monte-Carlo conductor, a little too free with
the cutting shears.

Not many managers have to abseil down 100ft cliffs or swing across mountain
streams in their battle to get the British economy moving.
But the imagination and initiative they reveal in dealing with the rigours
of nature raw in tooth and nail should have a spin-off in real life.
That at least is the justification for such enterprises as John Ridgway's
survival course based at Ardmore in north Scotland. And enough companies
believe in it to send middle managers outward bound.
Cutting Edge (Channel 4 at 9.00) follows a party of 24 executives of a
multinational business as they discover themselves and each other in these
testing conditions.
This is followed aptly by Northern Exposure, the cult US comedy sitcom set
in Alaska. 'Maggie faces the possibility that the late Rick has been
reincarnated as a dog.' Nuff said.
Radio 4's adaptation of Eveyln Waugh's Decline and Fall at 11.00 is a great
disappointment, exhibiting a pronounced lack of 1920s style - one of the
great humorous classics of the century is played without laughs.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Arts: It's the way that you spend it - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Architectural debate is particularly lively at the moment, with two events
in the last week making useful contributions to the changing climate.
The first was the Royal Society of Arts' symposium on one of the most
important subjects for architects, developers and clients: 'Better Buildings
Mean Better Business'. It was chaired by Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover
and addressed by Mr Michael Howard. the Secretary of State for the
Environment. The symposium raised a fundamental question: 'What is better
business and how can it be helped by better building?'
The principle speakers, the Secretary of State and Mr Vincent Wang of
Stanhope Properties, followed a similar line to the chairman in discussing
the main issues affecting quality.
Six factors were discussed as parameters for judging what makes a building
'better'.
The right timing of development (just as essential as the right location)
A good relationship between the client and the professionals
Design quality
Efficiency of planning and operation
Relationships with the neighbours
A successful balance of quality and price.
Mr Howard continued to argue for Compulsory Competitive Tendering for public
authority architectural services. The Secretary of State's view is that:
'There is a trade-off to be made between price and quality, and those
responsible for spending public money must ensure they strike the right
balance.'
It is interesting to observe a minister - who clearly appreciates quality
and has directed government departments to try to raise building standards -
struggling with an unnecessary dogma which can put those very standards in
jeopardy. I wonder how lawyers would enjoy the compulsory application of the
competitive fee bidding system applied to their services?
Mr Richard MacCormac, president of the Royal Institute of British
Architects, insisted that the issue of fees cannot be divorced from the
issue of quality. When you pay an architect, you are paying for time and
quality of work. The lowest tender approach to architecture would be like
asking Shakespeare to write his plays as quickly as possible. 'Selecting
architects by fee competition, on the same basis as street cleaners, simply
invites architects to give the minimum time to the design process to
minimise fees.'
The views of Mr Wang, an innovative developer with a track record of success
at Broadgate and Stockley Park, were based on wide understanding and
experience. He pointed out that high quality can save money in the
long-term. 'Productivity, absenteeism and sickness are all affected by a
building's design. And a well-designed building will cost significantly less
to run, in adaptation, maintenance and energy costs.'
But he also pointed out that the perceived quality of a building's finishes
is only a small part of the total cost, perhaps 10 per cent. 'Architectural
quality is not just to do with the quality or cost of the finishes. It is
not a question of cost at all. It is purely a question of skill, commitment
and loving care. Spending more money certainly does not assure a better
result.'
The other event that sparks debate is a small exhibition at the RIBA called
Before and After Planning. It runs until February 6 at 66 Portland Place,
London W1, organised by Hawkins Brown and GMA Planning. It shows the designs
of architects 'before and after' the actions of planning committees.
Rather an introspective exhibition, it is not designed to make the problem
very clear to the public. I did not consider the planners to have been wrong
in all cases although some of their interventions were undoubtedly
destructive and ignorant. The whole area is a subjective one: it is
difficult to argue for non-intervention from elected planning bodies when a
nominated and largely self-selecting group - the Royal Fine Art Commission -
plays the role of an arbiter at the national level.
Also at the RIBA is a fascinating, well-designed exhibition about new
museums in Austria organised by August Sarnitz and presented by the Austrian
government. It raises a great many questions about the links between new and
old buildings and the mixture of modern and Baroque cultures.
Anyone who has recently been in Vienna will realise that Austria has a more
relaxed approach to the location of new buildings in old settings than many
other European countries. There are some good examples here of the
intervention of modern artists and architects in the expansion plans of
Austrian museums and there is clearly a well-funded and intelligent
government approach to the question of museums. (Peter Brooke, please note).
I would recommend this exhibition to museum directors as well as the public
 -especially to Mr Nicholas Serota of the Tate Gallery as he plans the
growth of the Tate.
One scheme worries me, and that is the proposed new museum quarter at the
heart of the Imperial Forum of Vienna, opposite the marvellous stables by
Fischer van Erlach built in 1720. To turn the former imperial stables into a
museum quarter is a difficult task demanding immense sensitivity. I find the
proposals for a giant media tower and multipurpose hall and museum of modern
art strange and arbitrary - and curiously reminiscent of the 1960s. Can
Vienna be serious about this plan?
I will return to this subject when I have had the opportunity to look
closely at the site. As shown at the RIBA I can scarcely believe that this
scheme is, as it is claimed to be, 'a direct modern counterpart of an
ancient Greek acropolis'.

A Pounds 3m contract for a 60,000 sq ft office development beside the
historic Leeds Bridge on the river Aire has been awarded to CLUGSTON
CONSTRUCTION by Sovereign Quay, a joint venture by Ploughland Estates and
Yorkshire Rider.
The Sovereign Quay development comprises two adjacent buildings, Windsor
House and King House. Windsor House, which fronts on to the river and Bridge
End, will provide 20,000 sq ft of offices on five floors with basement
parking for 18 cars.
Original features will be retained such as the riverside boardwalk and the
facade of the Victorian building, which appears on what is believed to be
the world's first ever moving film, made by Louis Le Prince in 1890 on Leeds
Bridge.
King House, the adjacent building which fronts on to Sovereign Street, will
be vacated by Yorkshire Rider and the interior completely refurbished to
provide 40,000 sq ft of office space.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
KPMG partner Sheila Masters (right), whose three year stint as finance
director of the National Health Service put the wind up many health service
managers, has been appointed to the NHS Policy Board.
The government has used the recent departure from the board of Sir James
Ackers, following his resignation as chairman of the troubled West Midlands
Regional Health Authority, to strengthen the non-executive element of the
16-strong quango.
Masters, 43, is one of two accountants appointed to the board which advises
Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley on NHS policy. The other new member is
Tim Chessells, 51, a former partner of Arthur Young, who is chairman of the
London Implementation Group, set up to investigate the options arising out
of Sir Bernard Tomlinson's report on London's health services.
Set up four years ago in a bid to make the NHS more business-like, the
policy board's aim is to help set strategy and objectives and monitor the
performance of the service through the NHS management executive.
In its early days, its non-executive members were mainly industrialists such
as Sir Graham Day and Sir Ken Durham. However, they have since departed and
been replaced by new faces such as Peter Gummer, chairman of the Shandwick
public relations group, and Kate Jenkins, a former personnel director of the
Royal Mail. The other non-executives are Sir Roy Griffiths, a former deputy
chairman of J Sainsbury, Sir Robert Scholey, the former British Steel
chairman, and Professor Cyril Chantler, the clinical dean of Guy's and St
Thomas's medical schools, and one of the first doctors to embrace the
government's controversial health service reforms.

FT  25 JAN 93 / People: Foseke - turning over a new Liffe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
No-one else has made a success of it yet, but Karin Foseke is prepared to
give it a go. The new director of equity products at Liffe, London's
derivatives exchange, next week sets about the arduous task of selling
equity and index options to British institutions and the investing public.
LTOM, the traded options market under the umbrella of the stock exchange,
was a failure. Merged into Liffe and under a new roof for the past year,
equity index options have faired slightly better, but the volume on
individual stock options has actually dropped. Why does Foseke think she can
do better?
The Swedish-born American citizen, who says she acts American or Swedish
depending on what mood she is in, acknowledges that is 'a good question' but
believes her background should enable her to tackle the problem afresh.
She spent 18 years in the US, including at the Beverley Hills office of
Prudential-Bache Securities advising on equity options strategies. She then
moved to London, where she and her husband Peter Jorgensen were hired as a
team to develop the London end of Swedish exchange OM - she as business
development director, he as managing director.
While OM London more or less owed its existence at the start to Swedish
turnover tax (abolished at the end of 1991) driving business offshore, many
members of the London exchange community were impressed with Foseke's drive.
Since leaving OM early last year, she has been at WestPac London as head of
distribution within the financial markets group, but says she missed the
buzz of an innovative, successful market.
At Liffe, Foseke, whose boss is business development managing director Roger
Barton, will have to tread carefully with those members of LTOM who had
wanted a managing director representing their interests and reporting
directly to the chief executive. There is also unhappiness at how long the
appointment took to make.
Meanwhile, the advice from one LTOM old hand, who readily admits past
mistakes and welcomes a fresh face, is simple: 'I hope she doesn't listen to
us.'
*****
Stephen Unwin, formerly head of banking at Kleinwort Benson and who before
that ran Kleinwort's banking operations in the US, has joined Butte Mining
as a non-executive director.
Butte has never made a profit since it was floated on the London stock
exchange six years ago; it startled the mining industry last May by
launching a legal action in the US against 70 defendants, including former
directors and advisers, claiming damages of at least Dollars 325m.
Unwin, 52 and now a consultant, says he would not have joined the Butte
board 'if I did not believe in the merit of the litigation. It will take a
year or two, but I said I would help out at this difficult time for the
company.'
He stresses that he was not acting as a consultant to Butte and says that so
far he has not discussed whether he would be paid anything as a director.
David Lloyd-Jacob, Butte's chairman, says he has known Unwin for about ten
years since they both worked in New York and recently had increasingly been
seeking his advice. He says: 'Butte needs to ensure we have the financial
resources to fight the US case to the end. With his financial background,
Unwin is an ideal addition to the board.'

FT  25 JAN 93 / Management: When fatal illness is a public affair - The
executive's duty when serious sickness strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What should the chief executive of a large quoted company do if he discovers
that he has a serious, potentially fatal illness? How much of the problem
should he make public, and when?
This was the awful question which confronted Michael Walsh, chairman of US
conglomerate Tenneco, on Tuesday last week when doctors told him he had a
brain tumour.
Walsh's response conformed with the face-the-facts regime he has imposed on
the formerly flabby Tenneco since he took over as chief executive a year ago
 -complete and immediate disclosure.
He held telephone conference calls with securities analysts and the press
early the following morning, in which he explained the nature of the
problem, the treatment intended, and the median survival rate for patients
in his condition (five to six years).
He declared that he had virtually no symptoms, apart from a slight limp, and
that the tumour would have no effect on his ability to carry out his job. A
letter from his doctor supported this judgment.
Why then, did he announce the news so quickly? Walsh said that if he had
failed to act, rumour and speculation would have developed over his health,
and this could have been damaging to investors in the company.
'Little deceptions become big deceptions.' he added. 'Pretty soon all your
energies are going into managing the problem, not the business.'
Numerous US lawyers and management consultants suggest that Walsh acted in
an exemplary fashion - that full, frank and immediate disclosure of serious
medical problems is in the best interests of a publicly quoted company and
its shareholders.
Indeed, US securities law obliges publicly quoted companies to disclosure
facts when these are 'material' to its business.
But as Keith Kearney, of New York lawyers Davis, Polk &amp; Wardwell points out,
this gives companies a fair degree of latitude in what they report on
matters medical.
Privately-owned US companies are under no legal obligation to report health
problems. Coincidentally, this was underscored last week when TLC Beatrice,
a foods group, only disclosed that its chairman, Reginald Lewis, had brain
cancer the day before he died.
Publicly tracking the course of a disease can be much more of a grey area
than initial disclosure of the problem, pitting respect for an individual's
privacy and suffering against shareholders' right to know.
Time Warner faced this when Steven Ross, chairman and creator of the giant
media group, was found to have prostate cancer. The company revealed the
problem in November 1991 but insisted for months that Ross remained in
control of the business, while working from home. It announced last June
that he had taken temporary leave of absence for further treatment. Ross
died in December.
Walsh has waived all confidentiality about his medical condition with
Tenneco's board, which will be kept fully informed by his doctors and will
then have to decide what, if anything, to make public. Admirers of Walsh are
hoping that no news will be good news.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Management: Switching gears on a rocky road - Christopher
Lorenz explains how Flymo forced a common pricing policy throughout the
single market / Rethinking Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE the gardeners who use its innovative lawnmowers, trimmers and other
machines for preening their gardens, Flymo has always prided itself on being
able to follow a fairly straight line. Yet in the past few years it must
have performed more gyrations than almost any other company which geared up
well ahead of this month's dismantling of European trade barriers. In
response to sharp changes in the marketplace, it has had to rethink strategy
and tactics several times.
The rethinking done by this successful British company, which employs 450
staff, has been considerable. Since the Financial Times last wrote about its
continental European strategy four years ago, it has changed tack on several
counts, most recently just two months ago.
Having abandoned hope in the late 1980s that the 'hover' mowers which made
its name on its home market would ever sell in mass-market volume on the
Continent, it has now revised its view again; thanks to improved product
design, hover sales are starting to accelerate in several continental
countries, notably France, Denmark and Norway.
On the other hand, the 'wheeled rotary' mower which Flymo launched in 1989
especially to suit continental markets 'has not done well there - we've
found it much tougher than we expected', admits Les Evans, the managing
director. Only a quarter of its sales have been made on the Continent. But
with the addition of a roller it has sold unexpectedly well in the UK,
carving out a new segment.
Thanks to the hover boost, Flymo's continental export drive has been
transformed from a tentative toe-dipping exercise in 1988 into a rapid
forward march. In spite of a slide in prices, the value of its total exports
 -most of which go to the Continent - has nearly doubled to Pounds 15m, and
is pitched to quadruple over the next four years. At the same time total
sales have risen by 'only' a half, to Pounds 73m.
It had inadequate influence over how its products were distributed and sold
by the various continental sales companies of its parent group, Electrolux.
But it has now persuaded most of them to slash overheads and sales prices by
cutting out the wholesaling link in their distribution chains. They now sell
direct to retailers.
It is on the verge of annexing staff from those sales companies and
integrating them into its own organisation, run from Newton Aycliffe in
north-east England. This single European organisation will have key managers
dispersed across several countries.
That some of these steps have been made necessary, and others possible, is
thanks to three factors.
First, the speed with which, against all expectations, a European 'single
market' in lawn and garden machinery is being created by several combined
forces: the rise of powerful retail chains, some of which are selling across
national borders; a flood of cut-price, low-specification, standard imports
from Italy and the US; and the impact of the recession on consumers'
readiness to buy these machines. Little is now made of the climatic
variations and different consumer habits which just four years ago were
expected to keep the European market fragmented indefinitely.
This retail-driven convergence of consumer buying patterns has enabled Flymo
to cut production and inventory overheads by slashing the number of variants
of each product. Instead of seven, it now has just two: for the UK (with a
240 watt voltage, and different plug), and for the rest of Europe.
The second enabling factor behind Flymo's rethink is the financial strength
which has brought it through four of the worst years for European garden
machinery that anyone can remember, because of the way drought combined with
recession. That strength flows from the company's low break-even point and
its commitment to product innovation even through hard times; the latter
pays off in the form of a stream of successful product launches, and in
healthy cash flow.
The third factor - partly the result of the previous one - is the backing
that Evans has had from his Swedish parent in his sometimes fraught
discussions with Electrolux sales companies across Europe. It has helped him
considerably that, 18 months ago, he was promoted to the position of a
European 'product line manager' within Electrolux, reporting direct to its
president in Stockholm.
Previously, he had a product line manager above him. As part of the move,
Evans was given responsibility for the consolidated profitability of all
Flymo's sales, including those through staff in continental countries who in
other respects reported to local Electrolux managers.
For companies in other industries faced with intense price competition and
over-costly distribution arrangements in European markets, Flymo's
experience over the past four years is especially instructive, in spite of
its unusual position within a large multinational.
In 1988, it was faced with trying to sell through a set of sister companies
which were unused to having direct relations with retail chains. Instead,
they used wholesalers to distribute to specialist dealers.
In most national markets, the structure of the distribution chain for
imported machines was also so complicated, and the mark-ups for each link
(sales company, wholesaler and retailer) so generous, that selling prices
had to be pitched up to twice as high as those in Britain. They were far
higher than for local manufacturers.
In extreme cases, Electrolux sales companies were trying to make a margin of
40 per cent, wholesalers 20 per cent and retailers 40 per cent. The
resulting consumer price in Scandinavia was more than four times the factory
cost, against less than 2 1/2 times in Britain.
'This created a vicious circle,' says Phil McGrath, Flymo's sales director.
'It drove sales down to the extent that we were literally going backwards.
With the French and German markets shifting quickly from feature-driven
brands to own-label low-specification imports through hypermarkets and other
retail chains, it was very serious.'
But this situation also gave Flymo a perfect opportunity to confront the
sales companies. It began to attack the problem by showing them a
spreadsheet with the UK manufactured costs and all the mark-ups, plus the
consolidated result which Flymo wanted to achieve. It explained that this
could be done only if the sales companies cut out the wholesale link, and
added mass distribution to their network of specialist dealers.
A further weapon which it was able to wield over the sales companies was the
growth of cross-border retailing, which has been rapid over the past couple
of years on the Continent. Evans and McGrath told the Danish, Norwegian and
Swedish sales companies that they would have to sell at a common price, as
would those in Benelux, Germany, Austria and Switzerland. 'We said 'if you
don't co-operate, the retailer will buy from your sister company across the
border',' says Evans. With product specifications no longer varying between
countries, 'that was a hell of an incentive'.
In the short term, from 1990, Flymo used its financial muscle to subsidise
local losses while the sales companies cut prices and broke into the mass
market. Some of the national Electrolux sales companies were also ready to
help foot the bill for a time. 'We had to support some markets more than
others, but we saw it as a brand investment,' says Evans.
In the medium-term, the obvious answer was to cut overheads to the bone by
redesigning the entire structure of Flymo's sales, internal administration,
warehousing and distribution so as to remove duplication of activities
between head office and the sales companies.
There will be a single warehouse - probably at UK headquarters - provided
delivery across Europe in three days can be guaranteed.
A project team began work on the details last November, just after Evans and
McGrath - in another rethink - had decided to move straight to a
pan-European structure, rather than via an interim one with four regions.
From this autumn in France, local sales staff will be transferred to Flymo,
plugging directly into its UK computer network and all its other systems.
Shipping, but not invoicing, is already being done direct from Newton
Aycliffe. In late 1994, the same structure will be extended to other
continental markets.
From then on, Flymo will really be operating as a single market company.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Economics: Markets focus on latest indicators for signs of
renewed UK activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER A week of worryingly bleak indicators on the UK economy, today's M4
lending figures and Confederation of British Industry manufacturing trends
survey will be scrutinised all the more carefully for signs that consumer
and business activity is stirring.
M0, mainly notes and coins in circulation, has shown a strong rise for two
consecutive months, but M4 bank lending - bank and building society lending
 -fell by Pounds 600m in November. Most economists are forecasting only a
moderate rise in December.
'It seems that underlying demand from both the personal and corporate
sectors remains hesitant, though we expect some pick up in response to the
lower interest rates over the next six months,' said Ms Ruth Lea, chief
economist at Mitsubishi Bank in London.
The CBI survey will give an indication of business sentiment, activity and
pricing intentions. Many economists are expecting a more optimistic survey
than the last quarterly analysis which was carried out before most of the
latest base rate cuts.
This week also sees the last of the current series of UK trade figures.
After Thursday there will be no more data for intra-EC trade until June
while a new system, in line with the single market, is introduced.
The black-out will be imposed on a sad state of affairs. The visible trade
deficit in November was a worse-than-expected Pounds 1.4bn, with the value
of imports up by more than the increase in exports. That took the cumulative
trade deficit for the first 11 months of last year to Pounds 12bn.
Here are some of the week's other economic highlights. The figures in
brackets, from MMS International, are the median of economists' forecasts.

cent on
year).
Friday: France, December unemployment rate; US, December durable goods
orders (up 1.2 per cent), December durable shipments, December personal
income (up 0.3 per cent), December personal consumption expenditure (up 0.6
per cent), January Chicago NAPM, January Michigan Sentiment index, December

(L53trillion), December trade balance (l8trillion deficit), December hourly
wage (up 2.1 per cent), December balance of payments (L3.4trillion surplus),
December cumulative PSBR (L161.7trillion), December bank lending (up 11.5
per cent), December M2 (up 6.7 per cent on year); Belgium, January CPI (up
2.3 per cent on year).

RESULTS DUE
A FALL in interim profits is expected when WH Smith, the retail and
distribution group, announces figures to the end of November on Wednesday.
Losses in Do It All, its do-it-yourself joint venture with Boots, will drag
profits lower, from Pounds 50.1m to around Pounds 45m pre-tax, analysts
reckon, including the pension credit Smith enjoys. Investors will also be
looking for a report on Christmas trading.
It is the January sales which are critical for MFI Furniture Group, the
kitchen and bedroom retailer which floated last summer and which reports for
the first time in its new form on Thursday.
Although last year's January sales were strong, brokers think MFI could have
beaten the numbers this year.
As for the interim figures, to November 7, brokers are somewhat in the dark
without any comparable figures. Estimates are for a fall in operating
profits from Pounds 24.2m to around Pounds 18m to Pounds 20m.
Misys, the acquisitive computing services group led by a former Hanson
executive, Kevin Lomax, is due to report its interim results on Thursday.
Pre-tax profits are expected to increase to around Pounds 6.3m from Pounds
3.59m a year earlier.
The group has made a spectacular comeback since its disastrous 1990-91
financial year when its shares bottomed at 63p. They now stand at 375p.
Unitech, the international electronics group, is still bearing the scars of
the slowdown in the Japanese economy.
The company, which ranks as the world's largest manufacturer of power
supplies for electronic equipment, is likely on Thursday to report a decline
in first half pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.1m from Pounds 7.8m in the
comparable period.

FT  25 JAN 93 / South-east expected to lag in upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE south-east of England will lag behind most of the rest of the nation in
a slow economic recovery this year, according to National Westminster Bank.
The region is expected to show below-average growth of less than 0.6 per
cent, while Wales and the north will grow by up to 1.1 per cent, Mr David
Kern, the bank's chief economist, writes in the February issue of its
Economic and Financial Outlook.
Growth for the UK as a whole this year will be 0.9 per cent, but
unemployment will continue to rise, reaching 3.35m by the end of this year,
an increase of 13 per cent over the year. Unemployment in the south-east
will grow by 18 per cent by the end of the year. The jobless rate in the
south-east in December was 10.1 per cent, and the rate nationally was 10.5
per cent in January.
The bank expects interest rates to fall a further 1 percentage point soon.
As a consequence, headline inflation will fall to a low of 1.8 per cent in
May. The headline figure was 2.6 per cent this month.
Underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest rates, will drop to
3.5 per cent over the next few months from 3.7 per cent this month. But
inflation will rise and increase pressure to raise interest rates towards
the end of the year. As a result, underlying inflation will be 4.8 per cent
next year.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Ministers review pension provision: Proposal would encourage
personal plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is considering raising the retirement age for women to 65 and
using the cost savings to encourage millions of people to opt out of the
state basic pension scheme in favour of their own personal pensions.
The plan is still in the early stages of development and has grown out of
the government's review of plans to equalise pension ages for men and women.
Raising women's retirement age to 65, although politically unpopular, will
generate Pounds 3bn in savings, while lowering men's retirement age to 60
will cost about the same amount. Equalising at 63 produces no cost savings.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, is expected to recommend raising
the retirement age for women to 65 to match that of men in a white paper to
be published in late spring.
The government's own social security advisory committee recommended
equalising at 65, but using the cost savings to help the worst-off among the
elderly - mostly women with no occupational pension.
But government ministers are said to have reacted unenthusiastically to the
proposal and the Treasury has taken the view that any cost savings should be
diverted to general revenues.
Ministers are said to be aware of several stumbling blocks that could make
opting out of the state basic pension scheme difficult.
They are aware that a big hurdle to any change would be a sharp increase in
costs to the Treasury in the early stages of transition. This would see
revenues from national insurance contributions fall without any parallel
re-duction in pension payment liabilities.
The plan envisages using the Pounds 3bn in cost savings from equalising at
65 to cover the shortfall in national insurance contributions that will
result from the opt-out.
The UK operates a 'pay-as- you-go' system in which national insurance
contributions pay the pensions of those who have already retired.
If significant numbers of workers were to opt out of the basic scheme, there
would not be enough money to pay present pension liabilities. It is possible
that in the early years of an opt-out scheme additional tax revenues would
have to be committed to meet basic pension costs.
Also, ministers are concerned that if the scheme does not provide for
automatic diversion of national insurance contributions to a
personal-pension scheme, individuals might be tempted simply to spend the
tax break and fail to save for their old age.
The scheme is one of a number of radical measures under study by Mr Michael
Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury.
It aims to build on the right to opt out of the state earnings related
pension scheme (Serps), taken up by about 4.5m people since the right was
introduced in 1988.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Businesses 'are not ready for recovery'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY BUSINESSES risk insolvency because they are not ready to cope with the
end of the recession, a study by accountancy firm Grant Thornton says.
The survey of 108 members of the Confederation of British Industry in the
north-west found that most expect sales to grow in the next three years and
more than half will need extra finance for capital spending or working
capital.
But the study, by Mr Amin Amiri, a corporate finance partner at Grant
Thornton, shows poor planning, inadequate use of financial and management
information, and reluctance to employ proven management techniques or to
seek help from professional advisers.
Risks appear greater among medium-size companies turning over less than
Pounds 5m. More than 70 per cent will require extra funding in the near
future, but some believe they will need less than their expected growth
suggests.
The study shows many companies relying on a bank overdraft to fund
expansion. Most said they had been able to get extra facilities from their
banks in the past.
But the report warns those relying heavily on overdrafts that with working
capital tight in all businesses 'an increase in trading may result in
insufficient funds and an inevitable collapse of businesses'.
The report says that 54 per cent of companies surveyed do not make use of
available information on their own industry and their competitors, 30 per
cent do not have a business plan and 46 per cent have made no projections
for up to five years ahead.
'Lack of overall and comprehensive information to allow business planning is
not limited to smaller businesses and is evident among some large ones,' the
report says.
It concludes: 'There seems to be some reluctance to use professional
management techniques and professional advisers when dealing with an
acquisition or a project requiring funding.'

FT  25 JAN 93 / Discount food retailers lift sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISCOUNT food retailers are becoming a significant force in the food market
and could double their sales by 1996, according to Verdict, the retail
market research company.
In a report published today, Verdict says discounters have doubled their
annual sales in 10 years, to Pounds 4bn last year. Their numbers are
increasing, leading to intensified competition in the sector.
Two years ago there were only three discount chains trading in the UK - Kwik
Save, Lo-Cost, part of the Argyll group, and Normans, part of the Merchant
Retail Group. These have been supplemented by two discount retailers from
Germany - Aldi and Netto.
Existing supermarket chains have introduced discount formats to revive the
fortunes of old or underperforming stores. These include Food Giant and Solo
(both operated by Gateway), Pioneer (the Co-op) and Dales (Asda). Isle of
Man-based Shoprite has opened 33 discount stores in Scotland and plans 22
more this year.
A comparative survey by Verdict found that Netto offered the cheapest prices
for a basket of 40 basic items. Its total was 16 per cent lower than the
average of the lowest available prices for a similar basket at Sainsbury,
Tesco, Asda and Safeway stores, and 10 per cent lower than the average among
the 10 discounters surveyed. Next cheapest were Kwik Save, 14 per cent
cheaper than the superstores' average, and Aldi, 12 per cent cheaper.
Sales of goods at petrol forecourt shops increased by 10 per cent to almost
Pounds 1.7bn last year, research group Corporate Intelligence says in a
report today.
Although cigarettes, confectionery and ice cream remained the leading items,
sales of grocery goods were growing. The report predicted sustained growth
in forecourt shop sales at well above the rate for other retailing outlets.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Dispute over Lambeth fraud inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAMBETH council's ruling Labour group has failed to agree the form of an
inquiry into its chief executive's allegations of 'unprecedented' fraud, in
spite of meetings lasting into the early hours of Saturday morning.
Mr Steve Whaley, Labour leader on the south London borough, said yesterday
that reports that Mr Andrew Arden QC, a leading housing-law practitioner,
would carry out the inquiry were 'premature' and that a decision would not
be taken until further meetings in 10 days' time.
One Labour councillor reported 'strong disagreement' over the nature of the
inquiry while opposition councillors said they were not consulted about
either the remit of the investigation or the choice of investigator.
The Labour leadership, dismayed at the resurrection of its 'loony left'
local government image, is anxious for a swift response to allegations in
the report by Mr Herman Ouseley, the chief executive, that over the last 10
years payments of more than Pounds 10m were not properly authorised, with
contracts and redundancy payments awarded illegally and many cases of
over-charging.
It could be several weeks before any inquiry starts and Lambeth's Labour
group has agreed it should have until June to report.
Mr Michael English, secretary of the Labour group, said any inquiry should
be 'as wide-ranging as possible'. As well as a QC he wants it to include an
accountant, a civil engineer and possibly a trade unionist.
Mr Arden conducted Hackney council's inquiry into claims of a freemasons'
corruption racket in the late 1980s.
Mr Keith Fitchett, deputy leader of Lambeth's Liberal Democrats, said that
further inquiry into the Mr Ouseley's report was 'superfluous'. He added:
'It should now be a matter for the police. One of the major reasons for the
current scandal is that recommendations of the last full inquiry into
malpractice in the borough, in 1987, were not implemented.'
Friday night's debate on Mr Ouseley's report was acrimonious. The council's
housing and direct-services departments tabled responses of more than 100
pages. Opposition councillors claimed that information in the hands of some
Labour members had not been made available to them.
Police are already investigating claims made in Mr Ouseley's report.

FT  25 JAN 93 / End in sight for 27-year liquidation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER 27 years creditors of an insolvent insurance company have been offered
their first payment, signalling an end to one of the longest company
liquidations.
Liquidators of St Helen's Insurance, which stopped writing new business in
1966, have offered to pay a dividend at the end of next year provided
creditors agree to make no further claims against the business.
The company has less than Pounds 30m in assets against liabilities of nearly
Pounds 87m, indicating a maximum dividend of 34p in the pound.
Creditors have been warned that they may have to wait until next century for
their money if they refuse to accept the offer.
St Helen's represents a microcosm of the calamities which have hit insurers
in the past 30 years. The company, founded in 1938, temporarily ceased
underwriting in 1965 after receiving claims for more than Pounds 1m
following Hurricane Betsy. This caused catastrophic damage to property in
the south-east of the US and generated what was then the largest insured
loss from a single disaster - more than Dollars 1bn.
A capital restructuring in 1966 failed to remedy the company's difficulties.
Since then St Helen's has been hit by a growing number of claims for
asbestosis, medical negligence, and product liability.
Shareholders to the company - mainly Lloyd's syndicates and corporate
insurers - continued to keep it solvent with new equity until 1984, when
liquidators were finally appointed.
New claims notified to the company have continued to grow to more than 1,000
a month currently, including many caused by environmental pollution clean-up
costs in the US.
Mr Ian Bond, joint liquidator and a partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand Bond, said
that the alternative for creditors was to wait for payment until all claims
came in, which could be another 20 years.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Brown attacks Tories over banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR WILL this week seek to anticipate a Treasury review of the
high-street banks' treatment of their customers by publishing its own
damning report on charges, interest-rate margins and commissions.
At the same time Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, will charge the
government with serving the interests of the banking community before those
of the public as a direct consequence of the Tories' many close personal
connections with the sector. Labour's report will list several Tory MPs or
former MPs who sit on bank boards or act as bank consultants.
Mr Brown is due to meet members of the Bank Action Group, a consumers'
lobby, before a conference on banking practice tomorrow at which he will
renew Labour's call for a public inquiry into alleged excessive charges and
inadequate services. Labour says bank charges have increased by Pounds 1.5bn
since 1989 and customer complaints have risen from 1,682 to 10,109 a year
over the past five years.
Meanwhile, the Treasury review of banking practices, expected to be unveiled
this week by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, may call on the banks to
appoint internal ombudsmen to tackle the complaints of small-business
customers. The review is expected to confirm that there has been a large
increase in business tariffs but is also thought likely largely to exonerate
the banks from charges that they have not passed on interest-rate cuts.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Health row sparks further cabinet infighting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL infighting in Mr John Major's cabinet over issues ranging from the
future of the coal industry to reform of the police has been fuelled by a
new row over the health service.
The latest dispute, which has brought to a head long-simmering disagreements
over the role of regional health authorities, means there are now more than
half-a-dozen unresolved arguments in the highest ranks of the government.
The rows have fuelled an atmosphere of intrigue around the cabinet table,
with senior ministers accusing each other of making pre-emptive strikes
through press leaks.
Mr Major has publicly characterised the differences as healthy debate. He
has also sought to stamp out charges from the rightwing of the Tory party
that the debate over subsidies for the coal industry represents a crucial
test of his government's free-market credentials.
In the prime minister's view it is question of pragmatism rather than
principle - some subsidy for the industry is essential to avoid a renewed
Tory rebellion which might overturn the government's 21-seat Commons
majority.
Senior Downing Street aides have been seeking to identify the sources of the
leaks. Initial suspicion over the coal leak has fallen on Mrs Gillian
Shephard, the employment secretary, and Mr Michael Howard, the environment
secretary.
The fury of Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, at the
persistent attacks on his plans is mirrored by the irritation of Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the home secretary, at ministerial briefings against his plans for
the police. Several cabinet ministers - including Mr Howard; Mr William
Waldegrave, the public-service minister; and Mr David Hunt, the Welsh
secretary - have attacked Mr Clarke's proposal to deprive local authorities
of their role in police authorities. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary
and Mr Clarke's predecessor at the Home Office, has written to the prime
minister to register his objections.
The latest dispute over the health service - quite separate from the
wrangling over implementation of the Tomlinson report on London's hospitals
 -has pitted Mr Clarke and Mr Waldegrave against Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the
health secretary. After an acrimonious meeting of the relevant cabinet
committee the two former health ministers have forced Mrs Bottomley to
rethink plans to give regional health authorities a significant role in the
supervision of NHS trust hospitals.
Mr Hurd has emerged as Mr Waldegrave's sole ally in his attempts to secure
firm commitments from cabinet colleagues to reduce Whitehall secrecy as he
prepares a white paper on open government. One colleague has described Mr
Waldegrave as a 'persistent nuisance' but Mr Major is promising him his
personal backing.
In a separate dispute over how the government should respond to the prospect
of the jobless total topping 3m, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is
resisting proposals by Mrs Shephard for an expensive package to guarantee
work for the long-term unemployed. Other internal battles include that
between Mr Malcolm Rikind, the defence secretary, and Mr Ian Lang, the
Scottish secretary, over the future of the Rosyth and Devonport naval

Mr Major's trip to India will ensure that the disputes simmer at least for
the rest of this week, but Downing Street is promising a clutch of decisions
early next month.
Senior officials are making the best of the public airing of internal
debates by claiming it gives the lie to criticism that the government is not
confronting difficult decisions.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Public sector pay curbs attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAY CURBS for public-sector employees are guaranteed to provoke a hostile
reaction from unions, Ms Rhiannon Chapman, director of the Industrial
Society, the independent advisory and training organisation, said yesterday.
She said ministers might have underestimated opposition to the 1.5 per cent
wage limit, and warned of the dangers of the government's plan to abolish
wages councils, which set minimum rates for low-paid workers.
'It is not obvious how the economy will be helped by licensing poverty-pay
cowboys to undercut reputable companies providing a respectable service,'
she wrote in the society's newsletter. 'It is possible that ministers
calculate that employment legislation has emasculated unions to the point
where opposition to these steps is unsustainable. They should think again.'

FT  25 JAN 93 / Armani accused of copying design
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO young British designers have taken legal action against Giorgio Armani,
one of the giants of Italian fashion, for allegedly copying their design.
Mr Antoni Burakowski and Ms Alison Roberts - known professionally as Antoni
&amp; Alison - claim that a T-shirt in this winter's Armani collection is based
very closely on one that they designed in 1989 and displayed in Italy,
including Mr Armani's home base of Milan.
The Antoni &amp; Alison T-shirt bears the words 'I feel amazing fantastic
incredible brilliant fabulous great', while the Armani shirt says 'I feel
outrageous amazing brilliant terrific great' with a similar lay-out.
Mr Mark Stephens, Antoni &amp; Alison's London solicitor, said yesterday that a
writ had been issued against Mr Armani personally and against three of his
companies. The first pre-trial hearing is due on Thursday.
In their defence, the Armani companies admit that the design printed on
their T-shirt was 'inspired' by Antoni &amp; Alison but deny any wrong-doing.
They say the original design is 'neither artistic nor original'.
Antoni &amp; Alison would be seeking damages in the region of Pounds 300,000, Mr
Stephens said. Armani had already withdrawn its T-shirt from sale in the UK.
Mr Burakowski said the case was ironic because 'Armani himself is a frequent
victim of copying and often has to sue people to protect his name'.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Borrie to head debt advice trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR GORDON Borrie, the former director-general of fair trading, has become
chairman of the Money Advice Trust, which collects donations from banks and
building societies to fund debt counselling at institutions such as citizens
advice bureaux.
Sir Gordon, who succeeds Sir George Blunden, has been appointed in an effort
to raise the level of donations. Although the trust has a target of
attracting donations of Pounds 3m a year, it received only about Pounds
235,000 last year, its second full year of operation.
The trust has had difficulty attracting donations from building societies
because they have wanted to maintain the repayment of mortgage arrears as
the first priority for those in debt.
Sir Gordon said, however, that he believed attitudes among building
societies were changing because they were realising the value of independent
debt counselling.
The trust, which was established after a call from Sir Gordon in 1987 for
the credit industry to contribute to debt counselling, has funded support
services for money advisers and is trying to establish a national telephone
debt counselling service.
Mr Adam Carnegie-Brown, director of the trust, said it was maintaining its
target for private-sector donations in spite of the low level achieved last
year. The trust's annual report and accounts will be published soon.
He added that the trust had attracted an additional Pounds 20,000 of
benefits in kind and it had been encouraged by the number of new donors. He
said it would be wrong to revise the Pounds 3m target downwards because it
would send an inappropriate signal.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Councils and unions back N-plant plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER 10 weeks of public consultation, two-thirds of responses received to
British Nuclear Fuels' controversial Thorp reprocessing plant at Sellafield
in Cumbria are opposed to the plan.
There has been strong support for the plant from local councils and unions,
however. They are concerned that abandoning the plant and its 1,200 jobs
would worsen unemployment in Cumbria.
The public consultation, which ends today, is being conducted by HMIP, the
pollution inspectorate. It must assess whether the plant would threaten
health or the environment, and it needs to decide within weeks whether to
hold a wider public inquiry, which could take months or even years.
The complex questions raised over Thorp, which has agreed contracts worth
about Pounds 6bn with overseas customers, mean that its future will also
depend on an interdepartmental government debate which has been taking place
since November.
BNFL has said there is no health or environmental reason why the plant
should not start operating, and there is a sound economic case that it
should do so soon. However, environmentalists have repeatedly challenged
this.
By Friday night the pollution inspectorate had received 20,000 responses
from the public, local authorities and industry in addition to 38,000
written responses in the months before the 10-week period of formal
consultation started. Of the 20,000 letters, 13,400 were against the start
of the plant and 6,600 in favour. Many of the rest are standard letters
organised by environmental groups.
The main support for the plant has come from local councils and unions.
Copeland Borough Council, whose region includes Sellafield, has written to
the inspectorate saying that authorisation should be granted, but that BNFL
should continue to try to reduce radioactive discharges.
Cumbria County Council, which held a special meeting on Friday to agree its
submission to the pollution inspectorate, has argued that there are no
radiological grounds for holding back from commissioning Thorp.
The Sellafield unions, campaigning under the slogan 'Trust Thorp', expect
today to deliver about 14,000 letters from members of the public supporting
Thorp to the inspectorate.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Threat to rail lines denied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MacGregor, transport secretary, yesterday denied that rail
privatisation would bring widespread line closures but refused to guarantee
that the present network would be preserved indefinitely.
He was responding to speculation that the privatisation plans, published in
the Railways Bill on Friday, could lead to the closure of up to 1,000 miles
of branch and rural lines.
Mr MacGregor said on BBC1's On The Record that lossmaking services would
continue to be subsidised and statutory closure procedures would be just as
rigorous under the new regime as they were now. 'I can't give a guarantee
for all time because obviously if no one is actually wanting to go on a
particular line, then that would be a candidate for closure,' he said.
He also tried to play down fears of big fare increases after privatisation.
'I see no reason why, as a result of our proposals, prices should rise any
more than they have been rising recently,' he said.
Mr Charles Kennedy, MP and president of the Liberal Democrats, called on
opponents of rail privatisation from all quarters of the Commons to unite
against the bill. He said: 'I believe that we should use our collective
imagination on this issue to isolate the government diehards and be seen by
the public to be getting our act together where relevant in the national
interest.'

FT  25 JAN 93 / Offer of payment after 27 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER 27 YEARS, creditors of an insolvent insurance company have been
offered their first payment, signalling an end to one of the longest company
liquidations.
Liquidators of St Helen's Insurance, which stopped writing new business in
1966, have offered to pay a dividend at the end of next year provided
creditors agree to make no further claims against the business.
The company has less than Pounds 30m in assets against liabilities of nearly
Pounds 87m, indicating a maximum dividend of 34p in the pound.
Creditors have been warned that they may have to wait until next century for
their money if they refuse to accept the offer.
The misfortunes of St Helen's are typical of the calamities which have hit
insurers in the past 30 years. The company, founded in 1938, temporarily
ceased underwriting in 1965 after receiving claims for more than Pounds 1m
following Hurricane Betsy. This generated what was then the largest insured
loss from a single disaster - more than Dollars 1bn.
A capital restructuring in 1966 failed to remedy the company's difficulties.
Since then St Helen's has been hit by a growing number of claims for
asbestosis, medical negligence, and product liability.
Shareholders in the company - mainly Lloyd's syndicates and corporate
insurers - continued to keep it solvent with new equity until 1984, when
liquidators were appointed.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Ashdown calls for change to monarchy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday joined prominent
members of Labour's front bench in arguing for a fundamental overhaul of the
workings of the monarchy.
His remarks will stir fresh debate on the opposition benches at a time when
the Labour leadership has been trying to play down the issue for fear of
alienating royalist voters.
A straw poll of 100 Labour MPs in The Sunday Telegraph yesterday showed
almost a quarter want a republic, 32 per cent a monarchy along Dutch or
Scandinavian lines and only 14 per cent back the royal family continuing
unchanged.
Meanwhile, Dr John Habgood, the archbishop of York, said the religious
make-up of the country had changed so much that the Church of England must
debate the privileged position it held with the monarchy.
On the BBC Heart of the Matter programme he said he believed the coronation
oath, in which the sovereign pledges to uphold the Church of England, would
have to be revised when a new king or queen ascended the throne.
Mr Ashdown said on the BBC's Breakfast With Frost programme he believed it
unlikely that Britain would opt for a 'bicycling monarchy' as witnessed
elsewhere in northern Europe.
But Mr Ashdown added: 'We could strip away some of the pomp and circumstance
of the monarchy, bring it closer to the reality of life in Britain.
'I hazard a guess that that's a view held, for instance, by Prince Charles
and perhaps her majesty herself.'
Arguing that Britain looked increasingly out of date and also advocating the
case for the disestablishment of the Church of England, he added that the
royal family could easily perform its constitutional role by functioning on
a more modest scale.
The Liberal Democrat leader's comments add to the difficulties of Mr John
Smith, who has intentionally sought to avoid entering into the controversy
over the royal family's future.
The Labour leader had been planning to make a speech on constitutional
reform early next month, but has now postponed it.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ATTEMPT by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to win
parliamentary time for legislation to modernise the regulation and
protection of trademarks has been rebuffed by the government's business
managers.
A bill to implement the EC trademark directive as well as updating trademark
law more generally has been drafted for some time, but Mr Tony Newton,
leader of the Commons, and the government whips have made it clear it cannot
be introduced in the current session because of the amount of other
business.
Supporters of the bill point out that beyond the straightforward merits of
legislating, doing so would strengthen the UK's case for having the EC
trademarks office in London rather than in one of the other three cities
that have applied for it.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Mirror union seeks injunction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUJ journalists union will today seek a High Court injunction to stop
the management of the Daily Mirror newspaper from introducing a five-night
shift for sub-editors, Raymond Snoddy writes.
Journalists say the change from four to five shifts a week was introduced
without proper warning or consultation. Department heads were told on Friday
that staff rotas introducing a five-shift week were to start yesterday.
Sub-editors, who can work as late as 3am, traditionally work a four-night
week. Reporters work a five-day week.
The change will not mean an increase in the number of hours worked. The
34-hour week specified in the union agreement will be spread over five
shifts.
Mr Peter Woods, of Stephens Innocent, the NUJ's legal representatives, said
it was possible to vary the terms of the agreement but not unilaterally and
without consultation.
The Mirror's management said the agreement provided for five-day working and
that four-day working had grown up 'almost without the management knowing
about it'.
Staff at the Daily Mirror were working normally yesterday but under protest
at the new shift pattern.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBERT Evans, the chairman of British Gas, has warned the prime minister
that Britain needs large, viable companies if it is to compete overseas.
A joint venture between British Gas and India's Gas Authority is expected to
be agreed this week as part of Mr John Major's tour of India. The contract,
to set up and operate a distribution network in Bombay, is worth Pounds
100m. Further projects in India could follow.
Mr Evans, who accompanied Mr Major to India, said such projects depended on
financial strength and large-scale research and development.
British Gas is awaiting a report by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on
its possible break-up and Mr Evans said: 'If we were small and fractured
like the electrical industry I think that we would find it very difficult.
You do require large, viable entities.'
He had a private talk with Mr Major during the flight to India and said
afterwards that the prime minister agreed 'that we need strong British
companies'.
Downing Street indicated that Mr Major had yet to consider the possible
implications of the MMC investigation into the dominant market position of
British Gas.
Mr Evans said the government's reaction would be 'to some extent political
decisions'. The spliting of British Gas into a transport and storage arm and
a trading arm has been proposed by Ofgas, the industry's regulator.
The gas distribution network was a natural monopoly but a break-up could
jeopardise further price cuts in addition to those British Gas had made
since privatisation. He added: 'If we are to continue that kind of progress
we have really got to have access to the cheapest possible gas. We are in a
global marketplace and we need global players.'
British Gas had regarded overseas expansion as a priority because it had
'virtually saturated' the UK market. But Mr Evans acknowledged there was
resistance in many countries to foreign investors buying into utilities.
The company estimates that spending on gas-related activities in India could
be worth up to Pounds 2bn in the next 10 years.

It found that 34 per cent thought that linguistic skills are of 'no

Only 16 per cent believed it was of 'considerable importance' while half
said it was of 'limited importance'.
The lack of interest shown by London's companies in employing secretaries
who are versatile in a foreign language has grown over the past 12 months,
according to the survey.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIGNIFICANT benefits can be achieved by contracting out government computer
services to the private sector, a report from the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development says.
The Paris-based organisation says countries which have put computer services
out to tender can save 20 per cent to 30 per cent of costs, even when the
contract is won by the in-house team. Contracting out also improves the
quality of service, especially where governments lack the staff with
necessary skills.
The report appears as the UK government plans to increase the contracting
out of Civil Service work 50-fold, with information technology services
accounting for the largest proportion by value.
The OECD says sharing government information technology development with the
private sector can stimulate industrial development, especially among small
and medium-sized enterprises. This could improve a country's international
competitiveness in these applications.
Benefiting from this requires careful preparation, a clear understanding of
expectations, a good contract, strong project management and constant
monitoring. Unforeseen costs can arise where performance is unsatisfactory
or staff are demotivated.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Plan for opt-outs from state pension
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A PLAN to allow millions of people to opt out of the state retirement
pension is being examined by senior ministers as part of the government's
wholesale review of the welfare state.
The scheme is one of a number of radical measures being studied by Mr
Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury. It aims to build on
the right to opt out of the state earnings-related pension scheme which has
been taken up by 4.5m people since 1988.
Ministers are aware that a big hurdle to any change would be a sharp
increase in costs to the Treasury in the early stage of a transition. This
would see revenues from National Insurance Contributions fall without any
parallel reduction in pension payment liabilities.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Asdown calls for change to monarchy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday joined prominent
members of Labour's front bench in arguing for a fundamental overhaul of the
workings of the monarchy.
His remarks will stir fresh debate on the opposition benches at a time when
the Labour leadership has been trying to play down the issue for fear of
alienating royalist voters.
A straw poll of 100 Labour MPs in The Sunday Telegraph yesterday showed
almost a quarter want a republic, 32 per cent a monarchy along Dutch or
Scandinavian lines and only 14 per cent back the royal family continuing
unchanged.
Mr Ashdown said on BBC TV's Breakfast With Frost programme he believed it
unlikely that Britain would opt for a 'bicycling monarchy' as witnessed
elsewhere in northern Europe.
But Mr Asdown added: 'We could strip away some of the pomp and circumstance
of the monarchy, bring it closer to the reality of life in Britain.
'I hazard a guess that that's a view held, for instance, by Prince Charles
and perhaps her majesty herself.'
Arguing that Britain looked increasingly out of date and also advocating the
case for the disestablishment of the Chruch of England, he added that the
royal family could easily perform its constitutional role by functioning on
a more modest scale.
The Liberal Democrat leader's comments add to the difficulties of Mr John
Smith, who has intentionally sought to avoid entering into the controversy
over the royal family's future.
The Labour leader had been planning to make a speech on constitutional
reform early next month, but has now postponed it.
Dr John Habgood, the archbishop of York, said the religious make-up of the
country has changed so much that the Church of England must now debate the
privileged position it holds with the monarchy.
He said on the BBC Heart of the Matter programme he believed the coronation
oath, in which the sovereign pledges to uphold the Church of England, would
have to be revised when a new king or queen ascended the throne.

<TEXT>
MR LES ASPIN, the new US secretary of defence, yesterday said there were
signs that Iraq was moving its surface-to-air missiles back into the no-fly
zones. The US would need to watch the missiles in the next few days.
Mr Aspin said it was too early to say if President Saddam Hussein had broken
his self-declared goodwill ceasefire. 'I think we're going to wait a couple
of days to make sure,' he said.
A US Navy jet bombed a radar site in southern Iraq on Saturday. US military
officials said they believed the aircraft had been fired on from the ground
but confirmed that Iraqi radar had not, as at first believed, locked on to
it. Iraq denied firing on the aircraft and said it remained committed to its
ceasefire declaration.
A United Nations team of nuclear weapons inspectors is set to fly into
Baghdad today on a delayed but routine mission. They are expected to examine
damage to the al-Rabiya site, south of Baghdad, which was attacked last week
by US cruise missiles.
The mission, the 17th by nuclear weapons inspectors to Iraq since the end of
the Gulf war, is led by Mr Maurizio Zifferero.
He said after the US raid that he was 'very keen' to log the damage caused
by the attack. The eight-member team will join about 70 UN inspectors who
returned to Iraq last week. A team of ballistic missile experts will also
fly into Iraq today.

FT  25 JAN 93 / NY Post staff take 20% pay cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYEES at the New York Post voted last night to accept a temporary 20 per
cent pay cut that the owner, property developer Mr Peter Kalikow, says is
needed to keep the newspaper open.
The cut, to be accompanied by a 25 per cent increase in the newspaper's
cover price, was proposed by Mr Kalikow on Friday after Bankers Trust, the
Post's banker, said it would no longer provide a Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.2m)
revolving line of credit.
If the staff had rejected his proposal, Mr Kalikow had threatened to shut
down the 192-year-old Post, the oldest newspaper in the US.
While three of the Post's nine unions had agreed to the month-long pay cut
on Saturday, it was not until last night that the remaining six unions
agreed. Union leaders representing the paper's 720 employees had advised
members to accept the pay cut.
But the drivers' union did not agree to take the pay cut until late in the
day, and it was expected last night that publication of the newspaper would
be temporarily suspended.
Yesterday's decision ensures that Bankers Trust will provide credit to the
Post for 30 more days, giving Mr Kalikow more time to find a buyer, or an
investor, to save the paper.
Mr Kalikow says he has been in talks with three unnamed groups of investors.
Speculation about their identities yesterday centred on Canadian businessman
and newspaper owner Mr Conrad Black, on the New York Daily News, the Post's
main tabloid rival, and on Mr Rupert Murdoch, who sold the paper to Mr
Kalikow in 1988 for almost Dollars 38m (Pounds 25m).

FT  25 JAN 93 / Key Brazil economy post filled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S President Itamar Franco has appointed two women to run key
ministries, completing his cabinet and confirming the government's
centre-left slant.
Ms Yeda Crusius, an economics professor from the university of Rio Grande do
Sul, takes over the important Planning Ministry from Mr Paulo Haddad, who
was recently named economy minister. Ms Luiza Erundina, the left-wing former
mayor of Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city, is to be administration minister.
Both appointments have met widespread approval. A leading light of the
radical Workers' Party (PT), Ms Erundina was widely respected as mayor, as
well as for her no-nonsense attitude and honesty - a crucial qualification
after the corruption scandal which brought down the last government.
Her acceptance of the ministry has, however, angered the leadership of the
PT, which is theoretically in opposition but which now has two members in
the government.
Ms Crusius, a member of the Social Democrats, is a friend of Mr Haddad and
thus expected to avoid the usual conflicts between the economy and planning
ministries.
She joins the economics team amid growing fears over inflation. After more
than a year of monthly inflation between 20 and 25 per cent, predictions for
this month have been revised to 28 per cent and the president has summoned
supermarket owners to explain basic food price rises of 40 per cent.
After accepting the post on Saturday, Ms Crusius said her priorities
included development and cutting interest rates. Describing the free market
as 'a utopia', she said the state had a role in co-ordinating the market.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Malay sultans sense an end to the high life: Government's
gloves are off in the fight to limit royal powers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are few things as upsetting as seeing your own obituary in the
newspapers. Recently life has been a bit like that for Malaysia's nine
sultans, or hereditary rulers, who take turns as king.
The royalty is involved in a bruising battle with Dr Mahathir Mohamad,
Malaysia's powerful prime minister. Over the weekend one of the country's
national newspapers pointedly printed a list of the world's monarchs who had
fallen by the proletarian wayside since the war.
The sultans sit in their palaces, bombarded by adverse publicity, sensing
that their days of high living could be at an end.
Dr Mahathir wants to limit the sultans' powers. Last week the prime minister
introduced a bill to parliament that would do away with constitutional
provisions giving the royalty immunity from prosecution.
The move followed an incident in which the sultan of the southern state of
Johor is alleged to have abused, then beaten up, a sports official.
But Dr Mahathir has a problem. The constitution stipulates that any action
which alters the position of the royalty must be approved by the sultans
themselves.
Persuasive techniques have been applied to make the sultans agree to the
constitutional changes. Stories of royal high living and various alleged
abuses of royal power began to appear in the media. The sultans seemed
persuaded.
But then, at the last minute, they turned on Dr Mahathir, unanimously
rejecting the constitutional changes.
Since then, the government gloves have come off. The government started by
announcing that relatively trivial royal benefits, like special licence
plates for their lavish fleets of cars, must go.
Special wards in hospitals reserved for the royalty would be opened to the
public. Dr Mahathir would no longer seek a weekly audience with the king.
There would be no more state funds for the upkeep of royal yachts, and no
more allocations for work on royal homes.
By the end of last week Dr Mahathir had moved forward the big guns. In
future, he said, funds would be given to the royalty only in strict
accordance with the regulations. In effect, this means the withdrawal of
many millions of dollars from the royals' purses.
Each day fuller stories of alleged royal misdemeanours have emerged.
One sultan is said to have been in the habit of opening fire on vehicles
careless enough to come close to royal motorcades. Another is said to have
sold timber concessions worth millions of dollars pay gambling debts.
There have been tales of manslaughter and, in one case, murder, with
allegations made in parliament that a sultan killed his golf caddie.
The sultans are not entirely defenceless against this government directed
barrage. Some sultans are extremely wealthy and able to cope with the
tighter financial times.
They are still revered by many who see them as symbols of Malay identity.
There are also those who also point to what they see as the lavish lifestyle
of Malaysia's 'new rajas' - some government ministers themselves.
Dr Mahathir insists he does not want to do away with the monarchy. But there
are fears that the prime minister is seeking to add to his powers.
Parliament has passed Dr Mahathir's constitutional amendments. They now go
to the king for approval. Dr Mahathir says he is determined to make the
amendments law.
But if the rulers continue to withhold their consent then a constitutional
crisis will develop.

FT  25 JAN 93 / The US puts its poor and huddled masses to work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBERT REICH, labour secretary in President's Bill Clinton's new cabinet,
used to set a test each year for his graduate students at the Kennedy School
of Government, Harvard University.
The idea was simple. The students were asked to vote for one of two options
for economic growth rates in the US and Japan over the next decade: either
the US and Japan both grow at 1 per cent a year, or the US grows at 2 per
cent a year and Japan grows at 3 per cent.
The minority group of foreign graduates voted for the latter option. But
most of the aspiring American public policy students, and thus the majority
of the 250-strong class, preferred the former option - and thus a lower US
growth rate - rather than have a faster-growing Japan. The reason,
presumably, was that they recognised the link between economic supremacy and
political power and thus the implicit threat that Japan poses to the world's
largest democracy.
There was an echo of this sentiment in the recent remarks of Mr Michael
Boskin, the outgoing chairman of the council of economic advisers. Pouring
cold water on unease about the supposed long-term decline of the US economy
relative to other countries, he pointed out that the US has a growing share
of the industrial output of the developed economies and the highest level of
industrial productivity.
Yet the Kennedy School students should not be totally satisfied with these
comparisons. Yes, the US still has the largest gross domestic product in the
world. Using current exchange rates, which understate US incomes, Japanese
GDP is still only 60 per cent of US GDP. But no statistics can disguise the
fact that Japan is catching up. Japanese GDP grew at 4.1 per cent a year
between 1979 and 1990 compared to 2.3 per cent a year in the US, although
France, the UK and west Germany all posted slower growth rates than America.
Mr Boskin is also correct to highlight America's relatively high level of
labour productivity, as the chart shows. Value-added output per worker in
manufacturing was 14 per cent higher than in Japan in 1990 and 75 per cent
higher than in Britain. But, once more, Japan is catching up. Business
sector productivity, which also includes energy and private service
industries, grew by an average 3 per cent a year in Japan in the 1980s.
Germany managed a modest 1.6 per cent a year, but US business sector
productivity grew by a mere 0.5 per cent a year.
This recent dismal record of US productivity growth in the business sector,
alongside a declining share of investment in GDP, helps explain why the US
electorate was in a mood for change at the recent election. It also
justifies the remark of Ms Laura Tyson, Mr Boskin's successor at the CEA,
that America's recent economic performance posed a potentially devastating
threat to US living standards.
Yet the evidence is slightly harder to interpret than Ms Tyson suggests.
Average real wages barely grew at all in the 1980s, while the real wages of
the low paid fell sharply. But disposable income per head was able to grow
at 1.5 per cent a year, over twice as fast as economy-wide productivity. The
reason is that the number of US wage earners grew relatively rapidly as a
proportion of the total population, by 0.5 per cent a year. The rise in
female employment as a percentage of the female population in the 1980s was
greater in the US than in Japan or the main European countries. And the
percentage of US men with jobs also rose, by 1.6 percentage points, while
the ratio of male employment to the population fell elsewhere.
So the growth in US living standards, while slower than in Europe, was
spread across a greater proportion of the population. The UK, by contrast,
is currently managing to achieve rapid productivity growth, but only because
employment is falling even faster than output. President Clinton plans to
boost employment and productivity growth during his first administration.
But unless he finds a way to increase investment and the skills of the
labour force, he will find that these objectives are contradictory.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Kenya poll overseer was removed from bench: Commonwealth
report likely to reinforce opposition claims that election victory was
unfair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Zachaeus Chesoni, the former judge who supervised Kenya's general
election last month, was dismissed from the bench in May 1990 following the
discovery that a state-owned bank was seeking his imprisonment in a
bankruptcy action, according to the Commonwealth report on the poll
published last night.
This and other disclosures from a Commonwealth file on Mr Chesoni, appointed
chairman of the electoral commission by President Daniel arap Moi a year
after his dismissal, are likely to reinforce opposition claims that Mr Moi's
election victory was not free and fair. Opposition leaders sought Mr
Chesoni's replacement as chairman of the electoral commission, but failed to
get Commonwealth backing.
The documents, summarised in an annex to the report, were given to the
Commonwealth observer group before Christmas. No mention of them was made in
the group's initial assessment of the poll, issued on January 1. The heavily
qualified endorsement of the election process was reaffirmed in yesterday's
final report.
The annex says in 1984 Mr Chesoni's 'business involvements caused him severe
financial embarrassment'. Bankruptcy proceedings were filed against him
personally and winding up proceedings against the company through which he
operated his business. The action was initiated by the Kenya Commercial
Finance Company, a part of the state-owned Kenya Commercial Bank. In a
letter to Mr Chesoni cited in the annex but not published, Mr Mathew Muli,
then attorney-general, writes: 'His Excellency the President. . . has sadly
accepted your retirement.'
It goes on: 'With regard to bankruptcy proceedings against you personally,
the bank has been directed not to press with bankruptcy proceedings but may
proceed with the winding-up of the company. Any proceedings that may have
been commenced are to be terminated or withdrawn from the court record in
accordance with the rules.'
In February 1990, says the annex, Mr Chesoni was reappointed an acting
justice of appeal 'presumably on the basis that his financial affairs had
been brought to order. In fact that was not so. An application to commit him
to prison in High Court case 1234 of 1984 was listed for hearing on 18 May
1990. He was asked to resign but did not do so.'
The Judicial Service Commission found Mr Chesoni's conduct 'inconsistent
with the position, dignity and judicial integrity' of a judge.
A letter to Mr Chesoni from the Chief Justice, Judge Robin Hancox, demands
his resignation 'in view of your extreme financial embarrassment' and says
Mr Chesoni 'did not see fit to apprise' him of the application for his
imprisonment. On May 15 Mr Chesoni was told that his appointment as acting
justice of appeal would be revoked.
Earlier this month the Financial Times reported that in 1984 a
state-controlled bank was ordered not to implement a bankruptcy judgment
against Mr Chesoni. The action was revived in 1990, said the article, but in
1991 the bank was again ordered not to pursue it, say Nairobi legal sources.
In a statement issued before the Commonwealth report was made public, Mr
Chesoni said: 'It is absolutely untrue to suggest that the government played
any part in resolving the (bankruptcy) dispute.'
Mr Chesoni says in April 1984 he faced a claim for KSh18m (Pounds 322,000)
plus interest. Of this, KSh17m was repaid, and agreement reached on payment
of the balance.
'Prior to April 1990 execution proceedings had been taken against me,' says
Mr Chesoni: 'As a result an order was made that I pay KSh3.5m and the
balance to be agreed.'
His lawyers subsequently 'negotiated a full and final settlement of my
liability'. The sale of family property had raised KSh3m and he is no longer
indebted to the bank, says the statement.
The Commonwealth report says Mr Chesoni's conduct as electoral commission
chairman 'cast a cloud over the electoral process', but his performance
'improved dramatically' from mid-November. It adds that the observers 'have
not received information which would cast doubts' on denials by Mr Chesoni
and other commission members that they 'were associated with' or 'taking
directions from' Kenya's ruling party.

A United Nations team of nuclear weapons inspectors is set to fly into
Baghdad today on a delayed but routine mission. They are expected to examine
damage to the al-Rabiya site, south of Baghdad, which was attacked last week
by US cruise missiles.
The mission, the 17th by nuclear weapons inspectors to Iraq since the end of
the Gulf war, comes one day after Mr Les Aspin, the new US secretary of
defence, said there were signs that Iraq was moving its surface to air
missiles back into the no-fly zones. He said the US would need to watch the
missiles in the next few days.
The eight-member team will join about 70 UN inspectors who returned to Iraq
last week after Baghdad belatedly agreed to their direct access to the
country following intense US and UN pressure.
A team of ballistic missile experts will also fly into Iraq today.
UN officials said a large team of chemical weapons inspectors who entered
last week had met no resistance from Iraqi officials in resuming work
destroying chemical and biological weapons.
Mr Zifferero's team will undertake what he described as 'essential follow-up
work, verifying equipment has been destroyed'. He said the al-Rabiya site, a
complex of several factories, housed several heavy machine tools used in the
construction of uranium enrichment calutrons which his inspectors had tagged
for destruction on visits before the US raid.

TUGS and firefighting vessels battled through the weekend to control a fire
on board the Maersk Navigator (left), a 255,000-tonne, fully laden
supertanker drifting between the Indonesian island of Sumatra and the Indian
Nicobar Islands, Kieran Cooke writes.
A spokesman for the ship's owners yesterday claimed that 'Extensive cooling
of the vessel's hull is taking place and realistically it should be possible
to extinguish the fire within the next 72 hours.'
The ship's Danish owners yesterday said 'a few tens of tonnes per hour' of
crude was leaking from the vessel, and a narrow 15-mile slick of oil had
been sighted.

FT  25 JAN 93 / EC trade supremo has to hit the ground running: Sir Leon
Brittan talks to Andrew Gowers and Ian Hargreaves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SIR Leon Brittan
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Queen's Counsel, former British cabinet minister and erstwhile European
trust-buster - knows what it means to hit the ground running. But even by
his standards, the initiation to his new job as EC commissioner for external
economic affairs has set a demanding pace.
On January 2, four days before he formally took over the post, he found
himself closeted all day with the seasoned US trade representative, Mrs
Carla Hills, discussing an unfamiliar and highly technical subject: the
prospects for a deal in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade
negotiations.
As power switched from President George Bush to his successor, Sir Leon has
been plugging away to ensure that the trade talks do not get lost among
competing priorities for the new administration.
Also, as the European Commission attempts to regain its bearings after the
tumult of the last 12 months, he has been labouring to carve out a fiefdom
to replace his previous stronghold at the head of the competition
directorate.
In the US at least, he appears to be making headway. On Friday, within hours
of the swearing-in of the new US trade representative, Mr Mickey Kantor,
contacts had been opened to arrange a visit by Sir Leon to Washington. If as
he hopes a meeting can be fixed this week, it will be an important sign that
the momentum has not completely gone out of the Uruguay Round.
The European Commission vice-president is in no doubt as to where the onus
for success or failure now lies. Indeed, he seems relieved that the
Community is no longer in the dock as it was over agriculture last autumn.
'Everything depends on the attitude of the US administration,' he says.
'What we have to establish is how high a priority it is for (President Bill)
Clinton. We just don't know.'
Sir Leon insists that the negotiations have not been marking time this
month, despite another clutch of missed deadlines. The EC and US now have a
clearer understanding, he says, of what sort of deal they will be able to
strike on market access, notably concerning tariffs on textiles. In the end,
the talks that continued in Geneva right up to Mr Clinton's inauguration
were scuppered by the lack of time and by the ebbing authority of the
outgoing administration.
It has not been easy for outsiders to predict the new team's stance towards
the Gatt talks, and formulation of a coherent US policy may still have to
await the outcome of Washington turf battles - - Mr Lloyd Bentsen, treasury
secretary, Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, Mr Robert Rubin, director of
the National Economic Council, and Ms Laura Tyson, chairwoman of the Council
of Economic Advisers, all have claims to expertise in the trade area. But
Sir Leon suspects that as the dust settles, Mr Clinton's approach will turn
out to differ little from that of his predecessor.
'Nothing has happened so far to lead me to think they will take a
fundamentally different view' from the Bush administration, he says. 'If
that is correct, and they give it adequate priority, it should be possible,
with difficulty for all, to reach agreement this year.'
Even that heavily qualified prediction will strike many observers, weary of
years of mistaken optimism over the Uruguay Round, as unrealistic. For one
thing, the negotiators do not have all year; in theory at least, they are
working to a deadline of March 2, the date on which the congressional
'fast-track' authority under which the US administration is negotiating
expires.
The reality, as Sir Leon knows, is not quite so clear-cut. Mr Clinton could
go to Congress in March with a very general statement of intent to reach a
Gatt deal, while still negotiating with the EC and other contracting
parties. Congress would then have 90 days to approve.
Though the commissioner does not say so himself, playing it long like this
could have an extra advantage: it would mean that the EC itself would not
have to pronounce on a Uruguay Round deal until after the French legislative
elections in late March. At that point France, which threatened to veto the
EC-US deal on agriculture at the end of last year, might be able to take a
more relaxed view of the overall Gatt package.
Could internal divisions within the Community or the Commission destroy this
delicate timetable? Sir Leon does not seem concerned. He notes that Mr
Jacques Delors, the French president of the Commission, was party to an
EC-US statement in December urging completion of the round by January 15 and
that 'not one voice has been raised, within or outside the Commission'
against his energetic pursuit of further talks.
Sir Leon clearly wants to use his new post - with its weighty portfolio
covering trade relations with other industrial countries, anti-dumping
policy and, crucially, aid to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union -
to set the tone for a more outward-looking European Commission.
On eastern Europe, for example, he wants to make a strong push to get EC
governments to accelerate the improvement of market access for central
European countries' products, including some categories that have hitherto
been regarded as too domestically sensitive for liberalisation.
'There is no better way of helping the countries of central and eastern
Europe than expanding trade opportunities,' he says, a tune which he will
probably be heard playing with great frequency this year.
But what of the new Commission itself? Three weeks into its term, it is
attracting mixed notices. There have been reports of friction - not least
between Sir Leon and Mr Hans van den Broek, who has responsibility for the
EC's external political relations and enlargement.
There are also suggestions that the new team may slacken off in its
enforcement of the single market and competition policy, and mutterings that
the Commission is chastened and demoralised after having been used by member
states as a whipping boy last year.
Sir Leon dismisses such talk. He says that what some see as new-found
timidity on the part of the Commission reflects the Community's desire to
apply 'subsidiarity' - to take decisions and implement them at the
appropriate level - and in the case of the single market, a sensible period
of stock-taking.
On external policy, he sees no reason why he should not be able to work
closely and constructively with his fellow liberal Mr Van den Broek. Whether
the Commission as a whole is more or less economically liberal than its
predecessor is, he insists, 'much too early to say. We haven't had any votes
yet, and that's what sorts things out.'
Nevertheless, even Sir Leon cannot quite disguise the overall political
uncertainty that pervades the Brussels executive these days. This Commission
is, after all, appointed only for two years; it may lose Mr Delors to French
politics before the end of 1994; and the jockeying is already under way as
to who will succeed him. Might Sir Leon be a candidate, as is being mooted
privately within the British government? He laughs, and will say only: 'I
think that that is not a question that has arisen at the moment.'

FT  25 JAN 93 / Single Market Watch: Brussels battle over telecoms at
crucial phase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE advent of the single market on January 1 marked a small step in the
liberalisation of Europe's telecommunications industry. Some of the business
of carrying computer data was opened to competition.
The industry and its customers barely gave the change a second thought.
Their executives were busy lobbying Brussels over plans for far more
dramatic deregulation: the opening up of the business of carrying ordinary
telephone calls, a market worth Ecu90bn (Pounds 73bn) in 1990 and valued now
at an annual Ecu110bn.
At stake is control of a fast growing industry. Turnover in European
telephone calls is rising by more than 8 per cent a year, according to Daiwa
Institute of Research in London.
This industry is dominated by a handful of state-owned monopolies. They earn
almost 90 per cent of telephone revenues in the EC.
The European Commission wants this to change. It has called for
representations from suppliers, customers and governments on how far
liberalisation should go. These submissions should be filed by the end of
this month.
The Commission has asked for views on four alternative proposals. One would
be to freeze the process of liberalisation, reversing present policy. The
second approach would call for Brussels to bring in centralised rules to cut
the cost of calls - a policy which would contradict the EC's new emphasis on
subsidiarity, or making decisions at the lowest level of government.
The other alternatives - which seem in practice more likely - would be to
decide on either a partial deregulation or sweeping changes of the kind
introduced in the UK.
The Commission has said it wants to see at least some further deregulation.
But many member states are opposed to this. Views spread from the strongly
free-market British Telecom and Mercury Communications, the UK post and
telecommunications organisations (PTOs), to the pro-state monopoly
governments in southern Europe.
Executives in London and officials in Brussels now suggest that the
anti-liberalisation governments are bending to the will of the
free-marketeers. This would be no mean victory. Voice telecommunications
represent the core of an industry still seen in many countries as an arm of
government. The debate is heavily influenced by ideology and emotion.
Publication of the Commission's plans was twice delayed last summer, partly
because of concern about its impact on France's Maastricht referendum in
September.
The conservatives have already lost ground. The Commission has pushed
through reforms in the non-core activities of the PTOs. Legislation opening
up the equipment market, for example, was approved in 1988.
Countries that a decade ago were once staunch opponents of liberalisation
have allowed a measure of competition since the late 1980s. The UK remains
the only EC country with two PTOs, but Germany and France have introduced
competition into mobile telephony and in satellite links. Last week, a
subsidiary of the US company MCI Communications received French government
approval to run an independent satellite telecommunications network in
France.
'In a matter of a very few years, attitudes have changed,' says Mr Jonathan
Rickford, BT's director of government relations. The UK, which deregulated
in the early 1980s, 'used to be regarded as a piece of Anglo-Saxon
eccentricity. Now it is seen that that is the way the world is going.'
None the less, recent political moves suggest that obstacles to deregulation
may increase. In the EC commission, responsibility for telecommunications
has passed to Mr Martin Bangemann, who adds it to his industry portfolio. Mr
Karel van Miert, a Belgian socialist, has taken over competition policy from
the free-marketeer Sir Leon Brittan.
Both Mr Bangemann and Mr Van Miert believe competition should not be the
overriding factor in policy decisions - a sentiment in line with the
attitude of some state telephone monopolies.
EC commissioners intend to approve a draft proposal on deregulation by early
March. This would be presented to telecommunications ministers on May 10.
Commission officials concede it will take a year or more of detailed
negotiations before legislation is approved. But, depending on the outcome
of negotiations during the next few weeks, Europe's will to make real
progress in deregulation will be tested very soon.

FT  25 JAN 93 / English speakers lead crime league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGLISH-speaking industrialised countries head the world's crime league,
with some types of offence twice as common in the US, England or Australia
as in France or Germany, according to an intergovernmental report.
The report is the most authoritative study to date comparing crime around
the industrialised world. Sponsored by interior and justice ministries and
police agencies, the report is based on surveys carried out last year and in
1989 among 55,000 respondents in 20 countries.
'With the most obvious exceptions of Japan and Switzerland, all
industrialised countries suffer from an appreciable level of property and
aggressive crime,' the report says. 'For the public, being a victim of crime
has become a common feature of life in most urban areas.'
The report suggests governments' ability to curb rising crime is limited. It
puts forward a number of proposals, including better security standards for
cars and measures to discourage beer consumption  - held to be a factor
behind violence.
But it also sounds a note of fatalism. 'Put bluntly, this (rising crime)
seems to be the price for living in an affluent, urbanised and democratic
society, regardless of government policy on crime, or the way in which
communities try to organise themselves.'
Among the more controversial findings, England and Wales are recorded as
having registered the greatest increase in overall crime between 1988 and
1991. The number of respondents saying they had been the victim of one or
more crime rose 56 per cent during the two periods in England - much more
than indicated in previous UK crime surveys and in police statistics.
The study, co-ordinated by the Dutch Justice Ministry, is based on
questioning of random samples of adults, normally 2,000 people in each
country.
They were asked to report whether they had been victims of crime during the
past 12 months - in 1988 and/or 1991. Attitudes towards crime were also
polled. Eight countries held surveys in both years.
Such so-called 'victimisation surveys' offer a more reliable guide to
international crime trends than countries' police statistics, where
comparisons are distorted by divergences in crime reporting.
In view of uncertainties associated with polling methods, the report's
authors - Mr Jan van Dijk of the Dutch Justice Ministry and Ms Pat Mayhew of
the UK Home Office - caution about using the study to draw 'firm
conclusions'.
Nonetheless, some sharp international differences emerge. Northern Ireland,
in spite of frequent sectarian violence, ranks as one of the industrial
world's least crime-ridden areas. On the other hand, New Zealand and the
Netherlands, belying their peaceable reputations, have some of the most
severe law and order problems. Crime in Poland and Czechoslovakia is shown
as much higher than indicated by police figures.
In most countries, fear of crime is closely linked to actual prevalence of
offences. In England, fear of burglary - which is much higher than in the
rest of Europe - has increased since 1989, in line with actual burglary
risks.
In one sign of exaggerated alarm over violence, fears of street crime are
much higher than the real risks in Japan and West Germany.
Car theft appears roughly six times more prevalent in England, Italy,
Australia, New Zealand, France and the US than in the Netherlands and west
Germany.
Burglary is much more frequent in non-European countries, with Australia,
New Zealand, the US and Canada among the leaders, and rates also high in
Poland, former Czechoslovakia and England.
Sexual assaults on females appear highest in Czechoslovakia, Poland,
Australia, Canada, and west Germany.
Matching incidence of sexual violence, the highest rates of aggressive crime
are in North America, Australia, New Zealand and Poland.
Robbery is most common in Spain, Poland, the US and Italy.
The survey highlights differences in attitudes towards police. People who
had reported an offence were least satisfied with the police response in
Poland, Norway, Italy, Czechoslovakia and Spain.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Voters have only modest hopes for Danish coalition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DANISH voters say they have only modest expectations from the new four-party
coalition led by Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, chairman of the Social Democratic
party, while business fears it will lead to higher costs and therefore to a
loss of jobs.
Mr Rasmussen spent yesterday putting together his cabinet, which he will
present to Queen Margrethe today. It is expected that the administration -
which will assume Denmark's current presidency of the European Community -
will include at least a dozen Social Democrats, three members each from the
Radical Liberal party and the Centre Democrats and two from the Christian
People's party.
The change of government is a change of faces more than of policies. The
three centre parties which have joined the government were all supporters of
the outgoing non-socialist government. Furthermore, many areas of policy,
including defence and fiscal policy, are subject to multi-party compromise
agreements binding on all participants for the rest of this year and in some
cases longer.
EC policy is hammered out in the all-party market affairs committee of the
Folketing (parliament) and will therefore also not be subject to sudden
change as a result of the new government.
One of the foremost tasks for the new government will be to achieve a
majority for the Maastricht treaty on European union in a referendum to be
held probably in May. However, a poll by the Vilstrup institute, published
in the national daily Politiken, showed 63 per cent of Danes would vote Yes
and 37 per cent No. A month ago 70 per cent were in favour and 30 per cent
against.
Three quarters of voters polled by a weekend Gallup survey said they did not
think the government would succeed in reducing unemployment, which is top
priority in its programme.
Two thirds doubted that it would succeed in lowering personal income taxes,
another aim, or lead to a significant increase in real wages.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Worner warns Germany over 'no-fly' role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A DECISION by Nato to impose a no-flight zone over Bosnia-Hercegovina would
'without a doubt' influence the military situation, and bring an end to the
war in the former Yugoslav republic, Mr Manfred Worner, secretary- general
of the western military alliance, has told a German newspaper.
But if the decision is taken, Mr Worner warned that Germany must finally
decide if it will allow its crews to staff the alliance's Awacs, the
surveillance aircraft needed to impose the ban.
In the clearest signal to date from Nato, the secretary-gengeneral, who is
German, told the Hamburg daily Die Welt that the 16 member states of the
alliance, with the support of the UN security council, must 'by all
appropriate means' stop the conflict spreading to Macedonia, and the
Serb-controlled southern province of Kosovo.
Although he did not go into detail about how the conflict could be
contained, German and western military officials recently said Nato was now
making contingent plans to impose a no-flight ban over Bosnia from
Geilenkirchen, western Germany, close to the Dutch border, where the Awacs
are based.
The problem is that the 18 Awacs aircraft are commanded by a German general,
and a third of the crew are German personnel. Under Germany's constitution,
the deployment of the Bundeswehr, or military, from activities outside the
Nato area, is banned.
Attempts over the past 10 days by the ruling coalition of the Christian
Democratic Union/Christian Social Union, and the Liberal the opposition
Social Democratic parties, to agree on constitutional amendments have
failed.
Mr Worner said any German withdrawal from the Awacs fleet would damage its
efficiency. 'My hope is that Germany will keep its pilots, crews and other
personnel in that fleet. . . Germany will surely not put at risk its ability
to act as a member of the alliance,' he said after a Nato meeting in
Brussels on Friday.
General Klaus Naumann, the chief of Germany's armed forces, said Germany
should withdraw from the command of the Awacs fleet if Bonn refused to
participate in imposing a no-flight zone over Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Both Bosnian Serb and Croat forces from Croatia repeatedly fly over Bosnian
air-space in contravention of a tacit agreement at last August's London
peace conference to respect a ban on flights.

THE Czechoslovak currency will be split into separate Czech and Slovak
crowns 'within a few days', a senior adviser to the Czech central bank told
the Czech news agency CTK at the weekend, writes Patrick Blum from Prague.
At a conference of German and Czech businessmen in Coburg, Bavaria, Mr
Vladimir Jindra, adviser to the central bank governor, also forecast the new
Czech crown would be fully convertible in two years.
Changing crowns into hard currency is subject to strict limitations, but
uncertainty about the money's future has led to a rush for foreign exchange
both on the official and black markets.
The crown was not to be split until the summer but analysts expect this to
happen much sooner. A spokesman for the central bank said yesterday that no
date had been set and the timing would require agreement between both
central banks.

Vienna saw Austria's largest rally for 50 years at the weekend, when 200,000
Austrians gathered to protest against an anti-foreigner initiative by the
right-wing Freedom Party, writes Eric Frey from Vienna.
The demonstration was scheduled to coincide with the start of a
controversial petition drive by the FPO and its charismatic leader, Mr Jorg
Haider, calling for stricter immigration laws and other measures directed at
foreigners.
The FPO has won support for its anti-foreigner platform and nearly doubled
its share of the vote in elections in Austria's second largest city of Graz
yesterday, to 21 per cent.

This is the French leader's lowest score since last August. The lift which
the Maastricht referendum campaign and public sympathy for his prostate
cancer gave Mr Mitterrand has now clearly worn off. Ifop gives a slightly
increased favourable rating of 32 per cent to Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime

Both men score ahead of their Socialist party, which is expected to win only

FT  25 JAN 93 / Breaking European crime and unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Representatives of EC governments and training organisations are meeting in
Belgium today to explore ways of breaking the link between European crime
and unemployment, writes David Marsh.
The three-day meeting at Louvain near Brussels, organised by the
Commission's employment and social affairs directorate, brings together
experts from ministries and voluntary organisations from the 12 member
countries.
The meeting will exchange ideas and information on projects to rehabilitate
ex-offenders, highlighting a new approach to tackling the Community's
growing law and order problems.
In the UK, roughly half of adult males convicted of offences commit another
crime within two years - establishing a vicious circle in criminal
behaviour. The so-called 'recidivism' rate is thought to be similar in other
EC countries.
Statistics indicate that ex-offenders with jobs are three times less likely
to recommit crimes than those unemployed. EC ministries and training
organisations are planning a working party to tap funds for ex-offenders'
employment projects and monitor how different countries achieve solutions.
The Commission is spending an initial Ecu1.5m (Pounds 1.2m) this year to
finance projects connected with rehabilitation. One aim of this week's
meeting is to allow national agencies to gain access to training funds from
organisations and budgetary programmes elsewhere in the EC. Already the
Netherlands and Germany are co-operating on a cross-border programme for
integrating ex-offenders. A similar scheme is under way involving Luxembourg
and the UK.

   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jozsef Antall has fended off the strongest challenge to his leadership of
Hungary by facing down a far-right bid for power within the conservative
governing party.
The prime minister's moderate camp within the ruling Hungarian Democratic
Forum held on to its majority in the party presidium, conceding few seats to
the extremist Volk-national wing, at the congress which ended yesterday.
Mr Istvan Csurka, the populist author who whipped up the far right with
anti-semitic and anti-communist polemics, last night appeared chastened that
he had been so clearly confronted and defeated.
Nevertheless, his support among the party activists was sufficient to save
his place on the party presidium.
Qualified victory over the far-right gives Mr Antall the chance of appealing
to moderate voters and boosting the Forum's popularity in time for the
elections from the derisory 8 per cent it shows in the latest opinion polls.
Government officials said that the main lines of economic and foreign policy
would not change as a result of the congress.
But the congress did give priority to an anti-communist programme, which
would see trials of communist officials responsible for the suppression of
Hungary's 1956 uprising against Soviet occupation; and to a purge of former
secret police agents from positions of responsibility.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Press may escape law on privacy if regulator is reformed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR is ready to consider shelving proposals for a new privacy law
if newspapers respond to the Calcutt report by significantly strengthening
the Press Complaints Commission.
The government has signalled its determination to introduce criminal
legislation against the use by the press of electronic surveillance, bugging
and trespass.
But Mr Major is hesitant over separate proposals for civil law measures to
protect individual privacy. Senior officials have begun drafting legislation
but the prime minister has made known his preference for tighter
self-regulation of the press.
An extension of the law of tort to cover privacy is backed by a number of
senior cabinet ministers including Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, and Mr
Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary.
It would give individuals the right to sue for compensation when they
believed they could prove that their private lives had been unreasonably
invaded by intrusive behaviour or reporting.
Mr Major recognises such a law would face practical difficulties. Without an
expensive extension of the legal aid system, redress would remain out of
reach for the ordinary individuals it would be designed to protect.
The government would also face pressure for a loosely framed public interest
defence to avoid charges that its main concern was to protect politicians
and others in public life.
So far, however, the press has not indicated willingness to undertake
voluntarily the radical reform of self-regulation sought by Mr Major.
Newspaper editors agreed last week to strengthen the complaints commission
by guaranteeing a majority of lay members on the self-regulatory body. But
the editors deferred a decision to underwrite its independence by ceding the
industry's control over appointments.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Opec nears agreement to cut oil output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUWAIT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries appear
broadly to agree on the need to cut output by up to 1m barrels a day to
counter the fall in crude prices.
Signs of an emerging Opec consensus were cautiously heralded by Mr Alirio
Parra, the cartel's Venezuelan president. He arrived in Kuwait yesterday as
part of a tour of leading Opec producers, prompted in part by concern over
the weaker trend in oil prices.
Mr Parra said that following talks with the Saudi Arabian and Iranian oil
ministers there was a 'consensus on the type of measures' the cartel should
take at its next meeting on February 13. Then, Opec ministers are due to set
an output ceiling for the second quarter.
His remarks follow a proposal this weekend from Mr Hisham Nazer, the Saudi
oil minister. He said Opec members should make pro rata cuts to bring output
down by 1m barrels a day from a first quarter ceiling of 24.85m b/d agreed
at Opec's last meeting in November. The target figure excludes output from
Ecuador, which has since left the cartel.
Mr Nazer's proposal followed talks in Paris this weekend with Mr Parra, who
in turn held discussions in Tehran earlier yesterday with Mr Gholamreza
Aghazadeh, the Iranian oil minister. Mr Parra described both sets of talks
as 'positive', adding: 'We have a broad consensus, the Saudis and the
Iranians, as I only talked to the two major producers so far.'
Any effective Opec deal to cut output substantially would hinge on a deal
between Saudi Arabia and Iran, Opec's two biggest producers. Saudi Arabia,
which says it is pumping 8.4m b/d, has tenaciously guarded its expanded
post-Gulf war oil output. Iran, which was allocated a ceiling of 3.49m b/d
in the November agreement, has long been among the most vociferous Opec
advocates of output cuts to push prices closer to Opec's nominal target
price of Dollars 21 a barrel.
However, both countries appear to be responding to broader Opec concern over
prices which, for the basket of Opec crudes, have lately fallen to about
Dollars 16 a barrel, down from an average of more than Dollars 18 a barrel
in 1992. A Gulf Arab official familiar with Saudi oil policy said yesterday:
'There is a general feeling that the fundamentals are not very good for
output right now. There is general agreement among members to cut production
by around 1m barrels a day.'
Opec's cause has not been helped by 'leakage' of extra production among
several members which, according to industry estimates, has put actual Opec
output somewhat above 25m barrels for the first quarter.
Iran's president Mr Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who also met Mr Parra
yesterday, was quoted by Tehran Radio as saying too many Opec members had
been exceeding their November allocations: 'If oil producers reduced their
production by 10 per cent, they would have 20 per cent surplus income,' he
said.
Agreement among Opec mem-bers to cut output could place particular pressure
on Kuwait, where Mr Parra held talks yesterday with Mr Ali al-Baghli, the
Gulf state's oil minister. Since the Gulf war, Kuwait has considered itself
immune from any restrictions on output while it recovers its prewar output
level, makes up for lost revenues and pays for its reconstruction.
However, a senior Gulf Arab official said Kuwait was likely to be urged to
freeze output for the second quarter at present levels - which Mr al-Baghli
yesterday put at 1.778m b/d - as part of a bid to support prices. Mr Parra
will also visit Qatar, Algeria, the United Arab Emirates and Oman, which
though not an Opec member has often acted in tandem to support prices.

NEGOTIATIONS on a peace settlement for Bosnia-Hercegovina came to a virtual

Krajina, a Serb-populated enclave of neighbouring Croatia.
Mr Dobrica Cosic, president of the rump federation of Yugoslavia, said
before leaving for Belgrade that no further progress in the talks was
possible until Croatia ended its 'aggression' against Krajina. The
offensive, launched on Friday on the eve of the resumption of the Geneva
talks, 'seriously undermines and compromises the peace effort here'.
He called on the co-chairmen of the Geneva conference, Mr Cyrus Vance and
Lord Owen, to ask for a special session of the United Nations Security
Council 'to strongly condemn' the Croatian action and to put an end to what
he described as 'a veritable war' in the Krajina region.
Mr Cosic's statement followed strenuous efforts by the two international
mediators at the weekend to persuade the leaders of the parties involved in
the Krajina conflict to stop the fighting. The co-chairmen said yesterday
that they had expressed their 'grave concern' about the flare-up to
President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia.
Mr Vance said that Mr Tudjman had given them an assurance that he was
immediately going to order local commanders to stop the fighting. Last night
Mr Tudjman appeared on Croatian television to say his army had ended its
offensive after seizing a main route linking the south and north of the
country.
However, Yugoslav deputy prime minister Radoje Kontic said that instead of
withdrawing, the Croats were continuing their attacks. More than 500 Serbian
civilians and 150 fighters had been killed.
The mediators had also received an undertaking from Mr Cosic and the Bosnian
Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, that they did not intend to become
involved in the renewed fighting between Croats and Serbs, but that they
would leave it to the UN to find a solution.
The offensive was launched by the Croats in a 65-mile-long zone. This has
been under the protection of UN troops since Mr Vance negotiated an end to a
war between Croatia and the federal Yugoslav army a year ago, following
Croatia's declaration of independence.
Croat forces launched a powerful armoured assault on Zemunik airport near
Zadar and an attack towards the Serb-held towns of Benkovac and Obrovac,
according to Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency. The Croatian government
said 120 Serbs and 10 Croats had been killed in three days of fighting
around the Maslenica bridge and Zemunik airport, near the Adriatic port of
Zadar.
General Zivota Panic, the Yugoslav army chief of staff, warned that his
forces may intervene in Croatia, raising fears of an all-out Serbo-Croat
war.
'In the upcoming period the army will undertake measures to defend the
endangered Serbian people (in Croatia) and extend humanitarian and all other
help,' Gen Panic said in a letter to Indian General Satish Nambiar, the UN
force commander.
He warned that the Yugoslav army would fulfil its pledge to defend Croatia's
Serbs, who comprise 13 per cent of the 4.7m population.
George Graham adds from Washington: President Bill Clinton is expected to
hold a National Security Council meeting early this week to evaluate his
administration's policy on former Yugoslavia.
Mr Clinton has made clear that he believes something more must be done in
Bosnia, and that 'ethnic cleansing' in particular cannot be allowed to stand
unchallenged by the international community.
He is, however, reluctant to commit US ground troops to the region.

FT  25 JAN 93 / Japanese car dealer makes staff travel by public transport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOST OF the 12,000 workers at Yanase &amp; Co, Japan's largest dealer in
imported cars, have been ordered to take public transport to work, in an
attempt to give potential car buyers the impression that the country's
clogged roads are becoming less congested.
Trying to push-start a stalled car market, Mr Jiro Yanase, the 76-year-old
chairman of Yanase, which sells Mercedes-Benz and General Motors vehicles,
has also asked makers such as Toyota Motor and Nissan Motor to forbid their
employees from driving to work.
As Japan's economy has slowed, so have car sales. Motor vehicle
registrations were down by 7.2 per cent last year. Registrations of imported
cars fell 7.7 per cent, prompting carmakers to consider new gimmicks to
prompt customers to trade in and, preferably, trade up.
However, carmakers think Mr Yanase's strategy a touch quirky. Toyota and the
Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association both noted that the 'idea itself
is interesting', but suggested improving transport infrastructure rather
than keeping their employees off the road.
The edict from Mr Yanase is not only a response to recession but another
example of the sometimes eccentric policies of successful Japanese companies
dominated by a charismatic figure. For example, Minebea, the world's leading
maker of bearings, diversified into pig raising because of a lingering
boyhood fascination of its late chairman with those animals.
Mr Yanase originally asked that only Tokyo employees be banned from driving
to work. But he has now extended the ban to branches and subsidiaries
throughout Japan.
A Yanase manager in Nagoya, central Japan, said about 8 per cent of
employees are exempt, either because they live too far from the office or
for health reasons. But the rest of the branch's 600 employees are not
allowed to drive to work.
'We check the car park three times a day to make sure that no unauthorised
employees have driven in,' the manager said. 'If they break the rule once,
they will be given a warning. If they break it again and again, they will be
admonished and their salary may be cut.'

FT  23 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Concert party fires speculation - Andrew
Taylor on possible new ownership at Watts Blake Bearne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 280-YEAR-old Devon business, a world leader in its field, looks set to
lose its independence, and there appears little that the directors or
majority of shareholders will be able to do to influence the outcome or
price at which it is sold.
Watts Blake Bearne has been digging ball clay out of the Bovey Basin near
Newton Abbot since 1710. The heavy sticky clay, which once produced tobacco
pipes, is used worldwide to manufacture ceramics such as sanitary ware, wall
and floor tiles and table ware.
The ownership of the company has been thrown into question by the decision
of three shareholders to sell their combined stake of 45.2 per cent.
The companies, which are acting as a concert party, say that, under takeover
rules, the sale 'is likely to lead to an offer for the entire issued share
capital of the company.'
The three are Ceramics Holdings, controlled by the Lebanese Gargour family,
Sibelco, a privately-owned Belgian-based producer of silica sand for the
glass industry, and Quarzwerke, a private German producer of silica sand.
Mr John Pike, Watts Blake Bearne managing director, said: 'The three
companies are acting within their rights. They announced a concert party
agreement to pursue common interests in 1991 which allows them to sell their
combined holdings in this way.'
'It is tough, however, for other shareholders, many of which have said they
wish us to remain independent. It will be very difficult to mount a defence
if, as seems likely, the sale of such a large block of shares triggers a bid
at an unsatisfactory price.'
The company can only hope that the minimum price, which has not been
disclosed, is not met; an acceptable white knight can be found to buy the
stake; or that the shareholding can be placed with a number of investors
rather than sold to a single purchaser.
A placing, however, would be unlikely to raise as much cash as a sale to a
single buyer which might be prepared to pay a premium to provide a
spring-board for a take-over.
Sibelco and Quarzwerke could themselves bid for the company. They have a
pre-emption right, should a recommended purchaser offer less than 433p a
share, to buy Ceramics' shares at the same price.
At 433p the business would be valued at just Pounds 90m compared with
shareholders funds currently of about Pounds 50m or 240p a share. Watts
Blake Bearne's share price closed last night at 443p.
Mr Ian Hilliker, analyst at NatWest Securities, said a bidder could afford
to pay up to 530p a share or Pounds 110m without earnings dilution based on
forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.2m this year.
'This is a high quality company which absolutely dominates its niche
market', he said.
Watts Blake Bearne, which generates 85 per cent of its sales outside the UK,
estimates that it provides clay for 40 per cent of the European sanitary
ware market, a third of the US market and half of the Far East market. It
also claims to supply a quarter of the European and US floor tile market.
It owns extensive clay reserves in Germany and in the US where in 1989 it
bought United Clays the country's second biggest ball clay prod-ucer.
Profits, which had grown steadily since the family-owned business was
floated in 1964, have faltered recently due to the recession in the
construction industry. The group estimates that two-thirds of sales are
triggered by new building, repair, maintenance or improvement work.
The loss of an important customer in the US (since replaced), compounded
problems and pre-tax profits slipped to Pounds 5.67m in 1991 compared with a
peak of Pounds 8.47m in 1989.
NatWest expects profits to have bounced back to Pounds 6.8m last year helped
by recent acquisitions and a recovery in the US business.
The company should benefit from a recovery in the US and UK construction
industries, particularly housebuilding, although the continental European
ceramics market is likely to fall further. It seems probable, however, that
new owners will reap the benefits from any revival.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Airbus denies signing super-jumbo accord
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOUR European partners in the Airbus consortium are discussing the
possibility of joining Boeing in studying joint construction of a
'super-jumbo' airliner, but have not yet signed an accord with the US
company, officials said yesterday, David Buchan reports from Paris.
Both Aerospatiale, Airbus' French partner, and Boeing denied a newspaper
report quoting Mr Jurgen Schrempp, chairman of Deutsche Aerospace, Airbus'
German partner, saying a transatlantic agreement had been signed to examine
the feasibility of building a 600-800 seat aircraft.
The supervisory board of Airbus, whose four partners also include British
Aerospace and CASA of Spain, yesterday held its monthly meeting in Toulouse.
But the issue of the study with Boeing was said to be more for the four
partners individually than for the consortium.

FT  23 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Glaxo's Zantac to go OTC in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLAXO, Europe's largest pharmaceuticals group, is planning to switch Zantac,
its best-selling drug, from prescription to over-the-counter status in
Japan, the world's second largest market after the US.
Nippon Glaxo, of which Glaxo holds 50 per cent, the balance being privately
held, has signed an agreement with Sankyo and Taisho Pharmaceuticals of
Japan, to co-develop Zantac, the world's best-selling drug.
It is expected to file an application for over-the-counter sales at the end
of 1994, about the same time as its main competitors, Yamanouchi which
markets Samotidine, and SmithKline Beecham which sells Tagamet.
Zantac generated prescription sales of about Pounds 180m in Japan during the
last financial year to June, according to analysts.
The Japanese over-the-counter gastro-intestinal market is worth about Y57bn
(Pounds 300m) a year. Taisho is the market leader with Sankyo third.
The Japanese welfare ministry appears increasingly keen to move drugs from
prescription to over-the-counter status, in an effort to keep down state
drug expenditure.
The move is part of Glaxo's general strategy of licensing out development
and eventually marketing, according to Mr Nigel Barnes, pharmaceuticals
analyst at Hoare Govett.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Government's view on collieries backed: Reports into the
future of the coal industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE thick set of reports which the Department of Trade and Industry issued
yesterday will make depressing reading for the coal lobby.
The independent consultants hired by the DTI to illuminate the debate
support in grim detail what the government has claimed all along: that
British Coal's present size cannot be justified commercially, and that it
will have to undergo deep cuts very quickly if it is to have any worthwhile
future.
The comfort is that a cost-cutting exercise might save a small number of
pits currently listed for closure.
As the four reports make clear, British Coal is in a shrinking market where
its costs are far above those of foreign competitors.
John T. Boyd Company, the US mining engineers which examined the viability
of British Coal's pits, commends the corporation for its 234 per cent
increase in productivity over the last seven years but points out that
Australian and US coal miners are still three to five times more productive.
Because British Coal can never hope to match overseas producers - partly for
reasons beyond its control such as geology - its future is irrevocably
linked to whatever it can secure of the UK market.
However Caminus Energy, which was asked to look at future demand for coal in
the UK, expects it to fall from 95.2m tonnes in 1991-92 to 71m in 1997-98 at
the most, possibly as little as 58.6m. The difference depends on the way
energy prices move over the next few years. If they stay high British Coal
will be able to retain more of the market, but if they weaken, it will lose
out. Caminus says its main rival is natural gas, which provides much cheaper
new generating capacity than coal.
Faced with this harsh reality, the question is how far British Coal can go
in bringing down its costs, because the cheaper the coal it can produce, the
greater the share of the market it will command. The reports look at 21 of
the 31 pits which British Coal wants to close - the other 10 were listed for
immediate closure and are being examined separately.
John T. Boyd visited all the pits under review and came up with two possible
scenarios. In the first it assumed that working practices are unchanged, but
that new technology is introduced and labour reductions are accelerated - a
continuation of present trends. In the second it assumed that work practices
are improved to create more flexible shifts, and that mining regulations are
changed to allow further cuts in manning levels.
The differences are striking. In the second scenario British Coal could be
producing 13m to 19m tonnes more coal annually by April 1996, depending on
the exact cost level. It would, however, have to bring its costs down
substantially. UK coal is costed at Pounds 1.51 per gigajoule for the next
set of contracts starting in April, against international prices of Pounds
0.90. John T. Boyd assumes prices can be brought down to the Pounds 1.10 to
Pounds 1.40 range.
The market prospects are assessed by Caminus which also looked at different
scenarios. In the first it assumed international fuel prices would be high
with coal trading at Pounds 1.21 a gigajoule. In this case sales would be
53.9m tonnes in 1997-98. In the second it priced coal at only Pounds 0.90 a
gigajoule, and sales fell to 22.8m tonnes.
Although this showed, again, that British Coal will do better in a
high-price market, both forecasts are well down on the 85.7m tonnes sold
last year. There is a ray of hope here for the miners because the 1997-98
figure includes 42.4m tonnes of coal for the power generators, well above
the 30m which British Coal now expects to sell to them. But to achieve this
extra 12.4m tonnes everything - the cost savings and the international fuel
price - would have to go British Coal's way.
Although Caminus does not say what this would mean in terms of pits and jobs
saved, the rule of thumb is 1,000 jobs and one pit for every 1m tonnes.
All the reports go into how British Coal could cut its costs in some detail.
John T. Boyd provides a string of recommendations, including giving the
local colliery manager more autonomy, further introduction of new
technology, and changes in existing work restrictions and statutes.
Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, was asked to look at administrative
overheads which, it says, have not fallen in line with cuts at the
workplace. It believes British Coal could save Pounds 73.6m to Pounds 107.1m
a year by 1996-97 by cutting and simplifying the administrative system. But
this would involve the loss of about 3,000 white-collar jobs. Ernst &amp; Young
recommended that a small corporate office be retained in central London,
with other headquarter services re-located close to a colliery. The number
of regional groups should be halved and business systems modernised.
PIMS Associates, management consultants, said savings in overheads of Pounds
90m could be achieved if British Coal matched international standards. But
its report doubts that it could ever match the best-practice benchmark in
the industry of Pounds 75,000 of value added per employee in the next few
years. A more realistic level, it says, is a 20 per cent improvement to
Pounds 47,000 in three years.
The reports are therefore a vindication of the government's aim of cutting
back British Coal.
Critics will say that they take no account of aid received by other power
sources - for example the nuclear levy. But the presumption is that the UK
energy business must ultimately stand on its own two feet.
MAIN POINTS
John T. Boyd:
In the context of reduced market size, the general strategy and overall
future for each pit announced in October appears reasonable.
Significant cost reductions, plus improved safety and productivity, could be
achieved by the application of modern technology.
Important to address technological and structural problems as soon as
possible to achieve cost benefits and a healthy, competitive industry.
Past performance is not a reliable measure of future potential as all
collieries in the list of 21 would need to achieve substantial improvements
in productivity and operating cost.
Caminus Energy:
UK market for coal set to contract sharply over the next five years,
primarily because of reduction in coal use for power generation in England
and Wales as new gas-fired plant comes into operation.
Gas prices would need to increase to about double the level of existing
contracts in real terms for coal to become more economically attractive in
new plant.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Government says pit closures decision vindicated by reports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday claimed vindication for its decision last October
to close 31 coal mines after independent reports pointed to an unprecedented
decline in the market and broadly backed the selection of pits chosen for
closure.
However, the likelihood that the government will change its mind on some of
the pits was reinforced by the conclusion of one of the reports, by John T
Boyd, a US mining consultancy, that 13 could be profitable if there were
significant changes to working practices.
One of the 31, Point of Ayr, in north Wales, seems almost certain to remain
open after Boyd said its 'room and pillar' mining system should be applied
at other collieries. 'Priority should be given to continuation of this pit
to demonstrate the feasibility and economics of the system.'
Boyd said British Coal's strategy for selecting the 31 pits originally
earmarked to close appeared reasonable. Among the 21 since granted a stay of
closure by the government, the consultancy ranked Maltby and Hatfield the
most economic, and Westoe and Easington the least so.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said the reports broadly confirmed the
assessments which led to the original decision in October to close the pits.
The government would consider the reports in its white paper on energy but
he added that no pit would be viable unless there was a market for coal.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry minister, said the reports made it
hard to believe that ministers were carrying out a searching review of
energy policy.
The report by Caminus Energy, 'tells us nothing more than that on present
policies coal is being shut out from the electricity market. We knew that in
October,' he said.
Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, said the
reports failed to take account of subsidised imports and more expensive
forms of energy including nuclear power. Mr Neil Greatrex, president of the
breakaway Union of Democratic Mineworkers, said all 31 pits could be
profitable.
At Westminster last night there were fears that publication of the documents
could provoke a split among members of the cross-party trade and industry
select committee, which meets to finalise its report on the sector early
next week.
There were suggestions that Tory committee members might use the independent
reports to argue for recommendations that would save too few of the 31
threatened pits to be acceptable to some Labour members.
The select committee report is expected to be published on Friday.
Among the reports, Boyd suggested that six of the 21 pits whose future is
undecided could operate on a profitable basis within three years.
The number would rise to 13 if laws restricting changes in working practices
and management were removed.
Caminus Energy said that in a free market where rival fuels were relatively
cheap, British Coal's total sales, failing contractual arrangements with
generators, could fall from 86m tonnes this year to 21m next.
The two other reports, by Ernst &amp; Young and Pims, suggested ways for British
Coal to make significant savings in management costs, presaging the loss of
up to 3,000 redundancies among senior staff.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Sport: Ford gets it right first time - Motoring / Stuart
Marshall test drives the new Mondeo and is impressed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD REALLY has got its most important new model in years right first time.
Two weeks ago, I wrote here that if the Mondeo's on-road performance lived
up to its paper promise, it ought to breathe new life into Ford. But I
wondered out loud if, like quite a few new Fords in the past, it might have
some aggravating drawback that would put me off.
It has not. I judged the left-hand drive 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0 litre Mondeo
saloons and hatchbacks I tried in southern France last week well able to
look rivals like the Vauxhall Cavalier (Opel Vectra), Nissan Primera, Toyota
Carina E and Peugeot 405 in the eye.
Owners or users of the veteran rear-wheel driven Sierra that Mondeo replaces
may well find it so much better that they will feel it has moved up half a
class.
As multi-valve engines go, those powering the Mondeo are good without being
outstanding. One can say the same of the standard five-speed gearbox. But
what makes Mondeo shine is the thoroughness with which Ford has tackled
noise, vibration and harshness.
All the cars felt reassuringly solid and throughout two days of energetic
driving were squeak and rattle free. I started with an entry-model 1.6
litre. At around 130 kph (81 mph) on the autoroute - all right, just a bit
more - there was barely a whisper of wind and tyre noise and only a soft hum
from the engine.
Away from the autoroute's smooth tarmac the ride was supple, shock-absorbent
and quiet. (Mondeo is shorter than Sierra, but its wheelbase is longer and
the track wider). The medium low profile 65 series tyres did not roar on
coarse surfaces, nor thump when hitting potholes. Four up and with a boot
full of luggage, it handled with elegance and ease. Power assistance,
standard on all Mondeos, takes away steering effort but you still know what
kind of surface the tyres are on.
The 90 horsepower 1.6 litre engine spins freely up to high revolutions in
the gears but pulls smoothly in fifth from under 30 mph (50 kmh). The 1.8
litre, 115 horsepower Ghia I tried next felt much peppier, a 2.0 litre, 136
horsepower model more muscular still. The 1.8 and 2.0 litre Mondeos were
enjoyable, even stimulating, to drive on the uncrowded D roads of the Var.
There were times when I convinced myself the 2.0 litre could easily have
been an Audi or BMW. But the 1.6 litre rode best; the least powerful,
narrowest-tyred models always do.
Visibility is good over the short, downswept bonnet and the driving position
is fine. The Ghia's soft leather seats with power adjustment could have come
from a Pounds 30,000 car.
So does the Mondeo have no flaws at all? Not quite. A six-footer finds it
difficult to be comfortable in the rear seat because head and legroom are
meagre unless the person up front is short-legged. The overall gearing of
the 2.0 litre models - only 20 mph/32 kmh per 1,000 rpm - is too low. Of
course, it makes for great flexibility in town and vigorous acceleration in
fourth or fifth - but who wants to cruise a 2.0 litre car on an autoroute at
more than 4,000 rpm?
There is no rear-seat problem in the spacious Mondeo estate because the
cushion is lower. I shall be surprised if the 2.0 litre cars do not go on
sale with revised gearing.
Unquestionably, Mondeo is off to a good start. There will be sighs of relief
at Ford from March onward as it begins eroding the gains General Motors
(Vauxhall and Opel), Rover and Peugeot have made at the ageing Sierra's
expense.
The latest Escort has persuaded some Sierra buyers to trade down to a
smaller but nicely furnished and more modern car of equal performance.
Mondeo may do the same with Scorpio users.
Imagine a really posh model with the US designed and made 2.5 litre V6
engine, electronically-controlled automatic transmission and traction
control system, leather trim and air conditioning. It would match or exceed
Scorpio standards of luxury and performance without the bulk - and it is
coming before long.
So, too, are the four-wheel drive models, the turbocharged and intercooled
1.8 diesels and the estate cars.
All we need to know are the prices, due for release just before the Mondeo's
public debut at Geneva in March. If they are as keen as whispers suggest,
Ford's recovery prospects will be brighter than seemed possible a few months
ago.

FT  23 JAN 93 / British Airways: Customers show no signs of leaving BA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (Published 26th January 1993) appended to this article.
BRITISH AIRWAYS staff might feel angry and humiliated by the publicity
surrounding the Virgin Atlantic 'dirty tricks' campaign, but the company's
customers show no sign of abandoning the airline.
At Heathrow airport yesterday Ms Yvonne Kirk, a retail consultant, said: 'If
you've got a nine or 10-hour flight ahead of you, you're more worried about
service than anything else.'
Ms Kirk, who was waiting to board her club class flight to Japan, said
'looking after myself' remained her top priority in choosing flights.
BA staff said they had received no complaints from customers about the
events.
Ironically, it has been Virgin which has remained most nervous of publicity.
Airport staff at Gatwick airport yesterday refused to allow Virgin
passengers to be interviewed in the airport. According to the airline this
was to avoid charges of 'profiteering' from the events.
Some BA passengers at Heathrow expressed disappointment with the airline's
behaviour but said it would not affect their choice of carrier.
A senior manager flying club class to Chicago with BA said: 'There's been a
lot of discussion among my colleagues about it. We are all surprised that
British Airways would do this.' But she added: 'I normally fly British
Airways, and I don't intend to change.'
Even customers of Virgin Atlantic interviewed at Heathrow said the 'dirty
tricks' campaign would not stop them flying BA in future.
Mr Marvin Goodman, an American businessman waiting to board a Virgin flight,
said he would continue to fly with BA 'whenever convenient'. He added: 'I
wouldn't change my travel plans because of this kind of brouhaha.'
Ms Louise McDonald, a transatlantic economy passenger with Virgin, said
there were still good reasons for flying BA. 'All the stories reflect badly
on them, but you've got to look at the safety.'
Travel companies booking flights for corporate clients said they had no
evidence that disaffected customers were preparing to abandon BA. So great
is the airline's power in the travel business, however, that some felt they
should say even that anonymously.
A manager with one large business travel chain said: 'We're uncomfortable
talking about it. BA is a very big business partner of ours and we also have
strong business links with Virgin.'
He added: 'This story might have caused a lot of controversy, but the bottom
line is that BA have a very loyal customer base that they've developed over
many years. It's bad publicity for them, but whether it will result in any
downturn in their business I very much doubt.'
Mr Alan Coles, vice-president of business travel operations at American
Express, said companies would hesitate before changing airlines. 'A lot of
our customers have corporate policies with particular airlines.'
Mr Coles said American Express had had experience in the past of business
travellers wanting to change airlines, but that was usually because of
rumours that the carrier was in financial difficulty.
Mr Bruce Shepherd, the company's retail sales director, said: 'It's sad that
we have two major airlines airing their differences publicly, but at the end
of the day both of them have a good following. It's the fare level and the
quality of service that determine what airline people fly.'
CORRECTION
SOME editions of the FT on Saturday mistakenly gave the impression that Mr
Bruce Shepherd was retail sales director of American Express. Mr Shepherd
holds this position at AT Mays.

FT  23 JAN 93 / International Company News: Hafnia extends bid deadline by a
week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAFNIA, the troubled Danish insurer, has extended by a week the deadline
before which potential bidders can make offers to buy the group because of
the emergence of new interest.
Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned French bank, yesterday refused to comment
on speculation suggesting that it was the new party considering a bid.
Potential bidders have until January 29 to submit their bids. Hafnia said
the deadline had been extended to allow interested parties more time to
conduct due diligence examinations.
Several insurers have expressed interest in buying Hafnia's Danish general
insurance and banking business. Skandia of Sweden, Scandinavia's biggest
insurer, yesterday confirmed its interest.
Mr Johan Bergenstjarna, Skandia chief of staff, said yesterday that Skandia
was one of the companies conducting due diligence at Hafnia. Two Danish
companies, ALM Brand and Codan, in which Sun Alliance of the UK has a 65 per
cent stake, have expressed an interest.
Two other companies, Tryg Forsikring and Germany's Allianz, Europe's biggest
insurer, have been mentioned as possible bidders, although Allianz said
yesterday that it had 'no comment whatsoever on such rumours'.
Hafnia suspended payments to its creditors last year, after sustaining heavy
losses in its portfolio of investments. The group owns nearly 34 per cent of
Baltica, a rival Danish company, and 14.8 per cent of Skandia,
Mr Steen Parsholt, Hafnia executive in charge of selling off the company's
activities, told Reuters there had been great bidder interest in taking over
the insurer.
Hafnia's UK life insurance operation, the Kendal-based Prolific, was sold
late last year to Scottish Provident, the mutual life insurer.
Transamerica Corporation, the large San Francisco-based insurance and
financial services conglomerate and Sedgwick, the London-based insurance
broker, are to pump Pounds 12m (Dollars 18.24m) into their jointly-owned
London market insurance subsidiary, River Thames Insurance.
The cash injection, which is in proportion to the two companies' equity
holdings, increases the net worth of River Thames to Pounds 26m.
Transamerica and Sedgwick respectively own 51 per cent and 49 per cent of
the group.
River Thames will adjust its strategic direction to focus more tightly on
specialist and treaty reinsurance business.
Pre-tax losses at River Thames amounted to Pounds 9.5m in 1992 and Pounds
3.6m in 1991, with underwriting losses jumping to Pounds 16.4m from Pounds
10m.
Premium income increased to Pounds 90.7m in 1992 from Pounds 85.4m in 1991

FT  23 JAN 93 / Angolan government offers peace talks to Unita rebels
</HEADLINE>

   LUANDA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Angolan government has offered to hold immediate peace talks to end a
resumed civil war against the Unita rebel movement after suffering a series
of military reverses, Reuter reports from Luanda.
It remains unclear however whether the rebels will attend.
Diplomats said Unita had taken an oil platform offshore from Soyo but would
free 17 foreigners held since the guerrillas captured the town, Angola's
second most important oil centre, on Tuesday.
State radio said the government put forward a five-point proposal for talks
to be held today in Addis Adaba, giving into Unita demands for political as
well as military matters to be discussed at the meeting first proposed two
weeks ago.
The proposal called on Unita to respect May 1991 peace accords, honour an
immediate ceasefire, accept the results of September elections, allow the
free circulation of people and goods and respect the UN role in the country.
But Unita, which scuppered earlier negotiations by setting last-minute
conditions, said it was not given enough time to prepare for the talks,
which the government said should be organised by the United Nations. 'Unita
welcomes the talks that will begin soon in the Ethiopian capital under the
auspices of the United Nations,' '' Unita's Washington office said.
'Unfortunately, the fierce fighting in Huambo and the government's massive
indiscriminate aerial bombardments makes it impossible to assemble our
delegations and arrange transport as quickly as we would like.'
Unita and the government signed an accord in 1991 ending 16 years of civil
war in the southern African country which gained independence from Portugal
in 1975.
But fighting resumed in earnest this month after Unita rejected the results
of September elections and took control of 70 per cent of the country.
Diplomats said the government was apparently on the defensive after the loss
of Soyo and its inability to take Huambo, Unita's headquarters in the
central highlands, in two weeks of heavy air and artillery raids.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Airbus denies signing super-jumbo accord

THE FOUR European partners in the Airbus consortium are discussing the
possibility of joining Boeing in studying joint construction of a
'super-jumbo' airliner, but have not yet signed an accord with the US
company, officials said yesterday, David Buchan reports from Paris.
Both Aerospatiale, Airbus' French partner, and Boeing denied a newspaper
report quoting Mr Jurgen Schrempp, chairman of Deutsche Aerospace, Airbus'
German partner, saying a transatlantic agreement had been signed to examine
the feasibility of building a 600-800 seat aircraft.
The supervisory board of Airbus, whose four partners also include British
Aerospace and CASA of Spain, yesterday held its monthly meeting in Toulouse.
But the issue of the study with Boeing was said to be more for the four
partners individually than for the consortium.

JOHN FAIRFAX Holdings, the Australian newspaper group, which is 15 per
cent-owned by Mr Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph group, expects pre-tax
profits of ADollars 105m (USDollars 72.4m) in the year to June, compared to
earlier forecasts of ADollars 94m.
Share option prospectuses lodged with the Australian Securities Commission,
said revenue was expected to be 3 per cent lower than the earlier forecast
of ADollars 782m because of slow economic growth.
Fairfax said the forecast improvement in profit reflected reduced costs and
lower interest charges.
The Daily Telegraph, meanwhile, is seeking government approval to lift its
stake in Fairfax to 25 per cent.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Bank of England Governor: Two sides to gentleman farmer who
codified role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are two Robin Leigh-Pembertons, the man who is giving way to Eddie
George.
There is the governor who is liked and admired by Bank of England executives
and his fellow directors on the Bank's court, the man who codified the
Bank's role, gave greater responsibilities to executives and made the Bank
less secretive.
The other Leigh-Pemberton is a man described by a City banker as 'the most
able gentleman farmer ver to be governor'. Mr Leigh-Pemberton has been
criticised in the City and Westminster for taking too long to
professionalise the Bank's supervision department, which monitors banks'
soundness and honesty.
He was an unlikely choice for governor. His previous job, from 1977 to 1983,
was chairman of National Westminster Bank, and no clearing banker had ever
before been chosen as governor. When prime minister, Mrs Margaret Thatcher
chose him for the post and earlier in his career he had been set on becoming
a Conservative MP.
Nonetheless, on some of the main economic issues of the 1980s he took an
independent line.
He strongly, though vainly, supported the former chancellor, then Mr Nigel
Lawson, in his attempt in late 1985 to take the pound into the European
exchange rate mechanism and was delighted when the pound did finally join
the system in 1990.
The previous year he had alienated both Mr Lawson and Mrs Thatcher by
signing the Delors report on economic and monetary union, which paved the
way for the Maastricht treaty. His copy of the report is among his proudest
possessions and it sits in the top drawer of his magisterial desk at the
Bank.
However, his enthusiasm for the ERM may have clouded his judgment. The
humiliating circumstances of Black Wednesday could perhaps have been avoided
if the Bank had taken a less sanguine view of its ability to defend the
pound.
His record on banking supervision is also patchy. The need for more
professionalism in the supervision department was made clear by the collapse
of Johnson Matthey Bankers in 1984. The Bank had ignored a series of warning
signs. The Bank then succeeded in upsetting Mr Lawson by omitting to tell
him that it was injecting Bank funds into JMB, causing him inadvertently to
mislead the Commons.
The final chapter of the JMB affair was less unsatisfactory. The Bank
eventually recovered all funds put into JMB and the supervisory department
became more effective following the 1987 Banking Act.
Probably the supervision department's greatest achievement was during the
onset of the 1989 recession when it prevented the collapse of a string of
small and medium-sized banks, which were put at risk by an escalation in bad
debts.
However, it faced criticism for failing to detect the widespread fraud at
the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the corrupt international
bank, until early 1991. The recent government inquiry into BCCI by Lord
Bingham concluded that the Bank could have been more methodical and
aggressive.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton regards the attacks on him in the press and parliament
over the Bank's supervision of BCCI, which was closed in mid-1991, as the
most stressful period in his Bank career. On the other hand, he has played
an influential role in harmonising the bank regulations of different
countries.
In 1986, together with Mr Paul Volcker, then chairman of the US Federal
Reserve, he initiated the negotiations which led to the Basle international
standard on banks' capital adequacy ratios.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton was on the point of retiring after only eight years in
the post, but decided to wait until after the last election. He thus had to
contend with both BCCI and Black Wednesday. If he was hoping for a gentle
end to his career, he has been sorely disappointed.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Bank of England Governor: Challenges in setting economic
policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR EDDIE GEORGE picked up his nickname of 'hard Eddie' for his unstinting
efforts to secure price stability.
Last night, in a brief statement welcoming the appointment, Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, said he had 'made clear to the new governor that his
central responsibility should be to support the government in our
determination to bring about a lasting reduction in the rate of inflation'.
The statement encapsulated the relationship the chancellor expects to have
with the top man in Threadneedle Street after he takes over in July. Mr
Lamont (if he is still in Number 11 Downing Street) will be on the same
wavelength as Mr George about the Bank's main policy goal.
By recounting the chancellor's instructions to Mr George, the statement also
made clear there is no possibility under this government of the Bank
becoming independent so long as there is no move to a single European
currency.
But that does not mean that the Bank will not face economic policy
challenges, and possibly tensions with the Treasury, during Mr George's five
year term.
Behind the windowless curtain wall that contributes so much to the Bank's
aloofness and mystique, the Bank's court, or board of directors, has already
started a debate about its future.
This will have to consider how much priority to give to price stability and
how much to the Bank's other tasks such as safeguarding and developing
London's financial markets, supervising the banking sector and giving some
protection to industry in times of trouble.
On the question of supporting the government against inflation, Mr George
will take over an institution that already has aspirations to play a more
prominent role in policy making.
Next month the Bank will publish the first of its quarterly reports on
inflation that form part of the more open conduct of monetary policy that
has followed sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism.
Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the present governor, has promised that these
reports will 'put the Bank's professional competence on the line'. They will
not be restricted to a discussion of the past but will cover likely future
developments to produce a 'wholly objective and comprehensive analysis of
inflationary trends and pressures'.
It is easy to imagine circumstances in which such reports could bring the
Bank into conflict with the government, so long as the chancellor and
Treasury call the shots on interest rate changes.
Mr Lamont is no doubt sincere in his determination to bring underlying
inflation down to between zero and 2 per cent by the end of this parliament.
But will chancellors or prime ministers always be so high minded,
particularly if an election is looming?
Mr George will also become the UK's representative on the European
Community's committee of central bank governors. Although the future of the
EC's ambitious project for economic and monetary union has been under a
cloud since the September crisis that saw sterling and the lira quit the
ERM, the governor's committee is pushing ahead with work on Emu.
As the committee considers a future Europe-wide monetary policy, the
challenge for Mr George will be to ensure that he can prevent moves that
might undermine London's role as an international financial centre.
His expertise on financial markets will be an undoubted asset that should
offset any difficulties arising from sterling's position outside the ERM.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Bank of England Governor: New chief welcomed in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S appointment was welcomed by central bankers and government
officials in continental Europe as a sign that the Bank's stewardship would
pass into a safe pair of hands.
One central banker in continental Europe said the British government was
'setting a very high store by real professionalism'.
As a man with a discreet presence on the international financial circuit for
more than two decades 'Eddie knows his interlocutors well,' the central
banker said. 'There is high regard for his professional capacity and his
ability to communicate. And he's quite a good diplomat.'
Mr George's appointment appeared likely to win support in Washington, where
he is viewed as the official at the Bank who showed the most awareness of
problems in the Bank's handling of BCCI.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Bank of England Governor: Hardliner wins approval from City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR EDDIE GEORGE'S appointment was given a generally warm welcome by City
economists, who acknowledged his reputation for taking a hard line against
inflation in the UK in recent years.
Mr John Shepperd, head of bond research at SG Warburg, said Mr George had a
reputation in the City as a hardliner on monetary policy who would give the
battle against inflation top priority. 'He may be very cautious about easing
interest rate policy,' he said.
Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at James Capel, also referred to the
governor-designate's reputation as a hard man on monetary policy, saying
that there should not be any doubts about his credibility in fighting
inflation.
But he added: 'The problem at the moment is knowing how much independence
the Bank will have in formulating policy. The really important question is
still whether the government will stick to its anti-inflation objectives.'
Several economists said Mr George's strong understanding of financial
markets would add to the Bank's credibility at a time when it has a high
profile in currencies and gilts.
Mr Skeoch said: 'The new governor has been responsible for gilt market
operations at the Bank, and that is an important experience to have had at a
time when the issue of government funding is so high on the agenda.'
Several economists suggested, however, that Mr George is a technocrat who
has made his career at the Bank of England, and that this may make him too
secretive about the nature of monetary policy.
Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist at Kleinwort Benson, said the incoming
governor was very resistant to having visible indices of monetary policy.
'He is the sort of person who wants to conduct policy in a highly
discretionary, judgmental way,' he said.
City analysts were uncertain - and divided - about Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea's
appointment as deputy governor. One senior city economist said the new
deputy would have a large say in the presentation of policy, while another
claimed that he had never heard his name.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Bank of England Governor: Striving for stability through
supervision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England's powers are greatest in two areas which normally
attract very little public interest - and about which Mr Eddie George talked
only in passing yesterday.
These two areas are defined in the Bank's statement of principles as:
Preserving the stability of the banking system through the work of the
Bank's supervisory division operating under the 1987 Banking Act;
Encouraging the competitiveness and efficiency of markets in the City of
London.
There has been a widespread debate in the City and in Westminster recently
about whether it is appropriate for the Bank to retain these roles.
The Bank's effectiveness as a supervisor has been called into doubt by
criticism of its performance in monitoring the activities of the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International, the corrupt international bank which was
closed in 1991.
Lord Bingham's report said the Bank should have been more aggressive and
methodical.
In response the Bank has set up a specialist investigations unit and a legal
unit within the supervision department, both headed by outsiders.
Mr George has never worked in the supervision department and therefore
escaped criticism in the Bingham report. He said yesterday that for now he
perceived there was a strong case for retaining the supervisory functions
within the Bank.
However, his replacement as deputy, Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, argued forcefully
in a recent Economist editorial that the supervision department should be
separated from the Bank.
Some bankers believe that if the supervision department were separated from
the Bank, it might adopt a tougher approach to the banks it regulates.
They also say there is an argument for streamlining the supervision of banks
with the supervision of other financial institutions, now carried out by the
Securities and Investments Board and several self-regulatory organisations
whose functions are under review by Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman.
There have also been concerns among some bankers and regulators that the
Bank is often reluctant to take punitive action against leading City
institutions for fear of damaging the City's reputation.
They have argued that the Bank's effectiveness as a supervisor is reduced by
its allegedly conflicting goal of promoting the efficiency of London
markets. Critics feel there is only a fine line between encouraging the
efficiency and effectiveness of markets on the one hand and acting as a
sponsor of the City as a place to do business. In practice, the governor has
often played a public relations role on behalf of the City. Mr
Leigh-Pemberton has for example campaigned vigorously for any future
European Central Bank to be located in London.
Mr Pennant-Rea's chief argument for separating the supervisory department is
that the bank would suffer from a severe conflict of interest if it were
given independent powers to set interest rates.
The argument is that a central bank's responsibility for ensuring the
soundness of banks might deter it from raising interest rates to combat
inflationary pressures, if it feared doing so would damage commercial banks.
However, most Bank executives are convinced that such a conflict is most
unlikely in practice.
On the other hand, Mr Pennant-Rea points out that most independent central
banks, such as Germany's Bundesbank, do not have direct responsibility for
the supervision of banks. He believes a narrowly focused central bank is a
more efficient central bank.

THE chairmen of two Commons committees are considering calling for a full
inquiry into Civil Service standards of conduct and impartiality following
the payment of Pounds 4,700 of public money towards the legal fees of Mr

The inquiry idea is floated by Labour MPs Mr Giles Radice, of the Civil

Mr Radice says: 'It is very likely that we will proceed into a full inquiry

FT  23 JAN 93 / Lambeth council report alleges corruption of Pounds 10m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORRUPTION and malpractice on an 'unprecedented' scale have cost the south
London borough of Lambeth upwards of Pounds 10m, according to a confidential
report by Mr Herman Ouseley, the council's chief executive.
The report is a catalogue of work done without proper authority,
unauthorised redundancy payments, overcharging by the council's
direct-labour organisation and overcharging by former council employees
brought in as sub-contractors by the organisation.
Some cases uncovered involve double charging. The most serious cases involve
the borough's housing department.
The findings of Mr Ouseley's report may be investigated by the Serious Fraud
Squad, whatever action the council itself takes.
The report, debated by councillors at an emergency meeting last night,
suggests that police be called in and recommends that an independent enquiry
be established. It also raises the issue of disbanding the direct-labour
organisation and putting its services out to tender.
The allegations involve officials, council workers and contractors and go
back more than 10 years.
Throughout most of the period in question Lambeth was under the control of a
leftwing Labour administration.
Lambeth's finances have long been in a critical state. It has the highest
poll tax in England - Pounds 425 after capping - and more than Pounds 157m
outstanding in uncollected rents, poll tax, and rates.
Mr Steven Whaley, the council's Labour leader, called for a
'no-holds-barred' inquiry by a leading barrister, but conceded that the
council had not been as 'vigorous and vigilant' as it should have been.
Mr Keith Fitchett, Liberal Democrat leader, said the report reflected 'a
complete breakdown of managerial control in Lambeth, arising from the . . .
debilitating relationship between the Labour party and local government
unions.'
Mr Peter Evans, deputy leader of the council's Conservative group, called
the report a 'whitewash' and said it was 'the tip of the ice-berg'.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman, said he wanted 'strong and
effective action to deal with the quite appalling abuses revealed by this
report'.
'We expect to see decisions taken quickly to ensure that these abuses are
never allowed to happen again.'

FT  23 JAN 93 / Likud candidate in sex scandal accuses rivals of dirty
tricks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAELIS yesterday got the news they had been waiting for all week. It was
not about Iraq, or the Palestinian deportees crisis. It was the naming of
the 'other woman' in a scandal which has engulfed Mr Binyamin 'Bibi'
Netanyahu and threatened his powerful bid to become leader of the rightwing
opposition Likud party and, perhaps, Israeli prime minister.
The scandal, inevitably dubbed 'Bibigate', is much more than a tabloid
potboiler over Mr Netanyahu's self-confessed adultery. He himself has made
it a central issue in his campaign to succeed retiring former premier Mr
Yitzhak Shamir as party leader in March.
Mr Netanyahu, a former junior minister, is best known as Israel's
high-profile spokesman during the Gulf war. He says an alleged attempt by
Likud rivals to blackmail him over an extra-marital affair symbolises the
corruption within Israeli politics which he means to end in a new era of
American-style open democracy. His opponents counter that his accusations
belie an erratic man who they say is consumed only by personal ambition.
The scandal emerged when Bibi , as everyone calls Mr Netanyahu, appeared on
television to announce that his wife Sara had been telephoned with a threat
to make public a videotape of Mr Netanyahu in a 'compromising romantic
situation' if he did not withdraw from the leadership election. Mr Netanyahu
admitted to an affair which he said had ended, but denounced the alleged
blackmail as the work of supporters of an unnamed Likud rival who, Bibi
said, surrounded himself with criminals. He reported the issue to the
police, who are investigating the blackmail allegations.
Yesterday, newspapers fuelled the row when they revealed that the woman in
question was Mr Netanyahu's former public image adviser whose husband is now
seeking to divorce her, citing her relationship with Mr Netanyahu.
Mr Netanyahu's blackmail accusation was assumed to be aimed at the camp of
Mr David Levy, the former foreign minister. Mr Levy dismisses the
allegations as preposterous. His supporters say Bibi was angered that Mr
Levy, in a tireless round of appearances at private events such as
marriages, bar-mitzvas and circumcisions, had registered more party members
for the leadership contest than Bibi. The outburst, they say, was an attempt
to damage Mr Levy.
Both Mr Levy and the other main Likud candidate, the po-faced Mr Binyamin
Begin, scorn Mr Netanyahu's Americanisation of Israeli politics, with his
well-financed, highly-personalised public campaigning.
But Mr Netanyahu, educated at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology, is
far from beaten. His approach to politics does appear to be in tune with
modern Israelis. He has several times been voted the country's most
desirable man. Yesterday, a poll put him, at 34 per cent to 28 per cent,
ahead of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in public popularity and streets ahead
of both Mr Begin and Mr Levy.
'I believe I will become prime minister. My self-confidence is untouched,'
Mr Netanyahu said in a newspaper interview.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Charles understands the Morse code: The Prince of Wales,
says Dominic Lawson, is not taken in by all the tabloid fairy tales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRESS Complaints Commission, so trenchantly rubbished by Sir David
Calcutt's report on press and privacy, seems still to show signs of
unintelligent life. This week it invited Prince Charles, the Prince of
Wales, to complain to it about the publication of tape recordings alleged to
be between the heir to the throne and Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles.
The Prince, of course, will do no such thing. His advisers over recent years
may not have been the most brilliantly perceptive of their generation of
Sandhurst graduates but even the most inbred of equerries is surely not so
moronic as to plunge the Prince voluntarily into further controversy with
the press.
It is, besides, condescending of Lord McGregor, the accident prone chairman
of the Press Complaints Commission, to imply that the Prince and his staff
would not already have considered and rejected such a suicidal course of
action.
They had decided months ago, when the Daily Mirror first revealed the
existence of the tapes, that to take any action against newspapers
considering publication of them, on grounds of an invasion of privacy, would
be to acknowledge that the tapes were genuine. For it is not far-fetched to
suggest that most ordinary people - that is, those who do not write for or
run newspapers - regard what they read in the tabloid press as fantasy.
Often hugely enjoyable fantasy, but fantasy nonetheless.
The coverage of the Royal family in particular has come so much to resemble
a soap opera, that most readers will be too bemused and confused to know
what is real, what is based on reality, and what is sheer fiction.
The soap opera effect is greatly enhanced by the press's increasing tendency
to cover the lives of fictional television characters as if they were real
people. This week even the serious broadsheet press carried on their news
pages reports of the fate of a an invented television detective called Chief
Inspector Morse. As for the tabloid papers, they had whole pages devoted to
convincing their readers that, somehow, Chief Inspector Morse is a real
person, rather than just a lucrative part of the repertoire of the actor
John Thaw.
This tendency of the press to write about television characters as if they
were real people is merely an exploitation of popular wishful thinking. We
have always warmed to the story-teller's art of confusing fact and fiction.
The success of such long-running radio series as The Archers is precisely
because many listeners regard the script-writers' inventions as the dialogue
of real people, overheard, as if through a particularly porous neighbour's
wall.
The Prince of Wales's advisers should take heart from this phenomenon.
Indeed so should the whole Royal family. They should - if they do not
already - recognise that there are two public views of them, coexisting, but
mutually contradictory.
First, there is what the public see at Royal occasions: processional, full
of pomp and circumstance, immaculately choreographed by centuries of
tradition. This looks and is real (indeed the public can go and watch it)
even though it is denounced by such Labour MPs as Jack Straw and Marjorie
Mowlem as out of place, not of this century.
Second, there is the Royal family as it is written about in the popular
press. This is not real, because it is not tangible, it does not correspond
to what we see of the royal family on our television screens, in officially
sanctioned programmes such as Elizabeth R. Such programmes are denounced by
the new realists as a public relations gloss, a deception upon the public.
But they are far more powerful in forming the public image than any amount
of hostile investigative journalism.
Newspapers are right to pander to the television image of Chief inspector
Morse: they know that the public believes what it sees, not what it reads.
So the Prince of Wales is right to steer well clear of the Press Complaints
Commission. That is part of the world of fantasy which has not got the power
it thinks it has to take away his right to the throne. Instead he should
continue to stick to processions, grand gala openings, and polo. That is the
real world, or at least the one we all want to believe in.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Private View: Refugees from a city where the wrong badge
means death
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONALITY, race, religion: sometimes these labels seem to serve only as a
pretext for murder, or for war.
Mebrura is a Moslem, her husband Majo a Serb. They are well-educated,
middle-class refugees from Sarajevo, the besieged capital of Bosnia-
Hercegovina.
Mebrura Muminovic was born in Banja Luka in northern Bosnia, has an Arab
name and comes from a Slav family that converted to Islam hundreds of years
ago under the Turkish occupation. She has visited a mosque only once. She
used to think of herself as Yugoslav. Now she calls herself Bosnian.
Emotionally, she feels English.
As a child she was required to declare her race: Serb, Croat or undecided.
'I came back from school and asked my father: 'What shall I say?' He said:
'Who do you sit with?' I said: 'Duna, a Croat girl.' So I said I was Croat.
When I was 12 they asked me again. My mother said: 'Who are you sitting
with?' I was sitting with Svetlana, so I wrote down 'Serb'.
'Finally we were able to call ourselves Yugoslavs. So I became Yugoslav for
the rest of my life. I couldn't say I was Moslem because that was a religion
and we weren't religious in any way.'
Her husband interrupted. 'Moslem is an unhappy name. You could never have
found a more tolerant version of Islam anywhere in the world than in Bosnia.
These people are Slavs. They are not descendants of Turks. They are as pure
Slavs as you can be in the Balkans. And all the Moslems, or most of them,
consider themselves to be part of Europe.
'But a terrible thing could be taking place. Feeling betrayed, feeling left
alone for slaughter, the previously docile Moslems could really become what
is called fundamentalist.'
Majo Topolovac was born in Sarajevo. The couple met there while working for
Bosnian television. In 1969 he secured a four-year contract with the BBC
World Service in London, where the pair married and where their two children
were born. Because of that, they were able after returning to Sarajevo to
evacuate their children in 1991. Mebrura, learning she was on two death
lists, escaped last April. Majo, after months living in the TV building
under shell and sniper fire, where he filed over 100 reports for the western
media, secured a UN pass last August.
Today the warring parties are due to meet again in Geneva to discuss the
proposed cantonisation of Bosnia-Hercegovina along ethnic and religious
lines. For Mebrura and Majo Topolovac, however, this is an ex post facto
solution. The civil war, they say, was not caused by racial or religious
tensions: those were merely the instruments deployed, with the help of
sycophantic journalists, for power-grabbing by a corrupt and opportunist
ex-Communist clique.
The couple are vociferous in their analysis of the causes of the Yugoslav
bloodbath but they seem helpless to comprehend its brutality. They concede,
however, that history played some part.
Majo said: 'This is what I call the grandfathers' war. You have
grandfathers, especially in Serbia, with their grand- children on their
knees whispering in their ears: 'We have to pay them back, these Moslems,
these Turks, these Croats.' It's their distorted view of history, their
unfulfilled hatreds which they learned from their own grandfathers.'
His wife said: 'It all really depended on the way you were brought up. In my
case, I was told by my mother that her parents were killed in front of her
eyes by the Ustashe (Croat fascists) - but I was told only when I was 25 or
26. She could have brought me up hating Croats. She could have brought me up
religious. But she didn't'
Majo said: 'On my father's side, 42 males were killed in the last war, the
youngest a child of two and a half, mostly by Ustashe but also by Chetniks
(Serb nationalists). That was because my family were anti-Nazi, anti-fascist
 -not really pro-communist but pro-socialist.
'Yet I was never brought up to hate. I was not told that Croats killed my
father: it was the Ustashe. It's very important to draw this distinction
between ordinary Serbs and these extremists. Even if 100,000 Serbs are
involved in this war, what about the other 9,900,000 who are not?'
Ethnic tensions were whipped up by propaganda, said Mebrura, in what she
called a 'media war'. Objectivity was abandoned, journalists took sides, and
the public was fed a diet of preposterous lies - for example, that Moslems
had been feeding Serb babies to the lions in Sarajevo zoo. Some of these
journalists, Mebrura said, should be tried as war criminals.
So who started the war, I asked?
'Ask yourself who hopes to gain from it,' Majo said. 'The old opportunist
members of the Communist Party. It was the only way for them to stay in
power.'
It was an opportunist war exploiting a peasant mentality.
'During the shelling of the water queue in Sarajevo, one magnificent old man
shouted up to the hills in Serbo-Croat: 'You peasant]' He didn't despise
peasants as such, what he meant was this mean mentality that allows you to
shell even a water queue.'
'It's what rural life can do to civilised people,' said Mebrura. 'You call
it a civil war. Actually it is a war by uncivilised people against civilised
people, by peasant, illiterate crooks and gangsters attacking normal,
intelligent, civilised people.'
Her husband twisted his head to the side and drew his hand across his
throat: 'They are peasants who kill people like killing pigs. In fact, they
are trained to kill like that.'
Mebrura and Majo Topolovac may be accused of having a partial view. They are
a sophisticated and versatile couple. Outside her radio and television work
Mebrura has trained as an actress and fashion designer and she paints in her
spare time. Majo has written plays and won prizes for his children's
stories.
They were both admirers of Tito, though not practising Communists.
Mebrura said: 'To my mind the only mistake Tito and the Communist Party made
was that after the war we should have all declared ourselves Yugoslavs and
had our religions if we wanted. It was ridiculous to have to declare your
nationality as if it was equivalent to your religion.'
Are you sorry Communism collapsed?
Majo replied: 'No. I think it was a better alternative than this senseless
killing. But no, it was a dead end - as practised there, anyway.'
They both agreed that war was made possible by the weakness of the
federation after the 1974 constitution that gave republics virtual
statehood. It had been launched by opportunist politicians and crooked
businessmen as a cover for their corruption, and reinforced by the
confiscation of some Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7.8bn) of hard-currency savings
mostly accumulated by Yugoslavs working overseas.
Now they are in exile themselves and drawing the dole in a cheap flat in
north London.
'I think I lived here in my previous life,' said Mebrura. Majo, always the
more restless and talkative, chipped in: 'We really feel we belong here. We
always looked on England as the Old Country. We felt emotionally English. We
are terribly pro-British and pro-Royal family. Nationality is what one feels
oneself to be deep inside. It's a matter of emotional choice, like choosing
one's wife. You just feel it's her. We should never have left.'
I asked them whether, therefore, they understood the west's hesitancy about
military intervention to break the siege of Sarajevo.
'It's totally incom- prehensible,' Mebrura said.
'In the beginning the situation was so clear that anyone in their right mind
would have intervened. If they had silenced the artillery round Sarajevo
last April or May that would have stopped the war.'
The Serb extremists had already lost the war, said her husband, because they
were overstretched and under- manned. They were now hoping to buy time to
gather themselves for the push against Kosovo, possibly Macedonia, and later
against Albania and Bulgaria. That would draw in Greece and Russia, Turkey
and the Islamic nations - we would see an 'Orthodox jihad' against Moslems
and Catholics.
I pointed out that western governments were unwilling to risk their
soldiers' lives in a war their electorates did not understand. Should our
soldiers be ready to die under a UN flag?
Mebrura answered: 'Nobody likes that soldiers are killed, but soldiers are
for that. That's why they have decided it's going to be their job. I
wouldn't like any soldier to die, but yes, I think so.'
What has this whole experience taught you?
'I think this should be said,' Majo replied. 'Now I know that what is
considered to be impossible is actually possible. No one really believed
that such atrocities could take place.
'Now I know how thin this crust of what we call civilisation is, how thin
and how fragile. We all thought it was impossible in Yugoslavia. We all
think it's impossible in Europe. But Hitler was only 50 years ago.
'Civilisation is just thin ice and you can so easily fall through that ice
into this murky and turbid water of mutual killing, which is endless if not
stopped. This is the main lesson I draw.'
Mebrura was reflecting while her husband spoke.
She said: 'I am just saddened that cynicism overrules everywhere. I am
pretty sure that 100 per cent of the world's politicians know exactly what's
happened there. When I say cynical, I mean that for selfish or other reasons
they don't do anything to help at least those innocent civilians. Yet how
come they suddenly decide they have to intervene again in Iraq?'
Do you want to go back?
'No, I don't. It's not my city any more. How can I trust anyone any more?'
Do you have no feeling of guilt that you are here, safe?
'I don't feel guilt because here I can disseminate the truth, talk to
ordinary people. Anyway, we had to leave. They would have killed us.'
Is there nothing for you to go back to even if peace is restored?
'For me not - apart from my family and friends. The country that used to be
doesn't exist any more. They have destroyed everything - even our woods
where we loved to go mushrooming. They have destroyed even our woods, our
beautiful mountains.'
Majo spoke. 'It's not Sarajevo any more.'
You have no country left to love?
'You have answered it.'

FT  23 JAN 93 / Hawks and Handsaws: A few unpalatable facts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL Tuesday, there was not a lot I knew about the European single market.
Without exaggeration, the quantity or mass of what I did not know about the
European single market was in danger of collapsing, under its own gravity,
into a black hole, to go with all the other black holes that astronomers are
discovering.
On Tuesday, however, there was an FT survey - The European Single Market -
which set everything to rights. Wittily and authoritatively, it plugged the
black hole of my ignorance with analysis, graphs and matter. One of the
articles I enjoyed was a piece by David Marsh that sought to dispel
anxieties about life in the new Europe.
It was couched in the form of 'assertions' and 'facts.' For example:
'ASSERTION: A Commission directive will oblige fishermen to wear hairnets
aboard their boats. FACT: Untrue.' The writer (he happens to be a twin: a
fact resonant with disconnectedness) then explained why this was untrue. All
that is wanted is strict hygiene conditions at fish-processing plants,
including the wearing of head-covers. Similarly, he gave the lie to the
assertion that EC regulations require Christmas trees to sport
regularly-spaced needles, or that the EC wants to outlaw the dye that gives
smoked haddock its 'distinctive golden hue.'
All extremely jolly. Not to be outgunned, I decided to employ the astounding
resources available to this column in such a way as to put the Marsh formula
of assertion and counter-fact to global and cosmological use:
ASSERTION: Readiness by the world's central banks, which hold 35,000 tonnes
of gold, to sell some of this metal, is a bleak pointer for the gold price,
currently rolling drunkenly at around Dollars 330 an ounce.
FACT: Untrue. Two months ago I sold Pounds 3,250 worth of gold shares. This
important market indicator should loom as large on all graphs as Pheidias's
chryselephantine statue of Zeus loomed at Olympia, before its removal to
Constantinople, for it signals an imminent recovery in the gold price,
perhaps of some magnitude.
ASSERTION: Italy's crack-down on the Mafia, plus efforts by the Rome
government to control the budget deficit, overhaul the economy, eliminate
corruption and initiate constitutional reform, mean that prospects are
looking rosy for Europe's most stupid country.
FACT: Untrue. Italy cannot be salvaged. The barbarians are at the gate. Book
your holiday now, before it disintegrates entirely.
ASSERTION: The French are becoming less selfish and more neighbourly.
FACT: Untrue.
ASSERTION: The arts are not in terminal decay.
FACT: Untrue. The arts are all washed up. Good music ended with Rahkmaninov.
Picasso had his moments, but no one will ever paint a better picture than
Botticelli's Primavera. Literature and architecture are sculling round in
circles. From now on, the only worthwhile art will be that produced by
computers.
ASSERTION: The eclipse of Soviet communism heralded the end of
totalitarianism.
FACT: Untrue. With world population growth spiralling out of control,
nations will indeed coalesce into Orwell's Eurasia, Eastasia and Oceania,
with the apparatus of government in each of these blocs shared between the
four great ministries of Nineteen Eighty-Four, Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv
and Miniplenty.
ASSERTION: Nasa's Seti programme - its Search for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence - is proving a damp and costly squib. No alien radio
transmissions have been detected and none can be expected, because Man is
alone in the universe.
FACT: Untrue. Nasa has eavesdropped on thousands of alien conversations
since Seti's launch last October, but is too terrified to admit it. The
reason for Nasa's dread is its discovery that Earth is regarded as the
pariah of the galaxy. Reason: Earth is the only planet in the Milky Way on
which a warring, cannibalistic, drug-crazed, pig-ignorant and irredeemably
criminal species devoted to xenophobic mass killing and the destruction of
its own environment has ever reached the summit of the food chain. Anxious
to help out, a group of alien civilisations has attempted to provide Earth
with better leaders. John Major is a robot. But there are problems with his
circuitry. Some of his wires are crossed. These civilisations have fonder
hopes of the model installed in the White House this week.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Arts: Walton tribute - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A few weeks' time ten years will have passed since William Walton's
death. It probably seems more: most of his major works, including the First
Symphony, the Violin Concerto and Belshazzar's Feast, date from the 1930s
and it is the style of that decade that one takes away so vividly from
almost all his music - its cinematic sweep, its unabashed romance, the
echoes of jazz, the violent premonitions of impending disaster.
This was the decade in which music in Britain might be said decisively to
have broken with its insular past. Walton was the first to shake off
conservatism and it might be thought that the international flavour of his
music would have ensured an international following after his death. But
that is not quite how it has worked out: apart from Previn and Slatkin,
there are few conductors from overseas who get beyond the most obvious
handful of Walton's works.
To that select group, however, one more can be added. Vladimir Ashkenazy has
shown an unexpected willingness to forage in Britain's musical heritage
during his years in London as a conductor, taking in a number of
performances and recordings of Walton's music. To mark the composer's death
he has put together two complete Walton programmes and, if the second is as
good as the one on Thursday, they will constitute an important tribute from
a non-British musician.
The main item was Belshazzar's Feast. This favourite work more or less
selects itself, as Walton produced so few full-scale concert scores, but the
performance had a panache that made it out-of-the-ordinary. When Solti
conducted Belshazzar, he gave it a primeval violence worthy of Stravinsky;
Ashkenazy reminded me more of Rakhmaninov's Symphonic Dances (1940) in the
music's glorying of rhythm and orchestral glamour. It was a joyous
performance, well supported by the Brighton Festival Chorus and John
Connell, the bass.
Some very fine playing from the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (resplendent
brass, warm strings) was already presaged in the Suite from Henry V. Too
much pastiche is incorporated for this to be regarded as valuable Walton,
although the composer seems to have retained an interest in his film scores
(I recall him making a special visit to see his Hamlet at the Aldeburgh
Festival in the 1970s).
What ensured this first concert of the pair was an important event, as
opposed to a merely enjoyable one, was the deeply-felt performance of the
Cello Concerto, which came in between. To judge from the heady atmosphere
they created from the opening bars - sultry evenings on Walton's Ischia
perhaps, tempered by pensiveness and melancholy - Mischa Maisky, the cello
soloist, and Ashkenazy would seem to have a hot line to Walton's unique
sound-world. If the next ten years are to see a widening of Walton's
popularity, this Concerto looks a good place to start.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Arts: Lear sans court at the Court - Malcolm Rutherford
enjoys Max Stafford-Clark's swan song production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAX Stafford-Clark, the departing artistic director at the Royal Court, says
that he had been thinking about performing King Lear there for a good five
years. It is an intriguing idea and one can see why it was so long in
gestation, for the Court, although the stage is very tall, is a relatively
small theatre and Lear is by all conventional standards a very large play.
Clearly the challenge was to find a new approach appropriate to the place.
Stafford-Clark has pulled it off. This is not the classic Lear of grand
poetry and sweeping gestures. It is more a bourgeois soap than a regal
tragedy. But for the first time in my experience it comes across as a
cracking good story. The pace of the production is prodigious - it lasts
barely more than three hours. And because of deliberately going down a notch
or two in the social scale, the capacity to move is if anything enhanced.
There are some dramatic transformations of the stock version of the play. At
the start Goneril and Regan seem entirely justified in their dislike of
their father's habit of bringing 100 unruly retainers to their country
seats. They want to get on with giving their dinner parties and running
their homes in peace. A more subtle change is is that they are not remotely
look-alikes, hardly even recognisably out of the same stable. Lia Williams's
Goneril is svelte, blonde and notably well-dressed. Saskia Reeves's Regan
plainly cares less about her appearance. But they are both enamoured of the
same man: Edmund, the bastard son of the Earl of Gloucester, played with a
northern Irish accent by Adrian Dunbar. Here is soap of a very high order.
Tom Wilkinson's Lear does not look like an old man, certainly not at the
beginning. He is red-faced, has a large moustache and seems rather coarse,
more a country squire than a king. This belies what is to come. Wilkinson
plays the final scenes with Cordelia with magnificent pathos. By then, he
has aged. The key to his character is that he seems genuinely to fear going
mad. When he does it is the onset of madness that makes him first feel for
other people. The 'poor, naked wretches' speech is the beginning of his
understanding. Wilkinson takes the verse in his stride; he does not pander
to it, but never squanders it. His triumph in the acting is that he is a
distressed human being; the kingship is secondary.
There are some wonderful moments. The scene where Edgar leads his father to
the brink of suicide over the cliffs of Dover can scarcely have been better
done. The tension in what by now has become a thriller is breath-taking.
Played by Iain Glen, Edgar has a claim to being the most outstanding actor
in the production after Wilkinson's Lear.
Eccentricities crop up. The Fool is presented by Andy Serkis as a drag
queen. If there is subtlety here, I missed it, though one has always
wondered about Queen Lear and her influence on the family. With the line 'My
poor Fool is hanged', the Fool's body is seen suspended from a rope high up
in the background. Perhaps only fidelity to the text let the Fool be
retained; it is the least satisfactory role in the Stafford-Clark
interpretation.
The dress is spread across the 20th century to about the late 1950s: trench
coats, British military uniform, green army jumpers and jodhpurs. Cara
Kelly's Cordelia comes back from France kitted out like a colonel's lady on
an afternoon's ride. There is no obvious reason for the wardrobe, except
that they have to be dressed in something.
The thunder and lightning are terrific, using the height of the stage to the
full, and there is an authentic whiff of cordite, guns being employed along
side swords. In short, this is probably the most exciting production of Lear
you will ever see. It is also the most enjoyable one of a play which, apart
from some of the verse, I have always disliked intensely. Here paradoxically
is Lear at the Court without the court, an experience unlikely to be
repeated. Go]

FT  23 JAN 93 / Arts: Culture with Clinton - As the new US president takes
over, Karen Fricker looks at the implications for the arts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
'BILL AND Hillary Clinton are going to trigger a cultural renaissance in
this country from MTV (Music Television) to the most sophisticated arts,'
said Ed Markey, Democratic Congressman from Massachusetts, at a Washington
cocktail party on Wednesday night.
We will probably have to chalk up Markey's extravagant statement to
inauguration-night ebullience, but there is an undeniable sense among those
interested in America's cultural life that Clinton's presidency brings new
hope for the arts in America.
'Bill Clinton has shown himself to be a person who's culturally aware and
concerned, and I expect that his administration will bring new thinking
about the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). We've had many years of a
suffocating environment for the arts, and I look forward to a change in
attitude,' said Del Reisman, a screenwriter and President of the Writers
Guild of America, West.
The past 12 years of Republican leadership have been at best indifferent,
and at worst openly hostile, to the arts. Since Reagan took office in 1981,
NEA funding has dropped 36 per cent. The last three years have been
particularly embattled ones for the NEA as controversies over the funding of
politically outspoken and sexually explicit art by such artists as Andres
Serrano, Robert Mapplethorpe and Karen Finley have provoked a national 'art
war' about what constitutes obscenity and appropriateness.
Little is known for sure about what Clinton's arts policy will be. The arts
have not been at the top of his agenda during his campaign. Though Clinton
advisors did work with the NEA during the transition, they did not issue a
statement of arts policy. But Clinton's record on, and attitudes towards,
the arts bode well for the country's cultural future.
Clinton and Gore's campaign platform included a promising, if pithy,
statement on the arts, defending artists' freedom of expression and
advocating government support of the arts through the NEA. Though their
campaign initially opposed content restrictions for NEA-funded art, Clinton
has equivocated on this point. He said in the October 1992 Equity News that,
'While I believe that publicly funded projects should strive to reflect the
values that most communities share, I strongly support and will defend
freedom of speech and artistic expression.' Just what Clinton defines as
community values remains to be seen.
Speculations are flying about whom Clinton will appoint as NEA chairman. The
position was particularly politicised last February when the Bush
administration asked John Frohnmayer to step down from the chair and
replaced him with staunch conservative Anne-Imelda Radice. Radice's use of
her veto power on several gay-themed projects which had already received
peer panel approval won her few friends in the arts community. She stepped
down voluntarily this week with 'no regrets.' Longtime NEA bureaucrat Ana
Steele will serve as acting chair until Clinton appoints someone to the
position. Rumored to be under consideration are Yale School of Drama dean
Lloyd Richards, chairperson of the Dayton Hudson Foundation Cynthia Mayeda,
New York State Council for the Arts chair Kitty Carlisle Hart, actress
Lauren Bacall, and FOB (Friend of Bill) Deborah Sale, who was a member of
the transition arts team.
The NEA's total budget - Dollars 174 million in 1993 - is in Federal terms
insignificant. But NEA grants are crucial to the life of arts organisations,
particularly small ones, and breed more money: corporate and private funders
view a NEA grant as a quality stamp and are more likely to lend their
support to arts institutions that are NEA funded.
Clinton's record on the arts as Governor of Arkansas is fairly strong.
Arkansas' state budget arts allotment is the seventh lowest in the country,
but it has remained constant during the recession while other states have
slashed arts budgets or eliminated them entirely.
'We're not the biggest agency in the state, but Governor Clinton kept in
touch,' says Bill Puppione, Executive Director of the Arkansas Arts Council.
'There was a feeling among arts administrators that the Governor knew what
was going on and that they had access to him,' Puppione says.
In its 1987 education reform package, instituted by a board that included
Hillary Clinton, Arkansas added an arts requirement for high school
graduation, one of the first American states to do so. Education and the
accessibility of the arts, prominently mentioned in Clinton and Gore's
campaign platform, are likely to figure in their national arts policy.
Beyond policy, the president has the opportunity to influence public opinion
about the arts through his personal behaviour, and this is where Clinton is
likely to make the largest impact. Cynics deride Clinton's sax-playing
appearences on talk shows and at presidential galas as image-mongering, and
those of higher brow consider his musical preferences - Michael Bolton,
Kenny G, Fleetwood Mac - the aesthetic equivalent of McDonald's decaf. But
Clinton's active interest in music has humanised him to the public.
And though some call Clinton's choice of an African-American woman, Maya
Angelou, to read her poetry at his inauguration pandering to political
correctness, he was the first President since Kennedy to include a poet in
the inaugural ceremonies.
The Clintons led an active cultural life in Arkansas. They were subscribers
and donors to Little Rock's Arkansas Repertory Theatre and hosted
fundraisers for the theatre and other Arkansas arts organisations and
Hillary Clinton was on the board of the state's largest ballet company.
Cliff Baker, Artistic Director of Arkansas Rep, says that the Clintons were
known to creep into the balcony of his theatre on a Sunday night 'just
because they wanted to see the show, not because they wanted to be seen.'

AFTER THE Controllers came the Director-General, though in Radio 4's Sunday
afternoon debate Airing the Future he had only a brief innings at the end of
things, his rival debaters being senior executives from both the BBC and
independent outfits, with some members of the public. He must have heard
much that he would not agree with.
He repeated what we should know: that the Corporation seeks the best talent,
does not seek imitative work, is ready to adapt to changes in society; and
he turned down a proposal made earlier by Joan Bakewell that the licence
should be charged at 'a fair rate' of Pounds 140. The 24-hour rolling news
was described by foreign correspondent Charles Wheeler as 'the worst idea
yet'; Sir Robin Day, very cross, said it was one of the few good ideas the
BBC had had. The DG did not deal with it.
Radio 4's Saturday night Classic Serials move from next week to Sunday
afternoons (another good idea). Last Saturday we had Gun before Butter
instead, about Inspector Van der Valk, more familiar on television, here
played by Ian Hogg. It consisted mostly of a soliloquy by Lucienne (Sophie
Thompson), whom Van der Valk reckoned to have killed her lover Stam (Roger
Hume); there was little detection, just adventure and romance. Nicolas
Freeling's novel was adapted by Philip Martin, who also directed.
Radio 3's Sunday play was another Stoppard adaptation from Schnitzler,
Liebelei, now Dalliance. This too deals with honour among prosperous
Austrians, but introduces a Schnitzler special, the guileless working girl.
Fritz (Douglas Hodge) is dallying with Christine (Rachel Joyce), but more
seriously, offstage, with a married lady of his own class, whose husband
challenges him. The emotional acme of the plot comes when Fritz's friend
Theodore calls on Christine to explain that Fritz has been killed in an
'accident'. The plot is trivial, but the comprehension of the characters
makes it deeply moving, and the playing under Jeremy Howe was first-class,
with Hugh Grant as Theodore and Hetty Baynes as Mizi, Christine's friend.
Nick Ward's Red Sky at Night (Radio 4, Monday) was a kind of adaptation too,
though Ward (who also directed) says it was 'inspired' by DH Lawrence. (It
was introduced by a reading of Lawrence's essay Hymns in a Child's Life).
The tale tells how Alfred (Paul Copley) quarrelled with his wife Katherine
(Julia Ford) because he spent their money on booze, then was killed in a pit
accident. The direction called up most pictorially the mining world of
Eastwood, where Lawrence came from.
The difference between poverty in Lawrence's day and our own was seen on
Thursday in Octopus Boys, the first of Radio 5's series, The Collection.
Lawrence would hardly understand it. What are these Giros? What is the YTS?
Why are all these young people 'in care', whatever that means? How come they
have flats on the council?
Well, it is not strange to us, and writer Judith Johnson has caught it
adroitly. Mickey (Neil Anthony), 17, on the run from a hostel, lives off
Sharon and Kelley, who live off the dole; but what he wants is work on the
Octopus ride at a fair. At the fair, he and Sharon (Sunetra Sarker) find
Pounds 2000 of the Octopus management's money, and steal it. 'We could go to
Barbados,' Sharon proposes. But the boys from the Octopus catch up with
them. No happy end: how could there be? The vigorous production is by Martin
Jameson.
Radio 1's refreshing social concern was reflected in Saturday's Pink Pop,
where the involvement of gay people in pop music was displayed in song and
story. Presented by Laurie Pike, this was not one of their great
investigative numbers, but honest, interesting, fair and fun. No 'helpline'
attached to this one.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Arts: Faith in Frisell - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTEMPORARY jazz has split into two distinct camps (leaving aside fusion,
trad and similar afflictions for the moment). In the one, young musicians
like the Marsalis clan, trumpeter Roy Hargrove, and even aggressive
saxophonist Steve Coleman all continue a jazz tradition that calls for
standards, or their own nervy compositions that could pass for standards, to
be interpreted in the conventional bop idiom.
In the other camp, lying more languidly, are chamber groups led by people
like saxophonists John Surman, Jan Garbarek, or drummer Paul Motian, who
have wider terms of reference. They take the essence of folk tunes, pop
songs - and sacred standards - and perform on them a musical chromatography.
Guitarist Bill Frisell belongs to this group and is more often heard gently
dissecting the likes of Bill Evans alongside Paul Motian. In his own latest
collection of covers, where Dylan collides with Madonna, Ives with Sousa, he
has taken deconstruction toward its limit, however. So hard to swallow are
some of the selections that purchasers of the new album, Have a Little Faith
(Elektra Nonesuch 7559-79301), are well advised by its title and need to
persevere.
Set in a quartet consisting of Kermit Driscoll (electric bass), Joey Baron
(drums) and Don Byron (clarinets) for this UK tour, Frisell's trademark
notes, bent by an assortment of pedals, work hard at suppressing the message
of familiar tunes. He releases component parts of a melody tortuously,
creating a tension which is then relieved by a slashing power chord and more
snatches of the familiar. I never imagined I would be glad to hear Madonna's
'Live To Tell' coming through the ether of improvisation.
Vague and fogeyish, Frisell treads this precarious line determinedly, the
rhythm section clattering about pleasantly behind and dreadlocked Don Byron
squeezing in only occasionally with leaping clarinets. Opening at the QEH
with Aaron Copland's Billy the Kid suite, he moved jauntily through the
Americana of Muddy Waters, Dylan and Charles Ives, the dislocated
arrangements and earnest knob twiddling giving alternately comic and
poignant meaning to 'classics'. The resulting abstraction is as fresh and
intelligent as that of his peers in the other camp - but is it still jazz?
Tour continues to Dartington, Cambridge, Southampton, Leeds, Birmingham
andSheffield. Sponsors: Arts Council Contemporary Music Network

FT  23 JAN 93 / Arts: Benefits for the adventurous - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COULD IT happen at last? Is the Arts Council about to raise its chopper and
axe the grants of some of the 150 clients that still look to it for
sustenance?
It is one of the vagaries of arts funding in the UK that, despite frequent
huffing and puffing and the occasional minor sacrificial victim, once you
are in with the Arts Council your organisation is supported for life. The
Regional Boards are more vicious, especially to community projects, but the
leading theatre companies, dance troupes, art galleries and orchestras never
suffer more than the occasional frozen grant from the Council.
But, by a nice irony, the platitudinous strategy document finally produced
this week, A Creative Future, is to form the basis of - guess what - a
radical strategy. Within three months the Council will decide its funding
priorities on the basis of the guidelines mapped out in this document. It
promises to go for quality rather than quantity, and to scythe off not just
individual client companies but whole areas of funding, while lavishing more
resources on key objectives.
This will not mean the end of literature, touring opera, or regional
theatre. But it could mean a system which rewards creativity, educational
work, access - all the new buzzwords - and hits hard at the routine
potboilers. Basically, the controversial decision of the Eastern Orchestral
Board to fix its grants to concert promoters in line with the popularity of
the composers programmed - a Pounds 450 grant if you put on Tchaikovsky,
Pounds 1,000 for Mahler, building up to Pounds 2,000 for Harrison Birtwistle
 -will become the national template.
So, in theory, if the Royal Opera House, facing a growing deficit, plans
more performances of Tosca, Carmen and Boheme in its 1993-94 season, it can
anticipate a reduced grant. But since the Council thinks that Covent Garden
is at last getting its act together, this is unlikely to happen. More likely
victims are the orchestras and regional theatre companies which play safe
with a diet of Beethoven and Ayckbourn.
What has happened spasmodically in the past - as in the reduction of the
Council's grant to the RPO because it favoured programmes of popular
classics which attracted big audiences - will become the norm. Arts groups
with an impressive youth programme, or which commission new dance works, or
tour round village halls, can expect more.
The Council has the advantage of a lower grant for 1994-95, down Pounds 5m
to Pounds 220m,which can justify some pruning. Nothing has yet been settled,
but the likely blueprint is more for living artists, less for dead masters.
In May some unadventurous regional theatre companies or dance troupes might
lose all their subsidy.
That is until the specialist panels, the vested interests and the local
lobbyists start kicking up a rumpus and the Council backs down. There is
also the chance that the Heritage Minister, Peter Brooke, who is being
lobbied by his good friend, the Arts Council chairman Lord Palumbo to
rescind the Pounds 5m cut, will deliver more cash for 1994-95. The eventual
bloodletting is likely to disappoint Dracula.
The auction houses see no early end to the recession and are drastically
reducing staff. Christie's did it in one foul swoop before Christmas;
Sotheby's favours the gradual approach. Another 15 went in London this week.
There is a sad case of shooting the messenger because the main casualty is
Fiona Ford, a Sotheby's loyalist for 25 years, who resigned as head of the
press office when her department was shorn of two staff. Casualties have
been among support workers, but departures from the top echelons are
expected. WITH Art 93 at the Business Design Centre in Islington (until
Sunday), London at last has a contemporary art fair which can stand
comparison with those in Chicago, Basle, Frankfurt and Madrid. It is also
more populist than in the past, with decorative prints priced around Pounds
250 alongside grittier abstract sculptures costing Pounds 100,000 plus.
In a recession dealers take few chances, and anyone put off contemporary art
by the lumpen choices for the Turner Prize can have their enthusiasm
re-fired. The first buyer was dealer Leslie Waddington, who snapped up an
Anthony Caro sculpture from Anneley Juda and a David Mach sculpture from
William Jackson. He got a small discount - but, these days, so can you.
Also active was Unilever, which is showing its corporate collection on the
upper gallery and adding to it all the time, buying a Martin Kane painting
from Jill George for Pounds 4,000 and six works by Royal College of Art
student Nicholas Morris for a total of around Pounds 1,200 from the
Contemporary Art Society's Mini-market, where works start at Pounds 100.
But perhaps the most eye catching exhibit is Michael Roosen's stand, which
displays 48 portraits by Zsuzsi Roboz of leading contemporary artists,
including Hockney, Rego, Frink and Bacon. He insists on selling the
collection intact, for around Pounds 160,000.
With the IRA making a pre-Christmas visit to the theatre too much of a drama
for some last month, attendances in the West End in 1992 are likely to
match, rather than overhaul, the 10.9m set the previous year. This is still
some achievement, given the recession and the fact that 1991 produced the
second best total on record.
But there are causes for alarm. After a good first half 1992 got
progressively stickier and more seats than ever were sold at a discount.
There are signs that private angels are less keen to regularly lose money
backing plays and that producers are having to dip into their own bank
balances to put them on.
But theatre owners, instead of being only interested in rent, are now
considering themselves part of the play. The most striking commitment was by
Maybox, owner of seven West End theatres, which agreed to cover the
production costs of Sam Mendes' ambitious season at the revamped Donmar
Warehouse which, because of its small size, can never be commercially
viable. The success of his first production, Assassins, helped secure the
Donmar Pounds 100,000 and a year's sponsorship from Carlton TV, which
relieves Maybox of its burden.

ANTHROPOLOGY AND PHOTOGRAPHY 1860-1920
edited by Elizabeth Edwards
Yale Pounds 19.95, 275 pages
W EUGENE SMITH AND THE PHOTOGRAPHIC ESSAY
by Glenn G Willumson
Cambridge Pounds 55, 351 pages
CAN YOU trust a photograph? Do you believe that the camera never lies? Or is
a photograph the most dangerous medium of all, apparently a straightforward
image but one in fact selected and determined by the photographer's frame of
cultural reference, and, as it is reproduced, consciously or unconsciously
encouraging a social or ideological stance? Two exceptional new books on the
history of photography address this question from different, but equally
fascinating, backgrounds. Anthropology and Photography traces the creation
and use of photographs in early British anthropology, and is worth buying
purely for its abundant 19th century photographs of Fijian cannibals,
Hiawatha-style chiefs, Congo dancers and the rest.
But its point is our changing evaluation of these photographs, which at the
time were seen as objective documentation of inferior, exotic races but now
demonstrate the prejudice and cultural conditioning of the age. So a
soft-focus Samoan woman from the 1890s, her naked breasts garlanded with
flowers, is a classic western male erotic fantasy not worlds away from Sarah
Bernhardt on stage. South Sea Islands youths with limed blond hair and huge
earrings are captioned 'dandies'. Saddest are six Batwa pygmies, kidnapped
in central Africa, exhibited 'live' at the Hippodrome with 17 polar bears
and some Scottish dancers, and so famous that they were invited to the House
of Commons. The photograph of them dressed in children's sailor suits taking
tea on the terrace with MPs is a giveaway of the 1900s anthropological
belief that 'primitives' were in the 'childhood of mankind' stage. 'What did
they think of the greatest Legislature in the world? What dim conception did
they form of its purpose and work?' asked the photographer Benjamin Stone.
It is through such anecdotes, or case studies, that this book builds up a
cumulative picture of the worldview that made colonial domination possible.
In the Andaman Islands, an officer fascinated by 'junglees' ('wayward but
attractive children') took stereotyped photos like 'Andamanese Shooting,
Dancing, Sleeping and Greeting'. They were sent home doctored - for example
bunches of grass were scratched on to the plate of a naked chief and his
wife, both smoking pipes. Symbolic emasculation, but the photos helped the
army learn more about the Andamanese, and its policy of subjugation worked:
a final photo shows a dance celebrating Edward Vll as Emperor of India.
The interpretation of photographs in this book also tells anthropology's own
story, from its start as an unreflective, patronising study of 'primitive'
people to a self-conscious discipline examining meaning in any society.
Several decades on, W Eugene Smith and the Photographic Essay is an account
of the camera as political and social advocate, seen through the work of
Life magazine's most famous photographer. Eugene Smith took shots for the
human interest photo-essays that made Life a mass circulation, high-quality
magazine. But he was also an absolutist and a driven man, formed by the
Depression, when his bankrupt father killed himself, and by the moralism of
his Catholic convert mother.
As a war photographer, he switched from warmonger (he wrote home about a
knife 'good for Japs, underbrush or steak') to pacifist whose photos were so
unrelenting about the human cost of war that the Pentagon censored them. At
Life, as photo-essays like 'Country Doctor' and 'Spanish Village' show, he
had a mission precisely of his time: to portray and improve life for the
ordinary poor through a new type of intimate, immediate picture which showed
everyday peopke working, eating, getting ill, giving birth.
But did he really photograph Everyman? With carethis book examines the
genesis of specific photo-essays, from choice of topic through research to
the selection of strongly interpretative images from a 2,000-negative
contact sheet. The result was benign propaganda, finding the 'perfect'
American example: the young and photogenic country doctor, his stoop, look,
gesture implying exactly the mix of hard work, poverty, committed
satisfaction; the Main Street, Anytown, setting which must also be
picturesque (Kremmling beneath the Rocky Mountains was chosen). For Smith,
the triumph was to portray a secular saint; for Life, to tell a human story
with a topical health care angle; for 'Amerika', Life's Russian translation,
to advertise, by cropping and centering and magnifying, the great American
dream.
Gradually Smith's political mission clashed with Life's - in 'Spanish
Village' he wanted to stop US aid for Franco - and he resigned, had
breakdowns, died at 59 with Dollars 18 in the bank. But anyone interested in
the social outlook that saw the rise and fall of 'Everyman' magazines like
Life and Picture Post, and in the history of photographic journalism and how
newspapers manipulate material, will enjoy this account of his life and
work.
As Smith realised, the visual image is becoming our dominant mode of
communication. But one reason it is so powerful is that most of us don't
have the visual grammar to respond to it in the sophisticated way with which
we dissect and interpret words. Both these elegant volumes are compelling
and topical attempts to change that.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Arts: Why short is beautiful - Clement Crisp states his case
for the triple bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BALLETIC triple bills have not been popular with audiences for 20 years and
more. The tradition has grown up among Western ballet-goers - and it is one
entirely owed to the Royal Ballet's example in performing 19th century
classics, and then finding in Ashton, Cranko, MacMillan, Bintley,
choreographers able to extend the full-evening creation - that a 'real'
evening at the ballet means a long dramatic work, involving all the
resources of a company.
This nonsensical view has been accepted by ballet companies world-wide,
driven by the box-office imperative. Major troupes trot out variously
tiresome versions of the old war-horses, buy in evening-long works from
other companies, and the public flocks. Smaller ensembles sell titles rather
than ballets to their audience, and with little conscience offer shrunken
and shoddy productions under familiar names. (I report, with unwavering
gaze, that there is a version of Nutcracker currently on view in Europe
which also involves elements from A Christmas Carol).
The triple bill, which once offered a range of balletic experience, a
variety of dancing, a choice of choreography, a happy display of dancers'
artistry in varied roles, flourishes only with New York City Ballet, where
Balanchine's genius was expended in making a treasury of short pieces that
remain the supreme example of classical ballet in our century. Elsewhere,
box-office receipts will tell a tale of failing attendance for evenings
comprising three contrasting works, no matter how great their merits.
Prohibitive seat-prices mean that audiences will go for what they think are
the big, safe, cast-iron productions. If it's swans, it must be good, is
their motto. And, as these columns never tire of saying, the reverse is
true.
The Royal Ballet has, with a bravery every ballet-goer must commend, made a
serious effort in recent years to wean its public off swans and Veronese
lovers through intelligent (usually]) triple bills. Much of the history and
artistic achievement of ballet in our century is to be found in such works.
The current Covent Garden programme of Apollo, Judas Tree, Symphony in C is
a fine one - it will be on view twice next week - and it is in the main very
well danced. (I record that, after the fashion of the one-time Nureyev
circuses, advertisements announce that 'Irek Mukhamedov will dance at every
performance').
Certainly Mukhamedov's presence - in either Apollo or Judas Tree - is reason
enough to go. Both ballets gain in significance from his artistry. On
Thursday, he was replaced as the Foreman in Judas Tree by Zoltan Solymosi.
Solymosi's interpretation lacks the fervour that drives Mukhemedov's reading
 -it misses, as yet, something in emotional and dynamic ferocity - but it is
a worthy account of the role. The revelation of the performance was Leanne
Benjamin's appearance as the woman, a characterisation of extraordinary
sexual and technical pungency. Each pose and provocative movement, the
shifts between belligerent sluttishness and invulnerable dignity, were
superbly understood and stated: the ballet seemed to be about the woman as
victim - and ultimate victor - rather than about betrayal. It was a
beautiful and piercingly credible impersonation.
Mukhamedov's view of Balanchine's Apollo at this performance was one which
saw the role in a single span, and gave it emotional and physical momentum
from first moment to last. He exposed the dramatic substructure of the
choreography. He showed us the reason for every action by the young god, and
without communicative fuss - nothing over-emphatic - he provided an armature
for the dance action.
It was a reading more powerful, more dense, than any I have seen before. It
would look out of place in New York City Ballet performance today, but this
Royal staging does not aim for the speed or the purged clarity that is now
the NYCB style in the piece. We are shown Apollo as drama rather than rite:
and the choreography is rich and resonant enough to sustain both
interpretations. As Terpsichore, Viviana Durante made an elegant, pure-toned
debut.
About Symphony in C, most radiant of ballets, I am less happy in these
current performances. Girls are being sent out to do women's jobs -
ballerinas are in short supply at Covent Garden - and to do Balanchine
justice, we must see diamond clarity and unforced grandeur. It is,
nonetheless, a work of cumulative joys, and it ends an admirable triple bill
on the happiest of notes.
This triple bill is given final performances at Covent Garden on January 27
and 28.

CHINESE ROUNDABOUT: ESSAYS IN HISTORY AND CULTURE
by Jonathan D. Spence
WW Norton &amp; Co, Pounds 15.95, 400 pages
WHEN Montesquieu declared 'I believe that we will never completely
understand the Chinese', over a century had passed since the first sustained
western contacts with China. The admiration of the early visitors had been
tempered by disillusion, but misunderstanding persisted. Despite the
subsequent growth of Chinese studies and increased contact, misperceptions
remain today.
This '400 year old history of confusion' is one of Jonathan Spence's
favourite themes. In the first section of this collection of essays he
discusses people who managed to penetrate the confusion - notably Sidney
Gamble, a 20th-century sinologist and photographer - and others who, despite
their efforts, were part of it: Montesquieu's Chinese acquaintance in Paris,
Arcadio Huang; the Jesuit scholar and confidant of the Chinese emperor,
Matteo Ricci; the 16th century Portuguese traveller, Mendes Pinto; and Andre
Malraux and his literary contemporaries.
These are delightful and subtle portraits. Like Gamble's photographs, they
catch 'the evanescent moment in which a particular face, a gesture, a
juxtaposition of elements, comes to be more than itself and to speak for a
whole time and culture.'
Spence rejoices in details - the size of Arcadio Huang's conjugal bed, for
example - and unexpected explanations. Grammar, he suggests, was the cause
of Ricci's initial happiness in China. On leaving India Ricci no longer had
to teach Greek, a highly inflected language, and found the study of Chinese,
which has 'no articles, no cases, no number, no gender, no tense, no mood',
much more enjoyable.
But what distinguishes Spence is not his recognition of the complexity of
Chinese culture, for others have accepted this. Rather it lies in his
refusal to be baffled by China, having accepted that complexity is not a bar
to understanding. These self-selected essays manifest his determination 'to
think about China with precision . . . and to be fair and thorough.'
Confrontation with a new culture is a disorientating experience. The first
few hundred years of Buddhism in China were marked by an attempt to ease
understanding of the new religion by linking its ideas and practices with
Daoism, an indigenous Chinese tradition. A similar process took place in the
early years of Christianity in China, shown in Ricci's Buddhist robes and
his retelling of Bible stories for Chinese consumption.
But later Buddhists and Christians realised that, in stressing the
similarities with native systems, differences were often forgotten and an
accurate understanding of the new religion was not possible. The cliches
which abound in western literature on China are a result of trying to
explain China in Western terms. Spence challenges the cliches and presents a
more sophisticated view in which differences are not distorted or glossed
over. Speaking of the values expressed by an elderly Chinese philosopher he
writes, 'we may not accept or approve of them, but it is hard to deny that
there was something truly worth saying at the centre of his being.'
Although the essays are grouped thematically rather than chronologically,
those in the first section, on cross-cultural interaction, and the fourth,
on post-1949 China, contain Spence's most recent and most confident work.
While the portraits are enthusiastic, the tributes to his various teachers
express respect and admiration for people who also refused to be baffled.
The only piece in the other sections which rivals these in depth of feeling
is 'Tiananmen', written after the events of June 4, 1989.
The remaining sections contain a miscellany of lectures and book reviews.
They cover subjects as diverse as the cost of an imperial dinner, the
19th-century debate on whether to prohibit or legalise opium, and the
importance of tradition in 20th-century political debates, displaying
Spence's self-admitted and welcome 'hare-brained eclecticism' although
lacking the sparkle of the rest.
In his essays Spence, like the 16th century Dominican friar Gaspar da Cruz,
has sought 'those elusive elements that would give the complete picture of
China'. Many others have done the same over the past four centuries. Spence,
however, remains one of the few to realise the impossibility of the task.

JANACEK'S OPERAS: A DOCUMENTARY ACCOUNT
by John Tyrrell
Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 25, 405 pages
JUST AS recognition in his own country came late to Janacek, so his
reputation was slow to spread more widely. Outside Czechoslovakia his growth
to popularity has been a post-Second World War phenomenon; that of the
Janacek literature has been even more recent. Through his writings over the
last 25 years John Tyrrell has established himself as a leading scholar in
this and the wider field of Czech opera; this book, based on his work in the
Janacek archive at Brno, draws together a wealth of documents relating to
the genesis, publication and early performances of Janacek operas.
Janacek, one of this century's greatest musical dramatists, endured many
setbacks and suffered particular humiliation at the hands of unsympathetic
theatre directors. His long struggles run through the book like a leitmotif,
making reading that is at once illuminating and depressing.
Since the composition of Jenufa took him the best part of ten years, and was
overshadowed by the death of his daughter Olga, its rejection in 1904 by the
National Theatre in Prague proved a severe blow. It was only in 1916, after
the first Prague performance finally took place, that the 61-year-old
composer was able to write, 'I am beginning to believe in my life and my
mission'; in 1904 his sole response had been to 'deaden the pain with work'
 -but, as he added, 'I've got problems with a libretto'.
That work was Osud ('Fate'), and while the libretto did indeed prove
problematic (Janacek made up the scenario as he progressed, and to this day
it verges on the incomprehensible), its complications were overshadowed by
the difficulties he incurred writing The Excursions of Mr Broucek. At least
his troubles with publishers here were his last. After Broucek, the composer
produced his librettos virtually single-handedly, and the remaining four
operas flowed more freely (his last, From the House of the Dead, was written
in under 11 months).
But it would be simplistic to link this too closely to the great flowering
that characterised Janacek's final phase: there was also his growing love
for Kamila Stosslova, which, though unrequited, gave him added creative
impulse.
Perhaps most interesting is the background to Janacek's seldom-heard early
operas Sarka and The Beginning of a Romance. The first took a libretto by
the Czech symbolist poet Julius Zeyer which both Dvorak and Smetana had
turned down. Janacek based the second on a short story by Gabriela
Preissova, whose The Stepdaughter he later made into Jenufa.
As the title of the book suggests, this is a collection of sources which
relate to the nine extant operas. One longs for more - Janacek's thoughts on
the genre, or on the operas of other composers, would be fascinating, though
some of these would admittedly lie outside the scope of the book. It is a
pity that little account is given of his projected operas. Though the
evidence for some of these may be slight, musical sketches for at least four
incomplete stage works exist: The Housewife was to have been based on
another of Preissova's texts, and two others, Anna Karenina and The Living
Corpse, two Tolstoy projects, evince the deep sympathy for Russian subjects
reflected elsewhere in his oeuvre.
In general, though, Tyrrell has marshalled his material splendidly, to make
it both scholarly and readable. His sources are meticulously listed in an
appendix, leaving the text arranged and linked as a flowing documentary
narrative. Containing as it does much material that has not appeared in
English before (and some, indeed, that has not been published anywhere),
this is a major addition to the Janacek bibliography.

THEORY OF WAR
by Joan Brady Andre
Deutsch Pounds 14.99, 208 pages
THE ORIENT-EXPRESS
by Gregor von Rezzori
Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 13.99, 208 pages
COSMO COSMOLINO
by Helen Garner
Bloomsbury Pounds 13.99, 221 pages
THE AMERICAN civil war may have ended in the official abolition of black
slavery, but its chaotic aftermath also produced a new generation of human
chattels: unwanted white children who were sold to the highest bidder for as
little as Dollars 15. One of these 'bounden boys' was Joan Brady's
grandfather. And in Theory of War, a fictionalised account of his life and
her journey into the past, she explores the psychological legacy of slavery.
At four, Jonathan Carrick is bought by Alvah, a sadistic tobacco farmer, and
his dehumanised mate, Wify. He is beaten, tied up, and starved. They remove
his teeth to sell them for dentures. But the main focus of Jonathan's
inarticulate anger is not the brutish Alvah but his ambitious son George,
who actively provokes the bounden boy's envy, setting in motion a lifetime's
rivalry and resentment.
At 15, Jonathan runs away. He eventually finds an education, a wife and a
faithless vocation as a preacher. But he cannot escape his hatred for
George, by now a successful politician. After half a century of separation,
they are reunited in a final, fatal confrontation.
Joan Brady's novel is in part an act of personal catharsis - an attempt to
exorcise the emotional scars transmitted down the generations. But it also
universalises the individual's story into a symbolic parable of human
cruelty and its effects. If the novelist's artistry sometimes gets in the
way of the raw experiences she describes, Theory of War still achieves a
genuine tragic weightiness.
Gregor von Rezzori's The Orient-Express is another novel about reclaiming
the past. Its unnamed narrator, born into the pre-war cultural elite of
central Europe, has been an American capitalist since the 1940s. At 65,
afflicted by a delayed bout of adolescent angst, he decides to revisit the
scenes of his real adolescence and take a trip on the newly refurbished
Orient-Express.
In what follows, the external journey is soon subordinated to an interior
monologue which unfolds like a slow motion dream sequence. Fragments of
memory appear and dissolve - and it is up to the reader to piece together
the facts of the narrator's life.
We see the fussy Armenian aunts of his childhood; his first sexual
experience on a train with a woman in a silver turban; his student
obsession, fed by an overdose of Nietzsche, with suicide. Central to his
present ennui is an inability to forge emotional relationships with women.
His thoughts return again and again to his alienated marriage and to his
empty encounters with prostitutes.
Cultural schizophrenic and nostalgia victim, von Rezzori's narrator is
suffering from serious depression. At times his sanity seems under pressure.
But though his states of mind are minutely recorded, he is too introverted
to invite empathy.
After all this relentless introspection, Helen Garner's ability to present
characters actually relating to one another is something of a relief. Her
world is low-key and domestic. But Cosmo Cosmolino - which contains two
short stories in addition to the title novella - is wry, individual and
stylistically mature.
Garner's characters were young in the 1970s, caught up in the fashionable
utopianism of the time. But the communes have long since dispersed, and,
looking back, you have to decide whether the intervening years represent a
growing up or a loss of innocence.
The two short stories deal with death. In Recording Angel, a man contracts a
brain tumour and we witness the effects on his wife and best friend. In A
Vigil, a virtual suicide is followed by a hellish crematorium scene. But
Cosmo Cosmolino itself is a story of rebirth, in which Janet's buried
existence is given a jolt by the arrival of two lodgers, aimless Raymond and
Maxine with her batty New Age ecstasies.
Garner has an impressive ability to infect imaginative life into mundane
objects, and to focus on an individual character or situation without
generalising. Her choice of words is always eloquently precise. And it is
the honesty of her prose style, rather than any particular gift for
storytelling, which stands out.

E E CUMMINGS: COMPLETE POEMS 1904-1962
edited by George J Firmage
Liveright &amp; W W Norton Pounds 33, 1,102 pages
IN THE 60 years between 1870 and 1930 there emerged a remarkable number of
poets in the US. About one, TS Eliot, there can be no doubt as to his
international reputation. Ezra Pound's significance, too, is without
question despite his less appealing persona. Robert Frost's poetry was
received with acclaim in Britain long before he was recognised in his own
country.
But there were others, less well understood outside the US, who are also of
considerable importance. Wallace Stevens and William Carlos Williams are of
this number. Then there were Edwin Arlington Robinson, Carl Sandburg,
Robinson Jeffers, Marianne Moore, John Crowe Ransom and Hart Crane. Of this
latter group the most provocative was the son of a New England
Congregational minister. His name was Edward Estlin Cummings and he was born
in 1894 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Cummings had been publishing poems since his early 20s but he did not become
widely known until the appearance of his prose work The Enormous Room. This
savage attack on authority was the result of being imprisoned by the French
in the First World War for something he wrote in his letters while he was
serving as a member of the Norton Harjes Ambulance Unit.
The Enormous Room sent readers back to Cummings's first book, Tulips and
Chimneys, published in 1923. Some of the 'Songs' in Tulips, like 'all in
green went my love riding', have a fin de siecle flavour, but 'Chimneys'
contains such now-well-known language experiments as 'In Just-/spring' and
'Buffalo Bill's/defunct'. There are also attacks on 'Cambridge ladies who
live in furnished souls' and who would not find at all acceptable such poems
as ''kitty', sixteen, 5'1, white, prostitute' and the sardonic 'Humanity i
love you'.
If in the early poems there was a too obvious desire to epater les bourgeois
it was evident by the 1930s that Cummings had something more serious on his
mind. In ViVa and No Thanks we see him pushing forward the boundaries of
communication, attempting to use words as he did paint on canvas - as in the
notorious grasshopper poem ('r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r').
In New Poems and 50 Poems Cummings abandoned such extreme modernist
experiments and developed a new and more intimate form of lyricism seen at
its best in 'this little bride &amp; groom' and the powerful and moving 'my
father moved through dooms of love'.
One of the most striking things about him is his defiant individuality in an
age of conformity - his readiness to attack what he saw to be the ills of
society ('a salesman is an it that stinks Excuse', 'a politician is an arse
upon/which everyone has sat except a man'). In Cummings's introduction to
the Collected Poems of 1938 he said 'The poems to come are for you and for
me and are not for mostpeople'. But to be uncivilly disobedient like a
bohemian Thoreau is one thing. What about the calibre of Cumming's verse?
RP Blackmur counted 'flower' 48 times in Tulips and Chimneys, concluding
tartly that for Cummings the word must contain 'an almost unlimited variety
and extent of meaning'. Any attempt to evaluate Cummings's contribution to
poetry must therefore take into account the fact that he does not always
exploit the fullest resources of the English language. Like Henry Miller in
prose he was outre, shocking - sticking out his tongue at what HL Mencken
called the 'booboisie'. On the other hand it cannot be denied that life
leaps from his best poems.
Cummings is least successful when he is being self-consciously hard-boiled,
as in 'Poem, or Beauty Hurts Mr Vinal' or 'she being Brand/-new'. He is far
better in his ironic comments on war like 'my sweet old etcetera' and 'plato
told/him' and in his ability to catch the flavour of low-life speech, as in
'ygUDuh'. But he is best of all in such tender and unsentimental lyrics as
'the little horse is newlY/Born'. Simplicity has its virtues and although
Cummings's poems might seem a little contrived today, there is a freshness
about them which makes the reader return again and again with a sense of
delight.
George J. Firmage has revised, corrected and expanded the Complete Poems of
1973 using the original manuscripts and getting the typography right. He has
also added poems from Cummings's Harvard years and from the Dial Papers, and
his translations of Horace. It is all here, and although one cannot say with
one's hand on one's heart that it adds a great deal to our perception of
Cummings's quality as a poet, it certainly does not detract from it.

SHADOWS OF FORGOTTEN ANCESTORS
by Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan Random
Century Pounds 17.99, 505 pages
NEITHER the New Ageist title nor the mawkish cover illustration does this
book justice. Within, it is a feast. Absorbing and elegantly written, it
tells of the origins of life on earth, describes its variety and character,
and culminates in a discussion of human nature and the complex traces of
humankind's evolutionary past - hence the 'shadows' of the title. This is
fascinating science gracefully purveyed. The exposition is leisurely,
literate and wry, sometimes self-indulgent but always pleasingly so. It is
an amazing story masterfully told - easily the best popular introduction to
ethology and evolutionary biology now available.
The story begins at the beginning: with the turbulent mass of dust and gas
which spawned the sun and its planets, and prompted the frightening early
history of earth. Thereafter the tale unfolds more circumstantially. Its
proper commencement lies with the stromatolites, single-celled organisms
living in colonies, whose fossils date back three and a half billion years.
From these most ancient of creatures life's perilous history stems.
To recount that history Sagan and Druyan have to explain genetics and
evolutionary theory. They do it with exemplary lucidity. Thus armed, they
give dazzling accounts of insects, snakes, apes, humans, and much besides,
aiming to give us a sense of humanity's place in the evolutionary scheme by
exhibiting the enormous variety and curiosity of life and the connections
which unify its story. 'We achieve some measure of adulthood', the authors
write, 'when we recognise our parents as they really were, without
sentimentalising or mythologising, but also without blaming them unfairly
for our imperfections.' When with similar dispassion we understand something
of our evolutionary inheritance - our biological parentage - we come of age
as a species.
Every page yields nuggets. The kind of lesson to be learned from biological
understanding is well illustrated by the following juxtaposition of facts.
Humans find it convenient to geld male domestic animals. 'One or two skilled
motions of the blade - or a deft bite by a reindeer-herding Lapp woman - and
the testosterone levels are down to manageable proportions', the authors
remark. Only a few males are left intact for breeding purposes. In the wild,
when one male is defeated by another in a mating contest - and this applies
to creatures as different as snakes and apes - the conquered male's
testosterone levels decline steeply and he slinks away. One major effect, as
with domestic animals, is that trouble is kept within bounds.
Parallels must be treated cautiously. Humans and chimpanzees share 99.6 per
cent of their active genes, inherited from a common ancestor. By any
standards this is close kinship. But the differences - outstandingly,
language and what language makes possible - are more obvious than the
similarities. Still, as the authors show in four fascinating chapters on
monkeys and apes, both the parallels and differences are highly instructive.
One female chimp, taught to sort pictures of humans and non-humans into
different categories, placed pictures of chimps in the 'human' file.
The authors venture some controversial sallies. Sagan is famous for arguing
that there must be life elsewhere in the universe. Here he and Druyan make
an analogous suggestion: that consciousness might be a more pervasive
feature of terrestrial life than most thinkers allow. Even insects, they
muse, could have a measure of awareness beyond the merely reflexive. The
naturalist Jakob von Uexkull wrote, 'When the dog runs, the dog moves its
legs. When the sea urchin runs, the legs move the sea urchin.'
But Sagan and Druyan are not so sure. After describing the astounding
engineering skills of the spider, they remark, 'she spins her web now. She
reaps the reward later, perhaps much later. Does she know what she's waiting
for? Does she dream of succulent moths and foolish mayflies? Or does she
wait with her mind a blank?' Such innocuous-seeming questions prompt others
that are among philosophy's deepest.
Analogy presents the authors with their most dangerous temptation. Parallels
between animal and human characteristics can enlighten remarkably, but also
mislead. Yet although they sometimes tread close to the edge, Sagan and
Druyan are alert to the risks, and indeed end the book by warning against
them. One is left with a strong sense that what underlies their remarkably
skilful and accessible account is high scientific competence. It is this
which makes their book so good.

AT THE HEART OF A TIGER: CLEMENCEAU AND HIS WORLD 1841-1929
by Gregor Dallas
Macmillan Pounds 25, 598 pages
DEATH, says a French proverb, turns a life into a destiny, imposing
definition on a stretch of time which might, at earlier stages, have looked
amorphous. With some public figures, however, it is not death itself but a
late break, a sudden call to arms or power in old age, that gives a long and
varied life its permanent shape. So with Georges Clemenceau.
Born in 1841 under France's last king, he was raised as a disciple of
Pascal, Michelet and Comte; he became mayor of Montmartre during the
Franco-Prussian War and the Commune. A 'man of Victor Hugo', he subsequently
kept the flame of moderate Republicanism going through the vicissitudes of
the Second Empire and the chequered Republic that followed it, battling with
the likes of Boulanger on the one hand and Ferry and Jaures on the other and
raising an early and decent voice in favour of Dreyfus.
More than once during these decades his career seemed to himself and others
all but over - 'I am unrecognised in my home, betrayed by my friends,
dropped by my party, ignored by my electors, suspected by my country . . .
creditors bang on my door . . . I have nothing, nothing.'
He was almost 73 at the outbreak of the 1914-18 war, and 76 by the time
supreme command passed to him. Poincare, a long-term jealous colleague and
now demoted rival, added to his existing accusations of obstinacy,
swashbuckle and 'incurable light-mindedness' the charge that Clemenceau was
increasingly deaf, portly and incapable of reasoning.
Yet it was in Clemenceau's grey-gloved hands (he had begun to suffer from
nervous eczema) that near-defeat was turned into victory and the peace that
many of the French would have sought earlier on almost any terms became an
Armistice imposed by France and her allies. The old man had at last become
the 'tiger' - as in the lean title of this overweight work. The sharpest
image left to the world is of the hunched, moustachioed carnivore crouched
between Lloyd George and Woodrow Wilson in the treaty hall at Versailles,
standing as ever for justice, unwittingly doing his bit to set the scene for
another war in which he would act as a model for another
fighter-come-late-to-greatness: Winston Churchill.
Of course this odd-shaped life poses problems for the biographer. Gregor
Dallas has had to accompany his subject a long way before finally reaching,
if not the heart of the tiger, at any rate the heart of the story. At times
he loses himself in whole thickets of carefully scrutinised trees while
giving his reader little indication of the overall shape of the wood.
When at long last he sweeps out onto the devastated uplands of the First
World War battlefields, the panoramic view is impressive. But, just because
he knows the way himself, he fails to erect adequate signposts along the
route. Although the book's comprehensive and sometimes overtly instructive
style suggests that it is intended for the general reader, Dallas again and
again omits pieces of basic information that are in fact necessary to the
proper understanding of all this detail.
The events of 1870-71 are described with a wealth of descriptive energy as
befits a key period in Clemenceau's life - but if you did not know already
about the Prussian assault, why the Commune supervened and what it
represented, you would be in a complete fog as to what was really going on.
And although Dallas quotes Clemenceau's famous put-down after Boulanger shot
himself in 1891 on the grave of his mistress ('Il est mort comme il a vecu,
en sous-lieutenant') there is, almost unbelievably, no mention of
Boulanger's revanchist doctrine on Alsace-Lorraine and thus no adequate
discussion of the war scares of 1886 and '87. Similarly, when we reach the
moment of Jaures' assassination in 1914 only days before the outbreak of
war, no mention has at that point been made of Sarajevo or of 'the German
menace' at all.
More minor, but more irritating because more specific, is Dallas's failure
to tell us, when dealing with Zola's J'Accuse article, that L'Aurore was
Clemenceau's own paper. Indeed he has a circumlocutionary, novelist-like way
of creeping up to his favourite moments and then pouncing on them, which
does not make for coherence.
I do not want to sound ungrateful. I have learnt a good deal from this book,
whose cognitive scope extends from the dawn of the Revolution to the Fall of
Petain and Laval, and will keep it by me. Like Braudel, who is clearly his
master though oddly unacknowledged, Dallas is at his best when describing
events in the context of their settings. His earlier work deals with the
peasantry of the Loire (Clemenceau's native land); to accompany him there,
or to the northern mines of Zola's Germinal, or to the forest that now
covers the destroyed villages near Verdun, is a treat. Perhaps, for his next
work, he will chose a topic more rooted in one place and era and so really
expand his gifts.

SENTIMENTAL JOURNEYS
by Joan Didion
HarperCollins Pounds 15, 319 pages
I COULD die reading Joan Didion. It would be the perfect way to go -
slipping effortlessly into the deep, dark spiral of the long goodbye while
gorging on the unimprovable sentences with which Joan Didion constructs her
narratives.
Consider the perfection of this short passage: 'I was 10 years old when 'the
atomic age', as we called it then, came forcibly to the world's attention.
At the time the verbs favoured for use with 'the atomic age' were 'dawned'
or 'ushered in', both of which implied an upward trend to events. I recall
being told that the device which ended World War II was 'the size of a
lemon' (this was not true) and that the University of California had helped
build it (this was true).'
In the opinion of her publisher, Sentimental Journeys is Joan Didion's
'latest foray into the ailing American psyche', a world of disconnectedness
that Didion lacerates with the 'severe, crystalline beauty' of her prose.
What the publisher does not emphasise is that most of the essays here are
warmed-up potatoes: they appeared first in magazines. Nevertheless, not
everyone is a devoted reader of The New York Review of Books or The New
Yorker, let alone New West, so the publisher is performing a service.
The collection does not start well. Its opening section is entitled
'Washington' and contains an essay largely about Nancy Reagan - 'Her social
skills, like those of many women trained in the insular life of the motion
picture community, were strikingly undeveloped' - that is strikingly
second-hand, as well as sub-standard. But then the focus moves to
California, where Didion is more at home. Curiously, even this section opens
with a dud, Girl of the Golden West, which is about Patty Hearst and is that
most unusual thing: a completely useless piece of writing.
Then things take off. Los Angeles Days is an essay about the five-month 1988
Writers Guild of America strike against the Hollywood studios; Fire Season
about . . . the California fire season; and Sentimental Journeys (by now we
have moved to New York) about the gang-rape of a white middle-class jogger
in Central Park in April 1989. All three show Didion at her best: as
reporter, as interpreter and as stylist.
The style is crucial. There are better, more industrious reporters than
Didion, and her insights are sometimes highly odd. Quite often, I suspect,
we are not gaining a privileged view of the hidden springs of American
culture, business or politics, but a privileged view of the inside of Joan
Didion's head, where billions of exotic chemical connections bearing no
relation to reality are completed every second.
But so what? Cosmologists are now tending to the view that there is an
infinite number of universes, popping into, and out of, existence all the
time. Where Joan Didion came from, no one can imagine; where she is going
must be extraordinarily weird. How I wish I could follow her.
Flamingo is reissuing Joan Didion's Slouching Towards Bethlehem and The
White Album in paperback at Pounds 6.99 each.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Food and Drink: And is there luncheon still for two?:
Nicholas Lander considers the first responses to the FT's Lunch for a Fiver
scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ORGANISING the Weekend FT's Lunch for a Fiver has made me feel like a
restaurateur again. Initially, I wondered if it had been priced too low for
restaurants to offer the right menus. Were there enough restaurants to
satisfy demand? Was I, as one leading restaurateur wondered, sending out
false signals about the financial state of the restaurant trade? The initial
reactions, reported last Saturday, were encouraging, but any concerns
finally evaporated on Monday. A financial journalist from a rival newspaper
phoned to say that she had returned satisfied, in the company of a former
cabinet minister, from her Pounds 5 lunch at Frederick's, in London, N1. Her
Pounds 5 menu had been excellent and served with the same attention to
detail as the restaurant's normal lunchtime menu at three times the price.
A neighbour, finance director of a large public company, told me that he was
taking advantage of the scheme to take a number of his staff out for a
Pounds 5 lunch as a thank you gift. Other restaurants have also reported a
marked increase in the number of larger bookings as a result of the lower
unit price being offered.
Martin Lam at Ransome's Dock, London, SW11, said that on Monday lunch he had
served 34 customers compared with an average of 20 on Mondays and that the
per capita spend had been Pounds 18. On Tuesday he served 54 customers -
this surprised him since the restaurant can only seat 50.
The Brasserie at the Cafe Royal in Regent Street, London, W1, was fully
booked on Monday, a day when usually, according to general manager David
Pantin, it is never more than half full. Its menu was a model of what a
creative chef such as Herbert Berger can do for Pounds 5. A salad of mussels
and baby clams with coriander pesto and balsamic vinegar was followed by
braised lamb shank with garlic confit and root vegetables. They had to turn
customers away the following day and are busy converting tables normally
used for pre-lunch drinks into dining tables to satisfy demand.
One of the reasons for the success of 'Lunch for a Fiver' has been its
simplicity. All you have to do is choose your restaurant, phone to make a
booking specifying that you are coming for the FT menu - two courses for
Pounds 5 - and arrive on time. Remember it applies to weekdays only and
finishes on Friday January 29.
A number of restaurants are already full for the whole period but there is
always the possibility of a cancellation. And, like any sale bargain, a
little patient hunting will make the eventual prize more satisfying. Try to
be a bit flexible with your timing - eating closer to 12 than 1pm - and you
may stand a better chance of a table.
Attention all wine collectors. It is rare enough to have the chance to taste
the Bordeaux first growths together, particularly from such a glamorous and
highly priced vintage as 1982. But, at an exceptionally luxurious event
planned for Wednesday, February 3 at the Savoy Hotel in London, the pre-
dinner tasting will include not just this line-up but six
Corton-Charlemagnes and six de luxe champagnes. Suitable palate sharpening
for the dinner and accompanying wines as sumptuous as Chx Leoville-Barton
1985 and Pichon-Lalande 1982. There is a catch, but if wine collectors were
honest with themselves and their cellars, it is probably a relatively small
one. Tickets cost a donation of a case of wine worth at least Pounds 250, to
be auctioned by Sotheby's on April 21 in aid of the Tommy's Campaign for
research into fetal health. More information from Susie Roberts on
071-620-2654.
The Gulf is not the most obvious place in the world to learn about wine, but
the Wine and Spirit Education Trust, has been running courses out there this
month for Inchcape Middle East.
The WSET (tel: 071-236-3551) is the official body for formal wine trade
education, but there are many other approaches to liquid evening classes to
choose from, even in London. The Wine School of Fulham (071-736-7009) has an
array of excellent, non-stodgy speakers, Christie's South Kensington
(071-581-3933) has some marvellous classic wines, while Winewise in
Islington (071-254- 9734) offers a useful balance between the two. Many of
the livelier wine merchants offer one-off tastings too, notably Winecellars
of Wandsworth (081-871-2668) and La Vigneronne of South Kensington
(071-589-6113).

FT  23 JAN 93 / How To Spend It: Designs on your purse
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYONE WHO wants to dispel mid-winter gloom after the January sales should
head for London's Montpelier Street, where Bonhams is mounting its second
Decorative Arts Today selling exhibition.
From January 25 to February 7, Bonhams is offering a rare opportunity to see
under one roof the work of leading British designer-makers - no fewer than
140 of them this year. Most is for the home: furniture, lighting, rugs,
wall-hangings, glass, ceramics, tableware, silver and beautifully bound
books, but it also includes jewellery.
When Bonhams decided to sell exciting new work in this way last year, the
gamble paid off. Paul Whitfield, deputy chairman, said: 'First in at the
door was the chairman of another leading London auction house - last out was
Mick Jagger, who had bought 18 works.' This year's exhibition promises to be
richer, bigger and even more diverse. As soon as work is sold, it is
replaced by another piece by the same designer. All exhibits have been
designed and made in the 1990s and, after last year's success, most of the
designers have created work specifically for the exhibition.
For instance, Senior Carmichael has made a backgammon table in American
cherry, with a concealed playing surface and holding coloured sycamore
stones and leather shakers and dice (Pounds 3,500), and two matching chairs
(Pounds 985 each). Glen Hinton has made a hall table in carved wood,
patinated copper and laminated glass (Pounds 1,800), Martin Grierson an
elegant drop-leaf table in ripple sycamore with ebony stringing and six
chairs (Pounds 7,750), while Bob Crooks is showing his first glass
chandelier (Pounds 1,860) and Alan Caiger-Smith his one-off pieces - sadly
the last chance to buy his new work in London, because his Aldermaston
Pottery closes in May.
All the designers were encouraged to produce objects that are practical as
well as decorative. Dining tables and chairs, coffee tables, mirrors, side
tables, lamps, screens, candlesticks and coffee cups are among the objects
featured. Architect Jack Schneider has designed a striking dressing table,
in burl poplar and zebrano veneer and lacquered MDF, with a large, round
bevelled mirror (Pounds 3,560), while John Whittle has made an unusual
bedroom wardrobe, incorporating blue ash veneer (Pounds 1,005).
The exhibition sets out to show the wealth of design talent and
craftsmanship in Britain today. It also illustrates the great diversity of
styles. There is finely crafted wood-based furniture deriving from the Arts
and Crafts Movement by designers such as Alan Peters, Ashley Cartwright,
Jeremy Broun and Richard Williams; sculptural, minimalist furniture by Ron
Arad, whose surprisingly comfortable steel chair has a flexible, woven,
polished steel tug which rolls up to form a foot rest; Danny Lane's dramatic
two-metre glass table with six legs; painted furniture by Tony Isseyegh
showing the Bloomsbury Group's influence; and more eclectic and flamboyant
styles, from Regency-inspired metal work by Adrian Reynolds to a
Baroque-influenced candlestick by Felicity Evans.
The price range is from Pounds 15 to more than Pounds 12,000. Collectors'
items such as John Makepeace's library chair carved in burr elm with pivoted
leather lecturns for reading and writing (Pounds 11,850), an exquisitely
made treasure chest by Robert Ingham (Pounds 3,100) and a delicate
cloissonne enamelled egg box (Pounds 1,360) by Maureen Edgar should not
deter less well-heeled prospective buyers.
There are wooden bangles from Pounds 15 by Hayley Smith, wooden bowls by
Bert Marsh from Pounds 25 (turned wood is an increasingly accessible
collectable for those of modest means - a piece by another exhibitor, Steve
Howlett, was recently bought for the Sainsbury Collection) and silver rings
with bright artificial stones by Tina Engell from Pounds 100. There are also
hand-printed and painted cushions by Neil Bottle from Pounds 75, ties from
Pounds 32, colourful anodised aluminium plates and bowls by Patricia
Hamilton from Pounds 35, sensuous coloured jugs by Marianne Buus from Pounds
90 and ceramics from Pounds 40 by Chris Carter (the Sainsbury Collection has
bought some of his work, too) and Sarah Perry (who was taught by Lucie Rie
and Hans Coper).
The designers were asked to keep their prices low and many have produced
some particularly good buys. Bev and Mark Houlding, who make fantastic
painted and lacquered screens, have offered to make an edition of four
screens, painted on one side only, for Pounds 2,000, half their usual price.
Camilla Meddings, one of a number of young designers using old gilding and
lacquering techniques in a contemporary manner, is exhibiting a mirror
(Pounds 140) which depicts Artemis and Apollo, using tarnished copper and
gold leaf.
There is exceedingly good value in wallhangings from established designers
including Noel Dyrenforth, the leading contemporary British batik exponent
(Pounds 350), and the much respected weaver, Peter Collingwood, whose linen
and steel hanging costs only Pounds 220. Also, a Richard La Trobe Bateman
child's highchair in cleft ash is going for only Pounds 395]
Some reasonably priced bound books are being exhibited. Jan Lindsay produces
bookbindings with blank pages so that you can create your own book; the
bookbindings (Pounds 390), made from oak boards with white goatskin thongs,
are based on early 12th and 13th century manuscripts.
For anyone considering commissioning contemporary furniture in 1993,
Decorative Arts Today provides an opportunity to compare the work of more
than 60 furniture designers. Bonhams will happily make the introductions.
Apart from the well-known names mentioned above, Fred Baier, Ronald Carter,
Rupert Williamson, Toby Winteringham, Mark Brazier Jones and Tom Dixon are
exhibiting, as well as many unknown recent graduates.
Peta Levi is curator of the Decorative Arts Today exhibition; weekdays 11am
to 6pm; weekends midday to 6pm.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Cookery: Join a real jam session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

THERE IS something irresistible about Seville oranges. The name of them, and
the heady scent released when a fingernail is run across the skin, are as
brilliant as summer sunshine, just the spirit-lifter needed to dispel the
gloom of dank-dark January.
At this time of year, unlike high summer, the idea of holing up in the
kitchen for a jam session is not unappealing. The cosy warmth is inviting
and there is an undeniable glow of satisfaction to be gained from making
your own preserves.
What has become my standard marmalade recipe - one which is made with a
little less sugar than traditional marmalade - is given below.
If time is short, it may make more sense to buy marmalade and to enjoy more
immediate returns from the purchase of a few Seville oranges by turning them
into a sharp and zesty pudding for Sunday lunch.
Wendy Brandon is an ace marmalade maker, from whom I am as happy to buy as
to make my own. Her range is wide, using citrus fruits of all kinds and a
variety of additional flavourings. They include spiced lemon, orange with
ginger, grapefruit and elderflower, satsuma, kumquat, orange with molasses
and rum, pink grapefruit with campari, and lime with tequila.
Her marmalades come with a choice of sugar content (the traditional ratio,
reduced sugar, and with no added sugar at all). They are stocked by a few
select shops and can be bought by mail order: Wendy Brandon, Felin Wen,
Boncath, Dyfed SA37 0JR. Tel: 0239-841568. Fax: 0239-841746.
Another commercial offering of which I am especially fond is Twinings' 'Earl
Grey' marmalade. Although high in sugar, this is delectable, made with
bergamot, that most aromatic of bitter fruit. Its zesty oil gives
good-quality Earl Grey tea its characteristic fragrance.
It is a marmalade I will go a long way to buy, which is just as well, since
it involves a pilgrimage to central London - it isavailable only to personal
shoppers at Twinings shop in the Strand, London WC2.
Nowhere near so distinctive but chunky, dark and good is Duerr's extra
thick-cut, traditional marmalade, which has the advantage of being stocked
by grocers and supermarkets countrywide.
REDUCED SUGAR MARMALADE
(makes enough to fill eight jars) Organic fruit, or at any rate unsprayed,
is desirable for marmalade-making and any other recipe that uses the zest or
peel.
4 lb Seville oranges; four lemons; 6 lb granulated or preserving sugar.
Squeeze the juice from all the fruits into a preserving pan. Put the pips
and the membrane remaining in the citrus shells into a loosely-tied, butter
muslin bag. Shred the peel coarsely or finely as you like it, and add it to
the pan with the bag of pips and 8 pt cold water.
Cook over very low heat for two to three hours until the peel is so tender
that it can be squashed between finger and thumb, and the liquid has reduced
by about half.
Remove the bag of pips and membrane (squeeze it with a wooden spoon in a
sieve so all the pectin-rich juices drip back into the pan) and discard it.
Add the sugar and stir over very low heat until it is fully dissolved, then
cook at a rolling boil until setting point is reached - when a thermometer
will read 220'F (104'C). This usually takes 10 to 15 minutes.
Skim, let the marmalade stand for 10 minutes or so, then stir to distribute
the peel evenly in the jelly, and pot in the usual way.
LITTLE SEVILLE PUDDINGS (serves 6)
For those who want to enjoy the zesty scent and lovely taste of bitter
oranges without the labour of marmalade-making, here is a good pudding for
Sunday lunch. How many oranges you will need depends on their size and
juiciness: six is a fair average.
8 fl oz freshly-squeezed Seville orange juice and several pinches of finely
grated zest; 6 oz caster sugar; 3 oz softened butter; four large eggs; 2 oz
flour; 8 fl oz milk; fromage frais or whipped cream for serving.
Beat the butter and sugar with an electric whisk until creamy. Beat in the
orange juice, gradually, then the egg yolks, one at a time. Do not worry if
the mixture looks curdled. Beat in the flour, then the milk, adding it
slowly.
Whisk the egg whites to snowy peaks and fold the Seville orange juice
mixture into them, adding pinches of zest as you do so.
Ladle the mixture into six individual souffle dishes which have been lightly
buttered. Stand them in a roasting tin and add enough hot water to come
halfway up the sides of the dishes.
Bake at 350'F-375'F (180'C-190'C) gas mark 4-5, for about 40 minutes until
puffed up, coloured and softly set. The surface of the puddings will crack
as they cook and the mixture becomes light and spongy on top and creamy
underneath.
Little Seville puddings are best to eat about 10 minutes after they come out
of the oven. They sink a little as they cool, so dress them with dollops of
fromage frais or cream and a pinch of zest just before bringing them to
table.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Fashion: Unsung rag trade heroes - Avril Groom on the back
room stars of the UK fashion world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYONE with more than a passing interest in fashion will know the identity
of the British Designer of the Year. But the clothing exporter of the year?
Who is that? Media and public interest is invariably design-led, yet high
fashion designers turning over much more than Pounds 1m are the exception in
the UK.
Clothing companies notching serious export success tend to be far less
glamorous. Names from the heady realms of design, such as nostalgic
Mulberry, menswear genius Paul Smith and cashmere leaders Pringle, have been
winners but, more likely, are purveyors of men's duffle coats, inexpensive
cotton separates or frilly children's wear. Yet these kind of companies are
the main contributors to a total annual UK clothing export figure of more
than Pounds 2bn. In spite of the recession, the figure is still increasing -
albeit more slowly than in 1990.
Such unsung heroes of British fashion had their moment of glory this week,
at the 1992 Apparel Export Awards. Organised by the British Knitting and
Clothing Export Council, an industry-funded body which promotes clothing
exports by helping firms exhibit abroad and linking them with potential
agents and buyers, the awards, which I helped to judge, were presented at a
gala dinner in London by the council's president, the Princess Royal, who,
with her no-nonsense approach to glamour, is the perfect royal patron for
this cause.
Choosing eight winners from 74 nominees was serious business for a judging
panel drawn from journalism, industry and banking.
To be eligible, a company needed to have achieved continuing export growth
over the past three years, if possible to have increased its workforce and
to have a clear strategy for future growth. This was not easy last year and,
several firms where exports grew quickly up until 1991, reported a slowdown.
Eventual winners varied from traditional outerwear firms to a glove-maker
and a small-scale designer of upmarket cashmere with no formal training.
Some have always pursued export markets while others have only recently
altered their strategy, faced with a shrinking home market, to tackle them.
Many are family-run and all share the conviction that, apart from the need
for high-quality products efficiently delivered, successful exporting
depends on personal contacts with, and visits to, the customers. The good
designs displayed by this year's winners suggest that overseas buyers
increasingly recognise that British fashion is not just about tradition but
about innovative design that is also saleable.
We spotlight four of the winners:
Ghost, womenswear winner, is recognised as a high-fashion leader,
specialising in soft, flowing shapes made from piece-dyed, Italian-woven
viscose crepe which gains its character from the shrinkage induced by the
dyeing process. Innovative styling has recently given the label a high media
profile. The spring collection was shown in neo-hippy, grunge style but
individual pieces remain comfortably wearable.
London-based Ghost has increased its export sales over the past three years
from Pounds 1.3m to almost Pounds 2m - they now account for 70 per cent of
its total. The firm's founder and managing director, Tanya Sarne, oversees
every aspect, creating the range with designer Andrea Sargeant, who lives in
Italy, and a UK-based team.
Married in the 1970s to the singer Mike Sarne, Tanya says she learnt then to
juggle limited amounts of money. With stylish commercial acumen she has
increased the turnover from Pounds 250,000 in 1985 to about Pounds 2.75m.
The US now accounts for one-third of total business, followed by
Scandinavia. She says: 'The secret is personalities - getting agents and
customers who like and understand the clothes, which are very individual -
and maintaining contact. We give an initial reply to any communication
within one day and we make on-time, complete deliveries'.
Dents Gloves, accessories winner, has taken exporting seriously since the
arrival of managing director John Roberts three years ago. The 200-year-old
company had lost its way promotionally, in spite of high-quality products,
and was suffering from a fall-off in the home market. Roberts redirected the
company from contract work to export, investing heavily in high-quality
brochures and packaging, taking a high profile abroad at trade exhibitions
and producing design innovations such as bright silk linings to raise the
fashion image.
The result has been an increase in exports from 14 per cent to 70 per cent
of total sales. Italy, itself a byword for top-quality leather, provides the
best market. Roberts is very critical of lack of government support for the
industry. 'Companies get help with their first few foreign shows but that is
quite inadequate to build a new market which is very expensive for small
companies,' he says. 'It's typical British short-term thinking.' The support
to which he refers comes from the Department of Trade and Industry and
amounts to about 50 per cent of the cost of a 15 sq m exhibition stand at
the exhibitor's first three appearances in any one country, or five in
certain cases.
The lingerie section needs retitling as the winner - H G Porter and Co  - is
the first men's nightwear company to win in the awards' seven-year history.
Chairman Arthur Porter, the founder's grandson, has made a 'concerted and
strategic effort on export to Europe since 1989, preparing for the single
market. Before that, our exporting was piecemeal, relying on chance personal
contacts.'
The Strabane-based firm was founded as a shirtmakers, going into nightwear
through restructuring in 1965. 'We had relatively little specialist
competition so there was a niche,' says Porter. 'Since then I've become
obsessed with pyjamas.'
The results of extensive market research in Europe led to updating a
traditional British look and seeing each country as a regional variant, not
a different market. Exports have almost doubled in two years and he has
taken on 30 extra employees. He credits his workforce, the BKCEC and the
Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board.
Belinda Robertson wins the Natwest Award for small businesses with her
Pounds 440,000 sales of which almost 90 per cent are exported. Her cashmere
design firm started almost by accident when she modelled knitwear and
thought the designs boring, sketched some ideas of her own and found she
could sell them.
She moulds and drapes cashmere so it looks more like woven fabric, a style
with upmarket success especially in the US. She says the secret is 'all in
the contacts - through them I show abroad privately, which is what top-level
customers like.' She also finds her Edinburgh base an advantage - 'customers
are delighted to visit because they can take in a little golf and tourism.'

FT  23 JAN 93 / Sport: Test of mettle for crew of Steel - Yachting / Keith
Wheatley sees a dismasted yacht berth safely in Tasmania
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHAY Blyth was in ebullient form. It takes an experienced observer to
distinguish between this mode and the normally effervescent Blyth, but it
was thus. 'Wow, isn't that fantastic,' he shouted as a crudely ugly racing
yacht docked beneath the green hills of Hobart, Tasmania.
British Steel II had her boom jury-rigged as a mast, and a second spar
(borrowed from a much smaller yacht) in place as a mizzen. Aboard, her 14
crew looked much thinner than when they had left Rio on November 15. British
Steel had been dismasted halfway between Cape Horn and New Zealand, 2,500
miles from land in the iceberg-strewn wastes of the Southern Ocean. It is as
far from land and outside assistance as it is possible to be.
Her voyage to rejoin the other nine yachts racing around the world in the
British Steel Challenge, created by Blyth to give fare-paying amateurs a
taste of world-class ocean sailing, has become a classic of ingenuity and
guts.
Skipper Richard Tudor, 32, had already become renowned as probably the
hardest-driving of the 10 professionals helming the 67ft steel yachts. After
winning the training race around the Fastnet and the first Solent-Rio leg,
Tudor's boat was favourite to take overall victory in the 28,000-mile epic
which will call at Cape Town before finishing back in the Solent during late
May.
'It's been such an unbelievable experience. The shock and fear and then
teamwork to survive. I'm not sure that dismasting isn't more of an
achievement than winning the race,' said crew member Louise Broadbent of
Leeds, as the battered yacht moored up.
Once safely alongside Constitution Wharf, where Tasmania's unfortunate
convicts once landed, the stories began to emerge of the rough, freezing
night when the 90ft mast fractured just above deck level and toppled
overboard - a month from the nearest land. A stainless steel bottlescrew, a
disintegrated and left the spar without its main supporting wire.
'I thought we'd hit an iceberg,' recalled Marcus Gladwell, who was in his
bunk directly below the broken fitting when disaster struck. 'The first
noise of metal exploding woke me up, then came the banging of the mast
against the hull.
'If the yacht had been made of anything except steel I'm sure the rig would
have bashed through the side and sunk us.' In the dark and confusion it took
nearly an hour, using massive bolt-cutters, to cut the wires holding the
damaged mast to the yacht and let in sink 7,000ft to the ocean floor.
After that came the realisation that from being leaders of the 28,000-mile
race and favourites to win, British Steel II was effectively out of the
hunt. 'Some people were fairly depressed in the aftermath,' said Tudor,
going on to explain the irony of the incident.
'At the time we weren't pushing the boat hard. We were nicely placed just
behind the leader Nuclear Electric and there was no need. Had we been
pushing I could have forgiven myself for the damage,' said Tudor, a former
professional sailmaker from Pwllheli. His only similar accident was losing
the mast of his Mirror dinghy when he was eight.
Although he is shrewd enough to conceal it, Tudor is bitterly disappointed
that a design or manufacturing failure has dashed his hopes of glory. In a
shed adjoining Constitution Wharf lie the masts from three other yachts, all
seriously damaged from the same flaw in the overall rig.
Andrew Roberts, technical director for the race and virtual designer of
everything aboard except the hulls themselves, is certain that metal fatigue
caused the same component to fail on eight of the 10 yachts. Certainly there
are some expensive bills waiting to be apportioned and insurance assessors,
spar-makers and metallurgists can be found holding animated conversations in
odd corners of Hobart.
Without the full mast and sails to balance the yacht, British Steel II began
a wicked corkscrewing motion through the 40ft waves. 'From that point we
just thought about survival, not racing,' said crew member Yvonne Flatman, a
trading standards officer in 'civilian' life.
The ultra-competitive Tudor rejected the easier notion of running with the
prevailing winds to Chile. He was determined to reach Hobart in time to
participate in the final two legs of the race. British Steel II used its
motor to reach Hobart, disqualifying itself from that leg and the race
overall.
'We knew we were deep in iceberg country and we didn't have enough food or
fuel to do anything except sail out of it. It was my decision to stay in the
race and head for Tasmania,' said Tudor. A spare mast has been flown out for
British Steel II. The others are being repaired with new aluminium sections,
some over half the length of the original spar.
'Of course I'm surprised at the damage we've suffered. I honestly thought
the boats were built more substantially than that - if only because I'm
responsible for the repair bills,' said Blyth, who created and owns the race
concept.
'But we've got them all here safely and that's a huge relief.' Not least
because next month Blyth is expected to announce plans for a successor race
in even bigger yachts with more competitors. Against considerable scepticism
he has proved that a taste for adventure and danger lurks within even the
most deskbound of us.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Sport: Why Irish eyes must look abroad - Rugby Union / John
Hopkins analyses the sorry state of the men in green
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE rugby was no laughing matter at Murrayfield last Saturday, not even if
you were Scottish and celebrating a handsome 15-3 victory over the Irish in
the opening game of the international championship. What did you think of
it, Fergus Slattery was asked? 'Murrayfield is a lovely stadium,' said the
distinguished former Irish international, deliberately elliptically. 'It was
very windy.'
If Slattery was being polite, then it was in marked contrast to the
newspaper reports of Ireland's 12th successive game without victory in the
championship. 'Miserable Ireland sink to a new low at Murrayfield' ran a
headline in The Sunday Independent. The story beneath said: 'You don't often
sense misery at a major sporting occasion but it was present at Murrayfield
yesterday. You only had to be Irish to feel it. For the ailing team touched
a new low and emerged from a dull match the authors of nothing.'
Mick Doyle, who was Ireland's coach when they won the Triple Crown in 1985
(and when they were whitewashed in the championship the following season)
wrote in the same paper: 'This was the worst ever (display) by an Irish
side.' I have news for him. I have seen worse Irish teams than this but I
have never seen such a limp one. The traditional Irish fire was absent. They
seemed brow-beaten and uncertain of themselves, which are hardly Irish
characteristics.
By Tuesday, feelings had quietened and the remarks of Moss Keane were all
the more welcome for being so honest and low key. 'Our flair for rugby has
been curbed by our obsession to follow every one else,' said Keane, another
former international. 'Doing the unusual, as was our instinct, had a more
unsettling effect on the opposition. Where has the old fashioned footrush
gone? Working on fitness is fine and essential but when you have players
going out to play to a sterile, pre-ordained pattern foreign to their
traditions then you are getting nowhere.'
Rugby is of relatively little importance in the scheme of sports in Ireland,
a comfortable fourth behind Gaelic football, hurling and soccer. Only an
estimated 12,500 play rugby compared with 30 times as many in England, for
example.
'We used to close the gap that existed between us and other countries in
three ways,' said Slattery. 'First, we picked our best players. Then we were
better organised, and thirdly we gave 100 per cent for 80 minutes. We are
doing none of these now and we are showing our lack of resources.'
The Irish always seemed to be larger than life - on and off the field.
Seared into my memory and liver is the effect of a Sunday spent in the
company of Keane during the 1977 Lions' tour of New Zealand. For Keane it
was a day of rest, which meant that for everyone else it was anything but.
No wonder he was nicknamed Rentastorm. He roamed the hotel press-ganging
players and journalists to join him for a drink. He came across me just
before midday, as far as my memory goes, which is not very far, for obvious
reasons. I escaped to my bed barely vertical and far from sober after a mere
eight hours at the court of King Moss.
A few months later Keane was the host during a day in Dublin. The liver
received a second battering but what sticks more clearly in the mind is his
driving rather than his drinking. Cackling with laughter and dwarfing the
tiny gear lever in his massive left hand, the Kerryman piloted his way
around the fair city in a screech of tyres and a blur of brakes.
'Are you an ambler gambler,' he roared again and again as he diced with the
traffic lights. 'I am.'
It was around men like Keane and Willie-John McBride and Syd Millar, all of
whom had voracious appetites for life and rugby, that Ireland built their
pack in days gone by. Keane was once advised that the second row forward
playing opposite him was soft and a punch would be a good manoeuvre. 'At the
first line-out I bopped him one,' Keane recalled. 'Then bash] He hit me
straight back. I thought to myself: 'Bejabbers, I hit the wrong man'.'
Men like Keane have disappeared - at least for the time being. 'We used to
have players in key positions who always did the right thing,' said Noel
Murphy, the Ireland manager. 'We have not got men like this any more.'
I have a solution. The IRFU should look at - I am sorry for mentioning this
word, and I will wash my mouth with soap - but what they should look at is
soccer in Ireland. Some years ago it was in as much disarray as rugby is
now.
With the sort of ingenuity and disregard for convention that the Irish
professional golfers showed by staging the Irish Masters in Portugal, the
soccer authorities called in the best man to become team manager: Jack
Charlton, an Englishman who lived in Northumberland.
Charlton revitalised the national team, taking them to the late stages of
the World Cup finals in Italy in 1990. One possible candidate to revitalise
the Irish rugby team is the brilliant French coach Pierre Villepreux. He
could be found a job teaching English or French in a school in Dublin. Are
the Irish big enough to make such a break with their traditions?

FT  23 JAN 93 / Property: History and tradition in land of the commuter -
Gerald Cadogan explores Sussex, with its distinctive houses of half-timber
and hung-tiles, its wealth of attractions, and a hot-line to the heart of
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUSSEX was remote from civilised society until George IV, the Prince Regent,
turned Brighton from a fishing village into a seaside resort centred on his
pleasure dome, the Royal Pavilion.
Then, with the advent of the railways in Victoria's reign, Sussex changed
for ever. The county of woods and sticky clay, where travelling in a
carriage was a nightmare and where blacksmiths and forgemasters worked the
iron, burning the trees and damming the streams to make 'hammer ponds',
became a Home County.
Bankers and stockbrokers, and their clerks, moved out of London and set
about creating wonderful gardens of rhododendrons and azaleas. (A century
ago, trains to town took the same time as today. The choice of stations was
better.) The Sussex they moved to had largely escaped 18th century
gentrification - there are no Georgian stone stately piles.
Instead, wood, daub, and brick and tile are the basis of the Sussex
vernacular, and near the South Downs, knapped flint also. The houses are
distinctive - their frames are half-timbered, with a filling of daub, bricks
or flint, with the upper part sheathed in vertical hanging tiles as a
protection from the weather. Roofs are tiled and low, giving most Sussex
houses the look of cottages. Inside are low, head-hammering beams and brick
floors and fireplaces, often wide enough to have an inglenook.
The affluent 19th century commuters hastened to enlarge their homes, or
build new ones in the same style, as has continued to happen ever since.
With their look hardly changed for 400 years, it can be hard today to spot
the original bits in an 'old' Sussex house.
As a result, they exude the reassurance of sharing in a living tradition.
Sussex is a large county that divides into three parts. West Sussex,
bordering on Hampshire, has the attractions of Chichester and its cathedral,
theatre, and harbour, and the Roman palace at Fishbourne, racing at
Goodwood, and a beautiful, unspoilt hinterland.
Mid-Sussex is the London-Brighton corridor along the M23/A23 (now being
improved) and the railway line, with easy access to Gatwick, Glyndebourne
(closed for 1993) and the gardens at Wakehurst Place and Nymans. East Sussex
flattens as it nears Kent and the Channel tunnel, and oast houses (for hops)
begin to appear.
A splendid example of a typical East Sussex house newly on the market is the
18th century New House Farm at Bodiam, (where the National Trust has a
famous castle) and close to Battle, where William of Normandy conquered
Harold in 1066. Brick and hung tiles mask its timber frame. Cluttons in
Haywards Heath (0444-441166) are offering it at around Pounds 350,000, with
the adjacent triple oast house for around Pounds 200,000, and up to 320
acres of farmland.
More expensive and basically 16th century (when a family called Thatcher
obtained the property at the dissolution of the monasteries), is Arches
Manor at Framfield, near Uckfield and Lewes, with John D Wood (071-493-4106)
and Batcheller &amp; Thacker in Battle (0424-775577) at around Pounds 600,000.
Nearby is the 17th century Buckham Hill Farm at Isfield, a house rich in oak
and with an 18th century barn offered by Cluttons, at Pounds 575,000.
The Stable Cottage at Wadhurst near Tunbridge Wells, with a Victorian coach
house that could be converted, is available at around Pounds 110,000 from
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Tunbridge Wells (0892-515035). Next door, Hamptons
(071-293-8222) offer the big house, Best Beech Place, a 1920s Sussex-style
oaken splendour with garden by Gertrude Jekyll, at around Pounds 850,000.
For keen shots, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley are selling Platts Farm at Burwash
looking across to Rudyard Kipling's old house (Batemans) at around Pounds
500,000, to include barns and outbuildings, 71 acres and two duck flighting
ponds.
Oldcastle at Dallington near Battle is a house that grew over 300 years but
did not change its Sussex style. Humberts in Lewes (0273-478828) will sell
it to you with nine acres for about Pounds 625,000. Or they offer the
attractive 17th century Oak Ferrars Farm at Piltdown, with outbuildings and
three acres for about Pounds 269,000.
An intriguing East Sussex conversion is the flint Place Barn at Wilmington,
nestling under the Downs with views to the giant, chalk-cut Long Man of
Wilmington, who stands on the slope holding a stave in either hand. The Barn
(Humberts, around Pounds 275,000) won a Civic Trust award in 1982.
Another recent conversion is the Coach House at Halland near Lewes, a
handsome brick building that has the merit of not being cottage-style.
Watsons in Heathfield (0435-865077) offer it at around Pounds 320,000. The
best Sussex-style house in East Sussex is called Toad Hall: its name must be
reflected in the price of Pounds 395,000 (from Fox in Haywards Heath,
0444-450105). It is an impressive Wealden hall that could have belonged to
an ironmaster, dating back to the 15th century.
But finest of all is a manor house, early 17th century and listed Grade II*,
built in stone by an ironmaster to show he was above the common Sussex cut,
and on offer for only the third time in its history. Court Lodge at
Ashburnham near Battle (Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, under offer at around Pounds
450,000) comes with a Grade II barn and 48 acres, including 27 acres of
vineyards which the vendor would like to rent back from the new owner for
Pounds 175 an acre.
In mid-Sussex, a similarly grand manor, now a romantic ruin, is part of
Brambletye Manor Farm near East Grinstead. The total price for a typical
Sussex house, ruins, 26 acres, swimming pool and tennis court is around
Pounds 495,000, or Pounds 100,000 less excluding the farmyard (from John
Powell in Forest Row, 0342-822261, or Savills in Sevenoaks, 0732-455551).
Odder still, and dearer at around Pounds 1.25m, is Laughton Manor near Lewes
(from Hamptons in Mayfield, 0435-872294), a cream-stucco early Victorian
villa with an Italianate belvedere tower that has popped up in the country
from Belgrave Square or Regent's Park.
About half that price is a delightful house (from Fox), the Elizabethan East
Mascalls in Lindfield near Haywards Heath, which a Cheshire family built
with the ornamental half-timbering familiar in the north west. They must
have brought their joiner down with them. Nearby Cockhaise Mill Farm is for
those who want to run a business, as it comes with a thriving farm shop
(with game licence, sausage licence, ice cream licence and liquor licence).
Petfood is a new line and doing well. Humberts offer it at around Pounds
585,000.
Another neighbour is the many-bedroomed 16th/17th century manor called
Tremans at Horsted Keynes, listed Grade II* (Humberts, around Pounds
550,000). Arthur Benson, librettist of Land of Hope and Glory called it
'almost incredibly picturesque'.
Top marks go to Michael Winter-Kaines, a retired British Airways captain who
is marketing his Windmill Cottage at Rowhook, near Horsham, himself
(0403-790513) at Pounds 330,000, provided there is no chain. Not wanting to
pay agents' fees, he has produced an excellent, straightforward brochure for
an attractive listed Grade II house and cottage and barn, and is amazed at
how many people have replied to his advertisements and how nice they are.
'They are delighted to deal directly,' he says.
If you want to farm in mid-Sussex, the 425 acres of Little Danny Farm at
Hurstpierpoint is virtually all the estate once belonging to the imposing
Elizabethan manor house called Danny (now retirement housing with the Mutual
Households Association). It is an attractive proposition: mixed farming,
lovely country, parkland and lakes, in the lee of Wolstonbury Hill (National
Trust) on the Downs, and yet no distance from Brighton. Being sold in lots
by Humberts, the total asking price is around Pounds 1.3m.
Going west, Jackson-Stops in Midhurst (0730-812357) offer an essence of
cottagey Sussex in Old Hill at Lurgashall, near Petworth, three cottages and
a mill run together for around Pounds 220,000. The garden is crammed with
specimen plants. At Washington they are selling (with King &amp; Chasemore in
Pulborough, 0798-872081, at around Pounds 445,000) an 1820s old vicarage, a
good late Georgian box of a house for those who do not thrill to the wealth
of head-height old oak that is the hallmark of Sussex.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Travel Focus - Africa: North Luangwa now open - Practical
Traveller / Safaris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J WOODS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE TRACKS were very fresh in the off-white talc of the dusty path
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
there was an African hunting dog not far ahead. We set off on foot, treading
silently and hardly daring to breathe. We had barely reached the bend in the
track which led through thick mopane scrub when the wild dog doubled back
and met us face to face. We had walked into the middle of a hunt.
This was one of those chance encounters which turn an African safari from a
holiday into an adventure. One way of maximising the chances of such
encounters is to choose your destination carefully. With more areas opening
up for visitors, opportunities are increasing.
Zambia's South Luangwa national park has long been noted for its walking
safaris and its exciting night drives, while North Luangwa has only recently
been opened to visitors, although on a limited scale. Zambia was one of the
pioneers of walking safaris. They are generally well planned and full of
interest.
Abercrombie &amp; Kent, Worldwide Journeys and Expeditions, Twickers World, and
Art of Travel all go to Luangwa Valley, but of these only Art of Travel
specifically includes North Luangwa. Expect to pay Pounds 1,855 and up for
14 days.
While the walks in Zambia take you from one fixed camp to another, Richard
Bonham's walking expeditions into Tanzania's enormous Selous game reserve
are more in the traditional safari mould. Strings of porters are used, and
you sleep under the stars. Worldwide Journeys and Expeditions offers these
safaris from Pounds 3,950.
The traditional theme is repeated elsewhere in Tanzania where Gibbs Farm
Safaris takes clients into the vast grass seas of the Serengeti. Camping in
luxury tents, you will not see another vehicle in spite of the open country.
Nigel Perks, who runs GFS, has an uncanny knack of finding the most elusive
of animals. These safaris can be booked through Art of Travel, while
Twickers World has fly-in safaris to the Serengeti from Pounds 2,615 for 17
days.
A destination that has become much more accessible now that Air Namibia
operates direct flights from Heathrow is Namibia. With its good road
network, this southern African country makes an excellent destination for a
fly-drive tour. Etosha national park has plenty of elephant, black rhino and
lions, and a stay at Okaukuejo, with its floodlit water hole, is not to be
missed.
One country to rejoin the safari scene recently is Uganda, which has
gorillas. The borders of Zaire, Rwanda and Uganda meet in the volcanic
massif which forms the last stronghold of the mountain gorilla. It is
particularly good to see that gorilla-watching in Rwanda is possible again
now, as the continued conservation of these primates depends so much on
western visitors. Twickers World has a 23-day tour including visiting
chimpanzees in Tanzania from Pounds 1,675, while Abercrombie &amp; Kent has a
four-day add-on to a standard safari for around Pounds 1,021.
Mana Pools national park on the banks of the River Zambezi in Zimbabwe is
not only excellent for walking but is one of the highlights of a canoe
safari down the Zambezi, a leisurely way to see game, especially hippos and
crocodiles, at quite close quarters.
In turn, overland transport comes in many forms. Abercrombie &amp; Kent offers a
traditional ox-wagon safari on the shores of Kenya's Lake Naivasha (two
days, Pounds 480 ex-Nairobi), or a camel safari in northern Kenya (three
days, Pounds 307 ex-Nairobi), while there is the opportunity to explore
parts of the Kalahari desert in Botswana on all-terrain vehicles.
Botswana's Okavango delta, a rich mixture of glittering channels, clear
lagoons, water-lilied pools and sandy, palm-treed islands, has never been
easy to travel around. One way is to take an unhurried safari in traditional
mokoros, dug-out canoes, which are poled through the placid waters of this
enormous labyrinth of waterways by local guides, with an occasional walk on
one of the thousands of islands.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Travel Focus - Africa: A mosaic in the grand style - North
Africa is a place of happy lassitude
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES

<TEXT>
'Tunis is a land of liberty,' wrote the Chevalier d'Arvieux, a French
diplomat, over three centuries ago. 'Religion disturbs no one; they pray to
God when they must, fast when they cannot do otherwise, drink wine when they
have money, get drunk when they drink too much and no one finds any harm.'
THESE words ring true today and explain, as much as the sand and deep blue
sea, why more than 2m Europeans travel to the only country in the world
whose name is derived from a fish, tuna. The bulk of those who travel to
Tunisia go on summer package tours. Others have discovered that off the
beaten track, North Africa's smallest country has much to offer.
First of all it boasts splendid ancient ruins, the most dramatic of which
are in Dougga, on the western uplands near the Algerian frontier, and a
collection of Roman mosaics in the Bardo museum in Tunis which is second to
none. For those interested in Muslim architecture, the fortified town and
grand mosque of Qairwan, which dates from the 8th century, is but the most
remarkable of many scattered around the country.
The Jewish faith boasts the oldest synagogue in Africa on the island of
Jerba, Ulysses' fabled land of the lotus eaters. Every spring, a pilgrimage
to the Ghriba synagogue attracts Jews from all over the world to a country
where their presence, though much reduced today, spans nearly 3,000 years.
For their part, Christians can turn their thoughts to St Augustine, who
delighted in the pleasures of Carthage before preaching a more austere creed
as bishop of Hippo in what is now Algeria. On a warm summer night, Carthage
still evokes a courtesan past her prime but is still attractive.
Neighbouring Libya is virtually closed to foreign visitors. This is the
first country an ancient traveller from the east would have crossed on his
way to the 'Maghreb al Aqsa,' or 'Western land of the setting sun' as people
in the Middle East still call the maghreb. Yet, on the sea shore, the
setting of the roman ruins at Leptis Magna and Sabrata, both an hour's drive
from the capital, Tripoli, are exceptional.
Before its present troubles, Algeria attracted maybe 200,000 foreign
visitors, mostly headed for the Sahara desert. A quarter of a century ago,
the country's leaders set their mind against developing tourism; as a
result, Africa's second largest country boasts few decent hotels, most of
the state-controlled ones being very run down.
Gone are the late 19th century days when guides were published in London
called Algiers, The Playground of the Rich, and wealthy English families
built what are to this day the most elegant houses in the Mustafa Superieur
residential area of the city.
Yet those who brave discomfort and explore the Tassili plateau, the
mountains around Tamanrasset and the oasis of Timimoun and Tahrit, can
discover something of the beauty and magic of the desert.
Waiting to be discovered are the strange petrified stone forest of the
Tassili, with its thousands of dark silhouettes reminiscent of fur trees
weighed down by snow which, on closer inspection, are sandstone needles, and
thousands of pre-historic drawings scattered over 50,000 square miles.
The red needles of the Hoggar mountains near Tamanrasset are quite as
unreal. For those interested in architecture there is the town of Ghardaia,
founded by the puritan Mozabite sect of Sunni Islam which proved the great
inspiration for Le Corbusier's art.
Nearer Algiers, the roman ruins of Tipaza enabled Albert Camus to experience
'the happy lassitude of a wedding day with the world.' To Camus, the ruins
of Tipaza were far more 'modern' than many a modern city. This absinthe- and
jasmine-scented paradise has, however, today fallen victim to the violence
which has engulfed Algeria.
Morocco, for its part, boasts almost too many riches: skiing in the Atlas
mountains; swimming in the pool of any number of very comfortable hotels in
Marrakesh; trekking in the same mountains in late winter or spring through
Berber villages which appear like Cubist paintings hung on steep rocks.
For those who prefer the sun and sea, Morocco's long Mediterranean and
Atlantic coasts offer fun all year round. Resorts vary in tone, though
Morocco does not greatly encourage package tours and a number of its hotels
cater for the seriously rich. The Palais Jamai in Fes, one of the glories of
Islam, the Mamounia in Marrakesh and the Minzah in Tangiers are in the grand
tradition.
The variety and quality of Moroccan food, which is often sweet-sour, adds to
any trip, a true feast providing a seemingly endless flow of dishes. Save
for less than half a century as a French protectorate, Morocco has always
been independent.
Morocco's glory is its Berber and Arab architecture. The 1,000-year old
religious capital of Fes is dominated by the minarets of 100 mosques.
Unfortunately, mosques and other religious buildings are not open to
non-Muslims.
Beyond the red city of Marrakesh, from where in winter the visitor can gaze
at the 13,000-ft summits of the Atlas 30 miles away, lie Taroudant, Tafraout
and other old towns.
As the traveller descends to the plain from the frozen passes above, he
realises he has landed at the gateway of the Sahara. The contrast is
intoxicating, and never more than in late winter when the southern slopes of
the Atlas are covered with almond trees in flower.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Travel Focus - Africa: On the trail of small game in The

'THERE, Roger, There] Ooooohhh, Yeesss]'
I was sitting in a bright green and yellow six-wheeled truck with buffalo
horns wired to the bonnet and rows of old cinema seats in the back, and
beside me was a girl so excited she was almost dribbling in my ear. It was
irritating. My name is not Roger. There are moments when I wonder why I like
travel.
There were about a dozen of us in the truck, an old Swedish army vehicle
that had seen more African miles than a truck deserves to. Currently it was
in the service of a tour company that takes prawn-pink European tourists
into the dusty countryside of southern Gambia and shows them the sights.
The excited squeaks and coos had begun early in the morning, before we had
even left the strip of Atlantic coast where the tourist hotels range the
beach. Roger was sitting on one side of the truck, Jane on the other. Both
had binoculars to their eyes, cameras around their necks. Never had two more
enthusiastic discoverers set foot in Africa. It took me some time to work
out what it was they were discovering.
'Yaaaah]', Jane would let loose a barely restrained shriek, rocking the seat
beside me. 'Its a drongo]'
But what was a drongo? I would gaze in the direction that Jane was training
her binoculars, and try to imagine what one looked like. Was it the little
anthill-looking thing off to the left? Or the spiky tree behind the anthill?
Or maybe the little tin shack just behind the spiky tree? I could see
nothing at all.
This inexplicable behaviour began to get on my nerves. It was some time
after we had visited Uncle John's country palm wine bar, but a few minutes
before being held up for sweets and pens at the Jambur primary school, that
I borrowed a pair of binoculars from a fellow tourist and realised what Jane
and Roger were getting so excited about.
It was birds.
Take a pair of binoculars outdoors in The Gambia - anywhere: hotel gardens,
the potholed streets of Serrekunda town, into the peanut fields or mangrove
swamps along the Gambia River - and suddenly what can at times appear to be
a miserably poor and tourist-ridden country is transformed into a series of
vignettes of astonishing wealth and beauty. I arrived in the Gambia knowing
and caring nothing about birds. When I left I was well on the way to
becoming one of that most hopeless of species, the addicted birdwatcher.
The Gambia has had few fair shakes since it became a British slave-trading
entrepot in the 18th century. An historical and geographical aberration, it
is the result of commercial conflict between British and French colonial
trading interests. While France, master of much of north and west Africa,
laid effective claim to the huge territory of Senegal, the British were able
to hang on to the Gambia River, the sluggish, mangrove-bordered waterway
which flows through its heart.
The result, today, is a country which, while some 300 miles long, posesses
land only 15-to-30 miles wide on either side of the river. With no
hinterland, The Gambia's options are few. Ninety per cent of its meagre
wealth comes from peanut exports. Its population is one of the densest,
fastest expanding and poorest in Africa. Tourism is one of its brighter
hopes. Just five hours' flight from London and with six months' guaranteed
sunshine during the northern hemisphere winter, it is an increasingly
popular package destination.
If The Gambia's history and geography have made it a place where North and
South collide, its river has also incited a more gentle kind of meeting. One
of the few waterways to flow through this vast semi-arid region of west
Africa, The Gambia attracts millions of birds every year. Each dry season
hundreds of species, most African, some European migrants, congregate on the
country's riverbanks, beaches, mudflats, forests and grasslands.
Does an annual winter colloquium of birds sound slightly tedious? Perhaps,
in England, it might. But this is no dull, grey-brown meeting of humble
nuthatches and self-effacing finches. This is Africa, and its penchant for
flamboyance, oddity, excess and gaudy allure has been passed on to its
feathered inhabitants. The birds of The Gambia are, quite simply,
outrageous, and make the country one of the premier birdwatching areas in
the world.
One early morning a few days after my south Gambia tour I set out with Lamin
Sidibeh, a Gambian who at 29 is fast building a reputation as a professional
bird guide. He is known far away in England to the BBC - the Bedfordshire
Bird Club - two of whose members I had met walking goggle-eyed about the
lush gardens of the Senegambia Hotel.
Hard-core birdwatchers have a habit of drifting away in mid-sentence, their
eyes suddenly fixed on some object above your left shoulder, but I did
manage to hold them long enough to find out that Lamin is one of the best in
the business.
Among old Africa hands it is common to find that an early interest in big
game watching is replaced by a deep and long-lasting enthusiasm for birds.
There is greater variety, often more technical skill and personal knowledge
needed in spotting them, and a great deal less preparation and money
involved.
To sight a white rhino requires a costly expedition into a game park. To
spot the much smaller but equally spectacular malachite kingfisher - a
brilliant jewel of a creature - you might only have to gaze up at a
telephone line while ambling over to a restaurant for lunch.
Lamin and I, for example, began that morning in a not terribly auspicious
sounding place close to the hotel area, the Kotu sewage ponds. It sounds
ghastly, but there we saw a whole series of delicate waders, birds like the
blackwing stilt that mince around perched on thin pink legs that make up
two-thirds of their height. We saw the cormorant-like African darter drying
its wings after diving, and an English visitor, the grey heron, spearing its
sharp bill into schools of little fish.
From that point on, the morning was an unending succession of discoveries
and surprises. In a spiky, harvested millet field, where peasant women were
collecting stalks to feed their cattle, we came across a Senegal coucal with
green tail, white breast, black head and red wings and eyes, scuttling
through the stubble catching lizards.
In an irrigated rice field we watched a snowy white cattle egret wrestling
with a frog almost too big to get down its narrow throat.
On a mud flat by a small estuary we watched a bar-tailed godwit, a bird with
a beak almost as long as its body, poking around the mangrove roots catching
fiddler crabs for breakfast.
I had passed the Fajara golf club any number of times without thinking much
of it. Its fairways are yellowed, its greens brown. That morning it became
an entrancing place: all you have to do is look up. There we saw a giant
kingfisher, a full 18 inches long from beak to tail, flash by in a brilliant
blue streak. Not far away, in that strangest of African trees, the baobab,
we watched bright green long-tailed parakeets peck at the fruit that is used
to make cream of tartar.
Standing by the hollow of a neem tree - West Africans use its leaves as a
malaria remedy - Lamin whistled a scale of liquid, ascending notes; they
were similarly answered from inside the hollow, and in a minute or two a
pearl-spotted owlet emerged to blink sleepily at us. One of the aerial
wonders we spotted up a tall palm tree was not a bird at all, but a palm
wine tapper doing his morning rounds, shinnying up and down collecting
gourds of sweet fermented sap.
I shall not go on. Suffice it to say that in one morning I saw 55 different
kinds of birds, each new one as exciting and different as the last. I cannot
decide which I like best, but I think I would plump for the tiny
nectar-drinking sunbirds, impossibly bright creatures in yellow, scarlet and
ruby.
I did not quite see the full range, though: there are said to be 507 species
of birds in The Gambia. Even Lamin has seen only 378. But I have not given
up. If, in the future, you come across a wild-eyed twitcher crouched in some
distant palm grove muttering 'Yeesss] It's a drongo]', it might be me.
Nicholas Woodsworth travelled c/o The Gambia Experience (tel: 0703-730888),
a specialist tour company that offers return air fare from London and seven
nights' accommodation with breakfast at the Kairaba Hotel for Pounds
448-Pounds 548. Lamin Sidibeh can be contacted c/o Customs &amp; Excise,

FT  23 JAN 93 / Muddling towards democracy: Truth of the Matter - Patti
Waldmeir on the problems that face South Africa and Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OF ALL the nations struggling toward democracy, few seem to have less
natural aptitude for the task than Russia and South Africa. Neither is
politically tolerant by nature: throughout history, both have proved
themselves excellent autocrats, corrupt and terrible tyrants.
But now Moscow and Pretoria, bitterest enemies for decades, have become
strange comrades in battle: falteringly, they fight the tide of culture and
history to pursue a liberal democratic goal which seems to recede as often
as it draws nearer.
Neither is likely to follow a straight path to democracy - if indeed, they
ever get there. But both are committed to ruling by consent and not
coercion; and a return to either totalitarianism or apartheid is out of the
question. Both must therefore search for a more or less democratic form of
government which can hold anarchy at bay while protecting the minimum of
civil liberties.
So far the move to democracy has fostered chaos, crime and violence in both
countries. Many already yearn for a strong man to restore order. In South
Africa, a prominent mixed race politician complains (only half in jest) 'I
miss apartheid'; and most Russians would probably understand this nostalgia
for authoritarian certainty.
But in the longer term, a betting man would probably conclude that Russia
will stay the course to full democracy - however circuitous - and that South
Africa will not. Both face formidable obstacles to democratisation, chief
among them problems of ethnicity and economic hardship. But South Africa has
a further overwhelming disadvantage: the rigid correlation between wealth
and race decreed by apartheid.
For democracy is scarcely the obvious solution for a country where the
majority is poor, black and impatient and the minority white, rich and
powerful: democracy invites the individual to use his vote to obtain a
fairer share of wealth; but any government which indulges the urge to
redistribute wealth will alienate white skills and capital, and jeopardise
economic growth. Either way, the incumbent government would suffer at the
ballot box - and would probably soon decide to dispense with democratic
elections.
As Alexis de Tocqueville pointed out more than 150 years ago: 'When the
people rule, they must be rendered happy or they will overturn the state.'
But in South Africa, the 'state' would not give up without a fight; a new
government may well be tempted to impose its will - in the national
interest, of course - rather than hand over to the opposition.
Not surprisingly, most South Africans reject this scenario: indeed, they
find cheer in the midst of political upheaval by counting their considerable
blessings in comparison with Russia. South African democrats will inherit
intact the one most necessary condition for democracy: a market economy.
That economy may have been damaged by 40 years of 'Afrikaner socialism',
which used state capital to set up nationalised industries dominated by the
'white tribe of Africa'. But repairing its flaws is a small task compared
with that facing Russia's economic reformers. From nothing, they must create
financial markets, draw up a detailed body of company law and construct all
the institutional supports necessary to capitalism.
South Africa inherits these things from the apartheid state; and before the
African National Congress decides to tamper with this inheritance, it should
reflect on the ways in which capitalism underpins the democratic system
which the ANC professes as its goal. In developed democracies, the private
sector functions as an important check on the power of governmental
authority; and the market economy holds out the best hope of a prosperity
which is essential to bolster democracy from below.
Paradoxically, South Africans will also inherit from apartheid - a most
undemocratic ideology - the infrastructure of a thriving political democracy
which Russia struggles so painfully to build. South Africa has political
parties, independent courts, lobby groups and all the paraphernalia of
parliamentary democracy, which can surely be adapted for a multi-racial
future. But in Russia the Communist Party, which invaded every aspect of
personal and public life, has deeply discredited the very notion of 'party';
indeed, there are few coherent party alternatives to President Boris
Yeltsin, himself something of a one-man band.
Progress towards the establishment of an independent judiciary in Russia is
perhaps more advanced: the new Constitutional Court represents a milestone
on the path to democracy. But Russia has no tradition of challenging state
power through the courts - certainly not under communism, when challenging
party decisions was effectively forbidden - and it lacks the institutional
depth (the courts, the judges, the independent lawyers) present in South
Africa. Even in the worst days of apartheid abuse, South Africa's courts
managed to preserve much of their independence.
But democracy requires more than political parties, elections and courts: a
vigorous civil society (everything from trades unions to churches, women's
groups to chambers of commerce) is necessary to frustrate the would-be
tyrant. Such civil infrastructure is well developed in both black and white
South Africa - and almost non-existent in Russia. Organised business and
labour in South Africa could counter-balance government power; civic
associations in black townships could prove a further check on central
government; and with three-quarters of the population actively religious,
the churches will remain a major political force.
What is more, South Africa will inherit a state machine which actually
works; in Russia, where party and state were practically indivisible, the
collapse of the one has destroyed the other. No new South African government
is likely to face the crisis of executive power which currently assails
Moscow.
So that is the triple challenge facing Russia: to create a modern state, a
modern market economy and democratic political institutions, and to do so
simultaneously under conditions of great economic hardship.
But however daunting the immediate crisis, Russia will probably muddle
through in the end to democracy and prosperity. And South Africa, whatever
its early advantages, may not. Western democracies will continue to provide
moral support to Russian democrats (however unreliable their financial
backing), while South Africa will rapidly be left to itself on the remote
tip of a forgotten continent. And over time, the gross inequalities of South
African society could prove too much for a fledgling democracy.
Both face problems of ethnicity and economic deprivation which threaten
democracy; but in South Africa, crucially, they are linked. While Russians
struggle (more or less) equally to survive, race determines the degree of
hardship experienced by each South African. As long as that is so palpably
true, it is hard to see how democracy can take root.
But even if South Africa - perhaps Russia too - reverts temporarily to
authoritarian rule, there can be no returning to the specific abominations
of the past. Totalitarian communism and apartheid are ruled out forever. The
future can scarcely be worse.

FT  23 JAN 93 / As They Say in Europe: Talking dirty in six languages -
James Morgan asks what offends the man on a London omnibus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE THING the papers shared this week was Clinton fatigue. Editorials from
Dublin to Lublin made half-hearted attempts not to be boring but failed. The
inauguration of a president remains, as ever, the crossroads of history that
lead to a new beginning and the quest for the rebirth of the American dream.
Only Paris-Normandie had an interesting view of the new man in the White
House: 'It is as if Pontarlier town council were put in charge of France.'
Pontarlier is, incidentally, much nicer than Little Rock.
So, like the papers, I pursued last week's topic: unacceptable behaviour
and, my special interest, cross-frontier variations in definitions of it.
The research programme accidentally revealed that the British can deal
easily with the wilder shores of human emotions and the French cannot.
I discovered this thanks to AFP, the French news agency. The test involved
the revelations concerning a telephone conversation supposedly between a
male member of the royal family and a woman with whom he was evidently on
good terms. Sure enough the British, and English-speakers in general, were
assumed to be able to deal with the raw truth. When the story broke in
Australia, the English service of AFP gave it 1,000 words.
In French, however, it was compressed to under 200 words and the sole
reference to the contents of the 'presumed transcription' noted that the two
'do not hide either their love or their reciprocal physical attraction'.
And yet the French at home have few inhibitions. Political debate is larded
with words that I would not transcribe even in asterisks. Comedy shows on
television can consist of a stream of jokes that make the average British
stand-up comic sound like Noel Coward.
Such material can also provide the basis for what passes for German humour
yet it would be unacceptable in Spain or Britain. But these two countries
themselves differ on what is acceptable. In my local paper, among
advertisements for plumbers and electricians, is a column of notices
detailing the facilities available for making, yes, telephone calls of a
lubricious nature. Such items used to decorate Spanish papers but not since
the phone lines were closed last month in response to widespread public
pressure.
Yet those same papers, often liberal and leftish, freely advertise the
services of transvestite prostitutes, among others. Afternoon television
programmes for children can be interspersed with items where youngish
females progressively divest themselves of what do seem to be rather
uncomfortable garments.
National sensitivities involve not only the intimate side of life. The
delicacy of the British struck me this week in a bus which had a sign
saying, 'We would prefer you not to eat or drink on this bus. However, if
you do would you please take your litter with you.' I spent some time
working out how this would translate. German is not suitable for conveying
moral uncertainty or the doctrine of the second best; the nearest I got was
Essen und trinken verboten. In French the warning is like something from a
home for the incontinent elderly; in Italian, an invitation to steal the
bus; in Russia, nobody sufficiently resourceful to possess the items
involved would be fool enough to leave anything behind. And in Czech, the
sign would be a trap to ensnare the man with a sandwich in an endless
bureaucratic nightmare.
The same 9A bus also saw the entrance of an inspector who treated even those
without a ticket with some deference. This was a savage contrast with what I
remember from my time in Vienna, where, in similar operations, two young
toughs board a tram at opposite ends, the doors slamming tight shut behind
them. They adopt the demeanour of those who had mastered the techniques of
extracting confessions efficiently, open their denim jackets to expose heavy
metal badges and shout Kontrollieren. Not surprisingly nobody is without a
ticket.
The purpose of this digression is to set the scene for my favourite opinion
poll which appeared again in the Vienna tabloid, Kurier, the other day. The
question was: 'Which groups would you find objectionable as neighbours?' Top
of the poll were Turks and Romanians; the least unpopular of the nine were
Slovenes and Jews. (Discussion of the prevalence of anti-Semitism in this
part of the world often fails to reflect the rich spectrum of prejudice that
characterises Austrian society.) Commentators noted that there had been a
steady fall in the level of hatred from the peak in 1988, the year
newspapers demanded that 'Waldheim must go' following revelations about his
wartime past that he had prefered to conceal.)
I have asked many questions about this poll over the years: is a list of
'detestees' presented to respondents or can they supply their own? Whatever
happened to the Poles who once led the field but now get scarcely a mention?
And, has anybody ever included the Viennese on the list?
But the question I suppose I am really asking is this: would The Sun publish
the results of such a poll if it were conducted in Britain?

FT  23 JAN 93 / Gardening: As sterling wilts, sow seeds of British growth -
The Belgian and Dutch plants which fill garden centres have shot up in
price. Robin Lane Fox has a plan . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
In a sudden leap, there are flowers again, a wonderful prelude to the
unpredictable dance which the seasons now work for us all.
Last week, there seemed to be nothing; then, on Saturday, there were
hundreds of crocuses wrapped like yellow pencils; on Sunday, there were
aconites in churchyards and on Monday, snowdrops were spattering the ground
once more.
We are a month ahead of schedule, while the last of the winter's roses are
still waiting to leave the stage and their green leaves make a curious
backdrop to a new year. After weeks of gloomy rain, these early visitors
stand out like drops of sunshine.
They remind me that it is time for gardeners to get moving. Before they
start, they will need little reminding that their art is never cheap.
Mirrored in our gardens' microcosm, all economic life is reflected. Once
upon a time, we used to supply ourselves, grow our own plants and pay people
to help us look after them. Since the 1970s, the trade has changed as
rapidly as anything in business life.
Consumers want different things: busy householders will pay for shops to
display plants for immediate sale; garden centres have multiplied and keen,
fresh stock has become the cult of the visiting public.
With their usual subtlety, sellers have traded on their two best human
allies, impulse and impatience. Why wait for years when money can buy you a
plant which already looks reassuringly bigger than other people's? If you
like it, take it away in the car boot.
Here, technology has come to the rescue. In this new age of polythene,
plants can be turned out of their plastic containers at almost any season:
they can also be moved from one country to another. At this point, the
question of the economy and its prospects confront us all through a twist in
our national idea of ourselves.
We all know the stereotype: British goods may be declining; the monarchy may
be intercepted on the wrong frequency, but at least we Brits know how to
garden and our gardening is the envy of Europe. Tourist boards promote it;
even the French have to admit that it is better than theirs; economists
sometimes blame it for other sins.
I have sometimes been told by serious pundits that a reason why British
industry is losing its competitive edge is that employees are more
interested in their gardens and that the managers are waiting every day to
get back to the roses or the real business of life, so amply covered in the
Weekend FT.
Nobody could dispute the art of our flower gardens at their best or the
widespread love of gardening, planting and growing. However, I do think that
the better examples are rather rare and that visually, much of our gardening
(including bits of mine) is engagingly awful.
I do also notice how this national art is called 'English gardening', as if
nothing of any significance happened on the Celtic fringe. If I had to
choose only one public garden in the kingdom, it would always be the
Edinburgh Botanic Garden, but perhaps it is too Olympian to object to the
English insult.
What does amuse me, and in future may alarm me, is that the backbone of the
best garden centres, many of our nurseries and our garden landscaping is not
actually grown in England or even in Britain. Dreamy English gardening is
all very well in a summer's haze, but many of its greatest nurseries buy the
plants for it in the Netherlands and Belgium.
You can see why this piece of national double-think will soon have economic
consequences. Personally, I will rely ever more on seeds. But the irony is
not going to disappear quietly or without cost.
Of course there are planty 'people' all over Britain with their own cottage
industries and home-grown lists of lesser-known specimens. Yet they cannot
supply the trade with much of its better shrubs, hedging plants, bulbs and
border plants because they do not specialise or grow to the right scale
perhaps, or, to be charitable, have such a good European soil. Whenever you
see a particularly big and seductive plant in the garden centre, it is
highly likely to have been imported from a Dutchman or a Belgian who would
not know how to pronounce Miss Jekyll's name.
This nice little irony prompts me to two conclusions, one of which is
analytic, the other is commonsense. Like machine tools, the plants for
Englishpersons' gardens are now being imported en masse from abroad.
Many argue that Britain would have a bright economic future in heavy
industry if only engineering was part of our daily culture. Those people
ought to stop and consider the case of gardening. Gardening is agreed to be
not just a cultural taste but a national obsession: nonetheless, our big
traders and designers have to import a mass of its basic materials because
their obsessive nationals cannot grow it for themselves.
My second conclusion is simply prudential. Now that so many retail sources
are depending on plants from Europe, their cost is not exactly going to obey
the chancellor's happy predictions while the currency is suffering from
wilt. Flower bulbs have already made a nonsense of the retail index because
most of them come in from the Netherlands and this season's summer lilies,
hyacinths and gladioli have had surcharges of 15 per cent or more imposed on
them.
Matters have not been helped by an awkward season in 1992 for many of the
maincrop bulbs in which the Dutch, especially, excel. As for evergreen yew,
box and well-grown specialities such as viburnum or witch hazel, the same
price rises will soon apply wherever the retail trade has grown to depend on
foreign stock.
The moral, therefore, is to swap impatience for self-sufficiency and start
to grow as much as possible from seeds from one's own garden and seed lists.
The choice of seeds is one of the pleasures of late January and next week, I
will be scanning for a short list. This year, however, it has an extra
economic thrust.
I have already pre-booked my seeds of regale lilies, white galtonias and
mixed agapanthus. I have opted for patience with the late-flowering
lespedeza whose silky leaves and rose-purple flowers are such a blessing in
autumn and I will be trying for half-hardy daturas from seed. Anything the
Dutch can do I can surely do half as well: from a seed packet, you always
raise more than you need, with a margin of error which allows even an
Englishman without illusions to compete.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Warm glow of profits keeps out
chill of recession - Nick Garnett visits the London Scarf Company, where
first-year sales totalled Pounds 870,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT

<TEXT>
'I'VE been in the British textile industry for 30 years. It has been one
long retreat. Those of us who are still here think of ourselves as
equivalent to the survivors of Stalingrad.'
PETER Duxbury is looking forward now to a business life better than mere
survival. The London Scarf Company, which he set up a little more than a
year ago designing and contracting out the printing of scarves for big
department stores, has turned in remarkable first-year sales of Pounds
870,000. 'We have just started in the tie market as well. I'd hope to do
overall perhaps Pounds 1m in our second year.'
London Scarf is a classic example of an infant business created by people
already experienced in the same trade by working for large companies.
Duxbury was a manager at Josef Otten, an Austrian textile distributor. He
finished his days there in 1991 by winding up that company's British trading
operations.
He decided to set up on his own, taking with him two Josef Otten employees.
He had promised orders from Jacqmar, a UK scarf brand whose operations had
been serviced by companies Duxbury had once worked for.
The idea was to design scarves in London and have them made by low-cost
printers in China, Japan and Italy for importation into Europe.
'We decided we could develop a product which we would target on major
retailers rather than a mass of small shops. Joseph Otten had 400-500
customers for its scarves. We have 23 which are most of the big department
store groups.'
Duxbury had Pounds 100,000 of his own to put at the company's disposal. 'The
company is well funded. It had to have good secure footing or I would not
have gone into it.'
On top of that, Duxbury negotiated with Hambros Bank a reserve figure of
more than Pounds 40,000 to be tapped into if necessary. 'Hambros have been
wonderful. They have given us every support.'
As it happens, setting up London Scarf was not expensive. Duxbury puts
start-up costs at about Pounds 15,000. That included legal fees and first
payments on a smallish works studio whose yearly rent. for 500 square feet
in London is a rather high Pounds 14,000.
In its first year, the company produced 100 designs and close to 200,000
scarves, all but 10 per cent of which were silk. A little over a half of
production was supplied wholesale to department stores. The rest - still
using London Scarf designs - were bought direct by stores from the scarf
printers, Duxbury's company collects an agency fee.
London Scarf takes most of its designs from paintings submitted by freelance
artists. An artist receives about Pounds 350 for a design and its colour
work. Selected designs are air-mailed to one of London Scarf's three
manufacturers - in Tokyo, Shanghai and in the scarf printing area near Lake
Como in Italy.
A typical London Scarf product uses 10 to 12 colours. Much more expensive
Hermes scarfs might have up to 30. In preparation for printing, each colour
(with its own part of the overall design) must be converted by the printer
into an individual 'screen', usually made of nylon. Each colour with its
pattern is printed separately on each scarf, the silk moving underneath the
fixed screens through which dye is poured.
'Surprisingly, the process is much more automated in China than in Japan but
actual material handling is much more advanced in Japan,' says Duxbury.
'For the same money you get a better scarf from China than from Japan,' says
Jane Swan, who also came from Josef Otten. 'It is thicker and hemmed by
hand.'
The cost of designing a scarf and producing its colour screens (a further
Pounds 1,000) must be absorbed in the price. Production runs for a scarf
design range from 500 to about 6,000. London Scarf makes a relatively tight
average return of between a third and 40 per cent, measuring the price it
receives for each scarf against the cost of producing them. The biggest
margins, as so often happens, are enjoyed by the retailers. A silk scarf
retailing at Pounds 20 will be bought by the retailer for about Pounds 7.
Duxbury says the pre-tax margin for the first year was about 5 per cent but
he is looking for an eventual return on capital of 30 per cent. London
Scarf's main competitors include two US companies, Echo and Liz Claiborne,
as well as in-house designers some stores employ.
About a quarter of the company's sales are in France. The Monoprix chain
placed the largest order the infant company has so far enjoyed - one of
Pounds 50,000. Duxbury is keen to find agents for his scarves in Germany,
Spain and Scandinavia. Apart from reducing dependency on the UK's Pounds 7m
silk scarf market, such expansion would prove particularly lucrative. The
idea is to sell the design in a number of countries. This would raise
profits by spreading design and screen-production costs. Nylon screens,
which are stored at the scarf printers, last for three years before
corroding.
London Scarf caters for the middle mass market. 'We'll wait for two years
before deciding whether to go into boutiques. A typical boutique buys from a
merchant a scarf for Pounds 15 and sells it for Pounds 50.'
The downside is that this would force London Scarf into becoming a holder of
stock, another cost burden.
Duxbury would like to have scarves printed in the UK but says the one silk
printer capable of doing it - a company used by Liberty's - has high
production costs. London Scarf will almost certainly stick to overseas silk
printers for its ties. 'We are crashing into the tie market although it is
very competitive,' says Duxbury. 'We have so far done 7,000 for France. We
are expecting to do 60,000-70,000 ties this year.'
In recession, retailers squeeze the margins of little companies like London
Scarf. But tough trading has a silver lining. Swan says: 'What has helped us
is that department stores are cutting their numbers of buyers and, as they
are more hard pressed, they tend to depend more on our advice.'

FT  23 JAN 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Colour your thinking - Computing
/ Robin Brooker looks at innovative software designed to help managers sift
data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN BROOKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE pre-computer age it was often said that the business manager's
problems were aggravated by lack of data. Now the reverse is true.
Managers suffer from an overload of data. This plethora of data has reached
such proportions that often the managers have difficulty seeing the wood for
the trees. When it comes to decision making or problem solving it is not raw
data but information that is needed.
Information and data are not synonymous. Data is merely the building blocks
of information: it is the interpretation of data that provides information.
Only when we bring together these pieces of information are we able to
distinguish a recognisable pattern.
There are many software packages that support the organisation of our ideas
and thoughts. Most computer programs of this type allow the collection of
pieces of information as well as rapid and easy restructuring of the
individual ideas.
Packages such as PC Outline adopt a sequential and linear approach,
Brainstorm is more hierarchical; the opening screen shows just the trunk of
your thoughts while lower screens gradually reveal more and more branches
and detail. CK Modeller takes a new and innovative approach much closer to
gestalt methodology. CK Modeller is described by its originators - Idon
Software - as a package for management thinking. It moves from the six
elements of Edward De Bono's perceptions on lateral-thinking to a ten-colour
map of ideas, thoughts, issues and assumptions which can be manipulated on
the computer screen.
A reasonable analogy is the jigsaw puzzle. Most people when attempting a new
puzzle tip all the pieces on to a flat surface. Using the reference
illustration as a guide, they gather together the pieces which appear to
relate to particular parts of the picture.
CK Modeller uses much the same method. But, instead of prepared pieces,
coloured hexagons are marked with your thoughts. The hexagon allows more
relationships to be formed than the simple list of linear, or hierarchical
based software. When you have exhausted this initial thinking task you form
clusters of those ideas that seem to fit together.
As these separate clusters form you may recognise how particular clusters
link together. Other clusters, at this stage, may have no links. It is CK
Modeller's ability to show these missing links of the problem that makes it
unique.
You have to make up pieces, using new ideas, that will actually tie the
different clusters together. These, initially, may be quite tenuous links:
they may be merely annotated arrows. But, as your thoughts progress the
separate clusters become more part of the whole and you will gradually build
a complete model of your problem or extended idea.
The use of colour within CK Modeller is psychological, and a further step
towards understanding of the issue at hand. Psychologically, red is the
colour of danger, green is for growth, freshness and the new. By
encapsulating this evocation within the structure of the problem we are able
to pick out parts which signal danger, or require action, from areas that
merely convey information. The completed model will be an icon of the
overall thought process and will convey all the nuances of ideas brought
forward.
The system of thinking in hexagons is not new - though its use with computer
has only recently been made generally available. The computer version offers
considerable advantages over its manual counterpart.
First, it offers the ability to construct larger models than would be
possible with hexagons and whiteboard. The model might be part of a network
of sub-models and by using objects called activators CK Modeller can launch
other models or even other computer applications that contain the raw data
on which the ideas are based. These ideas of cognitive kinetics may be new
to you.
Initially, because of my previous experiences and the way I use outliners, I
had some learning to do before I could grasp the concepts - though when I
explained the principles to my 20-year-old daughter she immediately
recognised its potential. What I had struggled to understand, she grasped
within minutes. Operating the software is simplicity itself. There is no
intensive keyboard input as most operations are carried out on a graphics
window using a mouse.
CK Modeller is unlike most other computer applications. When the appropriate
formulae and data requests have been put into a spreadsheet or database the
computer takes over the work.
CK Modeller requires effort. While it supports your thinking and allows you
to restructure your thoughts in a matter of minutes you remain in complete
control.
In the user manual that accompanies the software there is a suggestion that
once you have encapsulated all your ideas in a model the next step is to
build a new lattice using the same set of hexagons. Only, this time, take a
hexagon from the periphery of the original cluster and regard it as the
central theme of your new model. As it will form a different perspective of
the problem it will also reveal new relationships and dependencies between
individual items. But that, as they say, is another story.
CK Modeller, with manual, a book 'Thinking with Hexagons' and a magnetic
travel kit for hexagon planning without a computer, is Pounds 395 plus VAT
and Pounds 5 shipping from Idon Software, Edradour House, Pitlochry,
Perthshire, PH16 5JW. 0796 473709

FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Only a niche position - John Authers
says the international balanced unit trust sector has a place, but you need
to know where
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR BREADTH of choice, the 'international balanced' unit trust sector offers
more opportunities than any other.
A quick look at their specifications shows why. According to the Unit Trust
Association, these funds 'have less than 80 per cent of their portfolio
invested in either equities or fixed interest securities'.
Geographical areas are not mentioned. Fund managers, provided they keep a
balance, can invest in virtually any security, anywhere in the world, which
they believe will perform well. Such funds may be the unit trust world's
answers to the stately galleons of the 'international general' investment
trusts, which have broadly spread international assets.
Managers face a different challenge from that in most other sectors. Usually
their remit is tight. They must stay in, for example, UK smaller companies,
even if they think these companies will underperform. Outperformance comes
from superior stock selection.
In the international balanced sector, asset allocation, not stock selection,
is the determining factor. Ideally, they will ride with the best-performing
asset of the moment, switching when necessary, and avoiding sharp changes or
speculative moves by retaining balance.
The only trust with a ten-year record, Gartmore Global Income &amp; Growth,
appears to have delivered this, with growth of 538.45 per cent over ten
years according to Micropal (offer-to-bid, with income reinvested). The
powerful UK equity market performance of the mid-1980s lies behind much of
this, while more recently holdings in Far Eastern equity markets and in
international bonds have kept the fund growing at a respectable, if more
sedate, rate.
Its asset allocation at the beginning of the year included a wide mix, with
79 per cent in equities - 19 per cent in the UK, 10 per cent in continental
Europe, 5 per cent in Japan, 27 per cent in the US and 18 per cent in the
Far East and in emerging markets. There is a 4 per cent UK cash holding, and
Gartmore also holds European, Japanese and American bonds.
This reflects the 'top-down' asset allocation which the company also uses
for its segregated pension funds. This dictates being overweight in emerging
markets, the UK and the US, and underweight in Japan and Europe.
Whittingdale Challenger, second over five years, could hardly present a
greatest contrast. It holds no equities at all, and is split between cash
and bonds. Roughly 70 per cent of the fund is in gilts (UK government
bonds), and the managers are in the process of reducing exposure to the
dollar and moving in to French francs and bonds. It went overweight in the
dollar last year, enabling it to log 22.42 per cent growth during 1992.
Whittingdale has built its reputation as a gilts manager, and does not
wander far into the equity markets. However, the fund, occasionally, has
held equities over the last few years.
Look to the third strongest performer, The Master Portfolio, managed by
Capel-Cure Myers, and yet another world asset allocation view emerges.
Capel-Cure has 52.5 per cent in UK equities, 15 per cent in Europe, 15 per
cent in the US, and 17.5 per cent in cash and bonds.
This diversity means that investors looking for a trust must also adopt a
different approach. Most managers try to make these trusts the potential
bedrock for a portfolio, which will handle clients' asset allocation for
them.
For example, the Master Portfolio is intended to mirror the portfolio which
would be established for an investor who came to an investment house with
Pounds 1m to invest, according to Kenneth Levy of Capel-Cure Myers. Its
minimum investment, of Pounds 50,000, is in line with this ambition.
Similarly, Whittingdale Challenger wants to be treated as a 'benchmark' for
other funds. So there might appear to be some sense in having a heavy
international balanced holding, to be complemented by smaller holdings when
they seem necessary. Interest has increased in recent years among managers,
with 18 funds launched in the last five years, so there is now choice.
But choosing a fund is difficult because they vary so widely. Anyone willing
to do some rudimentary asset allocation of their own - or with a portfolio
manager prepared to do it - can switch into sector funds managed by
companies with strong stock selection expertise in that area. Good asset
allocators may not have access to the best stock-pickers.
International balanced funds work better than funds of funds (which have
only managed 39.11 per cent growth over five years) at giving customers the
best of all worlds, and Gartmore's 10-year figure shows their potential
strengths in the long term.
But they look weak by comparison with the grand old ladies of the
international general investment trust sector. Over the same five-year
period when international balanced unit trusts rose 54.91 per cent, on
average, Law Debenture managed 166.8 per cent, Bankers 164.46 per cent,
Alliance 159.39 per cent, and Second Alliance 155.09 per cent. The average
for the sector was 119.11 per cent.
The erosion of investment trust discounts will have exaggerated these
figures, but they suggest the old dependables might provide a stronger
foundation for a portfolio. The international balanced sector has a place,
but only as an add-on to investment trusts.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Executor's entitlement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I am sole executor in a relation's will. I paid a lot of her bills out of my
own resources, some of these arising before I had power of attorney. I kept
a record of these as I had been looking after her affairs for some two
years. Clearly I wish to debit her estate with these before inheritance tax
is levied as they fell due before her death. The solicitor is implying that
I should have mentioned these before obtaining probate. Is it not enough to
give records in the corrective affidavit? They amount to nearly Pounds
2,000.
I note that you have paid bills on behalf of the estate and have now
obtained probate. It should be possible to obtain a corrective affidavit to
take the expenses into account when calculating inheritance tax and also
ensure that you can obtain a rebate.
If an executor advances money out of his own pocket to pay the debts of his
testator, he is entitled to be repaid in full, in priority to the creditors.
He is also entitled to an allowance of interest for the money so advanced.
Repayment will come from the estate and his liability must be allowed for in
calculating inheritance tax.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): My aunt's estate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When my aunt died many years ago she left her estate in trust to pay the
income to a friend for the remainder of her life and, on her death, equally
between her nephews and nieces. The will did not include a non-apportionment
clause.
The life tenant died on June 2 1992 and the trust investments were sold soon
after, including useful holdings in Guinness and Shell. Both these companies
had then just paid their 1991 final dividends, which were properly paid to
the life-tenant. However, the trust solicitors inform us that her estate is
entitled to a proportion of the future dividends for the year to December 31
1992, although the finals will not be declared or paid until nearly a year
after her death and will not actually be received because the holdings have
been sold.
We are told strict apportionment must be applied and that we could have
delayed the sales until after the dividends had been received, although this
would have meant waiting a year for any benefit to be received and taking a
chance on the state of the market 12 months hence. Is this right?
The trust's solicitors are correct. Section 2 of the Apportionment Act 1870
provides for apportionment on a daily basis of dividends.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): An unkind cut
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITHOUT any approach or warning whatsoever, my next door neighbour has
informed me by letter that branches from my tree have caused damage to his
garage roof and that he has had this repaired and cut my branches. He
informed me that he would be sending me the bill for this work which he
hoped I would pay promptly.
I replied denying responsibility, saying that I had noticed for many years a
tile missing from his garage roof, and that this had been caused by storm
and I refused to pay. I also mentioned it would have been neighbourly for
him to have spoken to me previously. Incidentally, the adjoining houses,
including my accusing neighbour's, all have roof tiles missing now or have
had replacements, because, I assume, of weather conditions.
My neighbour has now sent me an account for Pounds 55 showing replacement of
approximately seven tiles, securing six tiles and cutting my branches.
My gardener says the branches would not have lifted off roof tiles or
damaged them as they tend to grow away from the tiles. My neighbour also
asks me to cut back branches overhanging his property at another part of our
common boundary. What is your advice?
Your tree will have caused both a trespass and a nuisance to the extent that
branches have grown across the boundary with your neighbour. If your
neighbour can prove that the damage of which he complains was caused by
those branches, he is entitled to require you to pay for the repair. This is
ultimately a question of fact. Your neighbour can require you to cut
trespassing branches, and can cut them himself if he wishes; but he cannot
charge you with the cost.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Keeping it in the family has been the
key to success - Investment trusts / Philip Coggan considers Lowland
Investment Company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a distinct family air about the Lowland Investment Company, which
is managed by the Henderson Administration group.
The trust derived its name from the Henderson family's origins in the
lowlands of Scotland. Its largest investment is in the Henderson management
group (4.8 per cent of the portfolio as of September 30); and Lowland's
largest shareholder (with a 23 per cent stake) is Witan, another
Henderson-managed trust.
The current manager of the trust is James Henderson, a member of the
founding family, and eldest son of Lord Faringdon, chairman of Witan
Investment Trust. Henderson, 31, who studied economics at Pembroke college,
Cambridge, took over the trust management in mid-1990.
Lowland was founded in 1963 as a means of giving younger fund managers
within the Henderson group a trust to look after. Raymond Cazalet, the
current chairman, was the first manager to take the helm.
These familial links have brought success. Lowland produced the third best
share price performance of all investment trusts over the last ten years,
with a rise of 735 per cent*. Share price performance figures can be
distorted by the effect of discounts but the trust is also top of its sector
(UK income growth) in terms of net asset value growth over the same period.
The objective of the trust is to produce an above-average dividend, which
increases over time. James Henderson says his investment approach is to look
for companies which can produce income growth, rather than opting for the
ultra high yielders. He searches for companies with undervalued assets and
earnings and ends up with some of the duller stocks that have not been in
the headlines.
Compared with TR City of London (profiled last week) the trust has a much
greater concentration on the medium and smaller companies sectors. Only 40
per cent of Lowland's portfolio is in FT-SE 100 Index stocks, while 30 per
cent is in medium-sized companies and 30 per cent in smaller.
This concentration, says Henderson, has played a crucial part in the trust's
success over the last decade. 'We've had exposure to the medium and smaller
companies without being completely committed to them' he says.
The trust's ten largest stakes are: Henderson, British Gas, British Airways,
National Power, Prudential, Boots, GKN, Thames Water, Morgan Crucible and
AAH. In terms of sectors, the trust currently has a heavy weighting in
capital goods (29 per cent versus the All-Share weighting of 13 per cent).
The rest of the portfolio is split 20 per cent consumer, 19 per cent
financial and 32 per cent other groups.
Although the trust is in the UK income sector, around 9 per cent of the
portfolio is in Europe; but since getting income would be a problem if the
portfolio had too heavy an overseas exposure, the trust is unlikely to put
more than 25 per cent overseas.
The trust's short term performance has been slightly less impressive than
its 10 year record; as the graphs show, net asset value fell sharply in 1988
and 1990. Lowland has produced a slightly below average performance for its
sector over three and five years.
Currently the fund is taking a rather aggressive approach. It has a 15 per
cent gearing level, having borrowed Pounds 6m of debentures and bank
facilities of Pounds 4m (when a trust gears up, it hopes that equity returns
will more than make up for the cost of borrowing money). 'This is the
highest gearing we've had for a bit', says Henderson, 'over the last year,
we became increasingly confident that we could find value in the medium
term.'
Analyst Hamish Buchan of County NatWest says Lowland is a much smaller trust
than TR City and the shares are tightly held, with around 70 per cent of the
equity in Henderson or Cazenove-related hands. This restricts liquidity,
says Buchan but this is not too much of a problem for private investors.
Buchan says Lowland is 'a sound and solid security for the individual',
although he adds that the trust has been trading at a small premium to its
asset value.
Normally when investment trust shares go to a premium, investors start to
look for alternative funds which are at a discount. However, Lowland's
portfolio may benefit if the much awaited smaller company revival finally
occurs.
Key facts. The trust has net assets and a market capitalisation of around
Pounds 54m, as of January 21. The net asset value was 230.7p, almost equal
to the share price of 231p. The dividend yield is 4.9 per cent. The annual
management charge is 0.4 per cent.
Board. The board includes one Henderson employee, Richard Smith, who was the
manager of the trust until 1990, and is still the managing director. The
chairman is the first manager Raymond Cazalet, a former chairman of the
Association of Investment Trust Companies; other directors are John Morrell,
who is also a director of Law Debenture; John Kemp-Welch, a Cazenove
partner; and Peter Troughton, a director of W H Smith.
Savings scheme and Pep details.
The minimum monthly investment for both the savings scheme and the personal
equity plan is Pounds 100, with Pounds 2,000 for lump sums. There is a 1 per
cent fee on both purchases and sales and an annual fee of Pounds 20.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: CGT allowances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TABLE shows capital gains tax (CGT) allowances for assets sold in
December. To use it, multiply the original cost of the asset for the figure
shown for the month in which you bought it.
If you subtract the result from the proceeds of your sale, the result will
be your taxable gain or loss.
Suppose that you bought some shares for Pounds 8,000 in September 1983 and
sold them in December 1992 for Pounds 18,000. Multiplying the original cost
by the September 1983 figure of 1.618 gives a total of Pounds 12,944.
Subtracting that from the proceeds of Pounds 18,000 gives a capital gain of
Pounds 5,056, which is below the 1992-93 CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800. If
you realised no other gains during the year, the profits should be tax-free.
If you sell shares bought before April 6 1982, you should use the March 1982
figure. The RPI in December was 139.2.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The myth of 90-day accounts -
Scheherazade Daneshkhu on building society rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH RETURNS and convenience are usually the two most sought after
attributes of a bank or building society account.
Depositors are required to follow a few simple principles to obtain the
higher returns - the larger the amount of money deposited and the longer the
capital is left untouched, the greater the rewards.
Ninety-day accounts operate on this principle. The building society finds it
cheaper to administer accounts which do not have a large number of
transactions. In theory, they are able to pass this saving on to the
depositor in the form of higher rates.
The snag for many investors is that the higher returns come at the expense
of reduced accessibility to their money. Unless 90-days notice is given, the
saver suffers 90 days loss of interest.
This is not a problem if money is not needed in a hurry, but three months
can be a long time to plan ahead and foresee financial needs. And if a good
return becomes available, for example, in the form of a competitive
guaranteed product, it can be a big disadvantage to forego the 90-days
interest in order to be able to get funds out before the offer closes.
But is it even true that 90-day accounts pay the highest returns? The tables
show the highest rates currently available on 90-day, postal and
instant-access accounts, on amounts of Pounds 500, Pounds 1,000, Pounds
2,500 and Pounds 10,000.
A comparison of the rates on postal and 90-day accounts shows that 90-day
accounts do not always pay the highest rates. Birmingham Midshires matches
the 7.25 per cent gross rate paid by Scarborough's 90-day account on Pounds
500. The best of the 90-day rates are higher on Pounds 1,000 than the postal
accounts, but the postal accounts beat 90-day rates on amounts of Pounds
5,000, Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 25,000.
For example, the two highest 90-day rates on Pounds 10,000 are Halifax (7.75
per cent gross) and Alliance &amp; Leicester (7.60 per cent gross). Both rates
are beaten by postal account rates on not only the Pounds 10,000 tier but
also on Pounds 5,000. Skipton and North of England are paying 8.35 per cent
gross and 8.20 per cent gross on Pounds 5,000, while rates on Pounds 10,000
are 8.45 per cent gross at North of England and 8.3 per cent gross from
Northern Rock.
As postal accounts are administered centrally, costs are lower than for
accounts operated through a branch network. Low overheads and a smaller
staff allow competitive rates to be passed on to the depositor.
The accounts are advertised as instant-access, meaning that notice does not
have to be given for withdrawals, but they are not instant in terms of ready
accessibility to the cash.
With most postal accounts, it will normally take a week before you have the
funds. If you send off a withdrawal request on a Monday, the earliest you
could hope to receive a cheque is on Wednesday. It will then take at least
three working days for the cheque to clear, so usually you will not be able
to draw cash until the following Monday. However, it should be remembered
that most instant access branch accounts also require notification for large
withdrawals.
The tables show that rates on 90-day accounts are higher than those on
instant-access branch accounts. The rates are 1.25 percentage points higher
on all tiers, apart from Pounds 1,000, where the difference is fractionally

FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: How the wealthy take money from the
state
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ARBITRAGE, THE art of trading to take advantage of different prices in
different markets, is one of the oldest games played by financial
wheeler-dealers.
Now, the UK's Inland Revenue is falling victim to the same trick. The
Business Expansion Scheme, introduced as a tax incentive to encourage the
wealthy to risk investing in small enterprises, has become a device to help
banks and top-rate taxpayers to take slices of the state's money.
In the process, it has also converted a significant part of the UK's
damaging stock of repossessed housing into private rented accommodation.
This is good news for the homeless and for homeowners in houses where values
are dropping. But whether the government intended the windfall for top-rate
taxpayers to be so generous is another matter.
When the arbitrage scheme is finely tuned, it works as follows: an
institutional lender (usually a bank) finds itself with a large stock of
repossessed housing; dumping it on to the market at current values would
increase its loss.
Instead, the bank sets up a BES company which takes control of the property.
That company must then rent out the property under 'assured tenancy'
regulations for five years to qualify for BES reliefs. The bank covenants to
buy back the property at the end of five years, at a price only slightly in
excess of that paid.
Meanwhile, investors buy shares in the BES at Pounds 1 a time. Thanks to BES
tax relief, they receive 40p in tax relief, if they pay top-rate tax, so
they have effectively only invested 60p.
Six months later, the bank offers a loan against the BES shares of 72p for
every Pounds 1 share. That represents a substantial mark-up over six months
for someone who has only parted with 60p. The loan is on a 'non-recourse'
basis, so the BES shares themselves offer the only security which the banks
can use.
So investors can leave the investment, for a profit, after only six months.
Meanwhile, the banks have received Pounds 1 and paid out only 72p for it.
Both sides have thus profited handsomely from the relief.
Non-recourse schemes were first introduced in September last year and have
proved popular. Banks involved included Barclays, TSB, and Bank of Scotland.
The Inland Revenue, meanwhile, is allowing both banks and wealthy investors
to make some very easy money. Basic rate taxpayers, who effectively invest
75p per Pounds 1, cannot benefit from this trick.
For those not prepared to lock their money away for a long term, the
attractions of non-recourse schemes are undeniable. Most schemes launched so
far have been oversubscribed within a week, and many investors have put
money into the BES for the first time.
But this creates dangers. Bank-guaranteed non-recourse loan schemes
genuinely have a low level of risk. But many other schemes launched in the
next 12 months will not be so watertight. Others will be highly speculative.
Some schemes, mainly involving universities, offer a 'guaranteed' return
after five years. These returns will usually be greater than those on offer
after five years in schemes which offer a six-month loan, so they might be
preferable if the five-year term is not a problem. In many cases, these
schemes are guaranteed only by the universities themselves, so the credit
risk is greater than for a bank-backed scheme.
Other 'entrepreneurial' schemes make no guarantee, and simply aim to profit
as much as possible from any gain in the property market. They have
unlimited potential growth, but no safeguard against a continued decline.
Schemes launched this week demonstrate the differences: Flexit, sponsored by
Richard Ellis Venture Consultants, has exit arrangements backed by the Royal
Bank of Scotland. The loan available after six months is high, at 74p for
every Pounds 1, but the return after five years is only 105p. It will
purchase new homes for Fairclough Homes, a subsidiary of AMEC, and is not
involved in repossessions. The Ridings Companies, sponsored by Capital for
Companies, will buy new houses from the developers Tay Homes and Persimmon.
A non-recourse six-month loan of only 71p per Pounds 1 has been underwritten
by the Bank of Scotland, but 105p per share has been guaranteed at the end
of five years.
Pathfinder Repossessions II, backed by Johnson Fry, is returning to the
market. As its name implies it will buy repossessed property, in London.
However, it offers no guarantees. The aim is to make as much money as
possible, but this would be vulnerable to a weak property market, or to any
mistakes by managers.
Capital Prime Properties, also sponsored by Johnson Fry, is a hybrid. It is
offering loans at the rate of 60p per Pounds 1 invested after six months.
These loans are not repayable until the end of the five-year BES period, but
they are on a full recourse basis - if the property market does not recover,
you will have to pay more at the end of five years. If it does, you could
make a profit.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE INLAND Revenue, which is spending Pounds 2m on an advertising campaign
to encourage 10m people to reclaim Pounds 800m in overpaid tax, says the
main reason for the lack of claims is apathy. However, a Weekend FT reader
has a different explanation.
'It is not that people do not bother to reclaim tax overpaid, but unless my
own tax office is an exception to the norm, most people give up in despair,'
says Robert Anderson, of Sheriff Hutton, in Yorkshire.
Anderson was 65 years old in 1991. As his total income was below Pounds
13,500, he was entitled to the maximum age allowance. He could therefore
claim for a refund of tax for the year ending April 1992, and for a smaller
refund for 1991.
He completed a tax return and details of the amount he thought he had
overpaid for 1990-91 in January 1992. 'From then until the end of July, I
had continually to telephone and write to get some action,' he says. 'During
this time, I dealt with no fewer than eight different people in the same
section, each one of whom totally ignored any previous correspondence and
started again from scratch, and it was only when I finally demanded to speak
to the section head that I obtained any sense.'
He was told that his case could not be handled by one person because of
holidays, part-time workers and sickness absences.
'During all this time I must say I was treated with courtesy, and each
letter came with a profuse apology, for the last mistake on their part;
however it soon became obvious to me that the ordinary tax officer in most
cases didn't even know which form I should complete,' says Anderson.
This year, Anderson has worked out that he is due for a rebate of about
Pounds 150 but, 'I had decided that it was not worth the stress trying to
obtain it.'
However, he has just received a coding notice for 1993-94, which allocated
only the basic allowance to him, ignoring his married status and age
allowance.
'I am resolved to do battle again,' he says. 'The point I am trying to make
is, that the Pounds 2m the government is to spend on advertising would be
better spent in trying to educate the tax officers and improve the system.'

WH Smith, the retail and distribution group announces figures to the end of
November on Wednesday. Losses in Do It All, its do-it-yourself joint venture
with Boots, will drag profits lower, from Pounds 50.1m to about Pounds 45m
pre-tax, say analysts, including the pension credit Smith enjoys.
The January sales are critical for MFI Furniture Group, the kitchen and
bedroom retailer which floated last summer and which reports for the first
time in its new form on Thursday. Although last year's January sales were
strong, brokers think MFI could have beaten the numbers this year. As for
the interim figures, to November 7, brokers are in the dark without
comparable figures. Estimates are for a fall in operating profits from
Pounds 24.2m to around Pounds 18m to Pounds 20m.
Misys, the acquisitive computing services group led by a former Hanson
executive, Kevin Lomax, is due to report its interim results on Thursday.
Pre-tax profits are expected to increase to around Pounds 6.3m from Pounds
3.59m a year earlier. The group has made a spectacular recovery since its
disastrous 1990/1 financial year when its shares bottomed at 63p. They now
stand at 375p.
Unitech, the international electronics group, is still bearing the scars of
the slowdown in the Japanese economy. The company, which ranks as the
world's largest manufacturer of power supplies for electronic equipment, is
likely to report a decline in first half pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.1m from
Pounds 7.8m in the comparable period.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The pros and cons of Pibs issues -
Scheherazade Daneshkhu looks at a device used by building societies to raise
capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER base rates have caused many investors to see the attractions of
permanent interest bearing shares. Pibs are relatively new. The first issue
was launched in July 1991 by Leeds Permanent building society.
Pibs are not like ordinary shares which give investors a chunk of a
company's assets. They are instead a way for building societies to raise
capital and they form part of the loan structure of the society.
They are better compared with gilts than shares, but instead of being issued
by the government, they are issued by building societies. Like gilts, they
pay a fixed income and pay interest twice a year net of basic rate tax. They
are also exempt from capital gains tax.
Most gilts have a date on which the capital is repaid. But Pibs are
irredeemable, which means there is no repayment date. Investors can get
their capital back only by selling in the stock market and, like all stock
market investments, the price will fluctuate.
It is also worth bearing in mind that they are deeply subordinated. This
means that if the building society were to collapse, investors with Pibs
would be behind all other lenders, depositors and shareholders for
repayment. In addition, there is no compensation scheme to protect
investors.
Since the Pibs market is self-contained and small, Paul Killik of
London-based brokers, Killik &amp; Co, warns that, 'failure by one building
society in the Pibs market could do enormous damage to the others'.
Moreover the building society is under no obligation to maintain interest
payments. Nor does it have to pay skipped interest payments at a later date.
'People think that because Pibs are issued by building societies, they
cannot lose money. This is patently wrong,' said David Nugent of Pilling &amp;
Co, Manchester-based stockbrokers.
However, so long as investors understand that what they are buying is
similar to an irredeemable preference share rather than a fixed interest
building society bond, Pibs can be useful.
Their main attraction lies in the fixed yields which are substantially
higher than current variable rates of interest. The table shows yields and
prices of Pibs at mid-day Thursday.
The after-tax income that an investor receives is in the range of 8 to 9 per
cent, compared with variable rates of about 4.5 per cent net in an instant
access building society account. Non-taxpayers can reclaim the tax owed to
them.
As with government stocks, the yields and prices of Pibs have an inverse
relationship to each other. As prices rise, the yield falls and vice versa.
But once the Pibs are bought, the yield to the investor will remain fixed
forever, unless disaster befalls the building society.
The table shows that prices of Pibs have been rising since they were issued,
so people wishing to buy now get a lower, but still high, yield. Some of the
issues were aimed at the institutional market and will be beyond the reach
of most investors. But the minimum investment in many others, such as those
launched by Britannia and Bristol &amp; West, is Pounds 1,000.
So, who should buy Pibs? Johnson Fry, which runs a portfolio investing in 10
Pibs, says that 'A lot of elderly people, who do not care too much about
their capital, buy them to fix their income.' Killik believes that they have
a place in a fixed interest portfolio, but not on their own. He suggests
combining them with gilts and other preference securities.
There are several ways of buying Pibs. One is to purchase them through a
stockbroker. Pilling, for example, charges 1 per cent commission on the
first Pounds 10,000 and 0.5 per cent thereafter, while charges at Killik are
1.2 per cent on the first Pounds 10,000 and 0.4 per cent after that.
Pilling's Nugent believes that Pibs are attractive at the moment, but their
price could fall from September or October if inflation rises. Fixed
interest investments become less attractive when inflation is on the way up.
London-based broker, Dunbar Boyle &amp; Kingsley has put together five Pibs  -
Bristol &amp; West, Coventry, Leeds &amp; Holbeck, Newcastle and North of England -
with a National Westminster irredeemable preference share, to produce income
which is paid out 12 times a year.
The minimum investment is Pounds 14,000. There is an initial charge of 2 per
cent but no annual management fee. The portfolio currently pays an income of
about 8.3 per cent net per annum.
Johnson Fry's Pibs portfolio is based on a similar concept. It packages 10
Pibs to produce quarterly income. The initial fee is 4 per cent but there
are no other charges until the fifth year, when there is a quarterly
administration fee of Pounds 20 plus VAT. The minimum investment is Pounds
20,000 and the portfolio is currently paying net interest of about 8 per
cent.
Those who like the idea of Pibs but are worried about risks to their capital
may be interested in a fund launched last November by Exeter Fund Managers.
Exeter Balanced has a weighting of about 70 per cent in Pibs, with
investment trust zero dividend shares making up the balance.
The idea is that Pibs provide the high yield while zeros (which do not pay
income) provide capital growth for the fund. The yield for investors is
therefore much lower than on Pibs held as a single investment; it is
currently 4.7 per cent net. The minimum investment is Pounds 750 and there
is an initial 5.25 per cent charge with an annual management fee of 1 per
cent.
Since the Pibs form part of a unit trust, investors are protected by the
Investors Compensation Scheme. The fund is however, liable for capital gains
tax, but losses are allowable for CGT purposes.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: More bonus cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO MORE life offices have announced reduced with-profits pay-outs for 1993.
But they have cut bonuses in different ways.
Following Norwich Union, many companies have opted to cut reversionary
bonuses, which are declared annually and cannot be taken away from the value
of the policy if it runs to maturity. This is to reflect lower anticipated
investment returns and to strengthen reserves. Lower annual bonuses relieve
pressure on reserves.
Pay-outs at the end of 10-year policies have been dropping significantly.
Royal Life has opted to cut its reversionary bonus by 0.5 percentage points
to 3.25 per cent. Its terminal bonus, added only at the end of the policy to
reflect more recent performance, has been left broadly unchanged. Ten-year
pay-outs have dropped by 8.9 per cent, while 25-year maturities, assuming
the policy was taken out by a 29-year-old man paying Pounds 30 per month,
rose 1.1 per cent to Pounds 55,632.
Scottish Provident maintained its reversionary bonus on conventional
business, but growth rates for unitised with-profits life and pensions funds
dropped from 9.25 per cent to 8.5 per cent, and from 11.0 per cent to 10.0
per cent respectively. Terminal bonuses have also been reduced. Ten-year
endowment pay-outs, using the same assumptions, fall by 4.0 per cent from
Pounds 7,129 to Pounds 6,844, while 25-year pay-outs fall 1.7 per cent to
Pounds 56,409.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Guaranteed products start to multiply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS FINANCIAL companies try to persuade cautious investors to leave their
traditional safe haven in the building society, guaranteed products are
evolving at breakneck speed.
The latest version from Citibank Life is a complex product which aims to
counter some of the flaws in other guaranteed products - inflexibility and
the lack of an income facility.
The 'Stockmarket Bonus Bond' has strong similarities to Hypo Foreign &amp;
Colonial's Protected Capital Plus, which was launched last summer.
The guarantee occurs on a quarterly basis. If the FT-SE 100 Index rises over
three months, investors receive part of the gain; if the index falls, their
capital remains intact. Once a gain is locked in, it cannot be lost. The
cumulative effect of these guarantees is to reduce the impact of stock
market volatility sharply .
But the investor does not receive all the rise of the Footsie, nor the yield
on shares in the index. The proportion of Footsie's gain will vary from
quarter to quarter; Citibank indicates a range of 45 per cent to 94 per
cent. For the forthcoming quarter, the proportion will be a net 52.5 per
cent (60 per cent for pension products).
To add to the complications, one must then take account of the charges
(which are 5 per cent initial and 1 per cent annual) and the bonus
allocations. Investors will receive extra allocations for investing early
(2.2 per cent before February 10, falling to 0.5 per cent before March 24),
or for investing more than Pounds 10,000.
So it is rather difficult to estimate exactly how well an investor will do.
Citibank has found that over the past five years, an investment of Pounds
30,000 would have grown into Pounds 47,492 net of all charges and tax - but
smaller investments will not have done as well because of lower allocation
rates.
All returns are paid net of tax which cannot be reclaimed, but basic rate
taxpayers will face no further charge. Higher rate taxpayers will face a
further liability, but can take advantage of top slicing relief, which
allows the investor to divide the gain made on the bond by the number of
years it has been held.
The income facility allows investors to make regular withdrawals, for a
minimum of Pounds 50, or irregular withdrawals, with a minimum of Pounds
250. If the market does not rise in a particular quarter, these withdrawals
will cause the investor's capital to drop.
The product is technically an insurance bond, so investors can withdraw 5
per cent of their capital a year with no immediate tax liability (there may
be a tax charge on final encashment).
Flexibility is an important aspect of the bond; the product rolls on
indefinitely, and the investor can withdraw money at any time, although it
is a long- term investment.
Investors could be forgiven for being bemused by the product's complexity.
It is hard to predict how it will work in practice. It seems, likely,
however, that a top-rate taxpayer would still be better off buying a
low-charging index fund, such as Gartmore's; this carries no guarantee but
there is little point in buying any equity-based product unless you think
the market will rise.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE sharp increase in boardroom activity this week has been dominated by
directors' sales. With the FT-SE 100 Index pausing for breath, directors
have taken advantage of share prices often standing at record levels.
Faber Prest's mixture of specialist services has proved an effective
defensive combination. The share price, refecting the improving profit
figures, has risen from 130p in May 1991 to the current level of 380p.
Chairman Richard Prest has sold 155,000 shares at 377p. He remains the
largest shareholder on the board.
Dalepak Foods had a mixed year so far as share price performance is
concerned. Interim profits were marginally lower than last year and the
chairman's statement suggested thefinal year outcome would be broadly
similar. The interim announcement was accompanied by details of sales by
four directors, including Christopher Ivory, chief executive. In total, they
sold 100,000 shares at 315p, but each of the directors is left with a
residual holding greater than 100,000 shares.
Property shares have enjoyed a good run since Black Wednesday but Peter
Levy, chairman of Shaftesbury, has not been deterred; he bought 105,000
shares at 47p. At the same time Neil Benson, a non-executive director bought
20,000 shares, also at 47p.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The lesson of hindsight, the best buys
of 1988 - Philip Coggan on the most successful investments of the past five
years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ECONOMIC news may have been gloomy for some time, but investors have
actually enjoyed quite good returns over the past five years. Interest rates
have been high for much of the period, but equity-based products have also
shown decent profits despite the impact of adverse factors such as the UK
recession and the Gulf War.
The table shows that most commonly-held investments have managed to beat
inflation and that a significant number of products have produced nominal
returns of more than 50 per cent. It also may tell you what you should have
invested in five years ago.
Tax efficiency helps - which is why, looking at the average figures,
friendly society bonds and managed pension funds are top of the list.
The snag is that, though the percentage returns are high, it would have been
hard to become rich out of a friendly society investment. The maximum
monthly contribution into a friendly society in 1988 was Pounds 9 a month.
Also, friendly society rules would stop you from realising an investment for
another five years - you would only get back your premiums if you
surrendered early.
Pension funds also have strong tax advantages and the average figures look
good. However, those who are about to retire may find that the recent falls
in annuity rates offset their profits. Just because they have a bigger
pension fund, they will not necessarily get a bigger pension than they would
have a year ago.
Elsewhere, what will strike many savers is that it was possible to get a
very good return at minimal risk. Index-linked National Savings offered a
healthy 63 per cent return and allowed the investor to sleep at night
without any worries about safety. Indeed for top rate taxpayers,
index-linked look even better in comparison; since several other of the
investments listed reflect the impact of basic rate tax only.
Building society returns were not too far behind index-linked National
Savings (at least for larger depositors) and were marginally ahead of unit
trusts. The Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester returns are net of basic rate tax and
assume the investor switched from the Gold account to the London deposit
account at the right time.
In January 1988, the Crash of October 1987 was very fresh in investor's
minds. Few investors will have been venturing into equities at that time.
Those who did take the plunge will have done moderately well, but not
extraordinarily so.
We have included the stock market indices purely as a guide. They reflect
capital gains only, and do not include the yield. On the other hand, they do
not allow for any costs and what with bid-offer spreads, brokers'
commissions and stamp duty, the factors probably balance out. It is likely
that many private investors will have struggled to beat the returns from the
FT-SE 100 index or the All-Share.
Of the main markets, the best place to have picked in January 1988 was the
US. The Dow Jones index more than doubled, in sterling terms, over the past
five years, with more than a bit of help from the pound's decline against
the dollar. The best way for a UK investor to take advantage was via a North
American investment trust (up an average 174.3 per cent over five years) or
a unit trust (up 117.5 per cent).
Most UK investors, however, stay close to home, and the average returns for
all trusts are less impressive. Investment trusts look better than unit
trusts in the table but savers should be aware of two important factors. The
first is that investment trust returns are shown on mid-market to mid-market
basis (with net income reinvested) and do not reflect the full bid-offer
spread or brokers' commission. The unit trust figures (offer-to-bid with net
income reinvested) take all charges into account.
The second factor is that the share price performance of many investment
trusts will have benefited from a narrowing of the discount over the
five-year period. With some trusts now standing at a premium to net assets,
this factor is unlikely to recur - and may well work against investment
trusts over the next five years, if the discount starts to widen.
Of course, averages are all very well. The actual returns from investing in
a unit or investment trust varied very widely from a gain of 306.5 per cent
(from investing in the best unit trust - F&amp;C US Smaller Companies) to a loss
of 98.5 per cent (from the worst investment trust - Gresham House).
Unit trust sector averages are shown as the easiest way of indicating fixed
interest returns - and reveal that, because of the pound's decline, the
biggest profits were achieved overseas.
Finally, a word about single premium bonds. The average managed fund lagged
behind the average unit trust; even though the bonds are measured on an
offer-to-offer basis, giving them an advantage.
Although past performance is useful information, the chances are high, of
course, that the comparative returns over the next five years will be
completely different.
Figures were taken from Micropal and Finstat, except for the indices (from
Datastream) or the building society and National Savings figures (provided
by institutions concerned).

FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Don't panic on executive pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME life companies think they have found a new way to sell executive
pension plans.
The Inland Revenue has announced that the rules governing contributions to
EPPs - available only to company directors and high-ranking executives - may
be too generous. It is considering tightening them.
Several companies have used this as an excuse to push executives and
companies towards taking out the schemes. They are acting prematurely. The
Inland Revenue this week made it clear that no decisions had been reached;
it is not yet clear that any change will be made. There is certainly no
timescale.
The Association of British Insurers (ABI), which is in confidential talks
with the Revenue on behalf of the pensions industry, has taken a similar
attitude. A spokesman said: 'It is quite clear that nothing has been
decided. If anyone is putting about that things have been decided, then
that's wrong.' Neither side denies that discussions are taking place,
prompted by the Revenue's desire to tighten the rules.
The Revenue has been stirred into action by the high benefits that
executives are able to earn: pension contributions can be set as a level
amount rather than a proportion of current salary, allowing young executives
to put away huge proportions of their income. This was allowed because it
was assumed executive salaries would rise significantly before retirement.
Under the current rules, a 30-year old starting an executive scheme can make
contributions equal to 110 per cent of salary. This could be cut to 35 per
cent. Individuals can also walk away from the schemes, taking their entire
fund value with them. If they retire early or if the scheme is wound up,
directors can take excessive benefits in retirement.
So the Revenue's disquiet is understandable. If, as seems likely, the
regulations are tightened, it could pay directors and companies to set up
schemes with high contributions sooner rather than later.
It is still unclear, however, what the new regulations would be. They could
even be retrospective, making action now pointless.
Regrettably, this has not prevented some life offices from using the change
as a chance to sell. For example, advisers Chamberlain De Broe received a
mailshot from NPI headed: 'For You: A New Sales Opportunity.'
It goes on: 'As you know, the Inland Revenue is soon to impose dramatic new
changes which will affect the method of funding for Executive Pension Plans
and possibly Small Self-Administered Schemes too.'
Mark Bolland, of Chamberlain De Broe, said: 'We are getting tired of
watching the industry deservedly earning its poor reputation by pushing
something which a) might not be appropriate and b) might anyway be vitiated
by the Revenue rules.'
In a gloomy economic climate, committing yourself at the age of 30 to
regular payments of more than you are earning could be dangerous. Companies
are also advocating that people start regular premium contracts to establish
an arrangement before the Inland Revenue can change the rules.
However, an inflexible contract that calls for regular premiums, at a rate
which is in excess of your current salary, could soon impose an unwieldy
strain. And Bolland notes that it is needlessly expensive. For a man earning
Pounds 35,000, the maximum contribution could be Pounds 50,000, he says,
generating a commission, if on a regular premium basis, of about Pounds
26,000 in the first year.
Insurance companies could charge for a regular contract on a single premium,
rather than a regular premium, basis. This would work out much cheaper for
the investor.
Bolland admits that the schemes can be very tax-efficient, but only at the
expense of flexibility. He says: 'There are, no doubt, many companies that
set up this type of scheme on high contributions in good times, before the
recession, and have since found that cash flow has prohibited those levels
of payments from being maintained. The bottom line is a profoundly
detrimental penalty system.'
Making contributions on a single premium basis, for younger directors, or,
for those nearing retirement, a regular premium contract on a single premium
basis, are sensible actions for those worried about the change in the
pipeline.
If any brokers or salesmen try a more robust approach, remember that the
Revenue is still not committed to doing anything at all, and that the ABI
has said no decisions have been made and rebuked members for using the moves
as a sales pitch.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Markets: The money engine begins to lose power - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS WALL Street's earnings engine, which has been firing on all cylinders for
the best part of the last two years, running out of fuel?
After a record-breaking 1991, and an even better start to 1992, growth in
broking- house earnings appears to have slowed in the final quarter of last
year, judging by some of this week's results.
PaineWebber, the fourth biggest brokerage firm in the US, and Bear Stearns,
another prominent Wall Street operator, reported earnings that told the same
story. Revenues from stockbroking commissions were strong in the
October-to-December period, but sizeable declines in revenues from
investment banking, and smaller falls in proprietary securities trading
earnings, meant that total profits for the quarter were lower than in the
same period of 1991.
Although the disappointing final quarter did not completely take the shine
off what was a remarkable 1992 for both firms, PaineWebber was sufficiently
concerned about the outlook for this year to announce that it had begun a
hiring freeze among administrators and support staff in an attempt to
restrain costs.
In both companies, the fall in investment banking earnings was primarily the
result of a slowdown at the end of last year in the hectic pace at which new
equities and bonds have been issued. Extremely strong corporate demand for
underwriting services has been one of the key elements of Wall Street's
two-year boom, so any sign that this demand my be waning is a cause for
concern.
Investors, however, are being warned not to turn away from brokerage stocks
just yet. If the first three weeks of 1993 are anything to go by, Wall
Street's investment bankers are as busy today as they have ever been.
Keen to take advantage of a strong bond market, which has pushed interest
rates to new lows, companies have been issuing debt in record numbers this
year. As of January 21, companies had sold Dollars 28.3bn of bonds, making
it highly likely that the old monthly record of Dollars 36.8bn, set in
January of last year, will soon be eclipsed.
The rate of new issuance shows no sign of slowing down. On Thursday alone,
Dean Witter, Discover &amp; Co, the securities broking and credit card operation
soon to be sold by retailing giant Sears, Roebuck, announced it intends to
sell Dollars 3bn of its debt securities. UAL, parent of United Airlines,
filed plans to raise Dollars 1.5bn through the sale of a variety of
fixed-income and equity securities.
The fall in underwriting business in the fourth quarter of 1992, therefore,
may turn out to have been a brief interruption of an upward trend.
Elsewhere in the financials sector, bank stocks were cheered this week by
further evidence that the recovery in the US banking industry is now fully
underway.
Citicorp, which came to symbolise the problems of the banking sector, led
the way with a profitable final quarter, which helped the group return to
the black in 1992 after big losses the previous year. Expense reductions
have played a vital part in Citicorp's revival, a point that was mirrored at
other banks, such as Chase Manhattan and Chemical Banking, which unveiled
strong fourth quarter earnings achieved in part because of effective cost
cutting and restructuring measures.
Perhaps the clearest sign that the worst is over for the banking industry,
however, came not from the big New York money centres, but from their
counterparts on the Pacific coast.
BankAmerica, which recently completed its merger with fellow San Francisco
bank Security Pacific, was reported to be close to reaching an agreement to
sell as much as Dollars 2bn in bad property loans to Morgan Stanley Realty
Fund. Analysts said the transaction indicated that capital is finally
returning to the beleaguered California property market, which bodes well
for those west-coast banks which have struggled in recent years under the
weight of soured commercial property loans.
A few days later, shares in another California bank, Wells Fargo, took off
after the group reported that its annual earnings had improved more than
tenfold to Dollars 283m. Investors rushed to buy the stock on the news,
sending it soaring Dollars 13 to Dollars 99.
This week also included a stark warning to anyone who invests heavily in
high-flying biotechnology stocks. The market capitalisation of Centocor
plummeted more than 60 per cent in just one day after the company announced
it was halting testing of its Centoxin drug, which is used in the treatment
of an often-fatal condition called septic shock, because an unexpectedly

FT  23 JAN 93 / Markets: Shareholders suffer from dirty tricks - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO FAR, it seems to be shareholders rather than airline executives who have
paid the price for British Airways' shoddy behaviour towards Richard
Branson's Virgin Atlantic.
On Thursday, the BA board exonerated its own members; it remains to be seen
whether less senior members of the airline's staff face disciplinary action.
Shareholders' punishment has been swifter. Since late December, when rumours
of a settlement in the case with Virgin first began to circulate, British
Airways has under-performed the FT-Actuaries All-Share index by 13 per cent.
Perhaps more revealing is a comparison with three publicly traded European
airlines, KLM, Swissair and Lufthansa. During 1992, British Airways
outperformed all of them by more than 100 per cent; since late December, it
has done worse than all of them, underperforming Swissair and and Lufthansa
by over 20 per cent.
Had BA shares moved in line with the rest of the UK market since late
December, they would today be selling at something like 306p, compared with
the closing price of 265p on Thursday, just before the board released its
statement of self-exculpation. If that figure is a guide to the damage
caused by the scandal, it means that shareholders, collectively, are worse
off by around Pounds 300m - a figure that dwarfs the Pounds 2m or so paid to
Branson in costs and settlement.
On Friday, as institutional investors digested the fact that BA did not plan
to follow their advice to keep separate the roles of chairman and chief
executive, the share price rose 4 1/2 p on the week, closing at 275p.
The BA board might be forgiven for feeling that this particular piece of
advice has a one-size-fits-all quality. Whenever there is a set-back at a
company, regardless of its cause, institutional investors call for a
separation of powers.
This week, their advice prevailed in the case of Barclays. Andrew Buxton,
who this month became chairman as well as chief executive, sent a letter to
the bank's senior managers. 'I have taken notice of what our shareholders
think,' he wrote, 'and I will be taking steps to split the
responsibilities.' The move will happen 'at a time of our choosing', thought
to be later this year.
As if to reward him, Barclays shares rose 39p during the week, closing at
413p. The rise probably stems, however, from a growing belief among analysts
that Barclays' dividend is safe. That view was clinched, for Terry Smith of
the stockbrokers Collins Stewart, by some of the small print in Andrew
Buxton's letter. This year, said the chairman, would be one for recovery
rather than prosperity. 'I am completely confident, however, that we will
recover well,' and there would be good profits in the future. 'We have a
strong capital base that is amply sufficient to absorb the problems we have
suffered.'
Short of desperation, companies do not usually trim dividends if earnings
recovery can be expected in the foreseeable future. If the Barclays board
takes that approach, the wording of the letter is the strongest evidence yet
for the view that the dividend is safe.
The letter summed up another theme of the week. 'Even the most optimistic
economic forecasters are now predicting only a slow and difficult climb out
of the current world-wide recession,' wrote Buxton. As if on cue, poor
economic statistics were released.
On Wednesday, retail sales for December fell disappointingly short of
expectations fuelled by all those reports of last-minute pre and
post-Christmas buying. On Thursday, a fresh batch of gloomy figures
appeared. Unemployment, seasonally adjusted, rose by 60,800 in the month to
December, nearly twice as fast as City economists had expected. Industrial
production figures for November showed a 0.5 per cent drop in manufacturing
output, to a level 0.2 per cent lower than a year before.
The markets, which had already been toying with the expectation of an early
cut in interest rates, took the numbers as further pressure on the
government to act. The futures market's short sterling contract closed the
week at a level implying base rates of 6 1/2 per cent or less by March, down
from their current 7 per cent.
Sterling weakened sharply on Thursday, and closed the week at DM 2.44, down
6 1/4 pfennigs from the previous Friday. Equities, which had fallen on
Monday and Tuesday, recovered strongly as the market absorbed the economic
statistics, and the FT-SE 100 index closed the week at 2781.2 up 16.1p.
Shorter- and medium-term gilts followed the same pattern, influenced by
base-rate expectations. Long-term gilts, more influenced by Tuesday's
announcement that there had been a sharp rise in public-sector borrowing in
December, moved the other way, however.
The economists at Goldman Sachs, previously rather bullish on the outlook
for gilts, announced themselves more pessimistic, partly as a result of a
study of the way budget deficits affect bond yields.
Although it is hard to detect a strong relationship between the two in the
chart above, Goldman Sachs's Jeremy Hale calculates that 'a 1 per cent
increase in the budget deficit as a percentage of gdp will tend to increase
gilt yields by 0.33 per cent . . .'
The Goldman economists forecast public sector borrowing to rise by just over
2 percentage points of gdp by the 1993-4 financial year. That means, they
say, that after adjusting for a few offsetting factors, the equilibrium
yield on 10-year gilts this year should be between 9 and 9.3 per cent,
compared with just under 8 1/2 per cent today. Using this method, they add,
'the gilt market currently appears as one of the least attractive of the
world's government bond markets.' A chilly welcome, you might think, for
Eddie George, the new governor of the Bank of England.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Markets: Retailers miss that festive fun - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FESTIVE season for retailers lasted little longer than the traditional
12 days of Christmas, if this week's official sales figures are anything to
go by, but that does not mean investors should abandon the sector.
The prospect of chancellor Norman Lamont's hoped-for consumer-led recovery -
from which retailers, naturally, would be the first to benefit - still seems
distant. Most retailers believe consumers will not start spending any extra
money they have acquired as a result of lower interest rates until they can
be more certain of keeping their jobs, and the value of homes stops falling.
There is further anxiety about the possibility of an increase in VAT or
national insurance contributions in the Budget in March. Recovery could also
be slowed by an increase in retail prices, which many retailers are warning
is imminent. They say they can no longer afford to carry the increased cost
of imports after sterling's devaluation.
But while the sector is likely to continue to underperform the stock market
by between 12 and 20 per cent, it is unlikely to collapse. The earnings
quality of some of the heavyweight stocks tends to support the sector at the
bottom of this range.
For the cautious, stocks such as Marks and Spencer and Great Universal
Stores offer the prospect of safe, steady growth. Some would include
Kingfisher, W H Smith and Boots in this category.
However, analysts say there are other shares which could show greater growth
potential, even if the economy does not recover, or picks up only slowly.
Investors prepared to take some risks might decide to take profits on stocks
like M and S and GUS and invest in some with more exciting prospects.
The stock widely seen as the hottest in the sector is Storehouse, owner of
the BhS and Mothercare chains.
'Storehouse has a momentum all of its own in terms of recovery,' says Kimlan
Cook, stores analyst at County NatWest.
She adds that the new management, led by the American David Dworkin, has
sorted out Storehouse's balance sheet, disposing of the Habitat and Richards
chains, and begun to transform the company into a clearly-focused retailer.
Moreover, Dworkin's reform process has just started in BhS, and could unlock
huge untapped potential in Mothercare.
Feelings are more mixed about Burton, the fashion retailing group, which is
also being shaken up by new management. Some believe this is another stock
that could blossom whether or not the economy improves - although over a
longer period than at Storehouse.
John Hoerner, chief executive, this month announced the loss of 2,000
full-time jobs but the creation of up to 3,000 part-time ones, in a
wide-ranging rationalisation and cost-cutting programme. Observers are
divided about whether even the experienced and tough-talking Hoerner can
turn around a company with 10 different trading formats - some of which are
looking distinctly tired. But with about Pounds 2bn turnover and among the
lowest margins in the sector, the scope for growth is huge.
Other interesting prospects are offered by the 'quality cyclicals', well-run
companies whose fortunes tend to mirror very closely the general state of
the economy.
MFI, as a furniture retailer and maker, is heavily dependent on a pick-up in
the housing market. But with the highest operating margins in the sector,
about 60 per cent, any signs of such a pick-up will have a sharp impact on
its profits.
Argos, essentially a consumer durables retailer, also stands to gain
strongly from any recovery in spending. Analysts say it is a well-managed
company - one of the retailers best- equipped to prosper.
Dixons, the UK's largest electrical retailer, continues to trade well in the
UK. White goods could see a big upturn if the housing market improves.
Concern over continuing losses at its Silo chain in the US deters some
analysts from recommending it.
In the meantime, retailers will continue to pray for that recovery, and that
next year's Christmas lasts longer than the last. There are, after all, only
280 shopping days to go.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Markets: The fundamental approach to shares - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE are difficult times for savers. Interest rates have fallen across the
board, and many will be looking for an alternative to building societies.
Gilts are one option, since many issues offer a higher yield than is
available from cash. However, shorter dated issues offer yields of only six
to seven per cent; and many medium-dated issues are trading above par, which
means that investors are locking themselves in to a capital loss.
Investors might also be cautious about buying gilts at a time when the
government is being forced to issue so many of them to cover a large, and
growing, budget deficit.
What about equities? Many savers will have memories of buying at the top of
the market in 1987 and will be cautious about repeating the same mistake,
particularly as the FT-SE 100 Index reached an all-time high on January 4.
So, it is worth a look at the fundamental ratios to see what they tell us.
First the good news. Although both the Footsie and the FT-A All-Share have
recently reached all-time nominal highs, they have not done so in real
(adjusted for inflation) terms. On that basis, the All-Share is still below
its levels in 1987 and 1989 and indeed, those achieved in the late 1960s and
early 1970s.
Secondly, the yield ratio still makes shares look relatively attractive.
This measures the relationship of gilt and equity yields - when the ratio is
high, gilts are offering considerably greater returns than shares, and this
often indicates that share prices are too high. When the ratio is low,
shares may be cheap.
Experts argue about the usefulness of the ratio, but two recent examples
illustrate its merits. According to Datastream, the ratio reached its low of
1.73 (for the period 1976-93) on July 27 last year. Since then, shares have
risen by almost 20 per cent. The ratio's high for the same period was 3.46,
achieved two weeks before Black Monday's share price crash. At the moment,
the ratio is around 2, well below the 1976-93 average of 2.3.
If one compares the returns on equities and cash, shares also look
relatively attractive. Again one can argue about the significance of this
ratio, but if one uses three-month Libor to illustrate cash returns, this
ratio reached its peak (for the period 1976-93) at the start of 1990. As
theory would expect, 1990 proved a very good year to be in cash and a very
bad year to invest in shares.
The current ratio is 1.56, well below the 1976-93 average of 2.35. In
practice, this means it is now possible for top-rate taxpayers in the right
pep to achieve a higher net return than they could achieve at most building
societies.
BUT now the bad news. The price-earnings ratio measures the relationship of
share prices to corporate profits; the higher the ratio, the more expensive
(in theory) share prices are. The ratio reached its 1976-93 peak (21 on the
FT-A 500 Index) in the summer of 1987.
The p/e on the FT-A 500 is now 17.3, well above the 1976-93 average of 11.2.
On that basis, share prices are expensive, not cheap. Bulls would argue that
the UK is coming out of a recession and that profits will soon rise sharply.
The historical p/e is thus irrelevant; it is future earnings that matter.
However, the UK was also coming out of a recession in the early 1980s; and
historic p/es were much lower then than they are now.
The dividend yield on the All-Share has proved quite a good guide to the
attractions of shares over the years. On the plus side, it is currently
higher than inflation (a rare occurrence over the last 25 years); on the
negative side, at 4.4 per cent, it is lower than the historical average of
five per cent, which has proved a good benchmark through high inflation eras
and low.
So, what is the message of all these statistics? One certainly cannot say
'shares are cheap; fill your boots'. But history has taught Britons that it
is unwise to ignore shares altogether. So the first choices for those who
want to buy equities should be low-cost unit or investment trust savings
schemes (to smooth out the highs and lows); or one of the many types of
guaranteed products on the market. The latter can be complicated so read the
small print.
I have had considerable response to my article two weeks ago about Michael
O'Higgins's stockpicking theory. Let me stress that this is no 'magic' route
to profits (no such thing could ever exist); and that, as one reader
correctly pointed out, a portfolio of just five stocks must inherently
involve more risk.
Just to restate the theory; it involves taking the 10 highest-yielding
stocks in the index and, of those, selecting the five with the lowest share
prices. The process needs to be repeated once a year, with old stocks
discarded.
The FT-30 index which I used to provide a British counterpart to the Dow is
less frequently updated than it used to be. A reader with a good database
might want to test the theory using the FT-SE 100 Index since launch.
The current constituents of the FT-30 are: Allied Lyons, Asda, BICC, BOC,
BTR, Blue Circle, Boots, British Airways, British Gas, BP, BT, Cadbury
Schweppes, Courtaulds, Forte, GEC, Glaxo, GrandMet, GKN, Guinness, Hanson,
ICI, Lucas, Marks and Spencer, NatWest, P&amp;O, Reuters, Royal Insurance,
SmithKline Beecham, Tate &amp; Lyle and Thorn EMI.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The FT Quarterly Review - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A new tax year starts in just over nine weeks, heralding the risk that the
government may increase direct taxation or reduce the scope of tax shelters.
It is therefore time for savers and investors to take advantage of
tax-efficient vehicles still available, and to check that their finances are
structured in the most tax-efficient way. The winter issue of the FT
Quarterly Review of Personal Finance, to be published with next Friday's
paper and repeated with Saturday's, in the UK only, offers a checklist of
things to do with April 5 in mind. The review also includes a survey on
Personal Equity Plans.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Fall in savings schemes - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investment trust savings schemes last year showed their first annual fall
since the schemes began in 1984. The total amounted invested through savings
schemes for the year was Pounds 115.5m, down from Pounds 119.5m for 1991.
The Association of Investment Trust Companies attributed the fall in the
year to poor stock market performance and lack of investor confidence
because of the weak economy.
However, the final intake of Pounds 33.49m last quarter was strong. Lump sum
investments accounted for most of this rise, totalling Pounds 21.72m, an
increase of 87 per cent on the third quarter.

strikes against Iraq - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil prices shrugged off the air strikes against Iraq. Two years ago, the
aftermath of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait pushed oil prices to their highest in
years but this time there was little effect on the market.
North Sea Brent crude for March delivery increased by about 30 cents a
barrel on January 13, the day of the air strikes but ended the day unchanged
at Dollars 17.10 a barrel. The lack of activity underlines the weakness of
the market. Prices have been depressed because of overproduction by Opec,
with Brent crude falling by Dollars 1 a barrel since the beginning of the
year.

FT  23 JAN 93 / God at the end of a telescope: Has the Roman Catholic Church
at last been converted to science?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'It seems that not one of the natural phenomena which sense experience
reveals to us or which are proved to us by the necessary demonstration can
be held in any doubt whatsoever, or rejected, because of some passages in
the Scriptures which in their literal wording seem to be at variance with
it.'
Galileo Galilei; letter to the Grand Duchess Cristina di Lorena, 1614.
(trans: Shmuel Sambursky)
ON A MOUNTAIN peak high above the little town of Thatcher, Arizona, Jesuit
astronomers from the Vatican have taken up station behind two new telescopes
to peer into the atmosphere surrounding the youngest stars in the Milky Way.
'Our purpose is not to look for extraterrestrial life,' said Father George
Coyne, director of the Vatican Observatory and a professor at the University
of Arizona (which has a quarter share in the telescopes). 'But we might
incidentally discover conditions for the birth of new planets.'
The 10,700-ft peak of Mount Graham, home to a rare red squirrel, the pocket
gopher and the white-bellied vole, thus becomes the scientific summit of the
Specola Vaticana, created by Pope Gregory XIII to help his 1582 reform of
the calendar.
That celibates in cassocks should be competing with the world's best
astrophysicists may seem quaintly anachronistic, even ludicrous. For do
science and religion not give rival accounts of the universe? Is not God
simply a device for explaining the parts that science cannot yet reach? To
those who believe that every scientific advance entails a theological
retreat, the Vatican's formal rehabilitation of Galileo at the end of
October came as just one more proof of the archaic cosmogony of the Roman
Catholic Church. If it took 360 years to issue that retraction, how can
Roman Catholic theology hope to keep up? If the church is still wrestling
with the consequences of the two apples - Eve's and Newton's - how can it
hope to accommodate quarks, gluons or the Big Bang?
Yet the antagonism of faith and science is a relatively modern invention.
Even the furore over Darwin's theory of evolution has been exaggerated. Most
of the scientific pioneers were believers, and some were clergymen -
Descartes, Newton, Kepler, Galileo, Bishop Berkeley, Locke and, in this
century, the Jesuit palaeontologist Teilhard de Chardin. Copernicus,
proponent of the heliocentric universe, was canon of Frauenberg cathedral.
As scientific accounts of the sub-atomic and cosmic worlds become ever more
incredible - or counter-intuitive in the jargon - physicists are ever more
careful to distinguish the 'how' questions of science from the 'why'
questions of theology. As theologian Sean P. Kealy has put it: science is
like a photograph of the world, faith like an x-ray. But both are 'real'.
This is the distinction which Pope John Paul II insisted upon when he
commented on the report of the Vatican's commission of inquiry into the
Galileo affair. 'A tragic mutual incomprehension has been interpreted as the
reflection of a fundamental opposition between science and faith,' he said.
'This sad misunderstanding now belongs to the past.'
Cardinal Paul Poupard, former rector of the Catholic Institute of Paris, was
president of the commission. He said from his office in the Vatican this
week: 'This is my very profound conviction too. For the believer, both kinds
of knowledge come from the same fount. As Galileo himself said, there are
two big books, the book of nature and the book of super-nature, the Bible.'
For example, added the cardinal, the Big Bang hypothesis (accepted by the
church as consistent with Revelation) did not prove or disprove anything to
the theologian. 'As Pascal, my favourite author wrote: it is a question of
another order.'
In Galileo's day, questions of two orders were not acknowledged. So, on
February 26 1616, the Pisan astronomer was condemned by the Holy Office for
reinforcing the heliocentric hypothesis of Copernicus. Only 16 years before,
the Dominican philosopher Giordano Bruno had been sent to the stake for a
similar Copernican crime.
Galileo's case was more complex. He was in good odour with Rome but was
stubborn, provocative - and influential. Writing in language that everyone
could understand he had spread his fame throughout Europe. Under pressure
from Cardinal Roberto Bellarmino, chief inquisitor and 'hammer of the
heretics' - and a student of astronomy himself - Galileo agreed to desist.
But in 1632 he published his Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi, tolemaico
e copernicano, repeating the alleged libel on the Scriptures. The Florentine
inquisition ordered the book to be seized - too late.
Although he enjoyed the protection of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Galileo was
summoned to Rome, interrogated and in spite of a vigorous defence in which
he insisted that God spoke to mankind equally through nature and revelation,
was forced to recant on April 30 1633. A sentence of imprisonment was passed
on June 22 but reduced to one of house arrest two days later. He spent the
last nine years of his life confined to his villa in Arcetri, his health,
his sight and his spirit in decline.
Historians have argued that it was the manner as much as the matter of
Galileo's argument that led to his victimisation - that, and the insecurity
of the church under Pope Urban VIII. At all events, the great scientist was
the victim of a judgment which the Vatican commission has now declared to be
wrong, but not aberrant: that is to say, in the then state of knowledge the
Holy Office had no choice but to condemn the heresy.
When scientific proof arrived in the following century Galileo's works were
given the imprimatur and removed from the Vatican's notorious index of
prohibited books. That decision was upheld in the 19th century and
reconfirmed by the papal encyclical Providentissimus Deus, in 1893.
But the story did not end there. The present Pope, Karol Wojtyla, is a
graduate and former theology professor of Krakow University where the
German-Slav Mikolaj Kopernik (to give Copernicus his real name) studied
maths, optics and perspective.
Although regarded as a conservative in other respects, the Polish Pope gave
an early signal of his wish to repair the Vatican's reputation among
scientists by setting up the special commission on the Galileo affair a year
after being elected pontiff, on the 100th anniversary of Albert Einstein's
birth. There is talk of a forthcoming papal encyclical, to be called
Splendor Veritatis, the contents of which are not known but some Vatican
insiders say will reflect the Pope's interest in reconciling the two
branches of inquiry.
Some see the hand of another priestly Pole at work: Michael Heller, a
mathematical physicist and theologian who teaches at Krakow University, is a
confidant of Wojtyla's and an 'adjunct' member of staff of the Vatican
Observatory. He has been involved in a series of science summits at which
non-Catholic, even non-Christian, experts are invited to read papers and
debate with the theologians.
'What impressed me was that it was very hard work,' said Prof John Barrow,
professor of astronomy at Sussex University in England who attended a
seminar last year. 'There were 20 or 30 of us round a big table and we
worked from 9 am to 6.30 in the evening with an hour for lunch. The papers
were circulated six months in advance and took several hours to read. It was
not like the usual science meeting.' This series of meetings, run in
conjunction with the Centre for Theology and Natural Sciences at Berkeley,
California, is in addition to occasional briefings organised for the benefit
of the observatory's ten Jesuit staff.
Prof Stephen Hawking, the cosmologist who holds Newton's chair at Cambridge,
was another of those summoned. In his best-selling Brief History of Time,
Hawking gave an ironic account of his audience with the Pope: 'He told us
that it was all right to study the evolution of the universe after the Big
Bang, but we should not inquire into the Big Bang itself because that was
the moment of Creation and therefore the work of God.' He was glad, he
added, that Pope John Paul had not heard him read the paper in which he had
argued that space-time was possibly finite but with no boundary - and
therefore there could be no moment of creation. 'I had no desire to share
the fate of Galileo.'
There is no 'Galileo cloud', said Fr Coyne, the observatory's director. 'In
30 years I have never had any problem with any colleague concerning the
relationship of science and faith.' He did, however, admit to a shortage of
scientifically-trained theologians within the Catholic church. 'We have to
look in every corner to find a Catholic or even Christian expert'.
But can the message of scripture, however judiciously interpreted, and the
hypotheses of modern science, however cautiously advanced, ever be truly
reconciled?
No, says the biologist and writer Richard Dawkins. 'There will always be
conflict between the two. You cannot get away from the fact that religion is
a scientific hypothesis: to say there is a Creator is to make a scientific
claim, and science cannot ignore that. Then you have to explain miracles
like the virgin birth and the resurrection.
'It makes me cross that religion should have this power over people's lives
and education and thought. I think the whole thing is a total illusion. Why
doesn't the Vatican learn the lesson? They were not just wrong about Galileo
 -that bungle was only a detail - but their whole attitude of thinking you
can decide things by appealing to authority is wrong.'
Dawkins concedes that some scientist-theologians make a good fist of
squaring their beliefs. Asked to explain why so many scientists continue to
accept God he suggested the human brain could be infected by something akin
to a self-replicating computer virus.
The radical theologian Don Cupitt, dean of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, sees
religion as another kind of programme, a developing activity rather like
art, which can discover no final or absolute truth.
'For example, to say 'He ascended into Heaven' means nothing to us now,' he
said. 'All dogma is entangled in a medieval world view and has to be
rethought as a whole - you can't do it piece by piece.'
A more charitable view of the Vatican's programme is taken by the Rev Dr
Arthur Peacocke, a physical biochemist and Anglican priest who has also
taken part in the conferences at Castelgandolfo, the Pope's summer
residence. 'Given their inbuilt reactionary system it's to their credit that
they have put the record straight in their own legalistic way,' he said.
Science and theology might be addressing different questions but they
applied similar criteria.
'People put them together in different ways. I say both are part of truth
and reality and you can't put them in separate pigeonholes. Sometimes the
interreaction is puzzling, sometimes it is creative.'
Another Anglican scientist-priest who has been to Castelgandolfo is the Rev
Dr John Polkinghorne, president of Queens' College, Cambridge. His views
carry weight: he is a fellow of the Royal Society and was professor of
mathematical physics at the university before his ordination 10 years ago.
He, too, sees a kinship between science and theology: their use of
induction, of models and metaphors, their search for simplicity of
hypothesis and unified theory. 'But science is asking one sort of question,'
he said, 'and religion another. There are connections between the answers -
there is an uneasy sort of puzzling boundary between the two. People say one
is public, the other private. I don't think that's right - after all, ethics
and ideas of beauty are common concepts. It's not expressing an opinion to
say that torturing children is wrong. A lot of people in the science world
are wistful fellow-travellers who fear that the answers of religion might be
a kind of suicide.'
As he takes off for Arizona to begin work in the Mount Graham observatory,
Father Coyne is unabashed. 'Any advance in science, correctly heard by the
Church, is a help to the Church,' he said. The Pope may have declared a
truce with science but it could be a long time before the world is ready to
believe in Rome's conversion.

FT  23 JAN 93 / The Long View: Independent illusions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY

<TEXT>
ONCE AGAIN the trade press of the retail investment industry is buzzing with
alarm about the renewed threat to that beleaguered group, the providers of
independent financial advice. They are the ones who like to put blue IFA
logos on their office doors.
The plan to transfer these advisers - of which there are some 6,300
authorised firms - from their tottering regulatory body Fimbra (which is
being kept alive only by financial transfusions from insurance companies) to
a new body called the Personal Investment Authority is in deep trouble.
Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, says he will
not recognise the PIA unless its preliminary prospectus is changed so that a
number of conditions are met. One of these is that the PIA must vet all the
IFAs thoroughly before accepting them, and must not simply take the view
that they can be grandfathered over from Fimbra. The PIA will certainly not
now start operations on July 1, as scheduled, and may well be stillborn.
There is a lot of tedious financial industry politics in all this, but the
question of independent advice is an important one. The UK is unusual in
having a large group of independent intermediaries, who as recently as 20
years ago accounted for the bulk of life insurance and pensions business,
and still sell maybe a third. On the Continent most savings products of this
kind are sold through banks or by salesmen.
When the UK's new investment regulation framework was being developed in the
mid-1980s it was rightly thought vital to protect the tradition of
independent advice. Unfortunately a serious mistake was made. The IFAs did
not accurately recognise their own function, which was essentially to act as
freelance marketing agents who could sell products for a large number of
independent life offices, not to mention other providers such as unit trust
companies. Because of the existence of this independent distribution channel
the UK has been able to sustain a large number of innovative and competitive
life companies which have generally offered good value to investors. But the
IFAs had bigger ideas. They considered they were investment experts whose
job it was to offer best advice to clients.
This was seriously over-optimistic in most cases, because truly professional
IFAs would require proper experience and qualifications and would be
remunerated by their clients through fees; in fact IFAs are almost always
remunerated through commissions from the product providers.
With ideas a long way above their real station in life, the IFAs and their
trade associations saw the new Financial Services Act (intended to improve
investor protection) as a way of securing a marketing advantage. They
insisted that they alone should have the right to multiple representation;
other intermediaries could act only for one company. The gloss put on this
'polarisation' was that it protected the public against conflicts of
interest. But for the IFAs the point was that it restricted the banks and
building societies in their plans to develop the retailing of investment
products.
As recently as the beginning of this month we saw one of the belated effects
of this National Westminster Bank finally abandoned its attempt to persevere
as the last major High Street multi-branch IFA. The entirely superfluous
NatWest Life is now in operation, and leading independent offices such as
Clerical Medical and Standard Life have lost an important source of
business.
But in winning the battle against the banks in the 1980s the IFAs overplayed
their hand. The new rules required them to give 'best advice' and to
subscribe to a compensation scheme through which good IFAs must pay for the
losses inflicted on the public by the rogues and the incompetents. For a
truly professional industry this should not have been a problem. Alas, in
too many cases the IFAs have failed to match their own image of themselves.
Many firms have been closed or gone into liquidation, and there is concern
that the courts may make big awards against certain IFAs in favour of
victims of home income plans, the packages of mortgages and insurance bonds
that have left many pensioners facing repossession of their homes. The
financial viability of the IFAs' regulator Fimbra has been undermined. If it
collapses the law says that the IFAs must find authorisation elsewhere or
cease trading.
Moreover the banks are out for revenge. If the IFAs had not been so keen to
drive the banks and building societies out of multi-provider retailing the
IFAs might have lost some of their marketing distinctiveness but they would
have shared some regulatory interests with the banks. As it is, the banks
see the IFAs purely as competitors that would be better eliminated. They are
well-placed to kill the PIA - but are negotiating as they would prefer not
to be seen with a smoking gun.
If the worst comes to the worst most IFAs will have to sign up as the tied
agents of single life companies. A few may be able to gain authorisation
from other regulators. There remain accountants, solicitors and other
professionals who are authorised to give independent advice by their
professional institutes. In due course a professional body of specialist
IFAs could be formed to authorise firms in the same way. But these would
cater for a limited group of high net worth clients rather than the mass
market.
Would the drastic shrinkage of the IFA sector matter? The problem would be
not so much that people would get worse advice (this aspect has been
exaggerated) as that they would suffer a reduction in choice and in value
for money. The retail investment market in the UK would become much like
that on the Continent, and many venerable institutions would disappear,
while the likes of NatWest Life would thrive.
It would scarcely be the end of the world, but it would be the end of a
distinctive British tradition.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Baird loss a setback for Clinton
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton suffered his first big political defeat in the small
hours of yesterday morning, his administration not yet 48 hours old, when Ms
Zoe Baird withdrew her nomination as the next US attorney general.
In his letter to Ms Baird and in remarks before his first cabinet meeting
later in the morning, Mr Clinton said that he was 'saddened' by her
withdrawal but he had not 'agonised' over accepting it. He described her as
'an exceptionally gifted attorney and a person of great decency and
integrity'.
Mr Clinton said he took 'full responsibility' for the fact that the extent
of the problems she might face was not appreciated. Ms Baird, 40, would have
been the first woman to head the justice department.
She ran into severe criticism when it was revealed that she had employed two
illegal immigrants for household work.
In her letter to Mr Clinton she wrote that she was 'surprised at the extent
of the public reaction' but concluded that the opportunity 'to reinvigorate'
the justice department would be lost by the continuing controversy.
In hearings this week, she confessed to breaking the law, for which she had
subsequently paid social security taxes and a civil penalty. Mr Clinton
promised to begin the search for a replacement immediately but the White
House avoided a commitment to finding another woman nominee.
Ms Baird's cause was lost with escalating speed on Thursday evening.
The general reaction on Capitol Hill yesterday was that in the end the
president and Ms Baird had little choice but to accept defeat. Senator
Patrick Leahy, the Democrat from Vermont, said if Mr Clinton had exerted
maximum pressure he might have got her confirmed, 'but this would have sent
the wrong signal' about double standards.

FT  23 JAN 93 / BR sell-off plans open to change: Transport secretary
stresses opportunities for amending Railways Bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MacGregor, transport secretary, yesterday appeared to leave the door
open to significant changes in the UK government's proposals for the
privatisation of British Rail.
Mr MacGregor, unveiling the Railways Bill, emphasised the opportunities for
parliament to amend the legislation before it won royal assent.
'The whole point of the parliamentary process of dealing with legislation is
to carry out a parliamentary scrutiny,' he said. 'So there will be full
parliamentary scrutiny in the months to come, and there may well be
changes.'
The plans for British Rail are threatening to turn into the most
controversial privatisation yet. They have been criticised by a range of
bodies including consumer groups, the public transport lobby, professional
institutions, trade unions and MPs.
The aim is to split British Rail into two, with one body operating the
trains and the other owning the tracks.
Freight operations would be sold and the passenger train operations would be
contracted out to the private sector in up to 40 separate franchises,
starting in 1994.
Mr MacGregor has already climbed down on one aspect of the proposals, saying
that franchisees will not necessarily have to face on-track competition from
other operators trying to poach their customers.
There are criticisms of the practicality of separating track ownership from
the operation of trains and the possibility that track charges could price
traffic off the railways and on to the roads.
Yesterday, Mr Brian Wilson, a Labour transport spokesman, claimed the bill
would mean fewer services, greater safety risks, more bureaucracy, higher
fares, more freight on the roads and heavy job losses.
'Above all, one is struck by the Byzantine complexity of what is being
proposed,' he said. 'The lawyers will love it. Fragmenting the railways
means everyone registering with everyone else, and a vast web of agreements
and regulatory procedures.'
Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, refused either to endorse or criticise the bill.
'It is certainly a legitimate way of broadening the financial base of the
railway. Whether it works or not really depends on who comes forward and
runs these franchises,' he said.
Mr MacGregor said the plans would bring better railway services for
passenger and freight customers and better value for money for the taxpayer.
Fares would rise no more rapidly than they had under British Rail, he
predicted, and closure procedures would remain as stringent as they were
now.
Mr MacGregor acknowledged that work was still to be done on some of the
details of the plans. A document on rolling stock leasing would be issued
next week, another on the track charging regime would follow next month, and
a third on the sale of freight services would come in March.

FT  23 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A year after Mr David Rowland's task force report, the problems of the
Lloyd's insurance market look as pressing as ever. Underwriting losses show
every sign of matching the gloomiest predictions. That will lead to a
further erosion of capital. If the losses forecast by Chatset this week
prove anything like correct - and rates continue to harden - Lloyd's will be
turning away profitable business before the middle of the decade unless new
sources of capital are found.
The new quota-share arrangements for attracting corporate investors are
already proving their worth. But it is far from clear that the modest
investments made by the likes of J P Morgan this year will plug the gap. The
current rate of attrition among Names demands something more.
The hurdles to direct corporate membership are formidable. Assuming these
can be overcome, though, Lloyd's must find a way to introduce corporate
members without alienating individual Names.
Since corporate capital would be subject to limited liability, there is
plenty of scope for friction. Names facing unlimited liability - even
allowing for the stop-loss arrangements introduced last year - might easily
feel disadvantaged. But it can hardly be in the interest of Names to
participate in a market starved of capital. Any insurance market worth its
salt should be able to reward varieties of capital with appropriate rates of
return. If Lloyd's can learn to price its risks correctly, there should be
no shortage of capital from either source.

FT  23 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Sterling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling's sharp fall this week is a measure of the dilemma facing the
government. Without a resurgence of growth, the PSBR is likely to
deteriorate further when the government is already expected to be raising
Pounds 1bn a week gross during the next financial year. Since there can be
no fiscal stimulus, the only lever left appears to be interest rates. Yet
lower rates threaten to weaken the pound, raising fears of a fresh
inflationary push. That is hardly welcome when the underlying rate is
already pushing up towards its target ceiling of 4 per cent.
Financial markets were wrong to anticipate that this week's poor economic
data would prompt the government to cut rates. With unemployment growth
accelerating, though, it may sooner or later have to cast its inflation
worries aside. Equally important, a steeper yield curve may be needed to
fund next year's PSBR. The question is how much of this has already been
discounted by sterling. A market perception that the exchange rate was low
enough to allow room for eventual appreciation would encourage foreigners to
buy gilts. Next week's auction will provide some clue as to whether this
point has been reached.

FT  23 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: British Rail
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone waiting for the cancelled 7.25 to Waterloo will agree that British
Rail needs to be exposed to commercial pressure. But devising an acceptable
system has proved much more difficult than in other privatisations. In part,
that reflects the unprofitability of the railways - British Gas runs at a
profit, British Rail does not. But there are many similarities between the
two. British Gas started as a monopoly competing in a wider energy market;
British Rail runs all of the railways but competes with other transport
systems. Both too have a basic infrastructure which can be divorced from
services offered - gas marketing can be split from the pipes, trains can be
split from track.
It may be that the poor state of British Rail's capital stock, its high
fixed costs, and need for continuing public subsidy rule out selling the
operation as a whole. But that solution offers some advantages. It would
expose all of the railways - including the track - to direct market
pressure. Other privatisations have shown that many unlikely assets are
saleable if they are priced correctly. And efficiency and service
improvements combined with premium prices on some routes might justify the
capital investment needed. The benefits of an integrated network would be
maintained, while management would be motivated to work for the change.
Ideally, internal competition within the railways would provide benefits,
but that can be approached in a phased way - as it has been in the gas
industry. By opting for a track authority and franchised services, the
government has made rail commercialisation complex, when simpler
alternatives might have solved the problem.

FT  23 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: By George, he's got it]
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the Bank of England is not going to be independent, it matters rather
less who is going to be its governor. The choice of Mr Eddie George,
announced with characteristic abruptness last night, is safe but
uninspiring. As deputy governor, Mr George has been actively involved in the
Bank's affairs during a period when it has been found wanting in two of its
most important activities. It failed in its bank supervisory role to deal
early enough with the troubles at BCCI. It was also a willing party to the
UK's stubborn determination to maintain an unrealistic exchange rate within
the ERM even when the damage to the economy was becoming obvious.
Mr George is an intelligent and articulate man with considerable technical
central banking skills. That makes him the obvious choice in a field which
did not offer any candidate with overwhelming appeal. The other leading
contender, Sir David Scholey of SG Warburg, might have been seen as too much
of a City spokesman, with no direct experience of monetary policy. Mr George
went out of his way last night to stress that his overriding task was to
work for price stability.
More startling is the appointment of a journalist as deputy governor. Mr
Rupert Pennant-Rea could be seen as an ideas man who will inject some vigour
and originality into the policy debate; at The Economist he displayed
fervent support for monetary discipline and the ERM exchange rate. But what
is needed in Britain is a fresh approach to policy-making. These
appointments suggest the prime minister is still hankering after old ideas.
After the trauma of September 16 a more open-minded approach to
policy-making was promised. That now looks as conveniently forgotten as the
original exchange rate pledge.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Banks raise serious doubts on funding for Jubilee line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS to Canary Wharf, the financially troubled property development, said
yesterday there was serious doubt about whether they would provide funds to
extend the Jubilee line into east London.
They said there were no firm commitments from them to provide the Pounds
400m towards the cost of extending the underground rail line which the
government has said is needed from the private sector. Without this
contribution, the extension will not be built.
In November, the administrators to the project said agreement in principle
had been reached with 11 banks on the provision of the funds, including an
immediate contribution of Pounds 98m. As a result, Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, earmarked public funds in the Autumn Statement for the
government's share in the project.
But it emerged yesterday that the 11 banks, including Barclays and Lloyds of
the UK, have not made a binding agreement to provide the private sector
share. They are relying on the European Investment Bank, the European
Community lending institution, to provide the bulk of the Pounds 98m.
'I am confident that the EIB will come up with the money,' said one banker.
However, a banker with close links to the EIB said it had not made any
promise to provide the money and there was considerable doubt whether it
would do so.
The EIB has already lent Pounds 100m to the project. Another Pounds 600m has
been provided in a main lending facility provided by 11 banks. Four Canadian
banks have provided a separate Pounds 450m loan.
Canary Wharf is in administration under UK insolvency procedures. Bankers
said the project would probably go into liquidation if there was no
agreement on funding for the Jubilee line.
Discussions on the funds are closely linked to separate talks on how to
provide an additional Pounds 200m needed to complete Canary Wharf's building
in London's docklands and provide incentives to prospective tenants.
A banker said that without agreement on how to finance the completion of
Canary Wharf, no money would be provided for the Jubilee line.
The current uncertainty about the funding of the Jubilee line was caused in
part by the unexpected reversal of an offer from Credit Suisse, the leading
Swiss bank, to provide a large portion of the Pounds 98m. A banker said
Credit Suisse's board overturned a proposal to provide the funds made by
more junior executives.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Sterling hit by gloom on recovery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
STERLING came under renewed pressure against the D-Mark yesterday, falling
another 1 1/2 pfennigs, amid increasing gloom about the prospects for an
economic recovery in the UK.
The pound fell to a low of DM2.437 in London, as currency dealers speculated
that the government might cut base rates in the near future, following the
release of poorer-than-expected economic data on Thursday.
The Bank of England left interest rates unchanged, but the pound still
closed at DM2.44, 1 1/4 pfennigs down on the day and more than 6 pfennigs
below its closing level last Friday. In New York it fell back again, trading
at DM2.435 at the close. Against a generally weak dollar, sterling firmed in
London to Dollars 1.5345, up more than 1 1/2 cents, although it eased to
Dollars 1.5312 in New York.
On the London stock market, hopes of an early interest rate cut had helped
lift share prices to within 6 points of 2,800 on the FT-SE 100 index. It
closed at 2,781.2, up 7.9 on the day, for a gain of 16.1 on the week.
Sterling has on several occasions in the past three months, dropped to the
levels seen yesterday, only to rally to around DM2.50, but there were signs
yesterday that the currency was under more serious pressure.
One of the leading banks in the London foreign exchange market said it had
received no requests to buy sterling from its UK corporate customers on
Thursday and that there had been barely any improvement in the situation.

FT  23 JAN 93 / BA chief and Branson to meet: Airline heads seek rapid end
to conflict prompted by 'dirty tricks' affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR COLIN MARSHALL, British Airways' chief executive and deputy chairman,
will meet Mr Richard Branson, the head of Virgin Atlantic, next week in a
final attempt to end the conflict triggered by BA's 'dirty tricks' campaign.
The meeting is expected to take place as early as Monday amid growing
indications that both sides are anxious to improve relations which have
continued to be strained despite BA's two public apologies and a Pounds
610,000 libel settlement.
Virgin indicated last night it wanted the issue resolved by the middle of
next week, although it still threatens to take further legal action against
BA in the US courts. 'No one wants this affair to drag on,' the airline said
last night. BA is also keen to settle the damaging affair without further
delay. But the airline is uncertain over Virgin's likely demands, which
could prove too much for BA to swallow.
Mr Branson is expected to insist on cash compensation for lost revenue
arising out of its rival's campaign as well as a legally binding agreement
preventing any future abuse of Virgin's computer reservation information.
Virgin also wants access to BA's maintenance facilities for its aircraft.
Access was withdrawn five years ago.
Sir Colin emphasised this week that he was anxious to establish better
relations with Virgin, while Mr Branson has indicated he would like to avoid
taking any further legal action.
Although BA's executive management is continuing its investigation into its
marketing, public affairs and legal departments in the aftermath of the
'dirty tricks' campaign, no sackings or resignations have so far emerged.
In an effort to restore staff morale and publicly demonstrate its commitment
to best business practice, BA yesterday published its new code of conduct
for its 50,000 employees.
'The best way to put the past behind us is to make it plain how we intend to
go forward in the future,' Sir Colin says in an introduction to the
document.
The code sets down general standards of behaviour covering issues ranging
from 'fairness' and 'integrity' to 'honesty' and 'fair competition'. It
urges employees: 'Be prepared to challenge if you believe others are acting
in an unethical way . . .'
However, BA's attempts to restore an air of normality remain under a cloud
as institutional investors continue to express concern over the com-pany's
failure to split the roles of chairman and chief executive.
Despite recent events, there has so far been no change in the plan for Sir
Colin to add the post of chairman to his existing responsibilities when Lord
King steps aside as chairman in July.
The issue of the future shape of the company's board has not been raised in
the immediate aftermath of the 'dirty tricks' revelations. Sir Colin said
this week there was 'ample time' for the board to consider the issue.
Some institutional shareholders yesterday claimed that Sir Michael Angus, a
BA non-executive deputy chairman, had told them that Sir Colin 'would not
hang around' if he was unable to hold both posts.

STERLING came under renewed pressure against the D-Mark yesterday, falling
another 1 1/2 pfennigs, amid increasing gloom about the prospects for an
economic recovery in the UK.
The pound fell to a low of DM2.437 in the morning, as currency dealers
speculated that the government might cut base rates in the near future,
following the release of poorer-than-expected economic data on Thursday.
The Bank of England left interest rates unchanged, but the pound still

up more than 1 1/2 cents.
On the London stock market, hopes of an early interest rate cut had helped

leading shares. It closed at 2,781.2, up 7.9 on the day.
Sterling has on several occasions in the past three months, dropped to the
levels at which it was trading yesterday, only to rally again to around
DM2.5.
But there were signs yesterday that the currency was under more serious
pressure.
One of the leading banks in the London foreign exchange market said it had
received no requests to buy the pound from its UK corporate customers on
Thursday and that there had been barely any improvement in the situation.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, an economist at Citibank in London, said Thursday's
economic data, which showed a rise in seasonally adjusted unemployment by
60,800 in December to 2.97m, had significantly changed the currency market's
mood towards sterling.
However, Mr Steven Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London,
said the money markets were now virtually discounting a full percentage
point cut in base rates before the March Budget, so that the UK authorities
could ease policy without affecting the pound any further.
'The only thing that might put pressure on the currency is if the rate cut
comes too soon,' he said.

FT  23 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Narrow gain reflects grim
jobless data

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK markets struggled to stay in positive territory yesterday in the
face of computer program selling and some bad news on the jobs market,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 3.79 at 3,256.81. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 0.60 at 436.09, while the
Amex composite was 0.78 higher at 406.36.
The Nasdaq composite faltered after a strong morning session, and ended only
0.87 higher at 701.64, another record close. Trading volume on the New York
SE was 294m shares.
The day's economic news was, however, distinctly mixed. Jobless claims rose
17,000 in the first full week of January, a bigger increase than expected.
It was the second big jump in claims in consecutive weeks, and an indication
that the economic recovery is not feeding through into the still depressed
labour market.
On a brighter note, December housing starts rose 5.5 per cent. Analysts had
forecast a much smaller rise. It was the largest monthly increase in housing
starts in more than a year, and contributed to the market's early gains.
Prices soon fell back, partly under pressure from mid-morning sell programs.
The political background was gloomy. The news that President Clinton's
choice for attorney general had been forced to withdraw her nomination meant
that the new president's term had got off to a rocky start.
Among individual stocks, steel companies were in strong demand on the news
of industry-wide steel price rises. LTV was the most active stock, rising
Dollars  7/16 to Dollars 1 1/8 in volume of 9m shares, followed by Bethlehem
Steel, up Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 19 1/8 , Inland Steel, up Dollars  7/8 at
Dollars 24 1/8 , USX, up Dollars 2 7/8 at Dollars 37 7/8 , and General
Steel, Dollars 1 3/8 firmer at Dollars 13 3/4 .
Motor stocks posted solid gains on active buying. Chrysler, the star
performer of the sector in recent months, jumped another Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 39 5/8 , Ford added Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 48 and General Motors
firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 37 7/8 .
Ralston Purina climbed Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 49 5/8 after the company
reported fiscal first quarter operating income of Dollars 1.26 a share, up
from Dollars 1.14 a share a year earlier. Investors were also cheered by the
news that the company plans to spin-off its Continental Baking unit.
On the Nasdaq market, Software Publishing jumped Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 12
7/8 in volume of 3.4m shares after the company reported quarterly profits
well in excess of market forecasts.
Canada
TORONTO stock prices ended mixed. The composite index was up 0.22 points, or
0.01 per cent, to 3275.97, declines topping advances 339 to 291. Volume
climbed to 44,816,000 shares compared with Thursday's 41,707,000 shares. The
index fell 30.6 points or 0.9 per cent on the week.

FT  23 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt takes support from
Lufthansa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR bourses were stronger yesterday, writes our markets staff.
FRANKFURT saw gains in the pre-bourse accelerate throughout the session on
good overseas interest. The DAX index closed 13.97 higher at 1,587.64, a
gain of 2.8 per cent on the week. Turnover was DM5.7bn after DM5.2bn.
Some analysts believe that, while the prospect of a cut in interest rates
continues to lift sentiment, hopes that the government's solidarity pact
will gain the agreement of employers and trade unions is currently
supporting the market.
Individual features included Lufthansa, up DM6.60 or 6 per cent at DM110.00,
on reports that it will show good earnings results next week.
Deutsche Babcock rose DM5.80 to DM159.80, after announcing that it was to
resume dividend payments of DM3 after a two year suspension and pay the same
amount retrospectively for 1991 and 1990.
Elsewhere good performances were seen by Siemens, up DM7.00 at DM604.80 and
Daimler, DM11.50 higher at DM576.50.
PARIS was positive on the last day of the account with the CAC-40 index
finishing 8.24 higher at 1,820.42 for a 0.4 per cent gain on the week.
Turnover was good at FFr3.1bn.
St Gobain gained FFr14.90 to FFr495.90 as investors took stock of its 1992
figures, released after Thursday's close, which suggested that the group has
been more resistant to the economic downturn than other cyclicals.
Lyonnaise-Dumez, which has lost 11.6 per cent on the week after forecasting
disappointing 1992 earnings on Wednesday, closed 50 centimes lower at
FFr409.50.
Elf put on FFr6.00 to FFr340.80 after the group said that its 1992 results,
due out early next week, would meet expectations. Moulinex was another
gainer, rising FFr5.40 to FFr82.90, ahead of results due out after the
close.
Peugeot shed FFr20 or 3 per cent to FFr578 as a number of brokers downgraded
the stock.
ZURICH turned broadly firmer after a lively afternoon. Shares rose in the
morning, dipped at midsession on profit-taking, but climbed again in the
afternoon as investors were attracted by lower prices.
The SMI index, little changed on the week, ended up 15.3 at 2,102.7, the
level at which it had hit resistance in the morning.
Chemicals were in demand. Ciba registered shares rose SFr14 to SFr656. Roche
certificates dipped to a day's low of SFr4,050 in response to overnight news
of a 50 per cent drop in profits at Genentech, its US biotechnology unit.
But the shares later picked up to close unchanged at SFr4,120.
AMSTERDAM featured a 5.5 per cent rise in Hoogovens, up Fl 1.30 to Fl 24.80,
while a late session rumour that the state was to place its 8 per cent stake
in ING sent its shares down 80 cents to Fl 58.00. The CBS Tendency index
closed 0.3 lower at 98.9, up 1.2 per cent on the week.
MILAN suffered a bout of profit-taking after recent gains but the market
closed mostly off the day's lows. The Comit index was 5.98 lower at 481.62,
0.6 per cent higher on the week.
However, Italcementi and its parent, Italmobiliare, were among the few
issues to rise after news that the government was to free around L50
trillion for public works spending. Italcementi rose L388 to L9,338 and
Italmobiliare fixed L150 up at L37,000 before surging to L38,500 after
hours.
STOCKHOLM ended lower after profit-taking ahead of the February results
reporting season and a fall by pharmaceutical group Astra. Astra's A-shares
closed down SKr12 at SKr694, and the B-shares fell SKr10 to SKr679.
The Affarsvarlden index ended 14.3 lower at 912.9, for a weekly decline of
1.5 per cent.
Asea's B-share rose SKr1 to SKr383 on news of a large contract from Swedish
railways.
Among banking stocks, Handelsbanken A-shares climbed SKr2.50 to SK5r44.50
supported by hopes of a maintained dividend. In contrast, S-E-Banken's
A-share were unchanged at SKr14 after news of a widespread group overhaul.
BRUSSELS closed higher in busy trade which took the Bel-20 index 7.91 higher
at 1,172.32, for a weekly rise of 2.4 per cent.
Belgium's biggest retailer, GIB, was the most active share following
recommendations from London brokers. It advanced BFr24 to BFr1,234 on very
high volume of 186,800 shares.
MADRID took little encouragement from a cut in domestic interest rates and
the general index lost 1.19 to 232.18, down 1.5 per cent on the week. Banco
Santander, whose results on Thursday disappointed the market, shed Pta235 to
Pta4,640.
VIENNA, held up against expectations in the wake of news of a 1992 operating
loss dividend cut at OMV. The ATX index eased 1.43 to 338.34.
OMV shares slid Sch15 to Sch599 after the company said it expected to post a
1992 loss of Sch300m and that the dividend would be cut.

FT  23 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: De Beers gives JSE a buoyant start to
1993 - But economic hopes are muted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just as the collapse last August in De Beers' share price was an important
factor in driving down the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, so its recent
recovery has helped get the market off to a buoyant start in 1993.
The overall index has risen by about 4 per cent in the first three weeks,
having closed 1992 down 5.3 per cent on the year. The index closed yesterday
up 22 at 3,404.
Much of this year's rise can be attributed to De Beers, which accounts for
some 10 per cent of total volume and 5 per cent of market capitalisation.
The shares have risen by 16 per cent since the start of the year, closing
yesterday at R68.25, after finishing 1992 at R57.50. This improvement is
mainly attributable to better than expected rough diamond sales by the
Central Selling Organisation during 1992, and indications that the problem
of excess supply from Angola and Russia has eased.
The industrial index has also started the year strongly, up 4 per cent,
after a 4.6 per cent gain in the whole of 1992, which followed a strong 39
per cent rise the previous year.
Mr Richard Jesse, an analyst at brokers Martin &amp; Co partly attributes this
good start to the, by now, 'tedious litany' of the market's scrip shortage.
Nevertheless, most observers believe that 1993 will be a better year on the
JSE than 1992. To some extent, this view is supported by improved political
and economic fundamentals. While the speed of political negotiation is
rather slow all those involved are aware that the country cannot afford a
repeat of the damaging political hiatus which followed the failure of the
Codesa 2 talks in May and the Boipatong massacre in June.
Economic expectations, however, are muted: the weather pattern in recent
weeks has led to renewed fears that the El Nino phenomenon, associated with
the severe drought of 1991-92, has reappeared. Last year, for instance, the
drought shaved nearly 2 percentage points off GDP growth.
The expectation remains, however, of positive growth in 1993 of around 1.5
per cent (GDP shrunk by about 2 per cent in 1992), on hopes of a better
agricultural season and improved commodity exports as world growth improves.
The earnings prospects of industrial companies remains gloomy. Most
companies that have reported recently have predicted a drop in profits and
there is little expectation of improved corporate profits before 1994.
In spite of these rather pale fundamentals, Mr Jesse is predicting a
rerating of the market. He believes that the Financial and Industrial index,
currently on a price/earnings ratio of 14.9 times, down from a peak of some
15.5 in 1992, could rise to more than 16 this year.
He gives two main reasons for this forecast, apart from the improved
political prospects. First, the absence of alternatives: property returns
are expected to fall in 1993, while money market rates which are in line
with inflation, and likely to fall with interest rates, are hardly
attractive.
Capital markets are also a difficult route because, while the probable
short-term decline in inflation, which currently stands at about 11 per
cent, is positive, this is counterbalanced by concerns about the size of the
government's budget deficit and prospects of a relaxation in fiscal policy
under an interim government.
Second, Mr Jesse argues that South African fund managers will be increasing
the equity portion of their portfolios: many of them are underweight,
holding less than 60 per cent in equities when the limit is as much as 75
per cent.
One unfashionable area which could receive some of these institutional funds
is gold shares which have been sharply downrated over the past three years
as the gold index declined from a peak of 2,250 to current levels of about
800, with a 30 per cent fall in 1992 alone.
Mr Mike Wuth, mining analyst at brokers Rice Rinaldi says that this
correction has largely removed the speculative angle from gold. Now, he
says, gold has to offer decent returns and compete more directly with
industrial shares.
However few analysts hold out much hope for a higher gold price in the short
term and a weakening rand is only likely to offer limited benefit.
But one way that profits can be improved is through further cost cutting
measures and the December gold quarterly results of mining houses confirm
the impressive progress that has been made in this direction. With the
dividend yield of the gold index having risen to 6.6 per cent from 3.4 per
cent three years ago, gold shares are now offering better value than for a
number of years.
Mr Wuth forecasts that foreigners are more likely to be buyers of good
shares than local institutions. Many of the latter, he argues, are
historically overweight in gold and so are looking for opportunities to
lighten their holdings.
Overseas institutions, of course, will be wary of the vagaries of the
financial rand investment unit, which started 1992 at a discount of 14 per
cent to the commercial rand and ended at a discount of 37 per cent.
But the political outlook and recent steps taken to bolster the currency,
make any further weakening from current levels unlikely.

FT  23 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei retreats amid
worries on outlook

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE PRICES lost ground in small-lot selling by investment trusts, and the
Nikkei average closed below the psychologically important 16,500 level for
the first time since November 17 last year, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index closed down 201.87 at 16,336.81, a 1 per cent decline on
the week. The index rose to the day's high of 16,540.88 in the morning
session and fell to a low of 16,333.81 before the close at anxiety about a
possible collapse in share prices next month.
Volume fell to 180m shares from 199m. Declines led advances by 656 to 216
with 202 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks fell 7.96 to 1,256.70, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose
0.10 to 1,025.62.
Caution has been mounting among market participants regarding a 'February
crash' due to liquidation of specified money trusts by corporations ahead of
March book closing, margin selling and arbitrage trading. Comments by Mr
Yoshiro Hayashi, the finance minister, who yesterday ruled out the need for
imminent stock market support measures, also unnerved market participants.
Sentiment was further depressed after Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the
Keidanren - the Federation of Economic Organisations - announced that a
stock purchasing company, proposed by some economists, was unnecessary.
Retail issues held by Shuwa, the stock and property speculator, continued to
fall after Thursday's reports that the company was looking to sell its
holdings. Isetan fell Y120 to Y1,860 and Matsuzakaya lost Y61 to Y959.
Ito-Yokado, a supermarket chain, which last year held negotiations to buy
Isetan shares from Shuwa, lost Y100 to Y3,400.
Isuzu Motors, the most active issue of the day, fell Y12 to Y348 on
profit-taking by dealers. Pioneer Electronic fell Y150 to Y2,370 on reports
that the research division of Nikko Securities had lowered its earnings
projection.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 120.59 to 17,891.38, down 0.9 per cent on the
week, in volume of 30.9m shares.
Roundup
In the Pacific Rim, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur and Seoul were closed for the
Lunar Year long weekend holiday.
SINGAPORE moved ahead at the end of the half-day session, lifting the
Straits Times Industrial index 2.91 to 1,596.78, 1.5 per cent down on the
week. Volume was limited to 28.19m shares. Many investors and brokers had
left for the weekend holiday.
Acma was the most actively traded issue gaining 4 cents to SDollars 2.69.
Fraser &amp; Neave was steady at SDollars 11.40 as it proposed a five- for-25
rights issue which will accompany a bond with warrants issue of SDollars
100m to help finance an expansion.
MANILA climbed for the third day, fuelled by speculation about oil drilling
tests in the Malampaya well off south-western Palawan island.
The composite index rose 10.23 to 1,341.47 for a three-day increase of 58.47
and 2.1 per cent higher on the week.
AUSTRALIAN shares turned higher, taking heart from Mr Kerry Packer's
decision to roll over his Westpac Banking January call options to April
calls. Westpac added 30 cents to ADollars 2.91, having traded as high as
ADollars 3.00.
The All Ordinaries index benefited, closing up 3.9 at 1523.0, virtually
unchanged on the week.
Other banks moved higher with ANZ 2 cents up at ADollars 3.04 in turnover of
2.26m shares, and CBS rose 5 cents to ADollars 5.90. NAB slid 3 cents to
ADollars 7.49. Pioneer, with its exposure to Westpac, rose 10 cents to
ADollars 2.30. News Corp was strong throughout the session, closing 20 cents
higher at ADollars 29.20. Fairfax ended steady at ADollars .63 after its
forecast increased profits for 1992-93.
NEW ZEALAND was generally firmer but trading was light in the absence of
foreign investors. The NZSE-40 index gained 3.06 to 1498.43.

FT  23 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: US move seen by Sainsbury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING speculation that J. Sainsbury is looking to make a substantial
acquisition in the UK is likely to prove wide of the mark, according to
London analysts. The supermarket group is now believed to be targeting a
large US food store business. Such a purchase, which could cost Sainsbury
about Pounds 400m, would complement its Shaw's supermarkets division of 75
stores based in New England. It could also cause Sainsbury to seek further
funds from its shareholders. The shares gained a penny to 559p.
Names touted nearer home yesterday included the loss-making Do It All chain
owned by WH Smith and Boots. Analysts said there would be some synergy with
Sainsbury's Homebase DIY business, with suggestions also that patience is
wearing thin among Do It All's present owners. WH Smith 'A' shares advanced
8 to 453p, helped by a Nomura buy note. Boots edged forward to 518p.
Another candidate under scrutiny was Asda. Yesterday saw 22m shares traded
and the equivalent of another 10m in the options market. The shares added 2
at 68 1/2 p. However, analysts were dismissive of a bid for Asda, arguing
that the financial and strategic advantages were not compelling.
ICI sold
Shares in ICI fell 12 to 1,111p with several traders pinpointing US
investment bank Goldman Sachs. Dealers said Goldman had finally managed to
offload in New York the 10m shares still on its books after Hanson sold its
2.8 per cent stake in May last year.
Goldman would not comment but informed sources said there had been heavy
selling to US institutional clients. The shares were also weak following
press comment pointing out the relatively small positive impact of the
business swap with BASF of Germany, announced on Thursday compared with the
subsequent sharp rise in the share price.
C &amp; W active
A late flurry of selling caused by broker downgrades, drove Cable &amp; Wireless
shares sharply lower in the last hour of trading.
The stock ended the session down 18 at 703p with turnover expanding rapidly
to a hefty 5.5m. The profit downgrades were initiated, specialists said, by
Cazenove, Cable's own broker, which reduced its profits forecast for the
year to end-March 1994 to around Pounds 900m. Other brokers were said to
have followed in cutting their numbers. Previous estimates were around
Pounds 970m-80m.
Analysts said Mercury, C &amp; W's 80 per cent-owned telecoms business, has been
hit by the recession while Hong Kong Telecom, where C &amp; W has a 58 per cent
stake, could be facing reductions in call charges. C &amp; W's preliminary
figures for the year are expected in May.
Strong demand for British Airways (BA) saw turnover rise to 15m, and the
shares close 8 up at 273p, as the market took on board Thursday's
announcement of a strategic alliance with USAir.
That news came shortly after Thursday's market close so yesterday was the UK
stock market's first reaction to the US deal which came at the end of a week
of bad publicity for BA over its dispute with Virgin Atlantic. US houses
were particularly keen buyers with Salomon International on the bid for most
of the morning, and Lehman Brothers a strong buyer during the afternoon.
Messages from a US trade union to UK institutional shareholders of Tate &amp;
Lyle highlighting an industrial dispute unsettled the shares which retreated
4 to 395p. While specialists downplayed the financial significance of the
dispute, which involves negotiations over labour contracts at a large US
refinery, it struck a nerve with investors ahead of the group's agm next
week.
A modest rally in crude oil prices helped the exploration and production
sub-sector register further good gains. Enterprise Oil rose 8 more to 419p
on relatively keen turnover of 1.5m shares after some strong demand said to
have been generated by Lehman Brothers, the US broker.
Mr Peter Hitchens, oil analyst at Lehman said the company 'still has the
potential for good growth and remains the quality play in the exploration
stocks.'
Banks maintained their strong showing, renewed buying driven by recovery
hopes and takeover speculation. Standard Chartered capped a week of big
gains by a further 17 gain to 653p, having touched a 1992/3 high of 655p,
after profits upgrades and renewed takeover speculation. During the week
Standard shares have risen 68.
NatWest gained 9 to 435p, on 9.1m traded, but Lloyds, widely regarded as a
potential bidder for one of the UK banks, closed unchanged at 499p,with 4.9m
traded.
Volatility continued in Glaxo on the two-way view about imminent economic
recovery. An announcement by Glaxo's Japanese arm of a co-development deal
to sell Zantac, the prescription ulcer treatment, as an over-the-counter
drug was interpreted by one analyst as highlighting the company's concern
about its concentration on prescription drugs. The shares closed 5 lower at
712p.
Gases group BOC rose 3 to 746p following a buy note from Kleinwort Benson.
Vague bid talk, coupled with a buy note from James Capel, the UK
institutional broker, helped Cadbury-Schweppes, up 10 at 482p.
Reuters Holdings failed to benefit from the market's recovery as the stock
drifted a further 20 to 1310p ahead of results in February. BZW has voiced
caution over the rating and James Capel has reinforced its negative stance.
Shares in Midlands Radio were suspended at 112p pending announcement of a
recommended offer by Capital Radio. Capital bid 130p a share, valuing
Midland at Pounds 17.7m.
Profit-taking prompted London television franchise holder Carlton to fall 8
to 798p.
Anglia Television was held down at 202p as NatWest Securities moved the
stock to a hold from a buy,arguing that the shares were fairly valued at
present levels.
Reports that aircraft leasing company GPA was to cancel a large number of
aircraft orders hurt several suppliers to the aircraft manufacturers Among
those to suffer were TI, 5 lower at 296p, and Smiths Industries which also
gave up 5 to 367p. British Aerospace moved 5 ahead to 215p, on talk that the
long awaited Al-Yamamah 2 defence order was about to be announced.
Regional broker Wise Speke placed 25 per cent of shoe sellers Stylo at
around 96p. The shares fell 4 to 108p.

FT  23 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares firm but below the day's best
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REKINDLED hopes for an early cut in UK interest rates continued to flourish
in the London stock market yesterday but shares lost heart towards the close
as government bonds shaded lower.
At the high point of the day, the FT-SE Index came within six points of
regaining the 2,800 mark. By the close, however, the gain had been cut to
7.9 for a final reading of 2,781.2. The final hour of trading saw sharp
reversals in some share prices on what some analysts regarded as uncertain
investment grounds.
The underlying tone of the stock market remained relatively confident,
underpinned by good turnover volume. A return of investor attention towards
the second line issues was reflected in a gain of 9.8 on the FT-SE Mid 250
Index for a close of 2,909.0.
Retail, or customer, interest in equities has remained high this week;
Thursday's retail business touched recent daily average highs at a total of
Pounds 1.49bn. The week has seen share prices moving nervously against a
troubled background of Middle East hostilities and domestic economic
uncertainties.
The stock market turned higher at the end of the week as the announcement
that UK unemployment had risen to nearly 3m, together with doubts on
Christmas retail sales and falling industrial output, alarmed the City and
inspired hopes that base rates may be cut in the near future, rather than in
the March budget.
Share price gains on Thursday and yesterday have left the FT-SE Index 16.1
points up on the week. Equity strategists were in two minds yesterday. A cut
in base rates would be good for equities and also strengthen hopes for an
economic revival.
But an early reduction would smack of economic desperation, as well as
storing up trouble in terms of inflation, as well as for the impending
funding in government bonds.
UK gilts were down by about one quarter of a point throughout yesterday's
session, with trading fairly subdued as traders weighed the outlook for
sterling as it extended the loss of the previous session.
Sharelink, the execution-only broker which claims the lion's share of UK
private investor business, said yesterday that its clients had remained
buyers of UK equities this week, as they have been since December.
Store and retail issues remained subdued yesterday as sector strategists
assessed the implications of this week's news on Christmas sales. Banks
conventionally immediate beneficiaries from interest rate cuts, moved ahead.

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER hopes of a cut in UK interest rates continued in the derivates,
again helping to drive Footsie futures forward, writes Joel Kibazo.
The March contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,785, and, but for a brief early
retreat, moved steadily forward on speculation of a cut in base rates.
It was also boosted by the firm trading in gilts and short sterling.
The contract reached the day's high of 2,813 around 1pm. In the afternoon,
March came off the top due to the poor trading in the bonds market but
remained above the 2,800 level and closed at 2,803, with turnover reaching
8,735 lots.
In traded options, Asda was the most actively dealt stock option as talk of
a bid circulated. It traded 9,390 contracts with the July 70 puts the
busiest series.
British Airways was a poor second at 1,993 lots and TSB followed at 1,957
contracts. The closing total for the traded options was 37,685 lots, with
the FT-SE 100 option recording 10,290 contracts.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling under more pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING continued to perform weakly against the D-Mark yesterday, falling
as low as DM2.4370, following the release of poor economic data in the UK
this week, writes James Blitz.
The pound came under strong pressure in the morning as dealers speculated on
the possibility of the Bank of England cutting base rates in the wake of
Thursday's very poor unemployment figure for December.
The currency recovered up to DM2.45 in the early afternoon, but later fell
back to close in London at DM2.44, 1 1/4 pfennigs down on the day. It closed
more than 1 1/2 cents higher against the dollar, at Dollars 1.5345.
There were disturbing indications yesterday that the pound could go down to
DM2.40, which many dealers see as the next important support level.
One of the leading banking counterparties in the London market said that it
had seen almost no interest in buying the pound from UK corporates on
Thursday, and that there was barely any improvement yesterday.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, is among those who
believe that the mood of the market towards sterling has changed
significantly.
He says that sterling could see DM2.37 within a month, but that it will rise
up to the DM2.45 level afterwards. In his view, the January money supply
figures, due out on February 3, will be crucial to the decision on whether
to cut rates. A meeting of the 'seven wise men' who advise the UK Treasury,
on February 9th, will also be important. 'They will come out in favour of a
cut in base rates,' he said.
However, Mr Steven Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London,
said that the money markets were now virtually discounting a full percentage
point off base rates before the March budget, and that the UK authorities
could ease policy without depressing the pound any further. 'The only thing
that might put pressure on the currency is if the rate cut comes too soon,'
he said.
The dollar also suffered a new bout of weakness against the D-Mark
yesterday, dropping below the DM1.60 level against the D-Mark for the first
time this year. It closed at DM1.59 in London, down 2 1/2 pfennigs on the
day.
The dollar's fall came on the back of a mixed set of economic data. A strong
5.5 per cent rise in December housing starts raised hopes for good GDP
growth in the fourth quarter. However, jobless claims rose 17,000 in the
week to January 9, fuelling concerns that employment and incomes were
growing too slowly.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Money Markets: Excitement on rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK OF ENGLAND signalled no change in UK base rates yesterday, although
some money market dealers believe there is now a good chance of policy being
eased in the UK in the immediate future, writes James Blitz.
The last two days have seen a remarkable change of sentiment in the sterling
cash and futures market. Last Friday week, the feeling in the market was
that a base rate cut would not come before the budget on March 16, and
3-month money closed at around 7 1/16 per cent.
Thursday's extremely poor figures for unemployment and manufacturing output
have raised expectations in some quarters of an immediate rate cut.
Three-month money yesterday closed at 6 13/16 per cent, a  1/4 percentage
point down on the week.
The March short sterling contract was yesterday trading some 35 basis points
up on the week at 93.73, before falling back to close at 93.62.
At that closing level, it assumes that 3-month money in March will be at
6.38 per cent.
Yesterday's Treasury Bill tender was also seen by one dealer as a sign of
how bullish the market has become about rate cuts. The Bank of England
offered Pounds 100m of 6 month bills at an average discounted rate of 5.9663
per cent.
The Bank of England's operations will be scrutinised in minute detail next
week for any sign they give on interest rate policy.
Yesterday's shortage of Pounds 750m was seen as a conveniently neutral
figure behind which the Bank could conceal its innermost thoughts, and there
was no need for it to offer an early round.
Most of the early bids for cash were almost certainly at levels below base
rate, and only Pounds 10m of bills were bought by the Bank at 12 o'clock.
Again, conditions were a little difficult and there was late assistance of
Pounds 190m.
One money market dealer yesterday circled February 4th in his diary as a
date when the next policy easing could come. That is the day on which the
Bundesbank council is meeting, and a cut in rates then might be followed by
an easing in the UK.
However, he was bracing himself for a few days of intense speculation next
week. 'The trouble with this government,' he said, 'is that - in this sort
of situation - they have a tendency to panic.'

SOUTHAM, the Canadian newspaper group in which Mr Conrad Black's Hollinger
recently became the largest shareholder, plans to forge closer links with Mr
Black's other international publishing investments, The Daily Telegraph in
the UK and Australia's Fairfax Holdings.
Mr William Ardell, Southam's chief executive, said yesterday an alluring
aspect of Mr Black's business strategy was that 'he sees papers in a global
context'. No discussions have taken place on areas of co-operation, but Mr
Ardell foresaw opportunities to create products, including improvements to
existing papers.
Southam is expected to tap The Telegraph's UK industrial relations
experience to deal with labour problems at its loss-making Vancouver
offshoot which runs the city's two leading newspapers.
The 200-plus small US newspapers owned by Hollinger relied heavily on The
Daily Telegraph for coverage of the Gulf war in 1991.
The North American edition of the Jerusalem Post, which is also controlled
by Mr Black, is printed by a Hollinger subsidiary in New Jersey.
Hollinger recently completed a deal to buy 22.6 per cent of Southam, which
publishes 18 daily papers and has interests in business information services
and trade publications.
In an understanding modelled on last year's Hollinger-Telegraph agreement,
Mr Black has agreed to safeguards to prevent a creeping takeover or a proxy
fight for control of Southam.
Hollinger will name three representatives to the Southam board, but a
majority of board members will be independent of both Southam management and
Hollinger.
Any deal worth more than CDollars 100m (USDollars 78.1m) or 10 per cent of
Southam's market capitalisation must have the assent of holders of a
majority of Southam shares, excluding Hollinger.
John Fairfax Holdings, the Australian newspaper group 15 per cent-owned by
Mr Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph group, predicts pre-tax profits of
ADollars 105m (USDollars 72.4m) in the year to June, compared to earlier
forecasts of ADollars 94m, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney. But revenue was
expected to be 3 per cent below an earlier forecast of ADollars 782m.

MOBIL, one of the biggest US oil and natural gas groups, yesterday posted a
29 per cent gain in fourth-quarter net earnings to Dollars 514m compared
with Dollars 400m a year earlier.
Earnings per share rose to Dollars 1.25 from 97 cents.
Stripping out special items, Mobil said fourth-quarter earnings rose 50 per
cent to Dollars 583m.
Revenues in the last three months stood at Dollars 17.24bn compared with
Dollars 17.17bn in the same period of 1991.
For all 1992, net earnings fell 55 per cent to Dollars 863m or Dollars 2.01,
from 1991's Dollars 1.92bn, or Dollars 4.65. Revenues rose to Dollars
63.82bn from Dollars 63.22bn.
Mobil took a non-cash charge in 1992 for the adoption of new accounting
standards. Excluding special items, Mobil said its earnings fell 21 per cent
to Dollars 1.49bn in the year.
Pressures of weak economies and soft industry demand hurt operating earnings
from downstream and chemical operations in 1992. Underlying marketing and
refining earnings fell to Dollars 354m for the year from Dollars 1.02bn.
Those of the chemical business fell to Dollars 76m from Dollars 217m.
Stripping out special items, earnings from exploration and producing rose 20
per cent to Dollars 1.48bn in the year.
Restructuring charges of Dollars 49m in the quarter brought 1992's worldwide
restructuring charges to Dollars 203m.

FT  23 JAN 93 / International Company News: French issue lifts Ecu bond
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE provided an important lift for the Ecu bond market yesterday with the
announcement that it plans to auction between Ecu500m and Ecu700m of a new
10-year stock on Monday.
The Ecu bond auction will mark the first substantial issue of Ecu bonds
since Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty on June 2, which threw
the Ecu bond market into confusion and cast doubts over European economic
and monetary union.
France, which has been a keen supporter of European economic and monetary
union, has traditionally been one of the most significant issuers of Ecu
bonds. France last issued Ecu bonds in April 1992, apart from some limited
issuance intended for repo purposes.
Mr John Hall, international economist at Swiss Bank Corporation, described
the decision as 'very significant and very important for the Ecu bond market
as it shows that issuance has come back'.
He pointed out that 10-year Ecu bond yields have fallen from their peak of
about 220 basis points over 10-year German government bond yields, to around
107 basis points.
Ten-year Ecu bonds yield 72 basis points more than French government bonds
so it is more expensive for the French treasury to fund its borrowing
requirement in Ecu than in French francs.

FT  23 JAN 93 / International Company News: Corporate Japan piles up on
auction block - Robert Thomson in Tokyo looks at the larger deals that have
intensified M&amp;A activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Distress sale notices are being pasted in the front window of corporate
Japan. Nippon Steel is close to acquiring a majority stake in NMB
Semiconductor, a struggling electronics company, while large stakes bought
in six Japanese retailers by Shuwa, a developer and speculator, are on the
auction block.
These large deals follow a sudden increase in merger and acquisition
activity among smaller distressed companies, most taken over in purely
domestic deals arranged by their main bank. The trend offers opportunities
to European and US companies, whose acquisitions in Japan more than doubled
last year, and are on the rise.
At the same time, Japanese companies' acquisitions abroad fell 60.7 per cent
by value last year, according to Daiwa Securities, and a market is emerging
for the resale of foreign companies acquired during the heady days of the
late 1980s. Recof International, a Japanese M&amp;A boutique, estimates that 70
per cent to 80 per cent of foreign M&amp;A deals by Japanese companies were a
failure.
The present patterns of M&amp;A activity contrast strikingly with the rapid
international expansion by Japanese companies during the late 1980s, when
Tokyo stock prices were rising and capital raised at almost zero cost.
Executives, believing that the good times would last, miscalculated badly on
the long-term cost of investments both at home and abroad.
Ailing companies, hit by falling profits and higher capital costs,
particularly smaller manufacturers and service businesses, are in need of
assistance. Meanwhile, Japanese banks, worried about non-performing loans,
are keen to find buyers for corporate clients which appear on the verge of
collapse.
'Most of the deals you will not hear about,' explained Mr Yukio Rimbara,
general manager of the strategic business advisory division of Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank. 'We don't announce the deals, but every day, we are getting
calls and transactions are rising rapidly. We have clients with financial
problems, and M&amp;A could be a solution for them.'
Distressed Japanese companies tend to turn to traditional contacts before
thinking of a foreign purchaser. Japanese managers are aware that staff are
uneasy about a loss of job security under foreign owners, while there are
fears that foreigners would face more general difficulties in adapting to
the local corporate culture.
As a result, the largest increase in foreign acquisitions, so-called out-in
deals, is in strategic purchases by established US and European companies.
Purchasers last year included Ciba-Geigy, Atochem, and Philips, with eight
of 43 deals in pharmaceuticals, seven in industrial machinery and chemicals,
and six in computers, according to a survey by the corporate finance arm of
KPMG Peat Marwick.
About 60 per cent of deals last year were acquisitions of distributors or
joint venture partners, and Mr Thomas Lynch, a partner at Peat Marwick, said
most involved companies with sales of less than Y5bn (Dollars 39.8m) and
fewer than 100 employees: 'We haven't seen any really big acquisitions yet
by foreign companies in Japan, but you might see them in the future.'
NMB Semiconductor could have set that precedent. Before Nippon Steel's move,
reports had circulated in the Japanese electronics industry that Intel of
the US would acquire the company. Intel Japan says now that it will not bid
against Nippon Steel, which has apparently agreed to pay Y30bn for 60 per
cent of the chip maker.
The NMB case is a typical by-product of the hard economic times. Listed on
the over-the-counter market in Tokyo, it is still a subsidiary of Minebea,
the world's leading maker of miniature bearings, which entered the
semiconductor market in 1984 as part of an erratic diversification programme
that included a door-to-door cosmetics company and a Canadian pig farm.
Minebea reported a consolidated loss of Y13.6bn in the year ended September
and does not have the resources to keep pumping funds into NMB, which lost
Y12.4bn last year, expects a Y4bn loss this year, and needs capital
investment of about Y100bn over the next five years to stay in the chip
race.
Mr Mike Jeremy, electronics specialist at Baring Securities, said NMB was
the 'purest play in Japan' for a company with the funds to take advantage of
its chip-making facilities. In theory, bidders could include South Korean
semiconductor makers such as Samsung, but that deal could prompt outrage in
Japan, where Korean companies do not have the prestige of US manufacturers
such as Intel.
The other large acquisition move this week involved bids for a 29 per cent
stake in Isetan, the department store chain, owned by Shuwa, the troubled
developer. Having bought stakes in six retail groups during the late 1980s,
Shuwa is conducting a fire-sale to relieve a crippling debt burden estimated
at Y1,000bn.
'When people talked about the M&amp;A boom in the late 1980s, this is not really
what they had in mind,' an official at a Japanese brokerage said. Instead of
expansion abroad, the spate of acquisitions on the negotiating table is an
important part of the restructuring of Japanese industry.
The challenge for US or European executives wanting to take advantage of
this restructuring is to find a company that fits, but not fatally wounded
through speculation in stocks or property during the late 1980s. Ailing
Japanese companies offered to US or European companies tend to be those
turned down by its natural domestic partners, who may have scented danger.
Mr Masaharu Yonezawa, a director of Recof International, said the ripest
opportunities are in the chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food and computer
software industries, but foreign executives must be willing to make a quick
decision to take advantage of the environment.
'These out-in cases normally take more than a year, but for domestic
transactions three months is a normal time frame. Foreign companies have to
speed up the decision process,' he said.

SOUTHAM, the Canadian newspaper group in which Mr Conrad Black's Hollinger
recently became the largest shareholder, plans to forge closer links with Mr
Black's other international publishing investments, The Daily Telegraph in
the UK and Australia's Fairfax Holdings.
Mr William Ardell, Southam's chief executive, said yesterday that one
alluring aspect of Mr Black's business strategy was that 'he sees papers in
a global context'. No discussions have taken place on areas of co-operation
between the three groups, but Mr Ardell said that he foresaw opportunities

Southam is expected to tap The Telegraph's industrial relations experience
in the UK to deal with long-standing labour problems at its loss-making
Vancouver subsidiary which runs the city's two leading newspapers.
Such co-operation would mirror the pattern set in Mr Black's other
international interests.
The 200-plus small US newspapers owned by Hollinger relied heavily on The
Daily Telegraph for coverage of the Gulf war in 1991.
The North American edition of the Jerusalem Post, which is also controlled

two companies.
Any deal worth more than CDollars 100m (USDollars 78.1m) or 10 per cent of
Southam's market capitalisation must have the assent of holders of a

FT  23 JAN 93 / International Company News: Texas Instruments posts gains in
sales and income

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TEXAS INSTRUMENTS, the US semiconductor and electronics manufacturer,
reported increased revenues and income for the fourth quarter, lifted by
record semiconductor sales and orders for defence equipment to replenish
systems used in Operation Desert Storm.
Revenues for the fourth quarter were Dollars 1.99bn, compared with Dollars
1.75bn in the same period last year. Higher revenues in semiconductors and
defence electronics more than offset a drop in digital products resulting
from the sale of TI's multi-user minicomputer systems and service operations
to Hewlett-Packard.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 78m, or 80 cents a share, compared
with a loss of Dollars 85m or Dollars 1.18 in the fourth quarter of 1991,
after net charges of Dollars 55m. For the year, revenues grew about 10 per
cent to Dollars 7.44bn from Dollars 6.78bn in 1991. Increased semiconductor
revenues, across all product lines, were the largest contributor to this
rise.
Net income was Dollars 247m, or Dollars 2.50, compared with a net loss of
Dollars 409m or Dollars 5.40 in 1991 after net charges of Dollars 240m.
Semiconductor revenues rose 16 per cent to Dollars 4.03bn. TI, which is one
of the world's leading manufacturers of memory chips, has been moving to
diversify its semiconductor operations to include more profitable products.
'The strategy to increase our mix of differentiated products gained momentum
in 1992, with these products now making up more than 40 per cent of TI's
semiconductor revenues,' said Mr Jerry Junkins, chairman, president and
chief executive.
'We believe we will generate more than half of our semiconductor revenues
from this class of products well ahead of our original end-of-the-decade
timetable.' In the defence sector revenues were Dollars 2bn, an increase of
almost 3 per cent.
TI has been taking aggressive steps to adapt to a smaller defence market, Mr
Junkins said. However, the sector grew in 1992 when the company received
more than Dollars 500m in orders for equipment to replace systems used in
the Iraq war. In the company's information technology sector, software
revenues grew rapidly last year.
TI said that it would increase capital expenditures to Dollars 625m from
Dollars 429m in 1992 as it was anticipating strong growth in the world
semiconductor market this year. Research and development spending would be
increased.

FT  23 JAN 93 / British Airways: Business code explains honesty 'is not just
telling truth'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the text of BA's code of business conduct:
THE success of BA is dependent on the quality of the decisions and the
behaviour of individuals at all levels throughout the organisation. The code
has been developed to provide guidance and assistance to both managers and
staff in their dealings with all those with whom we do business, with our
customers and suppliers, and with each other.
Adherence to the principles will help ensure that our reputation and success
that has been built up over the years through the dedicated hard work of you
and your colleagues will continue to grow. Judgment and discretion will need
to be exercised in applying the principles where, at first sight, they
appear to be at variance with local custom and practice or commercial common
sense. It is not the intent of the code to anticipate and provide a
framework of governing values and advice on how to proceed when making
difficult decisions, namely to establish the norms of business behaviour
throughout BA.
General standards:
Compliance: Comply with all the laws that regulate and apply to the company,
its systems and the conduct of its business.
Fairness: Treat all groups and individuals with whom we have a business
relationship in a fair, open and respectful manner.
Integrity: Show respect for the individual, treating each in a consistent
way and honouring commitments made.
Openness: Share and declare information on personal and corporate conflicts
of interest (political, financial, relationship) including the offer or
acceptance of gifts or hospitality of significant value. Seek guidance and
where appropriate confirmation from a higher authority before acting.
Honesty: This goes beyond simply telling the truth to ensuring that any
misrepresentation is quickly corrected. Do not allow people to be misled.
Where there are valid reasons for withholding information, be clear about
the motives and if possible explain why are doing so.
Fair competition: Ensure comparisons drawn with competitors and working
partners are based on fact and avoid innuendo. Competition should be based
on the quality value and integrity of British Airways' service and products.
Determination: Demonstrate a sense of purpose and commitment to achieving
the optimum outcome even in adversity.
Responsiveness: Recognise changes in the business environment and use a
creative flexible style to respond to them.
Enablement: Provide sufficient guidance to enable individuals to act upon
their own initiative to solve problems and grow in their role.
Conformity: Promote corporate values and competitive edge through the
established performance systems of performance and appraisal.
Through employing these practices and behaviours, staff should:
Use British Airways' stated goals and objectives as guidance, using your
values and judgment to interpret against the principles of this code. Treat
others as you would like to be treated.
Be prepared to solicit views as to whether something would be appropriate
before action, rather than after.
Discuss difficult decisions with those whose values and judgment you
respect. Use company process to earn respect.
Ask whether you would feel comfortable explaining your decision or behaviour
to your boss, your family or the media.
Be prepared to challenge if you believe others are acting in an unethical
way. Create the climate and opportunities for people to voice genuinely held
concerns about behaviour or decisions that they perceive to be
unprofessional or inappropriate.
Do not tolerate any form of retribution against those who do speak up.
Protect individuals' careers and anonymity if necessary. Encourage an
environment of learning from mistakes and mutual trust in each others'
motives and judgments.
Treat the assets and property of British Airways and its customers and its
suppliers with the same respect as you would your own. Apart from tangible
assets this would include company information as well as the name, image and
reputation of British Airways.

FT  23 JAN 93 / British Airways: Branson to meet Marshall next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Colin Marshall, British Airways' chief executive and deputy chairman,
will meet Mr Richard Branson, head of Virgin Atlantic, next week in a final
attempt to end the conflict triggered by BA's 'dirty tricks' campaign.
The meeting is expected to take place as early as Monday, amid growing
indications that both sides are anxious to improve relations which have
continued strained, in spite of BA's two public apologies and a Pounds
610,000 libel settlement.
Virgin indicated last night that it wanted the issue resolved by the middle
of next week, although it still threatens further legal action against BA in
the US courts.
BA is also keen to settle the damaging affair without further delay, but it
is uncertain about the scale of Virgin's likely demands.
Mr Branson is expected to insist on cash compensation for lost revenue
arising out of its rival's campaign, as well as a legally binding agreement
preventing any future abuse of Virgin's computer reservation information.
Virgin also wants access again to BA's maintenance facilities for its
aircraft. This access was withdrawn five years ago.
Sir Colin emphasised this week he was anxious to establish better relations
with Virgin, while Mr Branson has indicated he wants to avoid taking further
legal action.
Although BA's executive management is continuing its investigation into its
marketing, public affairs and legal departments in the aftermath of the
'dirty tricks' campaign, no sackings or resignations have so far emerged.
Shareholders are concerned that if BA fails to react forcefully and
publicly, it could be vulnerable to adverse commercial circumstances.

FT  23 JAN 93 / British Airways: BA staff 'advised' to read Lord King's
statement on system
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WHEN British Airways staff at Heathrow airport switched on their computers
yesterday, they were greeted with the next twist in the British Airways
affair - Lord King's latest statement had been placed on the system and
staff were 'advised' to read it, Gillian Tett writes.
In spite of the official apology, desk staff in Heathrow remained defiant,
insisting that BA was not alone in its aggressive marketing campaigns.
'It's not just us that have done this sort of thing. Other airlines do it
too,' said Ms Karen Granahan, a BA customer service duty manager, citing two
other carriers which she claimed had previously tried to poach BA customers
at the airport - a claim echoed by other airline staff throughout the
terminal.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Week in the Markets: Price gloom greets coffee talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATORS FROM coffee producing countries gathering in London for a
two-week meeting beginning next Monday with their consumer counterparts were
given a timely reminder over the past few days of the price of failure in
their efforts to secure a price supporting International Coffee Agreement.
As New York investment funds resumed the heavy selling that had pulled
prices back sharply from recent 12-month highs London robusta futures fell
more more than Dollars 100 a tonne and New York arabica's by more than five
cents a lb. London's March position, which three weeks ago stood at Dollars
1,023 a tonne, touched a three-month low of Dollars 867 a tonne yesterday
before rallying to Dollars 902 a tonne, down Dollars 73 on the week.
Coffee traders appeared to take little notice of the producers' professions
of confidence ahead of the ICA talks, in which they hope for significant
progress towards the agreement of supply management measures to be included
in a new pact when the present one expires at the end of September. 'There
is a lot of determination on our part to get this agreement at least made
viable by the end of March,' said Mr Marques Porto, head of the Brazilian
delegation, as he outlined the biggest producer's position in informal talks
with other leading producers on Thursday. 'We are prepared to bridge the gap
with consumers on some very key issues,' said another member of the
Brazilian delegation, Mr Valdemar Carneiro Leao.
Among these issues is the consumers' call for 'automaticity' - the rolling
over of individual countries' export quotas (which would be subject to
periodic adjustment in response to price movements) at the same level from
the end of one coffee year to the beginning of the next. Brazil is now
prepared to accept this system, but would want it to come into operation
only at the end of the second year of a new pact, with that year's quotas
being determined at an International Coffee Organisation council meeting at
the conclusion of the first year. 'It is much too risky to say that the
system will work perfectly from the start, which is why we want a council at
the end of the first year,' Mr Porto explained.
Brazil says it is also prepared to consider consumer demands for stock
verification by the ICO in exporting countries, but in return it wants
consumer commitments on imports from non-member producing countries and
re-exports from non-member consuming members.
The other crucial issue is 'selectivity' - allowing consumers the determine
the amounts allotted to different types of coffee within the overall quotas.
Brazil and Colombia, the second biggest producer, are reported to have
reached a common stance on this, but no details have been revealed.
Although coffee traders will clearly be watching the negotiations closely
over the coming fortnight they see little prospect of them giving prices a
significant boost. 'It will be interesting to see if they can maintain minor
progress but it won't really affect the market,' one London dealer told the
Reuter news agency. 'Agreements take a long time to implement.'
The most significant price movement at the London Metal Exchange this week
was three months lead's dip to an 11-month low of Pounds 286 a tonne on
Thursday, in spite of sterling's weakness against the US dollar. The price
steadied to Pounds 288.75 at yesterday's close, but that was still Pounds 5
down on the week. The downtrend was fuelled by the publication on Thursday
of a report by the International Lead and Zinc Study Group showing that
exports of the metal from the former eastern bloc had nearly tripled last
year from 49,000 tonnes in 1991 to 120,000 tonnes. That pushed the western
world into a supply surplus of 85,000 tonnes, compared with a deficit of
6,000 tonnes in 1991.
'This news is far worse than even pessimistic observers had forecast,'
commented Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking
group. He said he had cut his forecast of the 1993 average lead price as a
result by 11 per cent from the 24 US cents a lb he predicted at the end of
last year.
The study group painted a similarly gloomy picture of the zinc supply/demand
balance. It said former eastern bloc exports had more than doubled in 1992,
causing the western world surplus to rise from 86,000 to 238,000 tonnes. Mr
Moore cut his forecast for this year's average zinc price by 10 per cent to
54 cents as a result.
Aluminium prices remained weak as LME stocks continued to build up and
copper was down in dollar terms, although the pound's fall meant that it
showed a small sterling rise.
The strongest LME market was tin, which was pushed steadily higher by
technically-inspired buying until it ran into overhead resistance on
Thursday. The three months price fell back Dollars 72.50 yesterday to
Dollars 5,992.50 a tonne, up Dollars 87.50 on the week.
Concern about the Middle Eastern situation helped the gold price to rise
early in the week, but with fears of further central bank sales continuing
to weigh on market sentiment it failed to break through resistance above
Dollars 330 a troy ounce. Yesterday the price fell back 80 cents to end
Dollars 1.40 up on the week at Dollars 329,25 an ounce.
Platinum staged a substantial technical rally before running into
profit-taking yesterday. The price was fixed in the afternoon at Dollars
360.50 an ounce, down Dollars 4.40 on the day but Dollars 4.10 up on the
week.

FT  23 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Control Securities sells 26% of Stylo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROL Securities, the brewing, hotels and property company which has been
involved in prolonged refinancing talks, yesterday announced the sale of its
26 per cent stake in Stylo, the Bradford-based shoe retailer, for Pounds
4.5m.
The company refused to identify the purchaser. However, traders said the
shares had been purchased by institutions at 90p each.
Control acquired 24.6 per cent of Stylo in 1988 for Pounds 16.2m, valuing
the shares at 325p. The purchase ended the shoe company's three-year battle
to fend off a hostile bid from property group British Land.
Yesterday's sale marks the beginning of Control's 'orderly disposal
programme' as cited by chairman Mr Sydney Robin in a letter to shareholders
earlier this month. The programme forms part of the business plan required
for a successful conclusion to refinancing talks begun in June. The group's
shares have been suspended at 16 1/2 p for 15 months.
The company said yesterday it would use the proceeds to pay off some of its
Pounds 259m debt.
Since 1988, the investment had been written down to a value of Pounds 4.7m.
Gross dividends received from the stake amounted to Pounds 591,198. Dividend
payments of Pounds 166,166 received in October 1992 would be included in the
year to March 31, the company said.
Control Securities recently reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 196.2m,
against a deficit of Pounds 3.3m last time.

<TEXT>
FIRST MARYLAND Bancorp, the US subsidiary of Allied Irish Bank, yesterday
announced a 23 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Dollars 75.1m to
Dollars 92.5m (Pounds 60.8m) after a 0.8 per cent rise in fourth quarter
earnings to Dollars 24.1m (Dollars 23.9m), writes John Gapper.
The bank said its earnings performance reflected improved net interest
margins, higher levels of non-interest income and lower provisions for
possible credit losses.
The bank's return on average assets for the fourth quarter fell slightly to
1.04 per cent (1.23 per cent) and its return on average equity fell to 13.95
per cent (16.11 per cent).
Shareholders' funds rose to Dollars 699.4m (Dollars 606.8m). The overall
capital ratio is 14 per cent, with Tier 1 capital of 10 per cent.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wescol Group, the USM-quoted structural engineer, fell deeper into the red
in the year to July 31 as pre-tax losses rose 60 per cent to Pounds 2.49m
(Pounds 1.55m).
Turnover dipped from Pounds 24.7m to Pounds 16.3m reflecting difficult
conditions and the group's closure of TMV Aluminium Systemsy.
Losses included an exceptional debit of Pounds 506,000. Per share the
deficit was shown as 21.6p against 11.3p, and there is no dividend.
Mr Peter Price was appointed chairman yesterday, taking over from caretaker
chairman Mr Barry Anysz who replaced Mr John Hicks when he resigned last
May.
Mr Price said the group had strengthened its trading base, by 'refocusing
operations, reducing overheads and securing fresh backing from our bankers'.
Facilities included a new six-year Pounds 2m loan.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Barings, the privately-controlled UK merchant banking group yesterday pulled
out of trading on the floor of the London International Financial Futures
and Options Exchange (Liffe), continuing the retrenchment of its operations.
Although Barings will remain a member of Liffe, enabling it to clear futures
transactions in its own name and on behalf of its clients, it has decided to
stop executing trades on the floor of the exchange in order to cut costs.
Barings has made 19 traders and desk staff redundant. In future it will
place orders through other brokers on the floor of the exchange.
In September, Barings announced the decision to shed 108 employees at its
securities trading subsidiary, Baring Securities.

<TEXT>
Park Food, which sells Christmas hampers through freelance agents, has
reported a lower than expected interim loss, incurring Pounds 3.69m pre-tax
for the six months ended September 30 1992.
Mr Peter Johnson, the chairman, was confident, however, that full-year
pre-tax profits would show a significant improvement over the Pounds 6.89m
of 1991-92, after a half-time deficit of Pounds 4.39m.
Analysts are forecasting between Pounds 8m and Pounds 9.2m, increasing to
between Pounds 9m and Pounds 11m in 1993-94.
The annual dividend cover of 2.5 times was felt to be excessive and the
interim dividend is doubled to 2p.
Sales of continuing businesses came to Pounds 9.1m (Pounds 8.95m), after
disposal of the drinks and frozen foods divisions which made Pounds 6.75m
last time.

FT  23 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Brent Walker chief resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KEN SCOBIE, chief executive of Brent Walker, the heavily indebted
property and leisure group, and its banks, appear to have fallen out. Mr
Scobie resigned yesterday. He is understood to have agreed a compensation
package.
Brent Walker is now expected to appoint a new chief executive to replace Mr
Scobie.
Sir Keith Bright has been brought in to chair the group, which last March
completed a Pounds 1.6bn refinancing. Lord Kindersley, the previous
chairman, left after last year's annual meeting and the group has been
looking for a new head since. Mr Scobie has been acting as chairman.
Mr Alan Clements, a non-executive director, has also resigned from the
group. He indicated last summer that he wanted to leave.
As well as their loans to Brent Walker, the banks own 54 per cent of the
group's shares following the refinancing. One banker said, 'the banks call
all the shots'. Another said there was a fairly widespread opinion among the
banks that Mr Scobie was not the right man for the job, once the
restructuring was in place.
Mr Scobie originally joined the group as a non-executive director in May
1991, but became chief executive soon after. He is thought to have been keen
to take on the chairmanship, while the banks wanted that role to be kept
separate from the chief executiveship.
Mr George Walker, the former head of Brent Walker, had combined the two
until the banks brought in Lord Kindersley.
Under the refinancing agreement, Brent Walker was to have made disposals to
cut debt. However, there appears to have been concern among the banks at the
rate of progress the group was making.
Brent Walker said yesterday 'the restructuring of Brent Walker has reached a
stage where Mr Scobie feels that his particular expertise is no longer
required.'
Brent Walker shares, which had been in the doldrums, have risen in recent
days and yesterday closed up 3p at 16p.
Sir Keith, 61, is also chairman of Electrocomponents.

FT  23 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Capital to pay Pounds 18m for Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL, Britain's largest independent radio group, yesterday announced a
major expansion into regional broadcasting with a Pounds 17.7m agreed
takeover of Midlands Radio, writes Tim Burt.
Midlands, which operates BRMB in Birmingham and six smaller stations, said
Capital had made a cash offer of 130p per share which had been accepted by
shareholders holding 51.7 per cent.
As an alternative, Midlands' shareholders can take shares in Capital on the
basis of one new share for 181p cash.
The takeover will give Capital its first wholly-owned station outside
London, although it already has stakes in several other radio companies.
Mr John Parkinson, who will remain Midlands' chairman and is expected to
become a non-executive director of Capital, said the company would flourish
as part of the new group.
Both companies have seen a sharp increase in their share price since
takeover discussions began last November. Capital's interest prompted a jump
of almost 15 per cent in Midlands' share price, which peaked at 119p before
being suspended yesterday at 112p.
Since announcing its results in November, Capital's shares have rose from
132p, peaking at 183p earlier this month, to close at 178p yesterday.
Midlands announced an Pounds 8,000 fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 679,000
in the year to September 30 1992, while Capital's pre-tax profits declined 9
per cent, from Pounds 9.48m to Pounds 8.84m, in the same period.

FT  23 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Concert party fires speculation - Andrew
Taylor on possible new ownership at Watts Blake Bearne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 280-YEAR-old Devon business, a world leader in its field, looks set to
lose its independence, and there appears little that the directors or
majority of shareholders will be able to do to influence the outcome or
price at which it is sold.
Watts Blake Bearne has been digging ball clay out of the Bovey Basin near
Newton Abbot since 1710. The heavy sticky clay, which once produced tobacco
pipes, is used worldwide to manufacture ceramics such as sanitary ware, wall
and floor tiles and table ware.
The ownership of the company has been thrown into question by the decision
of three shareholders to sell their combined stake of 45.2 per cent.
The companies, which are acting as a concert party, say that, under takeover
rules, the sale 'is likely to lead to an offer for the entire issued share
capital of the company.'
The three are Ceramics Holdings, controlled by the Lebanese Gargour family,
Sibelco, a privately-owned Belgian-based producer of silica sand for the
glass industry, and Quarzwerke, a private German producer of silica sand.
Mr John Pike, Watts Blake Bearne managing director, said: 'The three
companies are acting within their rights. They announced a concert party
agreement to pursue common interests in 1991 which allows them to sell their
combined holdings in this way.'
'It is tough, however, for other shareholders, many of which have said they
wish us to remain independent. It will be very difficult to mount a defence
if, as seems likely, the sale of such a large block of shares triggers a bid
at an unsatisfactory price.'
The company can only hope that the minimum price, which has not been
disclosed, is not met; an acceptable white knight can be found to buy the
stake; or that the shareholding can be placed with a number of investors
rather than sold to a single purchaser.
A placing, however, would be unlikely to raise as much cash as a sale to a
single buyer which might be prepared to pay a premium to provide a
spring-board for a take-over.
Sibelco and Quarzwerke could themselves bid for the company. They have a
pre-emption right, should a recommended purchaser offer less than 433p a
share, to buy Ceramics' shares at the same price.
At 433p the business would be valued at just Pounds 90m compared with
shareholders funds currently of about Pounds 50m or 240p a share. Watts
Blake Bearne's share price closed last night at 443p.
Mr Ian Hilliker, analyst at NatWest Securities, said a bidder could afford
to pay up to 530p a share or Pounds 110m without earnings dilution based on
forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.2m this year.
'This is a high quality company which absolutely dominates its niche
market', he said.
Watts Blake Bearne, which generates 85 per cent of its sales outside the UK,
estimates that it provides clay for 40 per cent of the European sanitary
ware market, a third of the US market and half of the Far East market. It
also claims to supply a quarter of the European and US floor tile market.
It owns extensive clay reserves in Germany and in the US where in 1989 it
bought United Clays the country's second biggest ball clay prod-ucer.
Profits, which had grown steadily since the family-owned business was
floated in 1964, have faltered recently due to the recession in the
construction industry. The group estimates that two-thirds of sales are
triggered by new building, repair, maintenance or improvement work.
The loss of an important customer in the US (since replaced), compounded
problems and pre-tax profits slipped to Pounds 5.67m in 1991 compared with a
peak of Pounds 8.47m in 1989.
NatWest expects profits to have bounced back to Pounds 6.8m last year helped
by recent acquisitions and a recovery in the US business.
The company should benefit from a recovery in the US and UK construction
industries, particularly housebuilding, although the continental European
ceramics market is likely to fall further. It seems probable, however, that
new owners will reap the benefits from any revival.

FT  23 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Control Securities sells 26% of Stylo as
part of 'orderly disposal' plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROL Securities, the brewing, hotels and property company which has been
involved in prolonged refinancing talks, yesterday announced the sale of its
26 per cent stake in Stylo, the Bradford-based shoe retailer, for Pounds
4.5m.
The company refused to identify the purchaser. However, traders said the
shares had been purchased by institutions at 90p each.
Control acquired 24.6 per cent of Stylo in 1988 for Pounds 16.2m, valuing
the shares at 325p. The purchase ended the shoe company's three-year battle
to fend off a hostile bid from property group British Land.
Yesterday's sale marks the beginning of Control's 'orderly disposal
programme' as cited by chairman Mr Sydney Robin in a letter to shareholders
earlier this month. The programme forms part of the business plan required
for a successful conclusion to refinancing talks begun in June. The group's
shares have been suspended at 16 1/2 p for 15 months.
The company said yesterday it would use the proceeds to pay off some of its
Pounds 259m debt.
Since 1988, the investment had been written down to a value of Pounds 4.7m.
Gross dividends received from the stake amounted to Pounds 591,198. Dividend
payments of Pounds 166,166 received in October 1992 would be included in the
year to March 31, the company said.
Control Securities recently reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 196.2m,
against a deficit of Pounds 3.3m last time.

Martin Shelton, the USM-quoted business calendars, diaries and gifts
specialist, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 144,000 from turnover of
Pounds 1.68m for the six months to end-September.
That compares with a deficit of Pounds 122,000 on sales of Pounds 1.63m for
the comparable period and with a profit of Pounds 302,000 from turnover of
Pounds 4.85m for the year to end March 1992. Losses per share came out at
1.88p (1.58p) and the interim dividend is held at 0.75p.
Mr Paul Martin, chairman, said that late ordering by customers was shifting

Stavert Zigomala, the close company which holds quoted investments and sells
furniture, upholstery and carpets, lifted pre-tax profits by 64 per cent in
the half year ended September 30.
On turnover ahead to Pounds 452,453 (Pounds 384,347) the pre-tax result
amounted to Pounds 38,813, against Pounds 23,623. Mr Edward Cooper,
chairman, said that on increased turnover the trading company produced a
much smaller loss than last time, but movement in stock remained
disappointing. In addition, investment income was lower and he did not
expect the shortfall to be made good by the year end.
Earnings per share amounted to 9.841p (5.978p).

FT  23 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Rights and sale plan from Stakis next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STAKIS, the hotels, nursing home and casino group, is expected to announce
both a rights issue and the sale of its nursing home division when it
presents its results next Thursday.
The company, where Sir Lewis Robertson took over as rescue chairman in early
1991, is believed to have returned to around break-even before tax in the
year to September 30 1992 against a loss of Pounds 47.4m.
However, it still has about Pounds 200m of debt owed to 21 banks. A plan to
sell its casinos had to be abandoned when Stakis failed to achieve a
suitable price.
Stakis has rationalised the management of its hotel operations and sold
peripheral leisure activities under Mr David Michels, its chief executive.
However, it still needs to reduce debt. Ashbourne Homes, its nursing home
subsidiary, operates 18 nursing homes profitably, but also has 19 sites for
new homes which would cost about Pounds 50m to develop.
Stakis should be able to reveal an agreement to sell Ashbourne Homes next
week.
The company is also expected to announce a rights issue under which
shareholders would be offered one new share for either three or four
existing shares. Stakis's market capitalisation is about Pounds 105m so the
rights issue could raise up to Pounds 35m.

FT  23 JAN 93 / UK Company News: GPA restructure sees debt halving in 3
years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA's debt restructuring proposals, which were sent to its 130 banks
yesterday, envisage that its Dollars 5.5bn (Pounds 3.6bn) debt will be cut
by half over the next three years.
The ambitious target is dependent on the Irish aircraft leasing company
regaining access to capital markets, so that it can raise off-balance sheet
finance to replace bank debt and unsecured traded debt.
It has already instructed Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, to lead
manage an issue of securitised aircraft leases, called Alps.
Mr Maurice Foley, GPA's deputy chairman, said he hoped the Alps issue would
take place 'well before end of the year'. However, bankers believe the Alps
issue will be impossible until investors are confident that GPA can overcome
its financial difficulties and that will take many months.
In addition, GPA is planning to raise about Dollars 200m of equity through a
rights issue of convertible securities. The rights document will be sent to
shareholders when banks agree to the proposed debt rescheduling.
The detailed documents sent to banks yesterday, which are an inch thick in
total, also said that GPA's commitments to buy aircraft from manufacturers
has been reduced from Dollars 12bn at the beginning of last year to less
than Dollars 4bn.
More importantly, the group believes that it has cut orders for airplanes in
1993 and 1994 from Dollars 5bn to about Dollars 2.5bn.
However, a banker stressed that the group had only reached agreement in
principle with manufacturers to cancel or change the contracts. They were
not legally binding.
The banker added that the group had yet to reach any sort of agreement with
one manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas, though agreements have been reached
with Boeing, Fokker and Airbus Industrie. Mr Foley said the failure to reach
agreement with McDonnell was not serious.
The deadline for reaching agreement with banks has now slipped from
mid-January to the end of February or early March. One banker said the
restructuring process was among the most complicated in which he had ever
been involved.
The banks are being asked to defer to late 1996 approximately Dollars 1bn of
debt repayments due between the end of last year and September 30.
GPA has Dollars 3.5bn of bank debt on its balance sheet plus another Dollars
500m off, some of it in joint ventures which have to be unscrambled.
This debt is divided into more than 20 different facilities, provided by 130
banks. A group of regional Japanese banks, which are said to shocked by
GPA's difficulties, provided a 'club loan' of Dollars 150m, all of which was
due for repayment in a year.
In addition about Dollars 2bn has been borrowed in the form of unsecured
traded debt, of which Dollars 500m is in the form of publicly traded, fully
registered bonds. In the next three years Dollars 1.25bn of this falls due
for repayment.

FT  23 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Glaxo's Zantac to go OTC in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLAXO, Europe's largest pharmaceuticals group, is planning to switch Zantac,
its best-selling drug, from prescription to over-the-counter status in
Japan, the world's second largest market after the US.
Nippon Glaxo, of which Glaxo holds 50 per cent, the balance being privately
held, has signed an agreement with Sankyo and Taisho Pharmaceuticals of
Japan, to co-develop Zantac, the world's best-selling drug.
It is expected to file an application for over-the-counter sales at the end
of 1994, about the same time as its main competitors, Yamanouchi which
markets Samotidine, and SmithKline Beecham which sells Tagamet.
Zantac generated prescription sales of about Pounds 180m in Japan during the
last financial year to June, according to analysts.
The Japanese over-the-counter gastro-intestinal market is worth about Y57bn
(Pounds 300m) a year. Taisho is the market leader with Sankyo third.
The Japanese welfare ministry appears increasingly keen to move drugs from
prescription to over-the-counter status, in an effort to keep down state
drug expenditure.
The move is part of Glaxo's general strategy of licensing out development
and eventually marketing, according to Mr Nigel Barnes, pharmaceuticals
analyst at Hoare Govett.

FT  23 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Wescol losses increase 60% to Pounds 2.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wescol Group, the USM-quoted structural engineer, fell deeper into the red
in the year to July 31 as pre-tax losses rose 60 per cent to Pounds 2.49m
(Pounds 1.55m).
Turnover dipped from Pounds 24.7m to Pounds 16.3m reflecting the difficult
conditions in the construction industry and the group's closure, last May,
of TMV Aluminium Systems, its curtain walling subsid-iary.
Its sheeting and cladding business was closed in 1991.
Wescol made a Pounds 506,000 exceptional provision for the closure of TMV
while interest charges increased from Pounds 419,000 to Pounds 476,000.
Losses per share were shown as 21.6p against 11.3p, and there is no
dividend.
Mr Peter Price was appointed chairman yesterday, taking over from caretaker
chairman Mr Barry Anysz who replaced Mr John Hicks when he resigned last
May.
Mr Price said the group had strengthened its trading base, by 'refocusing
operations, reducing overheads and securing fresh backing from our bankers'.
He explained that facilities included a new six-year Pounds 2m loan.

FT  23 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Margins boost First Maryland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST MARYLAND Bancorp, the US subsidiary of Allied Irish Bank, yesterday
announced a 23 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Dollars 75.1m to
Dollars 92.5m (Pounds 60.8m) after a 0.8 per cent rise in fourth quarter
earnings to Dollars 24.1m (Dollars 23.9m), writes John Gapper.
The bank said its earnings performance reflected improved net interest
margins, higher levels of non-interest income, lower provisions for possible
credit losses and careful management of non-interest expenses.
The bank's return on average assets for the fourth quarter fell slightly to
1.04 per cent (1.23 per cent) and its return on average equity fell to 13.95
per cent (16.11 per cent).
Mr Brian King, FMB senior vice president, said the low rise in fourth
quarter earnings reflected the fact that the bank's loan portfolio had
fallen by 8.5 per cent over the year to Dollars 4.97bn from Dollars 5.43bn
because of sluggish demand.
Shareholders' funds rose to Dollars 699.4m (Dollars 606.8m). The bank's
overall capital ratio is 14 per cent, with Tier 1 capital of 10 per cent.

FT  23 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Park Foods reduces loss to Pounds 3.69m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Park Food, which sells Christmas hampers through freelance agents, has
reported a lower than expected interim loss, incurring Pounds 3.69m pre-tax
for the six months ended September 30 1992.
Mr Peter Johnson, the chairman, was confident, however, that full-year
pre-tax profits would show a significant improvement over the Pounds 6.89m
of 1991-92, after a half-time deficit of Pounds 4.39m.
Analysts are forecasting between Pounds 8m and Pounds 9.2m, increasing to
between Pounds 9m and Pounds 11m in 1993-94.
The annual dividend cover of 2.5 times was now felt to be excessive; it
would be reduced to two times and therefore, the interim dividend is doubled
to 2p.
Sales for the half year of continuing businesses came to Pounds 9.1m (Pounds
8.95m), after the disposal of the drinks and frozen foods divisions which
made Pounds 6.75m last time. Mr Johnson anticipated continued strong organic
growth stemming from the enlarged network of agents (up by some 6 per cent)
and an increased average spend by customers of about 10 per cent.

FT  23 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Barings exits from Liffe floor trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BARINGS, the privately-controlled UK merchant banking group yesterday pulled
out of trading on the floor of the London International Financial Futures
and Options Exchange (Liffe), continuing the retrenchment of its operations.
Although Barings will remain a member of Liffe, enabling it to clear futures
transactions in its own name and on behalf of its clients, it has decided to
stop executing trades on the floor of the exchange in order to cut costs.
Barings has made 19 traders and desk staff redundant, saying that in future
it will place orders through other brokers on the floor of the exchange.
'This will mean a significant cost saving for us,' said a director at
Barings yesterday.
In September, Barings announced the decision to shed 108 employees at its
securities trading subsidiary, Baring Securities, in order to stem heavy
losses.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Kitchen scales tip to France: Nicholas Lander travels to
Paris for the Prix Culinaire, one of the world's top cookery contests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jeremy Cooper had envisaged spending Christmas plucking turkeys in his
father's butcher shop in Huddersfield, Yorkshire. Instead, he flew to Paris
to represent Britain in the 26th Prix Culinaire Pierre Taittinger, one of
the world's most prestigious culinary contests.
At age 24, Cooper, is chef saucier, head of the meat section, at London's
Inter-Continental Hotel. For four years he worked at Claridge's under
executive chef, Marjan Lesnik, who won the Prix Taittinger in 1981 but was
disqualified because of an unauthorised use of parsley leaves as garnish.
This year he is one of the 16 international judges.
The Prix Taittinger is the culinary world's equivalent of the Tschaikovsky
Piano Competition in Moscow. Although there are similar competitions held
around the world, this one attracts the most international interest, with
almost 500 entrants this year from America, Germany, Spain, Italy, Belgium,
Holland, Britain, Japan, Switzerland, and of course, France. It also offers
a rare insight into the highly conservative world of French gastronomy.
Most of those fortunate enough to eat both in and outside France would agree
that France's long-held domination of the culinary world is seriously under
threat. Today, talented and inspired chefs are to be found all over the
world.
French chefs, however, have dominated the competition. Indeed the Prix
Taittinger has only been won twice by chefs from outside France - in 1984 by
a Japanese and in 1986 by an Indonesian working at the Hilton, Amsterdam.
A strong flavour of French culinary conservatism was evident in the British
semi-finals when the eight contestants had to prepare a classic 19th century
dish, quenelles of pike with a sauce amoricaine. This dish was well known
when rivers were flush with pike and lobsters for the sauce were cheap (the
sauce was created in 1860); but today it rarely appears on menus. That may
have been one reason that the British favourite, Bruno Loubet, a highly
innovative chef from the Inn on the Park, finished behind Jeremy Cooper.
Cooper arrived in Paris with three words - gibier a poil (furred game)  -
ringing in his ears. Two weeks earlier this, and nothing else, had been
divulged as the subject of the four-hour finals.
At 7.30pm on the night before the cook-offs the 12 contestants, of whom
three were French, and 16 members of the jury met for cocktails. At the
party, the chairman of the judges produced four envelopes and asked Cooper,
as the youngest, to pick one. To his and his competitors' consternation he
chose the envelope marked 'hare' (the other three were rabbit, wild boar and
venison). All the chefs were concerned because hare is a particularly
difficult animal to cook well even if time is unlimited. Unlike other game,
hare is not hung but requires marinating to soften the flavours; the chefs
had to skin the animal, too. The most anxious was Japan's Minoru Sonehara
who had never seen a hare before.
Over dinner the chefs were given a list of rather prosaic ingredients:
carrots, red cabbage and cauliflower - nothing as exotic as a wild mushroom
or a small truffle. At 11pm it was up to bed where, with their telephones
unplugged, the chefs spent the night racking their brains for inspiration
and sleep.
The next morning, they took a short coach trip to the nearby Ecole
Superieure de Cuisine Francaise, where the cooking would take place. The
chefs then drew numbers for the sequence in which they would cook and at
7.20 met their commis chefs, their short-term personal assistants. The
commis were students who spoke little English, another big advantage for the
French competitors.
The competition began at 7.30, which seemed designed to benefit the judges
rather than the chefs. To enable them to taste in sequence each chef started
to cook at 15 minute intervals and the poor Dutch entrant, who drew number
12, had to sit glumly until 10.15 before he could get to his stove.
Two top professional chefs and two professors of the culinary arts
supervised the cooking. In theory, they could deduct points but rather than
being quick to criticise they were inclined to help and encourage.
The tasting judges each had a maximum of 50 points in two categories -
presentation and taste. From 11.30, and at 15 minute intervals, they were
presented with a silver tray, borne by student waiters and waitresses sworn
to silence, and placed in the middle of the room for the judges to
appreciate its design. The tray was then passed to the foreman of the jury
who cut two slices of meat per judge and placed the two garnishes and sauce
alongside. Finally, 16 mouths began to open and close.
Inside the kitchen the international character of the contest was obvious.
The Spanish chef made a tortilla to enclose his garnish while the extremely
calm German produced very classy potato cakes and cabbage dumplings. The
Italian, despite a bandaged finger, made ravioli of hare mousse wrapped in
cabbage while the Japanese opened a box of wonderful high-tech knives,
suitable for sushi, and cooked with chopsticks, too. The Dutch chef made a
hare sausage and enthralled the French judges with a Japanese machine for
making 'vegetable spaghetti'.
But all this was in vain because of the anachronistic finale to the
competition. This stipulated that the chefs' creations must be presented on
a huge silver tray, an accessory no longer used in good restaurants. Today,
chefs prefer to serve their dishes on a plate designed by themselves.
The winning dish certainly filled the tray. Entitled 'saddle of hare
Pojarski' and based on a recipe that was a great favourite with Tsar
Nicholas I, it resembled a chess board with pyramid tops of cabbage and
'castles' made of red cabbage filled with a hare mousse. It was too pretty -
food to admire, not to eat.
But it impressed the judges. And on a podium filled with some of France's
top culinary luminaries (Pierre Troisgros, Emile Jung, Michel GueArard and
Jacques Lameloise) Joel Robuchon, president of the jury, announced the
winner - France's Michel Izard, who recently became chef des cuisines at the
Dodin Bouffant restaurant in Paris. His compatriot, Eric Briffard, was
second, and Spain's Jose Arriero Barroso, third.
The experience of being in such company will have done a modest, talented
young Yorkshireman nothing but good. Whether French gastronomy will ever
benefit from such international gatherings is, however, another matter.
